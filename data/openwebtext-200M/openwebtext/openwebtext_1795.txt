1981 : Mystery disease kills homosexuals
A mysterious epidemic , which has been discovered in homosexual men , is causing increasing concern in the United States .
The unknown condition , which consists of two separate diseases - a form of pneumonia and skin cancer , has been found in 180 patients in 15 states since last July .
It has claimed around 75 lives so far in the US and up to 92 % of the victims are homosexual men .
One death has been reported from the virus in London .
Although doctors have identified what appears to be a new disease , they have yet to devise a cure .
The epidemic is being investigated by the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta .
The specialist unit has already discovered the causes of two other diseases , the toxic shock syndrome and Legionnaires ' disease .
Dr James Curran , who is investigating the condition , said : " It is a very serious problem and it does not seem to be on the wane . "
Three studies in the New England Journal of Medicine show that the immune systems of victims are severely weakened , leaving them vulnerable to serious infections from germs which most people normally shrug off .
Homosexuals who have developed either of the two conditions have shown a low resistance to standard tests on their immune system .
Four victims also had rare skin ulcers normally caused by the herpes simplex virus .
Researchers claim that their findings are " part of a nationwide epidemic of immunodeficiency among male homosexuals " .
Doctors are unsure of the cause of the epidemic which is carried in semen and other body secretions .
A study at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) suggests that homosexuals may be repeatedly infected with the virus .
One case also involved an intravenous drug user which implies that the disease could be spread by sharing needles .

' It would really surprise you , ' said her mother , Laura .
' Some nights she has sheets with 100 times tables .
I do n't want it to become a chore because it will put her off .
I work full - time ; I do not want the time we spend together to be me and her battling about homework . '
Family tension is just one of a string of negative effects of homework for young children , according to an explosive new book which says much of it is pointless .
The book , The Homework Myth , to be published in Britain in the spring , also says too much if it turns children off education and does not make them do any better in tests .
The study , by American academic Alfie Kohn , has sparked a huge debate on TV and radio and in hundreds of newspapers .
Last week it reached the Wall Street Journal , where it was reported that some of America 's most competitive schools were cutting or eliminating work beyond their gates .
' What surprised me is not the downside of homework , but the fact there appears to be no upside , ' said Kohn .
' No study has ever shown an academic benefit to homework before high school . '
In the UK , it has emerged that a handful of primary school headteachers have started to drop traditional styles of homework in favour of ' fun ' activities and outings that parents and children can do together .
One London school has swapped sums and endless spelling for museum trips and cookery tasks .
Even that is too much for Kohn , who will spend his year giving dozens of lectures calling for parents to ' organise ' into groups and go into schools to demand changes .
' Kids should have the chance to relax after a full day at school , ' he said .
In Kohn 's eyes , primary schoolchildren should do no more than read for pleasure when they get home .
Soon his message will reach the UK , where the government made homework compulsory nine years ago , starting at one hour a week for five - year - olds .
It is likely to reject his arguments .
' Homework is an essential part of education , ' said a Department for Education and Skills official .
' A good , well - organised homework programme helps children and young people to develop the skills and attitudes they will need for successful , independent life - long learning . '
It is a view shared by many parents .
Andy Hibberd , co-founder of the support group the Parent Organisation , says his sons aged seven and nine benefit greatly from the work they bring home .
' When they go to secondary school , then further and higher education , they will have to do homework , ' said Hibberd , from Wingworth , near Chesterfield , Derbyshire .
' I think for primary school children to start bringing home a little bit of homework so they are prepared is a good thing .
It does not hurt younger children to do 10 minutes a day . '
However , a recent review by Susan Hallam , a professor at the Institute for Education in London , showed that setting the wrong type of work can be detrimental to pupils .
' It needs to be meaningful , ' said Hallam .
' If it is just being set as something schools feel they have to do with no real thought to its purpose , then it is a waste of time .
Homework , if taken to the extreme , can completely disrupt family life . '
Some headteachers are sceptical too .
' Many teachers have long suspected homework was n't beneficial for the children , ' said John Peck , head of Peafield Lane Primary School in Mansfield , Nottinghamshire .
' Sometimes it is done more for the parents who demand it .
It would be a brave school that decided to eliminate homework . '
At Coleridge primary school in north London , the head , Shirley Boffey , has replaced many aspects of traditional homework with ' home learning ' .
Sums , grammar and spelling have been reduced .
Instead worksheets filled with ideas about making models , trips to museums , cookery and art are sent home .
One sheet suggests that parents take their children to nearby Alexandra Palace to look through the telescope ; another asks them to make bread together ; while one focuses on learning about the local area .
' We did it for all the reasons that they are arguing in the US , ' said Boffey .
' We did n't feel homework was working , we wanted children to enjoy learning and not see it as a chore . '
Some parents love the new system ; others are yet to be convinced .
Vikki Poole , from Muswell Hill , has two daughters at the school , aged seven and 10 , and loves the new system .
Her girls took home ' very formulaic ' work from their last school .
Now the family gets together once a week to do the tasks and Poole loves the new system .
But for others , such as Ilana Wegrzyn , the new regime means extra stress .
' I have two boys , eight and 10 .
One may have to cook a curry and the other one bake bread .
Each topic can take an afternoon .
I work part - time , but with their music and sport it is a really pressure . '
Wegrzyn prefers more traditional homework , but she could not deny that her boys love the new work .

Video ads are the best form of advertising in today ’s digital era .
Are you a new business and want to establish trust and authority right away ?
Video ads are your go to option .
Videos have the power to connect with the people in a form like no other .
This is the reason we are seeing such an incredible growth in the number of video content creators .
This is a clear sign that video work the best .
Even the world ’s most renowned brands have started to see this trend .
Cold , undead relics from a past age haunt the corporate world , spreading fear and carnage wherever they go .
These monsters can look good , seductive even , but if you let them , they ’ll suck the life force out of you and leave you dead .
Or worse : One of them .
I call them vampire ideas and all they deserve is a stake through the heart .
Vampire ideas can be found in stock management philosophy , tired old leadership theories or business advice from an earlier era .
Wherever they come from , they ’re bad for you and they ’re bad for business .
Here ’s a table comparing vampire ideas to actual vampires :
Actual vampires Vampire ideas Can look really good Can look really good … but are actually disgusting and evil … but are actually disgusting and evil Are undead Should ’ve been dead a long time ago Suck people ’s blood Suck a company ’s energy and creativity
Are deterred by garlick and crosses
Are deterred by good leadership Ca n’t enter your house without an invitation Ca n’t enter your business without an invitation
Are really hard to kill Are really hard to kill Wither and burn in the light of day Wither and burn in the light of logical thinking Cast no shadow or mirror image
That ’s kinda where the analogy breaks down
So what are some commonly seen vampire ideas ?
Here are a few examples .
Fire the bottom 10 % of your employees every year
This is one of the most inhumane , cynical and just plain stupid ideas I ’ve ever heard about .
Who on earth still believes that this is a good way to do business and to get the best performance from employees .
This idea keeps employees constantly afraid , but if that ’s what you want , go for it .
The exact opposite view is described here and trust me , it works much better .
If you ca n’t measure it , you ca n’t manage it
Considering how many things in a business are unmeasured , not to say unmeasurable , this is one more bad idea in need of a final resting place .
I ’ve written about it previously here .
This idea of management - by - spreadsheet stifles new ideas and reduces a leaders focus to things that can be expressed in numbers .
Long work hours are good for business
No .
They ’re not .
In fact , laziness will take you much further .
Nice guys finish last
That ’s not true either .
In a networked world it ’s more important to be generous and likeable than to be ruthless and efficient .
I ’m sure there ’s more .
What vampire ideas do you know , that we should get rid of once and for all ?
Let ’s break out the wooden stakes and go vampire slaying together !

I started this topic thinking of it as the Culture War but quickly realized there have been many separate instances of what is essentially the same phenomenon .
So culture wars it is .
Many of these culture wars overlapped in time and so are not chronologically distinct .
The Rock ‘n Roll War
As far as my consciousness of the culture wars , I ’d say it goes back to the 50s .
I was only 6 or so but I remember vividly the ruckus created by the arrival of Elvis Presley on the American scene .
That was my first inkling that there was a conflict within our culture .
Elvis descended on American culture like a cataclysm .
The impact scar was a deep - running schism between those who feared and hated him for the loosening of social strictures he represented , and those who thought , " I do n’t know , what ’s so wrong , let the boy wiggle when he sings . "
Now this schism is a complicated thing , and I do n’t mean to oversimplify it except for the purposes of discussion .
What explains this natural schism between reaction against change and acceptance of it or openness to it is somewhat mysterious .
It could be as simple as right - brain / left - brain dominance , or it might be purely cultural maybe going all the way back to the Puritans .
The one thing that can be said with certainty is that such a natural schism exists and is , at least in part , what separates conservatives from liberals , or reactionaries from progressives if you prefer .
In 1950s Alabama , everyone had an opinion on Elvis .
You were ok with him ( maybe even liked him a little ) , or you hated him and declared that he would be the end of civilization .
Thank God we got the criminals , and America got the Puritans !
~ Australian folk saying
The Civil Rights War
Of course , unbeknownst to me , there were all sorts of conflicts going on in our culture .
The civil rights movement was brewing with all the bitter conflict inherent in that .
There were conflicts between the defenders of the status quo and social reformers , Labor and Capitol , civil libertarians and the law and order crowd , the peaceniks and the warmongers , the beatniks and the bankers .
There was plenty of conflict to go around .
The Civil Rights Movement was n’t only about the rights of black people ; it was about the rights of all people .
If justice could be denied to one , it could be denied to many .
The Civil Rights Movement made strides toward ending the racial divide in America but was largely held in check by violence and social and economic oppression .
The power elite gave just enough to take some of the wind out of the sails of the movement , and then finished it off with the murder of Dr. King .
The War for the Soul of America
World War II brought something new and sinister to America , the prospect of war as business and armaments as industry .
The notion that there were profits to be derived from war was nothing new , but the industrialization of war as big business was ( if not entirely ) .
Because of the necessities of WWII America now had a vast industrial power house dedicated to the manufacture of the tools of war : planes , tanks , bombs , cannons , guns , bullets , and etcetera .
All that industrial capability could rake in some massive profits if only we could sell the rest of the world enough of the implements of war .
There were important voices warning against this new threat to America called the military - industrial complex .
Until the latest of our world conflicts , the United States had no armaments industry .
American makers of plowshares could , with time and as required , make swords as well .
But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense ; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions .
Added to this , three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment .
We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations .
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience .
The total influence -- economic , political , even spiritual -- is felt in every city , every State house , every office of the Federal government .
We recognize the imperative need for this development .
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications .
Our toil , resources and livelihood are all involved ; so is the very structure of our society .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes .
We should take nothing for granted .
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals , so that security and liberty may prosper together .
~ former President and military leader , Dwight D. Eisenhower ( emphasis added )
Please do n’t gloss over this Eisenhower quote .
This is a very important piece of history that has a profound bearing on where we are today .
That we failed to heed Eisenhower ’s warning is a pity beyond measure .
It is now our job , and a considerable challenge it will be , to reverse this tragic mistake of history .
We can no longer allow greed to drive humanity – for it has driven it into a ditch .
We must end the arms trade and turn the resources , genius , and capitol of the military - industrial complex to peaceful purposes .
Do n’t scoff .
People have done the seemingly impossible before , and we will do it again .
This is both a moral and a practical imperative .
As things are , the center cannot hold .
All of the energy , treasure , and sweat that has been devoted to the mass production of the lethal implements of war need to be redirected to solving our very real problems such as :
Global warming
Alternative energy
Food distribution
Disease prevention
Fresh water distribution
Crumbling infrastructure
And so on
We need to be building desalination plants , schools and hospitals - NOT bombs .
As it is we come very close to outspending every other nation combined on weaponry and the military .
The rhetoric is always , " We have to defend ourselves from the evil warmongers of the world . "
Well , guess what ?
We are the evil warmongers of the world .
The rest of the world needs to worry about us .
Just because they have won this war up till now is no reason to concede .
We must win back America ’s soul and put the nation on a righteous path , one that we can all be proud of , and one that will serve the world and all of humanity , and serve them well .
The Hair Rebellion
Just about the time the Civil Rights Movement was peaking , here came the Beatles to America .
It seems funny now that these clean - cut lads would cause such an uproar , but boy howdy did they ever !
People freaked out about their hair , though in pictures now they look well sheared .
As the objections grew so did the Beatles ’ hair .
It was a thing of beauty .
Of course now every other kid in America wanted to grow their hair out too .
As the Beatles grew theirs longer , we followed suit .
This was a travesty to the mainstream , and many of us kids were mocked , beaten , thrown out of school or kicked out of our homes for the choice .
For a period of several years it was all about hair .
You could tell almost any kid ’s politics by the length of their hair .
By the mid-1970s long hair worn by much of the American youth evoked little comment and indeed was considered fashionable .
But during much of the previous two decades male hair length was a contentious issue that divided the generations .
The struggle over hair in many ways epitomized the sixties generation ’s challenge to authority and their claim to individual rights .
During the era , the meaning of long hair changed dramatically from what it was during the fifties .
It began as a symbol of youth culture rebellion linked to music .
By the latter part of the sixties , however , it became associated with a political and social critique of American society .

Master ’s Thesis in History
Almost Cut My Hair Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It 's gettin ' kind of long
I could 've said it was in my way But I did n't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It 's gettin ' kind of long
I could 've said it was in my way But I did n't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
And I feel like I owe it , ... to someone Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I 'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car Well I 'm not giving in an inch to fear
çause I 've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it , ... to someone
When I finally get myself together
I 'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather And I 'm goin ' to find a space inside to laugh ,
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel ...
Like I owe it , ... to someone , yeah Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young
It may seem silly now , but our hair was our protest .
As such , it took on great significance at the time .
It was an in - your - face statement to the establishment that we were n’t buying their crap anymore .
The Anti-War War
At some point in the mid-60s , we as a culture began to wake up to the fact that we were losing a lot of young American lives in an obscure little country halfway around the world called Vietnam .
We still had a free press then ( more or less ) and they reported dutifully .
The entire nation followed the daily body counts on the evening news , and the war became a major focus of the youth rebellion .
Our peers were getting slaughtered and it made no sense at all .
It eventually began to dawn on us that companies like Dupont and Bank of America were reaping huge profits from the war , and that was why America was sacrificing its youth .
I Feel Like I 'm Fixin ' to Die Rag Yeah , come on all of you big strong men ,
Uncle Sam needs your help again .
He 's got himself in a terrible jam
Way down yonder in Vietnam
So put down your books and pick up a gun ,
We 're gonna have a whole lotta fun .
And it 's one , two , three ,
What are we fighting for ?
Do n't ask me , I do n't give a damn ,
Next stop is Vietnam ;
And it 's five , six , seven ,
Open up the pearly gates ,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why ,
Whoopee !
we 're all gonna die .
Well , come on generals , let 's move fast ;
Your big chance has come at last .
Gotta go out and get those reds -
The only good commie is the one who 's dead
And you know that peace can only be won
When we 've blown 'em all to Kingdom Come .
And it 's one , two , three ,
What are we fighting for ?
Do n't ask me , I do n't give a damn ,
Next stop is Vietnam ;
And it 's five , six , seven ,
Open up the pearly gates ,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee !
we 're all gonna die .
Huh !
Well , come on Wall Street , do n't move slow ,
Why man , this is War - a - go - go .
There 's plenty good money to be made
By supplying the Army with the tools of the trade ,
Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb ,
They drop it on the Viet Cong .
And it 's one , two , three ,
What are we fighting for ?
Do n't ask me , I do n't give a damn ,
Next stop is Vietnam .
And it 's five , six , seven ,
Open up the pearly gates ,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee !
we 're all gonna die .
Well , come on mothers throughout the land ,
Pack your boys off to Vietnam .
Come on fathers , do n't hesitate ,
Send 'em off before it 's too late .
Be the first one on your block
To have your boy come home in a box .
And it 's one , two , three
What are we fighting for ?
Do n't ask me , I do n't give a damn ,
Next stop is Vietnam .
And it 's five , six , seven ,
Open up the pearly gates ,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why ,
Whoopee !
we 're all gonna die .
~ Country Joe McDonald and the Fish
The Vietnam War protests became a battleground for the war between the rebellious youth and the establishment who profited from the war .
The establishment left us no doubts that they were prepared to slaughter us on the streets of America to hang on to their precious little war .
For a good long while following the war in Vietnam , our nation avoided war .
We had learned some painful lessons about messin ’ in the affairs of others .
Sadly , we failed to retain the wisdom over time and slowly began to forget what we had paid so dearly to learn , thus setting the stage for Iraq .
If we had remembered Vietnam , Iraq would never have happened .
One lesson we should remember about both Vietnam and Iraq is that a certain segment of our society reaps great profits from war and has no compunction about having their money come to them soaked in the blood of innocents and patriots .
They ’ll happily kill your children and mine for the base motive of short - term profit .
The Drug War
This war has wrought infinitely more death and human suffering than drugs themselves ever could .
Because of the hype , hysteria , and misinformation we are subjected to on the subject , many of us do n’t realize that the majority of the harm caused by drugs is actually the direct result of our draconian drug laws , aggressive and violent enforcement of those laws , and the criminality imposed by prohibition .
We need to bring all of this drug hysteria to an end .
Prohibition does not work .
The fact is that people have always used drugs and they always will .
But the point here is that this misbegotten war causes terrible and heart - breaking damage to our society , and to innocents , children , and others who would do us no harm .
And God help anyone who is caught up in the Drug War or for any other reason goes to prison in this country .
For decades prison populations have been rising dramatically while prison conditions have been deteriorating just as dramatically .
Prison reformers once imagined that as time went by , conditions would improve because awareness would naturally increase and Americans would act on their consciences .
They were wrong .
The Bullshit War
Every day of our lives we are ruthlessly exploited , manipulated , conned , and lied to .
And all the time there is a steady drumbeat from the MSM that everything is mostly alright , there ’s nothing seriously amiss here , just calmly do what you ’re told and everything will be alright .
You can believe that if you want to – but I do n’t advise it .
We live in a world of unrelenting , and overwhelming propaganda .
We are constantly lied to through every imaginable media .
We are fed a sugarcoated version of reality designed by expert propagandists to keep us acquiescent of the status quo .
" Everything ’s cool baby , just go along to get along , do n't rock the boat ! " is constantly whispered into our collective ear .
When you buy into that bullshit , they have you right where they want you .
The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media .
~ William Colby , former CIA director as quoted by Dave McGowan in his book Derailing Democracy
This is a former director of the CIA telling us that the CIA owns the media .
We should all be paying rapt attention .
In a fit on conscience in his old age , Colby told many such tales out of school - which may be why he was discovered one day quite mysteriously dead .
The extent to which you believe what you ’re told , or even allow it to register without rigorous questioning is the extent to which you are sadly misinformed .
This concerted campaign of disinformation is so pervasive in our culture that it ca n’t help but affect us all , disorienting individuals and distorting every issue to the point that knowing the truth in modern day America is nothing less than a Herculean task - and yet knowing the truth , as elusive as it may be , is our solemn duty as citizens .
The truth will set you free , but first it will piss you off .
~ Gloria Steinem
The War of All Wars – the Class War
This is the war that underlies all the others .
This is the real divide in America , the only one that really counts .
All the other culture wars have been largely a matter of the power elite exploiting social divisions to keep us at each other ’s throats , so that we would n’t turn on them – the old divide and conquer strategy .
It ’s worked pretty well too up to this point .
They have used race , generational tension , culture , religion , bias , bigotry , drug hysteria , nationalism , homophobia , and gender inequality to keep us riled up and fighting amongst ourselves .
The ruling class , or power elite , are comprised of the rich and powerful in America .
They are , directly or indirectly , heavily invested in the military - industrial complex and therefore the arms trade and war .
These are the corporate masters of America .
They are also heavily invested in our government .
They have raised the stakes and the ante in our political system to the point that most of us are effectively excluded from the game .
They pay for it and they own it .
They are blinded by their greed and amorality and therefore represent a clear and present danger to the rest of us .
These rich and powerful players are the heart of the rightwing , though a relatively small portion of it .
The rest are their dupes who subscribe to the wingnut philosophy because :
They hate one race or another
They are eaten up with homophobia
They believe in American exceptionalism and brook no criticism of the USA
They think war is patriotic
They hate people of other religions
They fear change
They some day hope to be gazillionaires and so want to be in with the right crowd
Or any number of other bogus reasons
The real power elite manipulate these fools like puppets .
Prayer in school , homosexual marriage , flag burning amendments , born again Presidents , and on and on goes the list of their manipulative devices .
They easily fool these folks into voting wholeheartedly against their own economic interests .
And they pit their dupes against the rest of us to keep us all from presenting a united front to them and thereby challenging their rule .
One of their favorite tactics is attempting to hang their sins on their opponents as a way of deflecting the criticism they know they deserve .
That ’s why you hear repubs accusing Democrats of class warfare .
They ’re trying to smear us with their own agenda to confuse the issue .
" It ’s not us , it ’s you , " they ’re saying .
All the while they are actively plotting to destroy the middle class and reduce us all to a condition of abject servitude .
They have been gleefully practicing class warfare against the lower classes ( which includes everyone who is not a certified multi- millionaire at the very least ) for most all of my life .
In the 60s one adult could support a household .
Living was relatively inexpensive , cars and houses were inexpensive , college was cheap , even people with mediocre jobs often worked a couple of years then took a year off to travel .
A lot of the things we now pay for were then free .
Today , even if you have a good job , chances are you live paycheck - to - paycheck , and that more than one adult in the household works fulltime just to make ends meet .
The cost of college has skyrocketed into the stratosphere , and nothing is free .
Fifty million Americans are without any form of health insurance .
Many have been victimized by the export of American jobs , just ask any computer programmer , and the list of exported professions is growing at an alarming rate .
What manufacturing jobs we still have are on their way to China , high - tech jobs to India , and those of us not filthy rich are in the process of being reduced to peasants – and peasantry pays poorly , even in America .
In Summation
Are we all going to wake up one day in our hovels or on the street with no job or income or hope and think to ourselves , " Hey , I guess that was a war " ?
What is it going to take to get people to realize that small incremental change is never going to make a real difference ?
It is massive , fundamental change that is called for and that is the only change that can help at this point .
As it stands , we are the world ’s leading warmongers , war profiteers , and purveyors of the implements of mass murder .
This is not something in which we can take pride , and it ’s not something which we can sustain .
And because of the blinding greed of those we have allowed to take charge of our country , we are failing to act on the issue of global warming .
This is the height of folly and irresponsibility .
When are we all going to stand and say ENOUGH ?
But do n’t worry , I ’m not pissed off or anything ...
Post Script
So what do I expect you to make of this diary ?
It ’s intended as a history lesson in the form of a brief overview , history admittedly as filtered through my personal experience , analysis and interpretation .
I hope it will help someone to focus more clearly on our present circumstances , as we are in desperate need of solutions .
If we do n’t even realize we ’re in a war , we ’re going to keep getting our asses kicked again and again , just as we ’ve been doing for lo these many years .
If you still do n’t believe this is a war , just ask those who were with Dr. King the day he was shot , or someone who was beaten , gassed and jailed in Chicago in 1968 , or the girl in the photograph at Kent State .

Top 5 Myths About Cats :
Despite its overwhelming popularity , the cat is still a very misunderstood animal .
Here are the top 5 " facts " about cats that many people still believe to be true :
# 5 : Cats Can See In The Dark
A cat has vertical pupils that expand to let him see in near darkness .
He has about thirty whiskers which help him find his way around at night , even in strange surroundings .
But he is not endowed with special eyesight that can enable him to see in absolute darkness .
# 4 : Cats Are Surefooted , And Always Land On Their Feet
Some children , believing this piece of folklore , delight in dropping Puss from heights - like out of the window - just to prove it is true .
But it is more often false .
Puss ends up with broken legs , or neck , and it is too late to say  Dont believe everything you hear ! 
It s true that cats are the most agile , surefooted , graceful animals in the world - most of the time .
But they can also knock over lamps , send coffee cups flying , and fall off chairs .
They can end up with broken bones in short falls , especially when they are kittens .
# 3 : Cats Are Cowards
Dogs are well known for their heroism , but not many people know that cats , too , have their hours of glory .
For instance , Agatha , who saved her family from fire by jumping on their bed .
Or a cunning Siamese named Su - Ling , whose ferocious growling and tiger pounce sent a prowler scrambling .
Or the story of the courageous feline who scratched her sleeping mistress continuously to save her from fire , knowing the dear , deaf lady could not hear .
There are many stories of cats scaring away poisonous reptiles , scorpions , and other unpleasant folk .
In Florida , a tiny kitten was credited with alerting her mistress to the danger of a deadly coral snake .
Remember , heroism is not confined to only one species of animal .
# 2 : Cats Are Stupid
Physiologically , a cats brain bears a striking resemblance to that of man-more so than any other animals .
How do we measure intelligence in an animal ?
One cannot and should not play one species off against another .
Cats , for example , are bored with mazes .
But watch them get out of any enclosed space !
They can open doors , lift latches , leap many times their own length over walls .
Psychologists have noted that their ability to escape confinement is superior to that of any other animal .
Besides superb skill and strategy in stalking prey , cats have a built in clock .
They know when its time for you to come home , and when it is time for bed .
# 1 : Cats Are Not Affectionate
The person who thinks a cat is an unloving animal never held one on his lap .
First the cat kneads gently to make the spot as soft and comfortable as possible , then settles down and purrs .
Whether he purrs loudly of softly , its love .
A cats affection is always subtle , like rubbing against your legs .
Each cat varies in the amount of affection he wishes to put forth , and in the ways he wishes to show it .
But its there - as long as you are receptive - and sometimes even if you re not .
Of course there are some stupid cats , just as there are some remarkable cats .
Like humans , not ALL are bright .
Most often people think cats are stupid because they refuse to perform on command .
But that s only because cats are smart enough to know its beneath their dignity !

This is a Jewish fish story .
Or more accurately a Jewish fishworm story .
My mother , like her mother , was an expert Jewish cook , their specialties famous in our extended family .
Their secret : taste as you go .
Season slowly until the perfect flavor comes through .
It ’s a safe technique with latkes or kreplach but not always with gefilte fish , a ground concoction of freshwater fish , spices , eggs , salt and matzo meal .
My mother never became sick from tasting raw fish , but , by chance , gefilte fish turned out to be a formidable problem for my medical partner ’s wife , Rita .
Rita was meticulous in keeping a kosher house and enjoyed making the special Jewish dishes , including gefilte fish .
An unusually energetic young woman , she was able to work in the garden , clean the house , cook and support her husband ’s surgical practice without effort .
But she had not been feeling well for months : abdominal symptoms of cramps , distention and occasional diarrhea , associated with increasing weakness , shortness of breath , lethargy and fatigue .
“ The publishers ca n’t dispute the fact that the popularity of playing guitar has exploded because of sites like mine , ” said Robert Balch , the publisher of Guitar Tab Universe ( guitartabs.cc ) , in Los Angeles .
“ And any person that buys a guitar book during their lifetime , that money goes to the publishers . ”
Image Credit ... Illustration by The New York Times
Mr. Balch , who took down guitar tabs from his site in late July at the behest of the music publishers , added that , “ I ’d think the music publishers would be happy to have sites that get people interested in becoming one of their customers . ”
Cathal Woods , who manages Olga.net , one of the pioneer free tablature sites , said he had run the site for 14 years with the help of a systems administrator , “ and we ’ve never taken a penny . ”
Mr. Woods , who teaches philosophy at Virginia Wesleyan College in Norfolk , said Olga . net had earned an undisclosed amount of money by posting ads on Google ’s behalf , but he said that money had paid for bandwidth and a legal defense fund .
Anthony DeGidio , a lawyer for Olga.net , said he was still formulating a legal strategy , while also helping decide whether the site could pay licensing fees “ in the event that that ’s required . ”
For now , though , the site remains unavailable to users .
Because the music tablature sites are privately held , they do not disclose sales figures , and because industry analysts generally do not closely follow tablature sites , it is unclear how much revenue they generate .
But with the Internet advertising market surging , almost any Web site with significant traffic can generate revenue .
Google also dabbles in tablature through its Google Groups discussion board service , in which guitar players trade tabs they have figured out by listening to the songs , or by copying tabs found elsewhere .
A Google spokesman , Steve Langdon , said Google would take down music tablature from its Groups service if publishers claimed the materials violated copyright agreements and if Google determined that infringement was likely .

He is renowned for his perfectionism on the pitch , but it seems everything has to be just right for David Beckham at home as well .
The England football captain has admitted that he suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) - a complaint which drives sufferers to carry out bizarre and persistent rituals .
In a television interview , Beckham , 30 , confessed to counting the cans of cola he keeps in his fridge .
He said the condition leads him to count clothes and place magazines in straight lines and symmetrical patterns .
And he added that one of the reasons why he keeps having tattoos is that he is addicted to the pain of the needle .
Beckham said : " I have got this obsessive compulsive disorder where I have to have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs . "
With a carefully - placed plug for his sponsor , he went on : " I 'll put my Pepsi cans in the fridge and if there 's one too many then I 'll put it in another cupboard somewhere .
" I 've got that problem .
I 'll go into a hotel room .
Before I can relax I have to move all the leaflets and all the books and put them in a drawer .
Everything has to be perfect . "
Asked if he had tried to rid himself of the condition , which affects two per cent of the population , he replied : " I would like to .
I 've tried and I can't stop . "
The World Health Organisation rates OCD as one of the top ten most debilitating illnesses .
Beckham reportedly spends hours straightening the furniture , apparently buys exactly 20 packets of Super Noodles on each visit to the supermarket and wears a new pair of football boots for every match .
His wife Victoria , 31 , has said : " Everything has to match in the house .
If there are three cans of Diet Pepsi , he'd throw one away because it 's uneven . "
Secret
In the interview with Tim Lovejoy , to be broadcast by ITV in the run-up to the World Cup , Beckham said he had kept the condition secret from his teammates at Real Madrid .
But his battle with OCD was common knowledge amongst teammates at his previous club , Manchester United .
Beckham told how players Paul Scholes , Nicky Butt , Ryan Giggs and Gary and Phil Neville would barge in to his hotel room .
" I thought they were just coming in for a chat .
But then they'd go out and I 'm thinking , ' Something 's different here ' .
And then all the magazines would be all wonky . "
He added : " They 'd have been in my wardrobe and all my trousers and my shoes would be all over the place .
It was a joke with them . "
Beckham , who has 12 tattoos including the names of his sons Brooklyn , Romeo and Cruz , said : " Funnily enough , and I know it sounds weird , but I actually enjoy the pain .
" Victoria 's not keen on my having many more but they are addictive . "
Other famous OCD sufferers include Paul Gascoigne , Woody Allen , Harrison Ford , Emily Lloyd , Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder .
In an earlier era , Charles Dickens and Marcel Proust are also said to have been victims of the condition .
A spokesman for the charity OCD - UK hoped Beckham 's revelations would encourage other men to seek help with the condition .
" OCD is something which affects both sexes equally but it is usually the women who are brave enough to come forward for help , " he said .
" To people like Beckham who are considered perfectionists in what they do , that sort of mindset can be a benefit to their careers to a degree , but for the vast majority it is a seriously debilitating condition . "
It was awful .
I could n't stop pawing the keyboard , looking for one more thrill , clicking that depraved trackpad of titillation over and over again .
But I made it out , barely intact , to warn you of the perils of the Number # 1 Christian Porn Site — Satan help me if I ever fall into their clutches again .
I feel guilty giving you the link to this most peculiar ministry , the Triple - X Church , which preaches against porn by copping as " Porno " an attitude as possible .
God knows they do n't need the traffic ; they 've been terribly successful wooing young men to purge themselves of their guilty obsessions .
By using sexy graphics , humor , lots of baby curse epithets ( " get your crap together ! " ) and avoiding boring Bible rants , the two " pastors " who run this site convince men to pledge that they wo n't look at sexy pictures of women anymore , even though they are the first to admit that the habit of looking sure does give you a hard boner in your pants .
Take a peek at this ad for their radio show that I 've posted : a hot babe , just waiting to embrace your manhood !
This is conservative , puritanical subversion as its most Machiavellian .
I prefer to pretend this site is a triumph of satiric performance art , because it 's too sad to contemplate that these clever wise - asses , Pastors Craig and Mike , actually believe that masturbation is an offense to God and womankind .
Yes , they insist that masturbation is something that guys do to demean the fairer sex .
At the same time , they go on tours with " porn stars " ... actual , working porn stars , who pose with Craig and Mike like a couple of Las Vegas conventioneers .
The women wear their usual sexy outfits , but what comes out of their mouth is , " I know Jesus loves me , but with his help , I 'll someday be able to get of of this industry of the damned . "
It 's diabolical !
Either that , or these are the two best con artists I 've ever seen .
Someone get them a job at the White House .
Craig and Mike 's merchandising is where they really shine : I , too , want one of their t- shirts that blazes Jesus Loves Porn Stars , in Charlie Angels handwriting — but I 'd rather die and burn in hell forever than send them money .
This self - styled Porn Church offers a special software that tracks where you visit on your computer , and then sends the log to a friend / family member of your choice , so that you 'll always know that someone is watching you .
If you go read a smutty story on literotica.com , your " wife " will get a link , and she can read the same smutty story too !
Hmm , maybe this could bring you closer together —
" Jane had no idea that Joe found bondage three - ways as hot and naughty as she did ! "
On this week 's episode of In Bed , # 218 , I tell you every detail of my foray into Craig and Mike 's Triple - X missionary positions .
You 'll also hear about some of my favorite sex toys available on Amazon.com , since they opened up their shelves to peacock feather buttplugs and Mr. Softies .
I 'm sure my new pastors could find a way to work these into their empire !
In my " Try This At Home " mailbag , a listener writes to me that he loves the show , but wishes I would leave out discussions of religion and politics .
Christ , I really let him down on this one !
Seriously though , what do you think of that particular mix on my show ?
My attitude has been that politics and religion are inescapable from my sexual point of view , but I do have a " broadcasting " obligation to be entertaining , funny , informative , rather than an utter bore , which can be a devilish temptation in these topic areas !

タが全部消えるということも無くなる。ユーザから異議を唱える契機はどこにもない。
ただ、開発者の視点、オープンソースという文脈からすれば、筆者は若干危惧しないでもな いのである。
自分が著作権を持つソフトウェアの扱いをコントロールしたい、というとき、
そのための手段となるのは著作権に立脚したライセンシングであり、とりわけ
複製や頒布の制限である。頒布に あたって種種の条件を付ける、というのがよくあるやり方で、典型例はGNU GPLなどにおけるコピーレフトだ。複製や頒布に制約を加えない限り、自由に複製や頒布を行ってよい、というのは、立派な「頒布の制限」である。

The act of running the Program is not restricted , and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program ( independent of having been made by running the Program ) .
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does .
と明示的に述べている( 強調は筆者 ) 。例えば自社が開発したプログラムをGPLの下で公開したとして、それを競合他社が改良を加えてウェブサービスで使ったとしても、その改良部分のソース公開を自社が求める根拠はどこにもない。これは、実質的なコピーレフトの骨抜きである。
この問題点そのものは、数年前からすでに認識されていた。GPLの「 Web ( あるい はDistribution ) loophole 」 と呼ばれるものがそれである。 これに対し、対策を試みたの がGPLv3のプロトタイプと目されていたAffero GPL ( AGPL ) だった。 AGPL には以下のような条項が含まれている。

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it , thus forming a work based on the Program , and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above , provided that you also meet all of these conditions : ( 中略 )
コンピュータネットワークを介してユーザとやりとりをするようなプログラム(まさにウェブサービスだ)には、完全なソースコードをユーザに送信する(たとえばボタンを押すとソースがダウンロードできるというような)機能を付け、その機能を除去してはならない、というわけである。これはそれなりに巧妙な解決策だったと思う。しかし、この種の条項には致命的な問題点がある。結局のところこれは改変への制限なので、改変への制限を認めない現行のGNU
GPLバージョン2とは矛盾してしまうのだ。
現在、GPLはバージョン3に向けた改訂作業が進んでいる。今後改訂プロセスが

しかし、これ はGPLv3そのものにAGPL的対策を取り込んだというものではない。筆者はGPLv3改訂に若干関与しているが、他の関係者の意見を総合しても、GPLv3ではWeb loopholeには積極的に対処しない、というのが大まかなコンセンサスのように思われる。DRMへの強硬なスタンスと比べるとずいぶん弱腰な対応ではあるが、それだけこれはエレガントな解決が難しく、不用意に手を打つと多方面に悪い影響を与えかねないセンシティヴな問題だということなのだろう。

ないだろうか。私たちは、そのような世界を目指してオープンソースだのフリーソフトウェアだのといった旗を振ってきたのだろうか。
あまり意味をきちんと吟味せず 、Web 2.0に代表されるような最近のトレンドと、オープンソース、あるいはフリーソフトウェアの近縁性を主張するような言説が散見される。印象論だけで語っているようなものは論外だが、オープンソースの隆盛がWeb 2.0を可能にした、というのは、確かにあながち間違いではないのだろう。しかし、Web 2.0的世界を突き詰めていくと、これまでオープンソース/フリーソフトウェアを支えてきた大黒柱の一本が無効化される可能性がある、ということは、頭の片隅にとどめておく価値のあることではないかと思う。

BBC News science reporter
The animal , from the early Cambrian Period , might have belonged to a now extinct mollusc - like phylum , academics from America and China say .
Other researchers have suggested the creature could represent an early annelid or arthropod .
Details are published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
It is another strange thing from the Cambrian
Jonathan Todd , Natural History Museum , London
The trouble is the animal , named Vetustovermis planus , did not possess a set of features , or characters , which placed it clearly within any known group .
When it was first described in 1979 , Vetustovermis was included in the annelid category .
Later researchers argued against this classification , saying it was , in fact , either an arthropod or a mollusc .
Flat foot
According to the latest study , the weird creature seems closest to molluscs , primarily because it had a snail or slug - like flat foot .
However , the researchers say , it does not sit happily in this group .
" Phyla are defined by an organism having a set of features called characters , and currently there are no animals that we know of which contain the set of characters that Vetustovermis has , " co-author David Bottjer , of the University of Southern California , US , told the BBC News website .
Vetustodermis planus does not fit comfortably within any known phylum
Since Vetustovermis requires some " pushing and pulling " to force it into any known phylum , Professor Bottjer and his colleagues are tempted to speculate it belonged to a different group entirely ; one which flourished and faded within the Cambrian .
" We have always been intrigued by the many molluscan features of these fossils , but in the great menagerie of organisms that have inhabited Earth through life 's long history , we may come to conclude that Vetustovermis indeed represents a new phylum , " he said .
Jonathan Todd , a palaeontologist from the Natural History Museum , London , UK , is also mystified by the baffling animal .
" It is an intriguing beast , " he told the BBC News website .
" It is another strange thing from the Cambrian .
It does n't look much like an arthropod and I do n't find its molluscan affinities particularly convincing . "
Evolutionary tree
However , Dr Todd is reluctant to create a whole new phylum to accommodate Vetustovermis ; that , he thinks , would be premature .
" Some scientists have thought that there were so many distinct phyla in the Cambrian , " he said .
" They came to that conclusion because they were not thinking in the phylogenetic sense , they were thinking 'hey , that is a unique set of features - it must be a distinct phylum ' . "
So rather than creating new phyla every time something does n't fit an existing one , the really interesting exercise , Dr Todd thinks , is to establish just how Vetustovermis slotted into the greater evolutionary tree .
If , indeed , it did belong to a different phylum , how did that group connect to the molluscs , annelids and arthropods ?
" We do n't really know the phylo - genetic relationships between the extant phyla , " he said .
" Molecular genetics has only gone so far .
But recent phyla have got to connect somehow .
These fossils really offer the opportunity to tie together recent phyla . "

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2006 October 9
Explanation :
An unusual spot has been found on Mars that scientists believe is not natural in origin .
The spot appears mobile and is now hypothesized to be a robot created by an intelligent species alien to Mars .
In fact , the spot appears to be NASA 's robotic Opportunity rover currently rolling across Mars .
The ability to see the Martian rover from orbit has recently been demonstrated by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) .
The new spacecraft achieved orbit around Mars in 2006 March .
Last week , MRO imaged the location of Victoria Crater and the rover Opportunity that had just arrived there .
In the above image at spectacularly high resolution , objects about one meter in size are resolved , and this includes the rolling rover .
Such images may help scientists better determine if any safe path exists for Opportunity to enter large crater .
In the inset image on the upper left , the whole of Victoria Crater was also imaged by MRO .
Way back when Interesting Thing of the Day was just a gleam in my eye , I started asking people for their ideas on interesting topics I should write about .
One of my wife ’s friends made the very first suggestion .
“ You should write about French butter dishes , ” she said , “ — you know , the kind that keep butter fresh without refrigeration . ”
I had no idea what she was talking about , but I wrote it down on my list anyway .
After unsuccessfully trying to locate one of these things in France , I did a few web searches and sure enough , French butter dishes — like the one now in my kitchen — are quite interesting .
The idea behind French butter dishes is pure , ingenious simplicity .
Butter at room temperature quickly turns rancid when exposed to oxygen , so the usual means of preserving it is to store it in the refrigerator .
But all that ’s really needed is to keep air away from the butter .
A French butter dish does this by using water to form a seal between the butter and the air .
There are two parts to the dish : a smaller , bell - or cone - shaped piece that sits on a wide base , and a second , larger container .
You fill the bell up with butter , put water in the larger container , and invert the bell into the water .
Because butter is basically an oil , it wo n’t mix with the water , and as long as it ’s not too hot , it will remain sticky enough to stay inside the bell .
You can keep this on your kitchen table so that butter is always available without the need to soften it .
Going Soft
Of course , most people have refrigerators , so keeping butter fresh is no longer much of an issue .
But for some unfathomable reason , even in the technologically advanced and culturally sophisticated 21st century , I regularly find myself at restaurants that serve hard , cold butter with their soft , warm bread .
Presumably the temperature of the butter is supposed to reassure diners that it ’s fresh , but I am utterly at a loss to comprehend what technique I am expected to employ to spread the butter while keeping both the bread and my dignity intact .
This is , for me , one of life ’s great imponderables .
But it ’s a problem solved neatly and painlessly by a French butter dish — always fresh , always soft , no refrigeration required .
Every restaurant should use them .
I should point out that for all their virtues , French butter dishes are not maintenance - free .
The water needs to be changed every two or three days , and some people recommend adding salt to the water to retard the development of mold .
They ’re also not impervious to heat .
If you leave a full dish in a hot room or in direct sunlight , the butter can melt and ooze into the water when you lift the lid — not a pretty sight .
It ’s also important to top off the butter regularly .
If the bell is only half full , a layer of air will be trapped between the water and the butter , defeating the purpose of the dish .
Some designs overcome this problem by placing small holes in the sides of the bell to allow the air to escape .
That Name Rings a Bell
There ’s yet one other problem : what exactly one should call them .
I call them “ French butter dishes ” because that seems to be the most popular name , but it ’s a bit of a misnomer .
If you go to any random housewares shop in France and ask for a butter dish , or beurrier as they ’re called there , you ’ll get an ordinary , everyday butter dish that will hold a stick of butter quite nicely in your refrigerator — not one of these .
( According to the scant evidence I ’ve been able to piece together , the design apparently originated in the French town of Vallauris , but is now more popular in the United States than in France .
Go figure . )
In any case , this particular type of French butter dish goes by quite a few names .
I ’ve seen them called Butter Bells — a term that is trademarked by L. Tremain , Inc. — as well as French butter crocks and butter keepers , among other things .
But none of these terms quite does justice to the unique design .
When I first wrote about French butter dishes here in 2003 , I said :
Perhaps the pottery makers of the world would consider the term cloche de beurre , which is French for “ butter bell ” and not , as far as I know , trademarked .
If the name catches on , remember : you heard it here first .
As it turned out , over the past 15 years , French manufacturers of butter dishes have largely settled on the term cloche à beurre — which , if my French skills in 2003 had been a bit more advanced , would have been the obvious answer — but I have nevertheless found no fewer than 16,000 references on the web to “ cloche de beurre , ” which is still defensible , if inelegant .
In any case : well done , everybody !
French butter dishes are cool because they ’re a low - tech solution to not just one , but two annoying challenges — keeping butter fresh and keeping it soft .
Just thinking about them makes me hungry for a baguette .
There are umpteen ( by actual count ) manufacturers of French butter dishes on the web , with tremendously varying designs , materials , and colors .
Amazon.com carries quite a few different designs .
I bought mine from Lee Daniels Clay in Brinnon , Washington .
I was favorably impressed by the quality of workmanship , the rapid and secure shipping , and the customer service ; I ’d recommend them to anyone .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on July 5 , 2003 , and again in a slightly revised form on June 14 , 2004 .
" When Governor Mike Rounds signed HB 1215 into law it effectively banned all abortions in the state with the exception that it did allow saving the mother�s life .
There were , however , no exceptions for victims of rape or incest .
His actions , and the comments of State Senators like Bill Napoli of Rapid City , SD , set of a maelstrom of protests within the state .
Napoli suggested that if it was a case of �simple rape , � there should be no thoughts of ending a pregnancy .
Letters by the hundreds appeared in local newspapers , mostly written by women , challenging Napoli�s description of rape as �simple .�
He has yet to explain satisfactorily what he meant by �simple rape . �
The President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation , Cecilia Fire Thunder , was incensed .
A former nurse and healthcare giver she was very angry that a state body made up mostly of white males , would make such a stupid law against women .
� To me , it is now a question of sovereignty , � she said to me last week .
� I will personally establish a Planned Parenthood clinic on my own land which is within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Reservation where the State of South Dakota has absolutely no jurisdiction . �
Strong words from a very strong lady .
I hope Ms. Fire Thunder challenges Gov. Rounds and the state legislators on this law that is an affront to all independent women . "

The Saint - Hilaire family first patented the Quasiturbine combustion engine in 1996 .
The Quasiturbine concept resulted from research that began with an intense evaluation of all engine concepts to note advantages , disadvantages and opportunities for improvement .
During this exploratory process , the Saint - Hilaire team came to realize that a unique engine solution would be one that made improvements to the standard Wankel , or rotary , engine .
Like rotary engines , the Quasiturbine engine is based on a rotor - and - housing design .
But instead of three blades , the Quasiturbine rotor has four elements chained together , with combustion chambers located between each element and the walls of the housing .
Photo courtesy Quasiturbine.com
Simple Quasiturbine design
The four - sided rotor is what sets the Quasiturbine apart from the Wankel .
There are actually two different ways to configure this design -- one with carriages and one without carriages .
As we 'll see , a carriage , in this case , is just a simple machine piece .
First , let 's look at the components of simpler Quasiturbine model -- the version without carriages .
The simpler Quasiturbine model looks very much like a traditional rotary engine : A rotor turns inside a nearly oval - shaped housing .
Notice , however , that the Quasiturbine rotor has four elements instead of three .
The sides of the rotor seal against the sides of the housing , and the corners of the rotor seal against the inner periphery , dividing it into four chambers .
In a piston engine , one complete four - stroke cycle produces two complete revolutions of the crankshaft ( see How Car Engines Work : Internal Combustion ) .
That means the power output of a piston engine is half a power stroke per one piston revolution .
A Quasiturbine engine , on the other hand , does n't need pistons .
Instead , the four strokes of a typical piston engine are arranged sequentially around the oval housing .
There 's no need for the crankshaft to perform the rotary conversion .
This animated graphic identifies each cycle .
Notice that in this illustration the spark plug is located in one of the housing ports .
In this basic model , it 's very easy to see the four cycles of internal combustion :
Intake , which draws in a mixture of fuel and air
, which draws in a mixture of fuel and air Compression , which squeezes the fuel - air mixture into a smaller volume
, which squeezes the fuel - air mixture into a smaller volume Combustion , which uses a spark from a spark plug to ignite the fuel
, which uses a spark from a spark plug to ignite the fuel Exhaust , which expels waste gases ( the byproducts of combustion ) from the engine compartment
Quasiturbine engines with carriages work on the same basic idea as this simple design , with added design modifications that allow for photo - detonation .
Photo - detonation is a superior combustion mode that requires more compression and greater sturdiness than piston or rotary engines can provide .
Now , let 's see what this combustion mode is all about .
Internal combustion engines fall into four categories based on how well air and fuel are mixed together in the combustion chamber and how the fuel is ignited .
Type I includes engines in which the air and fuel mix thoroughly to form what is called a homogenous mixture .
When a spark ignites the fuel , a hot flame sweeps through the mixture , burning the fuel as it goes .
This , of course , is the gasoline engine .
Four Types of Internal Combustion Engines
Homogenous Fuel - air Mixture Heterogeneous Fuel - air Mixture Spark- ignition Type I
Gasoline Engine Type II
Gasoline Direct - injection ( GDI ) Engine Pressure - heated Self- ignition Type IV
Photo - detonation Engine Type III
Diesel Engine
Type II -- a gasoline - direct injection engine -- uses partially mixed fuel and air ( i.e. , a heterogeneous mixture ) that is injected directly into the cylinder rather than into an intake port .
A spark plug then ignites the mixture , burning more of the fuel and creating less waste .
In Type III , air and fuel are only partially mixed in the combustion chamber .
This heterogeneous mixture is then compressed , which causes the temperature to rise until self - ignition takes place .
A diesel engine operates in this fashion .
Finally , in Type IV , the best attributes of gasoline and diesel engines are combined .
A premixed fuel - air charge undergoes tremendous compression until the fuel self - ignites .
This is what happens in a photo - detonation engine , and because it employs a homogenous charge and compression ignition , it is often described as an HCCI engine .
HCCI ( Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition ) combustion results in virtually no emissions and superior fuel efficiency .
This is because photo - detonation engines completely combust the fuel , leaving behind no hydrocarbons to be treated by a catalytic converter or simply expelled into the air .
Source : Green Car Congress
Of course , the high pressure required for photo - detonation puts a significant amount of stress on the engine itself .
Piston engines can't withstand the violent force of the detonation .
And traditional rotary engines such as the Wankel , which have longer combustion chambers that limit the amount of compression they can achieve , are incapable of producing the high - pressure environment necessary for photo - detonation to occur .
Enter the Quasiturbine with carriages .
Only this design is strong enough and compact enough to withstand the force of photo - detonation and allow for the higher compression ratio necessary for pressure - heated self - ignition .
In the next section , we 'll look at the major components of this design .

When Windows XP was released there was also a Windows XP resource kit released as well .
After Windows Server 2003 was released Microsoft released a Windows 2003 resource kit that includes a bunch of tools that can be used to support Windows XP
The book that Microsoft released can be purchased but the tools themselves are a free download .
Download them here
I have broken out the Windows XP support tools here and left the server tools undocumented .
After you download the resource kit tools you can install locally on your Windows XP box and try these following 61 tools out .
My favorites ?
Robocopy , qgrep and Cmdhere , but depending on what kind of situation you are in it is really nice to know about all of these tools .

Are you always looking out for new methods of approaching potential customers ?
If the answer is yes , then you should definitely try out a Address to Coordinate Conversion API service .
Just imagine , you will have a large map in front of you , where the locations of all your customers are marked .
You will know exactly where your customers live , and in which regions your products and services are most popular .
Just think of what you can do with this knowledge .
For starters , how about running some location based targeted marketing campaigns ?
These campaigns are sure to bring in lots of new customers , if you can fine - tune these properly .
The notion of mathematical coordinates for a specific location is about as old as the skill of mapping .
Navigators have used the concept for centuries to plot courses for ships , get airplanes to their destination , and explore the world .
Technology in the form of satellites and computers brought both accuracy and processing speed to the party , and by the 1990 ’s geographic coordinates were being used for a variety of purposes .
The United States Postal Service essentially took its database of postal delivery addresses and added the geographical coordinates to each record to help move mail .
Combined with the same data about roads and streets , the US government produced what are still known as tiger maps … digital databases of the road network on the US and the postal delivery addresses .
The idea was to enhance mail movement , and it worked .
Only the goal was to get mail destined to a specific location on to the correct mail carrier route , so things like correct street location , the exact location of each address , and even if the streets were complete did n’t matter all that much , as long as it was close enough to get mail on the correct route .
Mapping data companies came to the process , using various methods to correct the mapping side of the data … the postal service moved to ever tighter zip code assignments ( with associated geocodes ) to improve that part of the issue .
Those developments , coupled with increased computing power and transportation costs led to today ’s availability and uses for the process .

This is beneficial because users do not need to restart the application each time they log on .
Applications running as services can handle requests without user intervention .
Unless an application is interactive , requests are processed even when no user is logged on to the server .
Applications running as services can run with their own logon accounts .
This means an application can continue running and processing requests even when the user currently logged on to the server does not have permissions to administer the application

Subinacl.exe
SubInACL is a command - line tool that enables administrators to obtain security information about files , registry keys , and services , and transfer this information from user to user , from local or global group to group , and from domain to domain .
For example , if a user has moved from one domain ( DomainA ) to another ( DomainB ) , the administrator can replace DomainA \User with DomainB \User in the security information for the user ’s files .
This gives the user access to the same files from the new domain .
SubInACL enables administrators to do the following :
Display security information associated with files , registry keys , or services .
This information includes owner , group , permission access control list ( ACL ) , discretionary ACL ( DACL ) , and system ACL ( SACL ) .
Change the owner of an object .
Replace the security information for one identifier ( account , group , well - known security identifier ( SID ) ) with that of another identifier .
Migrate security information about objects .
This is useful if you have reorganized a network ’s domains and need to migrate the security information for files from one domain to another .

Basically all those childish columns about Dr Gillian McKeith PhD are just a cover , so that every few months I can lay some viciously complicated maths on you , as background to a major news issue .
This week , after a major government report , we heard that one murder a week is committed by someone with psychiatric problems .
Psychiatrists should do better , the newspapers told us , and prevent more of these murders .
It 's great to want to reduce psychiatric violence .
It 's great to have a public debate about the ethics of preventive detention ( for psychiatric patients and other potential risk groups , perhaps ) .
Before you career off and have that vital conversation , you need to understand the maths of predicting very rare events .
Let 's take the very concrete example of the HIV test .
The figures here are ballpark , for illustration only .
So : what do we measure about a test ?
Statisticians would say the HIV blood test has a very high " sensitivity " of 0.999 .
That means that if you do have the virus , there is a 99.9 % chance that the blood test will be positive .
Statisticians would also say the test has a high " specificity " of 0.9999 - so if a man is not infected , there is a 99.99 % chance that the test will be negative .
What a smashing blood test .
But if you look at it from the perspective of the person being tested , the maths gets slightly counterintuitive .
Because weirdly , the meaning , the predictive value , of a positive or negative test that an individual gets , is changed in different situations , depending on the background rarity of the event that the test is trying to detect .
The rarer the event in your population , the worse the very same test becomes .
Let 's say the HIV infection rate amongst high risk men in a particular area is 1.5 % .
We use our excellent blood test on 10,000 of these men and we can expect 151 positive blood results overall : 150 will be our truly HIV positive men , who will get true positive blood tests ; and one will be the one false positive we could expect , from having 10,000 HIV negative men being tested with a test that is wrong one time in 10,000 .
So , if you get a positive HIV blood test result , in these circumstances your chances of being truly HIV positive are 150 out of 151 .
It 's a highly predictive test .
But now let 's use the same test where the background HIV infection rate in the population is about one in 10,000 .
If we test 10,000 people , we can expect two positive blood results overall .
One from the person who really is HIV positive ; and then one false positive that we could expect , again , from having 10,000 HIV negative men being tested with a test that is wrong one time in 10,000 .
Suddenly , when the background rate of an event is rare , even our previously brilliant blood test becomes a bit rubbish .
For the two men with a positive HIV blood test result , in this population where one in 10,000 have HIV it 's only 50:50 odds on whether you really are HIV positive .
Now let 's look at violence .
The best predictive tool for psychiatric violence has a " sensitivity " of 0.75 , and a " specificity " of 0.75 .
Accuracy is tougher , predicting an event in humans , with human minds , and changing human lives .
Let 's say 5 % of patients seen by a community mental health team will be involved in a violent event in a year .
Using the same maths as we did for the HIV tests , your " 0.75 " predictive tool would be wrong 86 times out of 100 .
For serious violence , occurring at 1 % a year , with our best " 0.75 " tool , you inaccurately finger your potential perpetrator 97 times out of a hundred .
Will you preventively detain 97 people to prevent three events ?
And for murder , the extremely rare crime in question , occurring at one in 10,000 a year among patients with psychosis ?
The false positive rate is so high that the best test is almost entirely useless .
I 'm just giving you the maths on rare events .
What you do with it is a matter for you .
Human or Machine , Can You See a Difference ?
Can you imagine a world in which you have to establish systems in order to detect if an intelligence is machine created or comes from a real human ?
Scientists and programmers has already been developing such systems .
No , I am not talking about a far future here , I am talking about 2002 .
The first system to prevent machine intelligence from using web sites was developed in 2002 and is known as the CAPTCHA project .
What is today known as Captcha is a method of using a generated random image of letters and numbers and forcing the web user to repeat it before going further .
That was 4 years ago .
Today the machine intelligence is so advanced that almost no matter how complex the generated image is the intelligence figures it out .
A recent study showed a 92 % success rate .
As an owner of an IT company I own a lot of web sites .
A few days ago I found out that one of the members of my Swedish online forum was actually a bot , not a human .
The bot was posting fractions of sentences which other people had posted in their posts in related context which made it look like he was reinforcing statements and it looked very natural .
This was even in the Swedish language .
I remember that almost a year ago I discovered a bot on another online forum and announced that on the discussion thread .
The bot had already done 200 posts on that forum and the other forum users had at that point still not realized that they were discussing with a machine , not a human .
This is only the beginning , think about the future .
As a Sci-Fi writer I have been thinking quite a lot about the future .
Artificial Intelligence are still being developed today but it will only be a time question before we have highly sophisticated robots operating in our society doing various tasks .
And the next step from there are Androids .
For those of you that do n't that term it is " a robot made to resemble a human , usually both in appearance and behavior . "
The first unsophisticated humanoid robots and even androids has already been developed in Japan such as Repliee Q1 and Repliee R1 .
The Repliee R1 is very good at interacting with children , and studies showed that babies react as if she is human .
No , that is not the future - that is today .
Androids will in the future probably be totally illegal and maybe only used by government organizations such as CIA , FBI and the military .
Now to the scary part .
Let 's assume we are 40 years in the future and the technology has continued to advance in the same pace .
Let 's assume illegal organizations are producing illegal androids for specific purposes and you met one on the street .
Would you be able to see if it was a human or machine ?
Probably not .
If the users on my forum can be fooled today by a machine intelligence what do you think in 40 years ?
Or even 20 years ?
What if an illegal organization kidnapped and copied the genetic code of your son and produced an android that was exactly the same , would you be able to see a difference ?
Probably yes , but not easily .
Conclusion :
systems to detect if an intelligence is machine created or comes from a real human will be a major deal in the future , not only on the internet but in the day to day world .
Imagine your son having to do special tests in an employment interview to verify that he is not an android .
It is just like the tests we do today on the internet that verifies that we are not a spam bot but on a much larger scale .
I find that scary .

DENVER , Nov. 28 — Peace is fighting back in Pagosa Springs .
Last week , a couple were threatened with fines of $ 25 a day by their homeowners ’ association unless they removed a four - foot wreath shaped like a peace symbol from the front of their house .
The fines have been dropped , and the three - member board of the association has resigned , according to an e-mail message sent to residents on Monday .
Two board members have disconnected their telephones , apparently to escape the waves of callers asking what the board could have been thinking , residents said .
The third board member , with a working phone , did not return a call for comment .
In its original letter to the couple , Lisa Jensen and Bill Trimarco , the association said some neighbors had found the peace symbol politically “ divisive . ”
Mathematics has always been a brainchild to so many things that have evolved in life , its a under statement that some mathematic calculations lead to amazing combinations in its own .
Well with amazing i do mean that they are amazing combinations used , the Fibonacci series is one of them , but how many such series do exist do we even know about them , here are few series which lead to an amazing amount of curiosity what numbers can do .
I found this through CuriousMath just wondering how many such combinations do exist , your inputs are always welcome , but still have a look at some amazing combinations numbers can perform .

Kevin Drum reports :
Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes has somehow gotten hold of a copy of the no-fly list used by airport authorities to screen for possible terrorists .
So who ’s on the list ?
Gary Smith , John Williams and Robert Johnson are some of those names .
Kroft talked to 12 people with the name Robert Johnson , all of whom are detained almost every time they fly .
The detentions can include strip searches and long delays in their travels .
" Well , Robert Johnson will never get off the list , " says Donna Bucella , who oversaw the creation of the list and has headed up the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center since 2003 .
She regrets the trouble they experience , but chalks it up to the price of security in the post - 9/11 world .
" They ’re going to be inconvenienced every time … because they do have the name of a person who ’s a known or suspected terrorist , " says Bucella .
You know , I ’ll bet if there were some senator named Robert Johnson , the FBI would figure out a way to make this list a little more user - friendly .
Maybe we should try to elect one .
Why you should use Django
Inspired by Guido van Rossum ’s plea to be taught web frameworks here are ( in no particular order ) ten reasons why he — and you — should use Django .
1. Django works — right now
Do n’t be fooled by the fact that Django ’s first release was in July .
It ’s been under heavy use for over two years , and I ’m confident saying it has no show - stopping bugs .
I ’m tired of hearing that that SomeAwesomeFramework™ will be “ great when it ’s finished ” .
Django is finished , now — all the changes we ’re making in the run up to 1.0 involve stabilizing APIs and improving the cleanliness of the internal code .
2. Deployment is a breeze
The web framework world is full of sad tales of deployment woes .
You can even read horror stories about deploying Rails , the leader of the dynamic web framework pack .
Not only is there a well - established way to deploy high - traffic Django sites , but Django sites are very stable .
We do over 15 million hits to a day to about ten sites , and that ’s a single Django installation ( one web server , one database server ) .
3 . Your site wo n’t go down
Django sites survive Slashdottings ( chicagocrime.org ) , Farkings ( ljworld.com ) , and rabid NCAA Basketball fans ( kusports.com ) .
( Funny story about that : a few weeks ago the editor of ljworld .com asked me to look into why we had 3 million more daily hits than usually .
Turns out we ’d been Farked , and I had n’t even noticed . )
4. Django is fast
Every bit of the framework is designed with efficiency in mind .
I ’ve seen benchmarks that peg Django ’s template language at four times faster than Kid and six times as fast as Cheetah .
In fact , it ’s SO fast that we ’ve found that caching compiled templates is actually slower than re-rendering them on every request .
Django ’s ORM is similarly extremely careful to perform as few database lookups as possible , and to always make it obvious when database hits are happening .
And if Django still is n’t fast enough , it ’s stupidly easy to cache performance - intensive bits ( or even the whole site ) .
One of the available cache backends is memcached which drives LiveJournal and Slashdot itself .
5. Django scales
From personal sites running on shared hosting to small band sites to huge databases of public info to social networking sites with over 500,000 users , Django handles it all .
At the top end , you ’re only limited by your hardware budget .
6. Django ’s admin will blow your mind
The most boring part of writing content - heavy websites is developing admin interfaces .
How many times have you written a form validation function ?
Well , Django ’s admin is the most amazing thing to happen to content - driven sites since the invention of the database itself .
Seriously — even if you do n’t want to use Django for some reason you owe it to yourself to check out what a site administration interface should look like .
7 . You do n’t need to go whole - hog
As I said above , Django ’s admin interface will blow your mind .
Luckily , you do n’t need to port your legacy sites to Django just to use the admin interface ; in a few moments you can introspect your database and have a awesome admin interface to your old data .
I know quite a few people who have started major Django projects this way .
8. Django plays well with designers
Programmers have criticized Django ’s template language for not being Pythonic enough .
There ’s a simple explanation for that : the template language is n’t meant for you .
Our new designer Jeff Croft picked up Django ’s template language in about a day , and moved on to getting real work done .
Sure , if you ’re building a site all by yourself the overhead of learning a template language might seem dumb , but when you get bought by Yahoo you ’ll be glad you can hand off the design to someone else so easily .
9. Django comes from the Real World
Every single feature in Django exists because it solves a real world problem .
If you spend any time on django - dev you ’ll see Adrian repeatedly ask “ what real - world problem does this proposal solve ? ”
Django rose out of the insanely tight deadlines inherent to the news industry — our deadlines are mere days , if not hours — and it will let you build huge amazing sites far faster than you ever thought possible .
At work we ’re about to launch the best local TV station site you ’ve ever seen , but what you ’ll miss when you see it is that it was built in just a few weeks .
If the Romans had used Django , they would have built Rome in a day .
10 .
We ’re here to help
I ’m very proud of the fact that Django ’s community is lively and extremely friendly .
Whether it ’s on django - users , django - dev , or the IRC channel , you ’ll find smart people to help you out .
It might seem trite to say it , but I think our community is our biggest asset .

A Nigerian woman has been sentenced to two - and - a - half years in prison for her part in a massive 419 scam .
The case , heard in the Lagos High Court , has been hailed as the first big victory for Nigeria 's Economic and Financial Crime Commission set up to fight just such crimes .
Amaka Anajemba helped extract $ 242 m from Brazilian bank Banco Noroeste .
The email scam claimed to be offering kick - backs on a contract to build an airport in the Nigerian capital Abuja .
Much of the money was later recovered .
She must sell properties in Nigeria , the UK , the US and Switzerland to help pay back the missing money , according to the BBC .
The fraud was discovered when Banco Noroeste was bought by a Spanish bank .
The bank 's international boss was sentenced to a year in prison in Switzerland .
Two other defendants will appear in court in September on related charges .
The EFCC has 200 ongoing cases against 419 scammers .
419 scams are named after the relevant section of the Nigerian criminal code . ®

簡易セットアップ用。暗号化したければsvn+sshで。
Apache : ネット上で共有する場合 ; 柔軟な認証が可能 ; ブラウザでレポジトリを見れる ; ログを残す場合 。
レポジトリは１つか複数か？→場合による １つの場合 : ユーザーは共有だしコードも共有。なのでメンテナンス負荷は減る
( ASF uses a single repository for their entire directory of projects ) .
複数の場合 : 全く異なるアクセスポリシーやデータ形式を適用できる ( 例えば、テキストとバイナリとかね ) .
認証ポリシー svn 1.3 からパスレベルの認証をサポート。 オープンソースが前提なら認証無しにもできる。 信頼感が生まれる。 全部消すなんて無理ってことよ 。
レポジトリを閲覧する道具 何を使うべきか ?

In new research on the Great Pyramids of Giza , a scientist says he has found more to their construction than cut natural limestone .
Some original parts of the massive structures appear to be made of concrete blocks .
If true , historians say , this would be the earliest known application of concrete technology , some 2,500 years before the Romans started using it widely in harbors , amphitheaters and other architecture .
Reporting the results of his study , Michel W. Barsoum , a professor of materials engineering at Drexel University , in Philadelphia , concluded that the use of limestone concrete could explain in part how the Egyptians were able to complete such massive monuments , beginning around 2550 B. C .
They used concrete blocks , he said , on the outer and inner casings and probably on the upper levels , where it would have been difficult to hoist carved stone .
“ The sophistication and endurance of this ancient concrete technology is simply astounding , ” Dr. Barsoum wrote in a report in the December issue of The Journal of the American Ceramic Society .

Red Jr was formed from several storms that merged ( Image : Christopher Go )
Enlarge Image
The gas giant is growing another red spot , which US space agency ( Nasa ) astronomers have nicknamed " Red Jr " .
Both red spots are actually raging storms in Jupiter 's cloud layer , but scientists do n't yet know how they get their characteristic brick colour .
Red Jr is about half the size of the Great Red Spot and almost exactly the same colour , Science@Nasa reports .
The new storm goes by the official name of Oval BA .
It was first observed in 2000 , when three smaller spots collided and merged .
Changing colours
At first , Oval BA remained white - the same colour as the storms that combined to create it .
But over the past few months , it has started to change in appearance .
" The oval was white in November 2005 , it slowly turned brown in December 2005 , and red a few weeks ago , " said Christopher Go , an amateur astronomer from the Philippines who has been observing Red Jr .
Some scientists believe a similar merger to the one that created Red Jr may have created the Great Red Spot , which is twice as wide as our planet and at least 300 years old .
Dr Glenn Orton , an astronomer at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies storms on Jupiter and other giant planets , said : " This is convincing .
We 've been monitoring Jupiter for years to see if Oval BA would turn red - and it finally seems to be happening . "
No one is quite sure why the Great Red Spot is red .
One theory is that the storm dredges material from deep beneath Jupiter 's cloudtops and lifts it to high altitudes .
Here , ultraviolet rays from the Sun turn colour - changing compounds ( or chromophores ) red .
Oval BA may have strengthened enough to do the same , scientists say .
The title of this article is , of course , a reference to the Internet censorship that is rampant in China .
Mark Goldberg pointed me to the press release of “ Project Cleanfeed Canada ” .
Canadian carriers Bell Aliant , Bell Canada , MTS Allstream , Rogers , SaskTel , Shaw , TELUS , and Videotron have all opted in to a blacklist provided by Cybertip.ca , the Canadian tip - line against child exploitation .
Mark is an advocate of putting censorship in place against websites that would be deemed illegal by Canadian Law ( such as those promoting hate speech or sexually exploiting children ) .
I first came across Mark ’s website when he was filing an application requesting the CRTC to authorize Canadian carriers to block internet content .
I morally support blocking hate speech and child porn ( who would n’t ? ) , but the idea of having a national blacklist sends shivers down my spine .
I would always prefer that illegal websites be shutdown rather than putting into power national filters that have the potential to be abused .
I ’m a pessimist , I believe that any form of censorship will eventually be abused despite its good intentions .
Nart Villeneuve has an excellent article that sums up my fear of government sponsored filters :
“ Increasingly , states are adopting practices aimed at regulating and controlling the Internet as it passes through their borders .
Seeking to assert information sovereignty over their cyber–territory , governments are implementing Internet content filtering technology at the national level .
The implementation of national filtering is most often conducted in secrecy and lacks openness , transparency , and accountability .
Policy –makers are seemingly unaware of significant unintended consequences , such as the blocking of content that was never intended to be blocked .
Once a national filtering system is in place , governments may be tempted to use it as a tool of political censorship or as a technological “ quick fix ” to problems that stem from larger social and political issues .
As non–transparent filtering practices meld into forms of censorship the effect on democratic practices and the open character of the Internet are discernible .
States are increasingly using Internet filtering to control the environment of political speech in fundamental opposition to civil liberties , freedom of speech , and free expression .
The consequences of political filtering directly impact democratic practices and can be considered a violation of human rights . ”
Project Cleanfeed Canada is an offshoot of Project Cleanfeed UK .
From the Wikipedia entry on Internet Censorship :
“ United Kingdom set a deadline of the end of 2007 for all ISPs to implement a “ Cleanfeed ” - style network level content blocking platform .
Currently , the only web sites ISPs are expected to block access to are sites the Internet Watch Foundation has identified as containing images of child abuse .
However such a platform is capable of blocking access to any web site added to the list ( at least , to the extent that the implementation is effective ) , making it a simple matter to change this policy in future .
The Home Office has previously indicated that it has considered requiring ISPs to block access to articles on the web deemed to be “ glorifying terrorism ” , within the meaning of the new Terrorism Act 2006 . ”
Cybertip.ca has been in operation for four years and has led to 20 arrests and 1100 websites being shutdown .
From their website :
“ Cybertip.ca content analysts review , prioritize and analyze every report they receive .
After the report has been reviewed , the content analysts verify the report by collecting supporting information using various Internet tools and techniques .
If the web site or other subject matter in question is assessed to contain potentially illegal material , a report is referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency .
Cybertip.ca also gathers critical statistics and information for use by law enforcement and in public policy development .
If the subject matter of the report falls outside of Cybertip .ca ’s mandate or is assessed to be legal , although perhaps offensive in nature , Cybertip.ca provides Internet safety information to the complainant . ”
That ’s fine by me .
From the Internet Watch Foundation / BT Project Cleanfeed website :
“ We believe that everyone is entitled to an abuse free online environment .
Our child abuse image database contains details of websites , which if knowingly accessed by UK consumers could lead to them committing criminal offences under UK law .
By preventing access to that content , BT are protecting their services and their customers . ”
– Peter Robbins , CEO , IWF
If the definition of what is blacklisted is limited to “ websites which if knowingly accessed by customers could lead to them committing criminal offence ” , then I have no issue with it .
What I am afraid of is :
The list of blocked website will remain secret .
There will be no way for a site to find out if they ’re on the list .
There will be no way for a user to find out they ’ve encountered the list .
There wo n’t be watchdogs in place to check what is added to the list .
Sites will be added to the list without a proper investigation .
If the list is limited to websites that have been deemed illegal after proper legal investigation – websites where the operators would be jailed if they were operated within Canadian jurisdiction – then I have no strong argument against this .
My concern is that wo n’t be the case .
From the Wikipedia censorware page :
Frequent subjects of content - control software include web sites that , according to the company providing the control , are alleged to : Include illegal content with reference to the legal domain being served by that company .
Promote , enable , or discuss hacking , software piracy , criminal skills , or other potentially illegal acts .
Include sexually explicit content , such as pornography , erotica , and non-erotic discussions of sexual topics such as sexuality or human reproduction .
Promote , enable , or discuss lifestyles which some might consider immoral , including promiscuity , sexual orientations other than heterosexuality , or other alternative lifestyles or sexual activity outside of marriage .
Contain violence or other forms of graphic or “ extreme ” content .
Promote , enable , or discuss bigotry or hate speech .
Promote , enable , or discuss gambling , recreational drug use , alcohol , or other activities frequently considered to be vice .
Are unlikely to be related to a student ’s studies , an employee ’s job function , or other tasks for which the computer in question may be intended .
Are contrary to the interests of the authority in question , such as web sites promoting organized labor or criticizing a particular company or industry .
Promote or discuss politics , religion , or other topics .
Include social networking opportunities that might expose children to predators .
Blocking MySpace on a national level ?
Maybe I should reconsider my stance . :)
Michael Geist sums up the issue more eloquently than I ever could :
“ [ T ] here is likely wide agreement that Canada must begin to grapple with the Internet challenge of balancing free speech rights with rules that outlaw certain forms of speech that have been judged harmful to our multicultural society .
A policy framework that addresses these competing goals would likely include complaints mechanisms , a presumption that the content is lawful and must be disproved by a high standard of evidence , an opportunity to challenge blocking requests , appropriate judicial oversight , and full transparency about blocking activities .
The job is not the CRTC ’s alone – law enforcement and the judiciary must surely be involved in the process of determining what may constitute unlawful content and the remedies that follow – but the regulator can assist in the process .
Critics are quick to draw parallels to Internet censorship in countries such as China .
However , those countries involve state - based content blocking , with no transparency or legal recourse .
In fact , several democracies – most notably Australia – have established limited blocking rules , while British Telecom , the UK ’s largest ISP , voluntarily blocks child pornography as part of its CleanFeed program .
Even with various legal safeguards , many Canadians would undoubtedly find the blocking of any content distasteful .
Yet to do nothing is to leave in place an equally unpalatable outcome that silences those would speak out against unlawful hate speech for fear of personal harm . ”

I called Mike Walters , who told me my name had been passed to him
by his research team .
I indicated to him that I thought somebody
was probably having a little joke at his expense , and promised him an
email reply .
Here is my reply in its entirety :
To : " Mike Walters ( Search Wizards ) " < v-mikewa@microsoft.com >
From : < esr@thyrsus.com >
I 'd thank you for your offer of employment at Microsoft , except
that it indicates that either you or your research team ( or both )
could n't get a clue if it were pounded into you with baseball bats .
What were you going to do with the rest of your afternoon , offer jobs
to Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds ?
Or were you going to stick to
something easier , like talking Pope Benedict into presiding at a
Satanist orgy ?
If you had bothered to do five seconds of background checking , you
might have discovered that I am the guy who responded to Craig
Mundie 's " Who are you ? " with " I 'm your worst nightmare " , and that I've
in fact been something pretty close to your company 's worst nightmare
since about 1997 .
You 've maybe heard about this " open source " thing ?
You get one guess who wrote most of the theory and propaganda for it
and talked IBM and Wall Street and the Fortune 500 into buying in .
But do n't think I 'm trying to destroy your company .
Oh , no ; I 'd be
just as determined to do in any other proprietary - software monopoly ,
and the community I helped found is well on its way to accomplishing
that goal .
On the day * I * go to work for Microsoft , faint oinking sounds will be
heard from far overhead , the moon will not merely turn blue but
develop polkadots , and hell will freeze over so solid the brimstone
will go superconductive .
But I must thank you for dropping a good joke on my afternoon .
On
that hopefully not too far distant day that I piss on Microsoft's
grave , I sincerely hope none of it will splash on you .
Cordially yours ,
Eric S. Raymond
My wife , upon hearing of this , suggested that if something like
this could happen maybe I have n’t made enough trouble for
Microsoft lately , and I ’m slipping off their radar .
She might have a
point …
UPDATE : For those of you who missed the subtlety ( which was a surprising lot of you ) I was quite polite to this guy on the phone .
FURTHER UPDATE : I had my serious , constructive converstation with Microsoft last year , when a midlevel exec named Steven Walli took me out to dinner at OSCON 2004 and asked , in so many words , “ How can we not be evil ? ”
And I told him — open up your file formats ( including Word and multimedia ) , support open technical standards instead of sabotaging them , license your patents under royalty - free , paperwork - free terms .
I believe Steve Walli went back to his bosses and told them that truth .
He is no longer with Microsoft , and what little he ’ll say about it hints that they canned him for trying to change their culture .
This did n’t surprise me .
Microsoft ’s profit margins require a monopoly lock on the market ; thus , they ’re stuck with being predatory evil bastards .
The moment they stop being predatory evil bastards , their stock price will tank and their options pyramid will crash and it will be all over .
That being the case , negotiation is pointless .
Microsoft is not reformable .
Jeering at offers like this is actually the most constructive thing we can do .
A work of fiction .
A Semantic Web scenario .
A short feature from a business magazine published in 2009 .
Please note that this story was written in 2002 .
It 's hard to believe Google - which is now the world 's largest single online marketplace - came on the scene only a little more than 8 years ago , back in the days when Amazon and Ebay reigned supreme .
So how did Google become the world 's single largest marketplace ?
Well , the short answer is “ the Semantic Web ” ( whatever that is - more in a moment ) .
While Amazon and Ebay continue to have average quarterly profits of $ 1 billion and $ 1.8 billion , respectively , and are successes by any measure , the $ 17 billion per annum Google Marketplace is clearly the most impressive success story of what used to be called , pre-crash , “ The New Economy . ”
Amazon and Ebay both worked as virtual marketplaces : they outsourced as much inventory as possible ( in Ebay 's case , of course , that was all the inventory , but Amazon also kept as little stock on hand as it could ) .
Then , through a variety of methods , each brought together buyers and sellers , taking a cut of every transaction .
For Amazon , that meant selling new items , or allowing thousands of users to sell them used .
For Ebay , it meant bringing together auctioneers and auction buyers .
Once you got everything started , this approach was extremely profitable .
It was fast .
It was managed by phone calls , emails , and database applications .
It worked .
Enter Google .
By 2002 , it was the search engine , and its ad sales were picking up .
At the same time , the concept of the “ Semantic Web , ” which had been around since 1998 or so , was gaining a little traction , and the attention of an increasing circle of people .
So what 's the Semantic Web ?
At its heart , it 's just a way to describe things in a way that a computer can “ understand . ”
Of course , what 's going on is not understanding , but logic , like you learn in high school :
If A is a friend of B , then B is a friend of A. Jim has a friend named Paul .
Therefore , Paul has a friend named Jim .
Jim has a friend named Paul .
Therefore , Paul has a friend named Jim .
Using a markup language called RDF ( an acronym that 's here to stay , so you might as well learn it - it stands for Resource Description Framework ) , you could put logical statements like these on the Internet , “ spiders ” could collect them , and the statements could be searched , analyzed , and processed .
What makes this different than regular search is that the statements can be combined .
So if I find a statement on Jim's web site that says “ Jim is a friend of Paul ” and someone does a search for Paul 's friends , even if Paul 's web site does n't have a mention of Jim on it , we know Jim 's considers himself a friend of Paul .
Other things we might know for sure ?
That Car Seller A is selling Miatas for 10 % less than Car Seller B. That Jan Hammer played keyboards on the Mahavishnu Orchestra 's albums in the 1970s .
That dogs have paws .
That your specific model of computer requires a new motherboard and a faster bus before it can be upgraded to a Pentium 18 .
The Semantic Web is n't about pages and links , it 's about relationships between things - whether one thing is a part of another , or how much a thing costs , or when it happened .
The Semweb was originally supposed to give the web the “ smarts ” it lacked - and much of the early work on it was in things like calendaring and scheduling , and in expressing relationships between people .
By late 2003 , when Google began to seriously experiment with the Semweb ( after two years of experiments at their research labs ) , it was still a slow - growing technology that almost no one understood and very few people used , except for academics with backgrounds in logic , computer science , or artificial intelligence .
The learning curve was as steep as a cliff , and there was n't a great incentive for new coders to climb it and survey the world from their new vantage .
The Semweb , it was promised , would make it much easier to schedule dentist 's appointment , update your computer , check the train schedule , and coordinate shipments of car parts .
It would make searching for things easier .
All great stuff , stuff to make millions of dollars from , perhaps .
But not exactly sexy to the people who write the checks , especially after they 'd been burnt 95 times over by the dot - com bust .
All they saw was the web - the same web that had lined a few pockets and emptied a few million - with the word “ semantic ” in front of it .
. . . . .
Semantics vs. Syntax , Fight at 9
The semantics of something is the meaning of it .
Nebulous stuff , but in the world of AI , the goal has long been getting semantics out of syntax .
See , the trillion dollar question is , when you have a whole lot of stuff arranged syntactically , in a given structure that the computer can chew up , how do you then get meaning out of it ?
How does syntax become semantics ?
Human brains are really good at this , but computers , are dreadful .
They 're whizzes at syntax .
You can tell them anything , if you tell it in a structured way , but they can't make sense of it , they keep deciding that “ The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak ” in English translates to “ The meat is full of stars but the vodka is made of pinking shears ” or suchlike in Russian .
So the guess has always been that you need a whole lot of syntactically stable statements in order to come up with anything interesting .
In fact , you need a whole brain 's worth - millions .
Now , no one has proved this approach works at all , and the # 1 advocate for this approach was a man named Doug Lenat of the CYC corporation , who somehow ended up on President Ashcroft 's post - coup blacklist as a dangerous intellectual and has n't been seen since .
But the basic , overarching idea with the Semweb was - and still is , really - to throw together so much syntax from so many people that there 's a chance to generate meaning out of it all .
As you know , computers still are n't listening to us as well as we'd like , but in the meantime the Semweb technology matured , and all of a sudden centralized databases - and Amazon and Ebay were prime examples of centralized databases with millions of items each - could suddenly be spread out through the entire web .
Everyone could own their little piece of the database , their own part of the puzzle .
It was easy to publish the stuff .
But the problem was that there was no good way to bring it all together .
And it was hard to create RDF files , even for some programmers - so we 're back to that steep learning curve .
That all changed - suprisingly slowly - in late 2004 , when with little fanfare , Google introduced three services , Google Marketplace Search , Google Personal Agent , and Google Verification Manager , and a software product , Google Marketplace Manager .
. . . . .
Google Marketplace Search
Marketplace Search is a search feature built on top of the Google Semantic Search feature , and it 's likely nearly everyone reading will have used it at least once .
You simply enter :
sell : martin guitar
to see a list of people buying Martin - brand acoustic guitars , and
buy : martin guitar
to see a list of sellers .
Google asked for , and remembered , your postal code , and you could use easy sort controls inside the page to organize the resulting list of guitars by price , condition , model number , new / used , and proximity .
The pages drew from Google 's “ classic , ” non-Semantic - Web search tools , long considered the best on the Web , to link to information on Martin models and buyer 's guides , as well as from Google 's Usenet News archive .
Links to sites like Epinions filled in the gaps .
So where did Google Marketplace Search get its information ?
The same way Google got all of its information - by crawling through the entire web and indexing what it found .
Except now it was looking for RDDL files , which pointed to RDF files , which contained logical statements like these :
( Scott Rahin ) lives in Zip Code ( 11231 ) .
( Scott Rahin ) has the email address ( ford@ftrain.com ) .
( Scott Rahin ) has a ( Martin Guitar ) .
[ Scott 's ] ( Martin Guitar ) is a model ( 245 ) .
[ Scott 's ] ( Martin Guitar ) can be seen at ( http://ftrain.com/picture/martin.jpg).
[ Scott 's ] ( Martin Guitar ) costs ( $ 900 ) .
[ Scott 's ] ( Martin Guitar ) is in condition ( Good ) .
[ Scott 's ] ( Martin Guitar ) can be described as “ Well cared for , and played rarely ( sadly ! ) .
Beautiful , mellow sound and a spare set of strings .
I 'll be glad to show it to anyone who wants to stop by , or deliver it anywhere within the NYC area . ”
What 's important to understand is that the things in parentheses and brackets above are not just words , they 're pointers .
( Scott Rahin ) is a pointer to http://ftrain.com/people/Scott.
( Martin Acoustic Guitar ) is a pointer to a URL that in turn refers to a special knowledge database that has other logical statements , like these :
( Martin Guitar ) is an ( Acoustic Guitar ) .
( Acoustic Guitar ) is a ( Guitar ) .
( Guitar ) is an ( Instrument ) .
Which means that if someone searches for guitar , or acoustic guitar , all Martin Guitars can be included in the search .
And that means that Scott can simply say he has a Martin , or a Martin guitar , and the computers figure the rest out for him .
Actually , I just lied to you - it does n't work exactly that way , and there 's a lot of trickery with the pointers , and even the verb phrases are pointers , but rather than spout out a few dozen ugly terms like namespaces , URIs , prefixes , serialization , PURLs , and the like , we 'll skip that part and just focus on the essential fact : everything on the Semantic Web describes something that has a URL .
Or a URI .
Or something like that .
What that really means is that RDF is data about web data - or metadata .
Sometimes RDF describes other RDF .
So do you see how you take all those syntactic statements and hope to build a semantic web , one that can figure things out for itself ?
Combining the statements like that ?
Do you ?
Come on now , really ?
Yeah , well no one does .
So Google connects everyone by spidering RDF and indexing it .
Of course , connecting anonymous buyers and sellers is n't enough .
There needs to be accountability .
Enter the “ Web Accountability and Rating Framework . ”
There were a lot of various frameworks for accountability , but this one was certified , finally , by the World Wide Web Consortium , before the nuclear accident at MIT , and ECMA , and it 's now the standard .
How does it work ?
Well :
On Kara Dobbs 's site , we find this statement :
[ Kara Dobbs ] says ( Scott Rahin ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
On James Drevin 's site , we find this statement :
[ James Drevin ] says ( Scott Rahin ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
And so forth .
Fine - but how do you know how to trust any of these people in the first place ?
Stay with me :
On Citibank 's site :
[ Citibank ] says ( Scott Rahin ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
On Mastercard 's site :
[ Mastercard ] says ( Scott Rahin ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
And inside Google :
[ Google Verification Service ] says ( Scott Rahin ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
and if
[ Citibank ] says ( Kara Dobbs , etc ) is ( Trustworthy ) .
then you start to see how it can all fit together , and you can actually get a pretty good sense of whether someone is the least bit dishonest or not .
Now , this raises a billion problems about accountability and the nature of truth and human behavior and so forth , but we do n't have the requisite 30 trillion pages , so just accept that it works for now .
And that a lot of other stuff in this ilk is coming down the pike , like :
[ The United States Social Security Administration ] says ( Pete Jefferson ) was born in ( 1992 ) .
Which means that Pete Jefferson can download smutty videos and “ adult ” video games from the Internet , since he 's 19 and has a Social Security number .
That 's what the Safe Access for Minors bill says should happen , anyway .
And do n't forget the civil liberty ramifications of statements like these :
[ The Sherriff 's Department of Dallas , Texas ] says ( Martin Chalbarinstik ) is a ( Repeat Sexual Offender ) .
[ The Sherriff 's Department of Dallas , Texas ] says ( Dave Trebuchet ) has ( Bounced Checks ) .
[ The Green Party , USA ] says ( Susan Petershaw ) is a ( Member ) .
Databases are powerful , and as much as they bring together data , they can intrude on privacy , but rather than giving the author permission to become a frothing mess lamenting the total destruction of our civil liberties at the hand of cruel machines , let 's move on .
Anyway , when you think about it , you can see why Google was a natural to put it all together .
Google already searched the entire Web .
Google already had a distributed framework with thousands of independent machines .
Google already looked for the links between pages , the way they fit together , in order to build its index .
Google 's search engine solved equations with millions of variables .
Semantic
Web content , in RDF , was just another search problem , another set of equations .
The major problem was getting the information in the first place .
And figuring out what to do with it .
And making a profit from all that work .
And keeping it updated ....
. . . . .
Google Marketplace Manager
Well , first you need the information .
Asking people to simply throw it on a server seemed like chaos - so enter Google Marketplace Manager , a small piece of software for Windows , Unix , and Macintosh ( this is before Apple bought Spain and renamed it the Different - thinking Capitalist Republic of Information ) .
The Marketplace Manager , or MM , looked like a regular spreadsheet and allowed you to list information about yourself , what you wanted to sell , what you wanted to buy , and so forth .
MM was essentially an “ logical statement editor , ” disguised as a spreadsheet .
People entered their names , addresses , and other relevant information about themselves , then they entered what they were selling , and MM saved RDF - formatted files to the server of their choice - and sent a “ ping ” to Google which told the search engine to update their index .
When it came out , the MM was a little bit magical .
Let 's say you wanted to sell a book .
You entered “ Book ” in the category and MM queried the Open Product Taxonomy , then came back and asked you to identify whether it was a hardcover book , softcover , used , new , collectible , and so forth .
The Open Product Taxonomy is a structured thesaurus , essentially , of product types , and it 's quickly becoming the absolute standard for representing products for sale .
Then you enter an ISBN number from the back of the book , hit return , and the MM automatically fills in the author , copyright , number of pages , and a field for notes - it just queries a server for the RDF , gets it , chews it up , and gives it to you .
If you were a small publishing house , you could list your catalog .
If you had a first edition Grapes of Wrath you could describe it and give it a lowest acceptable price , and it'd appear in Google Auctions .
Most of the smarts in the MM were actually on the server , as Google interpreted what was entered and adapted the spreadsheet around it .
If you entered car , it asked for color .
If you entered wine , it asked for vintage , vineyard , number of bottles .
Then , when someone searched for 1998 Merlot , your bottle was high on the list .
You could also buy advertisements on Google right through the Manager for high - volume or big ticket items , and track how those advertisements were doing ; it all updated and refreshed in a nice table .
You could see the same data on the Web at any time , but the MM was sweet and fast and optimized .
When you bought something , it was listed in your “ purchases ” column , organized by type of purchase - easy to print out for your accountant , nice for your records .
So , as we 've said , Google allowed you to search for buyers and sellers , and then , using a service shamelessly copied from the then - ubiquitous PayPal , handled the transaction for a 1.75 % charge .
Sure , people could send checks or contact one another and avoid the 1.75 % , but for most items that was your best bet - fast and cheap .
1.75 % plus advertising and a global reach , and you can count on millions flowing smoothly through your accounts .
Amazon and Ebay - remember them ?
- doubtless saw the new product and realized they were in a bind .
They would have to “ cannibalize their own business ” in order to go the Google path - give up their databases to the vagaries of the Web .
So , in classic big - company style , they hedged their bets and did nothing .
Despite their inaction , before long all manner of competing services popped up , spidering the same data as Google and offering a cheaper transaction rate .
But Google had the brand and the trust , and the profits .
It took 2 years for over a million individuals to accept and begin using the new , Semweb - based shopping .
During that time , Google had about $ 300 million in volume - for a net of $ 4.5 million on transactions .
But , just as Ebay and Amazon had once compelled consumers to bring their business to the web , the word - of - mouth began to work its magic .
Since it was easy to search for things to buy , and easy to download the MM and get started , the number of people actively looking through Google Marketplace grew to 10 million by 2006 .
. . . . .
Google Personal Agent
Now , search is not enough .
You need service .
You need the computer to help you .
So Google also rolled out the Personal Agent - a small piece of software that , in essence , simply queried Google on a regular basis and sent you email when it found what you were looking for on the Semweb .
Want cheap phone rates ?
Ask the agent .
Want to know when Wholand , the Who - based theme park , opens outside of London ?
Ask the agent .
Or when your wife updates her web - based calendar , or when the price of MSFT goes up three bucks , or when stories about Ghanaian politics hit the wire .
You could even program it to negotiate for you - if it found a first - edition Paterson in good condition for less than $ 2000 , offer $ 500 below the asking price and work up from there .
It 's between you and the seller , anonymously , perhaps even tax - free if you have the right account number , no one takes a cut .
Not using it to buy items began to be considered backwards .
Just as the regular Google search negotiated the logical propositions of the Semweb , the Personal Agent did the same - it just did it every few minutes , and on its own , according to pre-set rules .
. . . . .
Google Verification Service
Finally , Google realized they could grab a cut on the “ Web of Trust ” idea by offering their own verification and rating service , $ 15 a year to answer a questionnaire , have your credit checked , and fill in some bank account information .
But people signed up , because Google was the marketplace ; the Google seal of approval meant more than the government's .
. . . . .
A Jury of Your Peer - to - Peers
Since all the information was already in RDF format , Google 's own strategy came back to bite it .
Free clones of Google Marketplace Manager began to appear , and other search engines began to aggregate without the 1.75 % cut , trying to find other revenue models .
The Peer - to - Peer model , long the favorite of MP3 and OGG traders , came back to include real - time sales data aggregation , spread over hundreds of thousands of volunteer machines - the same model used by Google , but decentralized among individuals .
Amazon and Ebay began automatically including RDF - spidered data on their sites , fitting it right in with existing auctions and items for sale , taking whatever cuts they could find or force out of the situation .
In 2006 , Citibank introduced Drop Box Accounts for $ 100 / month , then $ 30 , then $ 15 , and $ 5 / month for checking account holders .
The Drop Box account is identified by a single number , and can only receive deposits , which can then be transferred into a checking or savings account .
They were even URL - addressable , and hosted using the Finance Transfer Protocol .
Simply point your browser to account://382882-2838292-29-1939 and enter the amount you want to deposit .
There 's no risk in giving out a secure drop box number , and no fee for deposits .
Banks held the account information of depositors in federally supervised escrow accounts .
Suddenly everyone could simply publish their bank account number and sell their goods without any middleman at all .
Feeling the pressure , and concerned , just as the music companies had been ears before , that their lead would slip to the peer - to - peer market , Google dropped its fees to 1 % , allowed MM users to use Drop Box accounts , and began to charge $ 25 a year for the MM software and service for sellers , while still making it free for users .
After a nervous few months , Google found that the majority of users who sold more than 10 items per year - the volume users - were glad to buy a working product with a brand name behind it ; the peer - to - peer networks were considered less trustworthy , and the connection to Google advertising .
Google also realized that they could also offer Drop Box accounts , and tie them to stock and money - market trading accounts , which opened a can of worms that we 'll skip over here .
If you 're interested , you can read The Dragon in the Chicken Coop , by Tom Rawley .
Google 's financials can , of course , be automatically inserted into your MM stock ticker ; right now they 're trading at 25,000 times earnings , heralding news of the “ New New New New Economy . ”
You 'll get no such heralding here ; while they 've pulled it off once , the competition is fierce .
Google was the dream company for a little less than the last decade , but they 're finally slowing down , and it's high time for a new batch of graduate students too itchy to finish their Ph.D. 's to get on the ball .
And I 'm sure they will .
. . . . .
A Semantically Terrifying Future ?
The cultural future of the Semantic Web is a tricky one .
Privacy is a huge concern , but too much privacy is unnerving .
Remember those taxonomies ?
Well , a group of people out of the Cayman Islands came up with a “ ghost taxonomy ” - a thesaurus that seemed to be a listing of interconnected yacht parts for a specific brand of yacht , but in truth the yacht - building company never existed except on paper - it was a front for a money - laundering organization with ties to arms and drug smuggling .
When someone said “ rigging ” they meant high powered automatic rifles .
Sailcloth was cocaine .
And an engine was weapons - grade plutonium .
So , you 're a small African republic in the midst of a revolution with a megalomaniac leader , an expatriate Russian scientist in your employ , and 6 billion in heroin profits in your bank account , and you need to buy some weapons - grade plutonium .
Who does it for you ?
Google Personal Agent , your web - based pal , ostensibly buying a new engine for your yacht , a little pricey for $ 18 million , sure .
But you 're selling aluminum coffeemakers through the Home Products Unlimited ( Barbados ) Ghost Taxonomy - or nearly pure heroin , you might say - so you 'll make up the difference .
Suddenly one of the biggest problems of being a criminal mastermind - finding a seller who wo n't sell you out - is gone .
With so many sellers , you can even bargain .
Selling plutonium is as smooth and easy and anonymous ( now that you can get Free Republic of Christian Ghana Drop Boxes ) as selling that Martin guitar .
Could n't happen ?
Some people say it can , which explains the Mandatory Metadata Review bill on its way through Congress right now , where all RDF must be referenced to a public taxonomy approved by a special review board .
Like the people say , may you live in interesting times .
Which people ?
Look it up on Google .

In response , ya see .

Warning :
This is a rant , so if you are in here for erudition , then you must be looking somewhere else …
I have been mucking around python for sometime ( 2 years to be precise ) and I am almost confident in saying that I am a pretty good python programmer .
I took one look at lisp ( scheme rather ) a couple of years back , and chose python then .
I do not regret that choice .
In the past two years , I ’ve looked at a lot of languages ( including ruby ) and nothing took my fascination as much as python did .
As every C/C++ programmer I am annoyed by the indendation rules .
I know those rules make my code look more readable , infact I indent any of my code like that with a new level for every block .
I did that with C more than 6 years before I was doing that with python .
With python its been more of a landmark - coupon effect with me .
Its like , I know I will spend this 1000 bucks at my nearest landmark , but I just hate it when people give me a landmark - coupon for the same 1000 bucks as prize money .
Its a bit irrational , but thats how I am .
Anyhow , as I said no other language took my fascination , untill I came across Lisp .
Lisp was a mind - blowing piece of computer science .
If you are in CS , and have n’t taken a look at lisp yet , stop reading this right now and go here .
A few months back , I was commisioned to do a project for a lab in bangalore .
After extensive internal discussions with the people involved we finally settled on python .
We had debated about lisp then , and since the lead din’t feel lisp implementations were either not “ free enough ” or not “ mature enough ” , I had to give up , and now , this where the actual rant starts .
Every moment I was running into some thing that python din’t allow me to do in a easy way , I was thinking of “ now , if it were lisp ….. ” .
Every time , my list comprehensions grew to more than one line , and started looking plain ugly I wished I had “ loop ” there .
But these were minor annoyances , I got most of the power of loop with generators + side effects in python for all my needs .
And I went on hacking and completed the project .
The lead was impressed .
However , she also asked me any good reasons where I could have used lisp here .
I had plenty , but nothing impressive enough then .
But , now in retrospect , I realised the biggest need where lisp would have fit in .
True Multi-Methods and a bit of macro-magic .
The project invovled extensibility of classes at runtime , i.e I needed to create dispatch handlers at run-time .
In python I ended up creating my sweet own version of multiple - dispatch , based on string messages and “ function objects ” ( thats what Guido calls closures ) .
I ’m no expert on design patterns , but I guess they have a quirkily named pattern for that too .
Maybe I built lets say 25 % of the functionality of CLOS .
Now , if I had lisp , I could have done with 25 % less code .
Infact , add a bit of macro-magic to what I did , and probably I could have done with 50 % less code .
( and probably , since its 50 % less work for them , I would never have been hired ) .
Now , about the macro-magic I was talking about .
It would have also helped the users of my code .
Since it is a framework , rather than an end product in itself , and hence users are mainly programmers , but from more mathematical and scientific backgrounds , who care less about “ design patterns ” and more about getting “ my experiment over with ” .
Also , it would have helped me save millions of cuts / paste and arduous editing , which would be way better done with a macro .
Many people seem to think that using lisp macro’s are a maintainabilty issue .
The basic thing here to understand is that , as your abstractions get better , your ability to look at the code and understand it just like that decreases , but the benifit there being , working with a code is such a breeze .
So , there is slight maintainability issue there , but thats no different from highly OO code .
The most common complaint you see with anyone doing java is the complexity of the frameworks .
With a million classes , each having a million functions , doing very similar things .
Ruby solves the problem with a compromise of a solution – mixins , but its just a compromise .
Interestingly ruby also solved my previous problem with keeping classes open .
That shows , that I should probably take another look at ruby , but now I am hooked to lisp .
And , now the downside to lisp ?
No , there is nothing wrong with Lisp , the language , its pretty asymptotic to the “ prefect ” line .
My gripe is with the community .
I have a typical newbie problem with python , I can probably find more newbies having the same problem and a google search gives me the solution .
Python is batteries included , Lisp is not .
When I want to handle a http - get in python I simply think of urllib , and in Lisp ?
Its not like there are n’t libraries out there , but just lots of them , and not all are really well maintained .
and probably would n’t work on every implementation .
And c.l.l is one of the easiest places to get labelled a “ troll ” .
And in fact , I have a hypothesis why that happens .
The problem with complete newbies is that they start from a C/ C++ background , and come to lisp .
And then they ask really really stupid questions .
( even I had some of those , but just that I was smart enough to ask it too google ) .
And c.l.l has one of the highest density of smart people around .
They might be small in number , but they are possibily one of the smartest groups online , and smart people ca n’t stand stupid questions , whereas newbies ca n’t do without them .
The “ be good to the noob ” mindset is comming more often these days into c.l.l , but it needs to improve a lot .
And , then there is the classic chicken and egg peer issue .
There are n’t that many lisp programmers around and I really can’t work on lisp , except for my own stuff .
Its easier to find python programmers , heck even ruby programmers seem to be more in number than lispers .
So , if I do end up writing lisp code , Its hard for me to get it peer reviewed , and even worse get a team member to work on with it .
Hmm , thats with the rant I guess , till later ..

Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain
The first of the near - simultaneous blasts went off at about 1830 local time ( 1300 GMT ) , during the rush hour in the suburbs on the Western Railway .
Correspondents spoke of scenes of pandemonium , with people jumping from trains and bodies flung onto tracks .
There have been a number of bomb attacks in Mumbai in recent years .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm and described the incidents as a " shocking and cowardly attempt to spread a feeling of hatred " .
Pakistani leaders also condemned the blasts as a " despicable act of terrorism " .
Police said the co-ordinated blasts took place at Matunga , Khar , Mahim , Jogeshwari , Borivali and Bhayandar , with most on moving trains and two at stations .
Local reports said the bombs appeared to have targeted first - class compartments , as commuters were returning home from the city 's financial district .
A shopkeeper near one explosion said it was so powerful they thought they had been hit by lightning .
Television images show dazed and bloodied commuters being carried by fellow passengers to waiting ambulances , as rescue workers clambered through wreckage to reach victims .
The force of the blasts ripped doors and windows off carriages , and scattered luggage .
Clothes and shoes were strewn along the tracks .
An eyewitness at Mahim told the BBC some of those who had jumped from the train were run over by another train coming in the opposite direction .
Hospitals across Mumbai have been swamped with casualties .
A medical student at a hospital in Parel , which has received many of the wounded , told the BBC News website the " floors are filled with bloodstains " .
" There were so many [ injured people ] , I could n't really count , " Sunny Jain said .
Correspondents say the confusion in the city has been made worse by the collapse of mobile phone networks , and long queues have formed for the payphones still working .
Repeated target
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks , which are the worst in the city for more than a decade .
MUMBAI FACTS
Changed named to Mumbai in late 1990s Population : 17 million HQ to many big Indian companies and foreign multinationals Home of the Indian film industry , Bollywood Thousands arrive monthly from rural areas , with many living in slums Property prices are among the most expensive in the world
At least 250 people died in serial bomb blasts in the city in 1993
India looks for Mumbai clues Railway lifeline
Home Minister Shivraj Patil told reporters authorities had " some " information an attack was coming , " but place and time was not known " .
Analysts say Mumbai has been a repeated target because it is a financial hub and a centre for the underworld .
More than 250 people died in a string of blasts in the city in 1993 .
Correspondents say Tuesday 's bombers could hardly have struck a target with greater impact - both practical and psychological .
The city 's suburban train system is one of the busiest in the world , carrying more than six million commuters a day .
The blasts came hours after suspected Islamic extremists killed seven people in grenade attacks in the summer capital of Kashmir , Srinagar .
Scientists using NASA data are studying a newly recognized type of cosmic explosion called a hybrid gamma -ray burst .
As with other gamma-ray bursts , this hybrid blast is likely signaling the birth of a new black hole .
It is unclear , however , what kind of object or objects exploded or merged to create the new black hole .
The hybrid burst exhibits properties of the two known classes of gamma-ray bursts yet possesses features that remain unexplained .
NASA 's Swift first discovered the burst on June 14 .
Since the Swift finding , more than a dozen telescopes , including the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground - based observatories , have studied the burst .
" We have lots of data on this event , have dedicated lots of observation time , and we just can't figure out what exploded , " said Neil Gehrels of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , lead author on one of four reports appearing in this week 's edition of the journal Nature .
" All the data seem to point to a new but perhaps not so uncommon kind of cosmic explosion . "
Gamma -ray bursts represent the most powerful known explosions in the universe .
Yet they are random and fleeting , never appearing twice .
Scientists have only recently begun to understand their nature .
Such bursts typically fall into one of two categories , long or short .
The long bursts last more than two seconds and appear to be from the core collapse of massive stars forming a black hole .
Most of these bursts come from the edge of the visible universe .
The short bursts , which are under two seconds and often last just a few milliseconds , appear to be the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole , which subsequently creates a new or bigger black hole .

The hybrid burst , called GRB 060614 , after the date it was detected , originated from within a galaxy 1.6 billion light years away in the southern constellation Indus .
The burst lasted for 102 seconds , placing it soundly in long - burst territory .
But the burst lacked the hallmark of a supernova , or star explosion , commonly seen shortly after long bursts .
Also , the burst 's host galaxy has a low star - formation rate with few massive stars that could produce supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts .
" This was close enough to detect a supernova if it existed , " said Avishay Gal - Yam of Caltech , Pasadena , Calif. , lead author on another Nature report .
" Even Hubble did n't see anything . "
Certain properties of the burst concerning its brightness and the arrival time of photons of various energies , called the lag - luminosity relationship , suggest that burst behaved more like a short burst ( from a merger ) than a long burst .
Yet no theoretical model of mergers can support a sustained release of gamma-ray energy for 102 seconds .
" This is brand new territory ; we have no theories to guide us , " said Gehrels .
The burst is perhaps not unprecedented .
Archived data from the Compton Gamma - Ray Observatory in the 1990s possibly reveal other hybrid " long - short " bursts , but no follow - up observations are available to confirm this .
Johan Fynbo of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen , also lead author on a Nature report , suggests that a burst from May of this year was also long , but had no associated supernova .
Scientists remain divided on whether this was a long - short burst from a merger or a long burst from a star explosion with no supernova .
Most conclude , however , that some new process must be at play -- either the model of mergers creating second - long bursts needs a major overhaul , or the progenitor star from an explosion is intrinsically different from the kind that make supernovae .
" We siphoned out all the information we could from GRB 060614 , " said Massimo Della Valle of the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri in Firenze , Italy , another lead author on a Nature report .
" All we can do now is wait for the next nearby hybrid burst . "

" Iron Chancellor " Otto von Bismarck of Germany
Summer 1878 : With the end of the two - year Russo - Turkish War , the countries of Europe gathered at the Congress of Berlin to discuss and resolve outstanding issues from the conflict .
This conference culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Berlin , which was to take place on June 22 .
It was not too unusual a meeting ; however , there was one very specific special concern .
Everyone present was aware that at the Congress there was a potential security threat , one no one had very much chance of being able to stop .
This was a man by the name of Henri de Blowitz .
For most of those at the Berlin conference , he would be harmless and amusing at worst .
He was just a reporter , and one for a respected British newspaper at that .
What sort of damage could he possibly do ?
However , for German national leader ( and “ Iron Chancellor ” ) Otto von Bismarck , Blowitz ’s undetected presence almost certainly meant major trouble .
There were some things he did n’t want exposed in the way that de Blowitz was notorious for doing .
De Blowitz⁠ — a Bohemian , and later a naturalized French citizen⁠ — was not first a spy , but a journalist .
He had , however , an “ uncontrollable desire to get to the bottom of sensational reports ” and get them to press ahead of everyone else .
To ensure this , he developed very clever methods of eavesdropping and otherwise gaining access to information .
The chief Paris correspondent for the Times of London since 1873 , de Blowitz was already widely notorious for having exposed an 1875 German plan to attack France and for uncovering an internal conspiracy against the latter in 1877 .
He considered it a responsibility he had to his profession .
Bismarck was all too aware of de Blowitz⁠ — more importantly , of the reporter ’s interest in getting to the Treaty and giving it to the entire world to see .
Already he had somehow managed to report day after day of the Congress of Berlin to the Times⁠ — and in astonishing detail .
This was disturbing to Bismarck since secretly he wished to dramatically redraw certain European borders , and could not afford to see his reputation compromised .
Which , if de Blowitz were able to leak the Treaty , would surely be what happened ⁠ — not so much because of what the Treaty contained , but due to Bismarck ’s perceived incompetence at dealing with the audacious journalist .
It was looking more and more likely , however , that this would be exactly what was going to occur .
Although Bismarck had called upon Wilhelm Stieber , his esteemed and trusted director of intelligence , there had been no success whatsoever in finding any trace of de Blowitz .
Nor had anyone come across any potential tools or accomplices de Blowitz could be using .
It was a maddening enigma .
Without the slightest idea of how to adjust the situation in order to keep de Blowitz out , and with time an understandable restriction , the treaty ’s signing went ahead as planned .
Meanwhile , de Blowitz outdid himself .
Not only was the entire text of the Treaty published in the Times , but it was virtually instantaneous .
The document had barely even been signed by the time it appeared in the press .
How was it all done ?
This was not discovered until much later , when it was revealed that the reporter did have a contact inside the conference after all .
De Blowitz had been able to ensure that this man had been associated with the Congress before it even began .
But there was a problem with this theory alone : these two men had never been known to interact .
There also was no exchange of information via mail or telegraph to be seen .
How had the two men communicated ?
As it turns out , there was an intricate plan behind it .
Every day during the Congress , de Blowitz and his inside - man would eat the at the same Berlin restaurant , at roughly the same time but independently .
Having entered , each of the two men would hang his hat by the entrance .
The two hats were virtually indistinguishable ; as de Blowitz left , he would simply pick up the one that the other man had brought in .
Messages and details for the reporter were placed in the hatband every day .
This daily hat - swapping continued daily through the time the men were in Berlin .
So careful and subtle was de Blowitz about it all that the Congress concluded without Stiebler having the tiniest clue as to how he had managed to do it .
Bismarck was undoubtedly annoyed if not downright infuriated .
Meanwhile , this accomplishment helped secure de Blowitz a place among the most celebrated journalists of the nineteenth century .
NET profits exceeding $ 8 billion last year , and $ 3 billion in the latest quarter alone , are not usually an indicator of a firm in serious trouble .
Yet things are going from bad to worse at Pfizer , the world 's biggest drugs company .
In July it abruptly fired its widely respected chief executive , Hank McKinnell , after the board concluded that the firm needed the sort of reviving medicine that only a new leader could administer .
One bitter pill announced last week was a cut of one - fifth , or 2,000 jobs , in Pfizer 's American sales force , the industry 's largest .
That much was welcomed by the stock market , as a sign that the firm was on the mend .
Alas , such a positive prognosis was to prove short - lived .
On Saturday 2nd December Pfizer decided to end clinical trials of torcetrapib , a drug that promotes the creation of the good variety of cholesterol , known as HDL .
Initial results had shown that the drug was associated with an unacceptably high rate of death among users .
Only two days earlier Pfizer 's research chief , John LaMattina , had described the drug as “ the most important new development in cardiovascular medicine in years . ”
On Monday investors , who had hoped that torcetrapib would be a commercial blockbuster , knocked more than $ 25 billion off Pfizer 's stockmarket capitalisation , reducing the firm 's value by one - eighth .
Like other big drug companies , Pfizer has been struggling hard to stop its product pipeline running dry .
It can ill afford to lose such a promising prospect as torcetrapib , which could have helped to offset the losses of revenue that Pfizer is almost bound to suffer when some of its most lucrative drugs lose their patent protection in the years to come , and users switch to cheaper generic alternatives .
Between 2004 and 2007 Pfizer is due to lose patent protection for drugs with combined annual revenues , at their peak , of $ 14 billion .
Sanford Bernstein , an independent research firm , forecasts that Pfizer 's revenues will drop from over $ 47 billion this year to under $ 42 billion in 2008 .

Health campaigners had criticised Pfizer for testing torcetrapib by bundling it together with Lipitor , the firm 's highly successful drug for lowering bad cholesterol .
This bundling was viewed as a none too subtle attempt , in effect , to extend patent protection for Lipitor that is due to end in 2010 .
The 50 m Americans believed to have low levels of good cholesterol , and the far larger numbers in the rest of the world , must hope now that alternative drugs being tested by Roche and Merck fare better than torcetrapib did .
Alas , neither product is due to be ready for the market within the timeframe originally set for Pfizer 's drug .
Even so , their existence is a salutary message to those who complain that the big drug firms focus too much on developing similar , “ me too ” , drugs .
If the original drug does not work , the “ me too ” may be all a patient has got .
The failure of torcetrapib is also a reminder that drug development is an extremely high cost , high - risk activity , and that the most promising new drugs can go wrong even at a late stage .
In 2004 Pfizer pledged to spend $ 800 m getting torcetrapib to market , an investment that may now be worthless .
And such failures are hardly unusual .
In the heart disease area , recent disappointing examples include AstraZeneca 's blood - thinner , Exanta , and Bristol - Myers Squibb 's blood - pressure - reducing drug , Vanlev .
Merck is caught up in a costly legal battle following the withdrawal of its pain - killer , Vioxx , in 2004 .
Side - effects were discovered after Vioxx had gone to market .
That failure cost Merck 's then - boss , Raymond Gilmartin , his job .
This high failure rate explains why drug firms need to earn huge profits , for a while , on those drugs that do reach the market successfully .
It explains why anyone who wants the drugs industry to be as innovative as possible ―which is all of us , surely ?
―should oppose moves to impose limits on the pricing of new drugs , an idea now being actively considered in Washington , DC , by politicians who seem more desperate to cut the cost of health care than to improve its quality .
Currently America does not impose controls on the price of new drugs , in sharp contrast to Europe .
It is surely no coincidence that most of the exciting innovations in drugs nowadays take place in America , not in Europe .
Torcetrapib failed , but at least Pfizer thought its development was a risk worth taking .
Under a system of price controls , Pfizer might not even have got that far .

It is the earliest known example of gliding flight by mammals , and the scientists say it shows that mammals experimented with aerial life about the same time birds first took to the skies , perhaps even earlier .
From an analysis of the fossil , the researchers concluded that this gliding mammal was unrelated to the modern flying squirrel and unlike any other animal in the Mesozoic , the period best known for dinosaurs living in the company of small and unprepossessing mammals .
They announced today that the species qualified as a member of an entirely new order of mammals .
Richard L. Cifelli , a paleontologist at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in Norman who reviewed the findings for publication , said this “ wholly unexpected diversity of something adapted for gliding at this early time is absolutely astonishing . ”
Until a couple of years ago , Dr. Cifelli said , most scientists held the view that such early mammals were simple shrew - like creatures that cowered in the shadows of the dominant dinosaurs , and now “ this adds a new dimension to our knowledge of early mammals . ”
The Justice Department placed new restraints on federal prosecutors conducting corporate investigations yesterday , easing tactics adopted in the wake of the Enron collapse .
The changes were outlined in a memorandum written by Paul J. McNulty , the deputy attorney general .
Under the revisions , federal prosecutors will no longer have blanket authority to ask routinely that a company under investigation waive the confidentiality of its legal communications or risk being indicted .
Instead , they will need written approval for waivers from the deputy attorney general , and can make such requests only rarely .
The new guidelines will help companies defend themselves by “ making it easier for corporations to say no , and not having to worry about that decision being held against them , ” said Andrew Weissmann , who headed the Justice Department ’s Enron task force and is now in private practice .
Another substantial change introduced yesterday prohibits prosecutors from considering , when weighing whether to seek the indictment of a company , whether it is paying the legal fees of an employee caught up in the inquiry .
Plan 9 is an operating system designed by the same people who created the original UNIX .
Its development began in the late 1980 ’s and it was a research project intended to address a variety of system scalability issues that the UNIX and LINUX kernels do n’t do particularly well , namely , distributed computing , distributed name spaces , and distributed file systems .
Plan 9 is open source and its current and fourth major release was in 2002 .
It is
available as an install or LiveCD and it can be downloaded here .
Note :
This is an entry to our Alternative OS Contest .
Plan 9 does not have a lot of flashy demos and is not intended for home users .
It is not intended for use by novices or as a starter operating system .
Instead , it was intended as a platform for trying out new algorithms , new methodologies , and new technologies and it does these very well .
Its development tools and documentation assume a fair amount of familiarity with UNIX fundamentals .
Similarities to and differences from UNIX Plan 9 is similar to UNIX in that is has a kernel , a command shell , and various C compilers .
It also has man pages and runs standard UNIX
applications like awk , emacs , cp , ls , and others listed here .
It is different from UNIX in that the people who wrote it had 20 years of kernel and user experience to re-think and redesign the entire operating system .
One major difference from UNIX and most other operating systems is that all major applications understand 9P , the underlying , distributed file system protocol .
And because everything under Plan 9 is part of the file system , and the file system is distributed , everything under Plan 9 is distributed , and easily accessible as a file object .
Instead of the X11 window management system , Plan 9 has Rio .
Rio is small , intuitive , and easy to program .
A Plan 9 contributor , Geoff Collyer , wrote a graphics front end for the Reversi game in 469 lines of C code .
That ’s impressive .
Because Rio sits on top of 9P , Rio itself is a distributed windowing system .
UNIX ’s name server , BIND , has been replaced by ndb , which is easy to configure , much more secure , and is the partial basis for Plan 9 ’s powerful ,
distributed name space .
Plan 9 does not use UNIX sockets for inter-process and inter-computer communications .
Instead , all communications are done through 9P , the distributed file system paradigm .
Protocol stacks and network cards are implemented as file system objects .
Ethernet packet types are simply subdirectories .
Plan 9 does have an extremely robust implementation of TCP / IP including IPV6 .
The abstraction of network communications separates ordinary programs from the gory details of network connection specifics .
New protocols and transport media can be added or changed with virtually no impact on basic applications .
How is Plan 9 Better ?
It was designed as a faster , cleaner , more - lightweight multi- processor operating system with better security in all aspects of operation .
It uses
lightweight processes that were designed for fine - grained resource control across forks .
The thread library uses no kernel support and this makes it very
quick .
Plan 9 ’s system libraries were built with multi-processing and Unicode character support from day 1 .
In fact , UTF - 8 was invented for Plan 9 .
These
libraries , in conjunction with a new generation of high performance Plan 9 compilers , make application development very fast and very reliable .
The Plan 9 security model is quite different from other mainstream operating systems .
It has no root , administrator , or super user .
Instead , local host owners have privileges over their own machines and can join various network groups that extend more privileges and access to resources such as printers or the CPU .
Authentication is done using the Secstore client application .
The Secstore server exchanges encrypted passwords or hardware passkeys , and stores sensitive information in memory .
Distributing resources is especially easy .
Want to use someone else ’s sound card ?
Simply import their / dev/audio .
Remember that everything in Plan 9 is a file system object , including multimedia devices .
Want to debug a process running on someone else ’s machine ?
Simply import its / proc file .
Because all distributed resources have been rewritten for simplicity and efficiency , network administrators love it for its ease of use .
Developers love Plan 9 because its libraries are elegant and the compilers are clean and fast .
How is Plan 9 worse ?
As with other innovative operating systems , Plan 9 suffers from a lack of commercial support , a lack of device driver support , and a lack of mainstream applications .
When this article was written Plan 9 did not have a web browser , it does not have support for VMWare virtualization ( but does for Xen ) , it did not have accelerated video card support other than GForce and some Radeons , it supports only a few sound cards beyond AC97 and Soundblaster .
It
did not have office productivity software .
And it did not support Windows compatibility through Wine .
Why use Plan 9 ?
Plan 9 offers only a few advantages to single workstation users running in isolation .
Its advantages grow rapidly as the number of networked Plan 9 workstations increase .
If you are developing a large distributed computing application , using Plan 9 makes a lot of sense .
If , for instance , you are performing large - scale scientific computing that needs to run across a large number of computers you are faced with a variety of difficult challenges .
A particular problem in large node computing is that the failure of a single node can bring your whole computing cluster to a halt .
This problem is
increasingly likely as the number of processors increase .
Consider that a computer node with a mean time between failure of 10,000 hours ( or about 1.15
years ) , when used in a cluster of 10,000 nodes will fail on average of once an hour .
In other words , your large , expensive super - computer will crash once an hour .
Plan 9 provides the basis for writing processes that can be mirrored or replicated in more efficient ways and can become fault tolerant .
Without
increased fault tolerance , large scale computing just does n’t scale well .
Taking the Plan 9 test drive I downloaded the Plan9 installation ISO , burned the Install / LiveCD and tried it on five different computers with varying degrees of success .
The supported hardware is somewhat limited so you should check the Supported
PC hardware list to avoid the frustration of a failed install with cryptic error messages .
After aborted installations on my home BH6 , K7S5A , and Proliant systems I successfully booted the LiveCD on a Dell SC400 .
The default window size is 640*480 which is too small to get much done , but this is easily changed with the aux / vga command .
By default you get a nice system load monitor , a date and time window , an rc shell window , and an acme window for integrated editing and executing .
Next I decided to install Plan 9 on an ancient IBM 390X Thinkpad laptop .
The install script took me through several dozen input steps
most of which had defaults , which I accepted .
The steps are described here .
The only tricky part was deleting the existing NTFS file system and creating a new Plan 9 file system .
The only frustrating part of the install was copying the distribution files from the install CD to the new file system .
This took about 30 minutes .
After installation the boot time was an impressive 12 seconds .
Not bad on a 400 MHz laptop .
Unfortunately the internal NeoMagic VGA was not supported and I could n’t use the Rio window manager .
I proceeded using the command line interpreter , rc .
Here ’s how I created an account for myself : term % con / srv/fscons prompt : uname andrew andrew prompt : uname sys +andew I rebooted using reboot : term % reboot and logged in as andrew with permission to write to the /tmp folder .
This permission is not given by default .
Next I changed to the /tmp
directory : term % cd /tmp and used the ed editor to enter in a hello world program in the 8C C dialect : term % ed i # include # include void main ( void ) { print ( " hello world \
" ) ; exits ( 0 ) ; } w test.c q I compiled the C program with the 8C compiler : term % 8 c test .c
And linked it into an executable with the 8L linker : term % 8l test .8
Then I ran my new executable : term % 8.out hello world
Not exactly rocket science but it worked out of the box .
What ’s happening with Plan 9 now ?
Although the original Bell Labs department that created Plan 9 was disbanded in October 2005 , commercial support continues in the form of
Vita Nuova ’s implementation of Inferno ( PDF ) .
Development and non-commercial support can be found on the Plan 9 user group list .
Development of Plan 9 still continues but at a slower pace .
Where did the Plan 9 name come from ?
The name was taken from the infamous sci- fi horror movie by Ed Wood , Plan 9 From Outer Space .
Some people call it the worst movie ever made .
Other people say it ’s so bad it ’s good .
The Ed Wood movie
by Tim Burton , on the other hand is a great movie and gives a great historic account of Ed Wood ’s low budget movie making .
Here ’s the actual Plan 9 quote : RULER : “ What plan will you follow now ? ” EROS : “ Plan 9 .
It ’s been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures .
Their soul is too controlled . ”
RULER : “ Plan 9 …
Ah yes .
Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead .
Long - distance electrodes shot into the pinion pituitary glands of recent dead . ”
Plan 9 / BeOS Factoid
An older version of Plan 9 runs on the original BeOS BeBox hardware .

With the entry of Avigdor Lieberman into the government as deputy minister for “ strategic threats ”  essentially in charge of preparing for war with Iran 
Israel makes a qualitative step toward a regime that increasingly resembles , in all its essentials , a rogue state , and , I might add , potentially a very dangerous one .
Lieberman ’s views are notoriously racist , and his rhetoric is invariably violent .
He called for the execution of Israeli Arab members of the Knesset who met with Hamas or did n’t celebrate Israel ’s Independence Day .
His party , Yisrael Beytenu ( “ Israel is our Home ” ) , accuses Israeli Arabs of “ dual loyalty ” on account of their ethnicity , and advocates the complete separation of the Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine  in effect , forced transfer .
Lieberman and his followers vehemently oppose the peace process , support the militant settlement movement , and are proud partisans of ethnic cleansing .
In 2002 , Lieberman averred that he would n’t flinch at ordering the IDF into the occupied territories on the West Bank for 48 hours , an operation designed to “ Destroy the foundation of all the [ Palestinian ] authority ’s military infrastructure not leave one stone on another .
Destroy everything . ”
Civilian targets included : that same year he also argued the Israeli air force should bomb all Palestinian commercial centers , including banks and even gas stations .
Lieberman ’s portfolio as minister in charge of strategic threats allowed the editors of Ha’aretz to quip “ Lieberman is a strategic threat ! ”
Here , after all , is a man who has threatened to bomb Tehran , the Aswan Dam , and Beirut .
His entry into the government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , in coalition with Kadima and Labor , marks an ominous shift in the stance of the Jewish state .
As Ha’aretz put it :
“ The choice of the most unrestrained and irresponsible man around for this job constitutes a strategic threat in its own right .
Lieberman ’s lack of restraint and his unbridled tongue , comparable only to those of Iran ’s president , are liable to bring disaster down upon the entire region . ”
Up until this point , the stance of the government has always been set forth in the context of the American plan for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state , the so - called road map , which includes a freeze on Israeli settlements and the return of some land claimed by the settlers to the Palestinians .
No more .
With the inclusion of Lieberman in the governing coalition  and in such a key post  the Israelis are signaling that they ’ve had enough of being dictated to by the Americans .
This also dramatizes a sea-change in Israeli politics : ideas that were generally considered out of the mainstream  and out of the question , as far as actual implementation  are now up for consideration .
Yet the line that separated Lieberman , the Jewish equivalent of David Duke , from the Israeli “ mainstream ” has been increasingly hard to discern for quite some time .
As Arthur Neslen put it in the Guardian recently :
“ The most worrying thing about Lieberman is not that his ideas exist on a plane outside Israel ’s political continuum but that , in many ways , they are close to its dead center .
The proposal to transfer ‘ the triangle , ’ an area around Um al - Fahm where 250,000 Palestinian citizens of Israel currently live , was first brought into the press spotlight at the end of 2000 at Israel ’s most prestigious annual policy - making forum , the Herzliya conference .
“ The then prime minister Ariel Sharon publicly floated the idea again in February 2004 .
Opposition from Washington to a de facto violation of international law reportedly took the plan out of the headlines , but it remained in the comment pages .
“ In December 2005 , Uzi Arad , a former Mossad director , government foreign policy adviser and current head of the Institute for Policy and Strategy , which organizes the Herzliya conference , resurrected the idea in an article for [ The ] New Republic . ”
I have covered the growing influence of Israeli extremism for years , and worried over the rise of what seems , at first , a hopeless oxymoron : Jewish fascism .
That an ideology that has proved so harmful  indeed , near fatal  to the Jewish people should gain a foothold in the Jewish state seems too bizarre even for a post - 9/11 reality that increasingly resembles Bizarro World .
Yet here we are , confronted with the specter of Avigdor Lieberman , the would - be Hitler , currently the second most popular politician in the running for prime minister , right behind Benjamin Netanyahu .
The Jerusalem Post reports Lieberman originally pushed for the internal security post , but this was vetoed by Israel ’s Attorney General , who told Olmert that Lieberman must be kept entirely out of the realm of law enforcement .
The Russian immigrant , a former bouncer in a bar , is being investigated for his ties to Russian underworld figures : money funneled into his political activities from abroad apparently came from some pretty dubious sources .
That a gangster of Lieberman ’s ilk is now a serious contender for the post of prime minister and his fascist party is rising in popularity are measures of how the Israeli settler colony , originally designed along left - wing Zionist - utopian lines , has hardened into a national socialist Sparta .
Lieberman ’s prominent position in the Israeli government raises some new considerations when contemplating the future of the long - standing “ special relationship ” between the U.S. and Israel  and at least one very disturbing possibility .
To begin with , if Lieberman ’s views now represent those of his government , at least when it comes to matters related to his portfolio , then it seems clear Tel Aviv is bent on war with Iran .
The Europeans are already reacting with distaste to the prospect of having to deal with him : before meeting with him , Javier Solana , the EU negotiator , declared he disagreed with Lieberman about “ everything . ”
One presumes the U.S. State Department holds similar views , but others in the Bush administration might prove more tolerant of Lieberman and even sympathetic .
In any case , the War Party in the U.S. is likely to find him very useful : Lieberman ’s fiery rhetoric is sure to set off sparks in a very volatile region of the world , one that is just waiting to explode .
Secondly , what does Lieberman ’s ascent tell us about the future of Lebanon and the prospects for another Israeli invasion ?
The minister in charge of strategic threats will not be restricted to just making threats , but will be at least partially empowered to carry them out .
If I were a resident of Beirut , I would start packing .
Finally , it must be remembered that Israel is a member of the nuclear club , with at least 400 nukes and perhaps more at its disposal .
The chilling question is this : do we really want to see Israel ’s nukes fall into the hands of a madman like Lieberman ?
The image of the “ mad mullahs ” of Tehran brandishing a nuclear scimitar is routinely conjured to frighten Westerners into supporting military action against Iran , and there is some legitimacy to this fear , although not nearly as much as the War Party would have us believe .
After all , Iran does n’t have nukes , yet : Israel , however , does have them , and we have to wonder what use Prime Minister Lieberman will make of them .
Not that I am predicting Lieberman will achieve that office  although I would n’t rule it out , either .
The point I ’m making is that Israel is moving in a new and very disturbing direction , one that requires us to take a fresh look at U.S. - Israeli relations and reevaluate our level of financial and political support .
If the Israeli government is going extremist , the moral and strategic implications of our continued assistance are grave : will we be complicit as Israel “ transfers ” hundreds of thousands of Arabs , many of them Israeli citizens ?
As hard - right ideologues embark on a campaign of aggression aimed at creating a “ Greater Israel , ” will U.S. tax dollars continue to fuel the Israeli war machine ?
The U.S. has made no comment on Lieberman ’s elevation .
How long we can keep up our embarrassed silence is going to be the measure of the Israel lobby ’s strength .
Their power , once without serious challenge , is waning .
As the ongoing investigation into spying on behalf of Israel by AIPAC uncovers the shocking extent to which our “ ally ” has penetrated our security and probed our deepest secrets , the Israel lobby is facing a major crisis .
They are n’t just facing a legal challenge , but also an intellectual one from professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , of the University of Chicago and Harvard respectively , whose now famous study of “ The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy ” is proving almost too much for them to handle .
However , what ’s really undermining the formerly impregnable position of “ the Lobby , ” as Mearsheimer and Walt call it , is the sudden outbreak of honesty , and a growing refusal on the part of many in the intellectual community to kowtow to threats and smears .
This has caught the Lobby off guard , and now they are confronted with the horribly unattractive figure of Lieberman , who makes Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  often likened to Hitler by Western commentators  seem relatively reasonable .
What a public relations headache !
Oh , but do n’t worry : they ’ll think of something .
You ca n’t prettify a man like that , so the strategy will be to downplay Lieberman ’s importance .
Yet his entry into the government is quite significant , for Israel and for the world , in that it marks the end of the honeymoon era in relations between Israel and the West , particularly the United States .
Israel and its Western amen corner have always insisted that the Jewish state is part of the West , yet the rise of Lieberman tells us something quite different .
Lieberman ’s appeal is directed at the large Russian immigrant population : these people are poor , resentful of their low status , and imbued with the same receptivity to authoritarianism that has long afflicted their Russian motherland .
The rapid rise of Lieberman ’s political fortunes means that Israel is turning away from the West and asserting its Asiatic identity .
It is no more a Western democracy than , say , Turkey or Lebanon  and , if Lieberman rises all the way to the top , considerably less so .
WASHINGTON - HOUSEHOLDS across the land are infested with vampires .
That 's what energy experts call those gizmos with two sharp teeth that dig into a wall socket and suck juice all night long .
All day long , too , and all year long .
Most people assume that when they turn off the television set it stops drawing power .
But that 's not how most TV's ( and VCR 's and other electronic devices ) work .
They remain ever in standby mode , silently sipping energy to the tune of 1,000 kilowatt hours a year per household , awaiting the signal to roar into action .
" As a country we pay $ 1 billion a year to power our TV's and VCR's while they 're turned off , " said Maria T. Vargas , a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency 's Energy Star program , which sets voluntary standards for energy use , and grants its ratings to the most efficient products .
There are billions of vampires in the United States , drawing more than enough current in the typical house to light a 100 - watt light bulb 24/7 , according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories , a research arm of the Energy Department .
Jan. 27 , 2006  --
A clear majority of Americans now disapprove of President Bush 's handling of ethics in government , and three - quarters say the administration should disclose all contacts between White House officials and disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
The administration has declined to release records of Abramoff meetings , saying it will not " engage in a fishing expedition . "
But in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll , 76 percent said the White House should produce such a list .
Even 65 percent of Republicans said so .
Ethics Gone Awry ?
As things stand , the ethics situation in Washington is not working to Bush 's advantage .
In advance of his 2006 State of the Union address , 56 percent now disapprove of the way the president is handling ethics in government , up from 49 percent in mid-December .
Beyond disapproval of Bush on ethics , there 's been some weakening for the Republicans more broadly .
Asked which party they trust more to stand up to lobbyists and special interest groups , just 27 percent of Americans picked the Republicans , down from 34 percent last month .
More , 46 percent , preferred the Democrats .
Independents -- quintessential swing voters -- picked the Democrats over the Republicans in trust to handle ethics by 46 percent to 20 percent .
But skepticism is considerable ; a quarter of all Americans , and about a third of independents , volunteer that they do n't trust either party on lobbying , or draw no distinction between them .
There is some belief that Congress in the next year will enact tough new regulations on lobbying , but it 's muted : Nearly half , 46 percent , call this likely , while 51 percent think it 's unlikely .
Just 11 percent see it as " very likely " that such legislation will come to pass ; 24 percent , on the other hand , call it very unlikely .
Concern
Other measures show the extent of public doubts about honesty in Washington today .
Fifty - five percent -- essentially the same as last month -- think the Abramoff case is evidence of " widespread corruption " in the capital , rather than being limited to a few individuals .
Republicans are much less apt than Democrats or independents to see it that way .
Moreover , 43 percent say the overall level of ethics and honesty in the federal government has fallen during Bush 's presidency -- about 20 points more than Bill Clinton during the Whitewater controversy more than a decade ago .

Plutonium 238 has no central role in nuclear arms .
Instead , it is valued for its steady heat , which can be turned into electricity .
Nuclear batteries made of it are best known for powering spacecraft that go where sunlight is too dim to energize solar cells .
For instance , they now power the Cassini probe exploring Saturn and its moons .
Federal and private experts unconnected to the project said the new plutonium would probably power devices for conducting espionage on land and under the sea .
Even if no formal plans now exist to use the plutonium in space for military purposes , these experts said that the material could be used by the military to power compact spy satellites that would be hard for adversaries to track , evade or destroy .
" It 's going to be a tough world in the next one or two decades , and this may be needed , " said a senior federal scientist who helps the military plan space missions and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the possibility that he would contradict federal policies .
" Technologically , it makes sense . "
Early in the nuclear era , the government became fascinated by plutonium 238 and used it regularly to make nuclear batteries that worked for years or decades .
Scores of them powered satellites , planetary probes and spy devices , at times with disastrous results .
In 1964 , a rocket failure led to the destruction of a navigation satellite powered by plutonium 238 , spreading radioactivity around the globe and starting a debate over the event 's health effects .
In 1965 , high in the Himalayas , an intelligence team caught in a blizzard lost a plutonium - powered device meant to spy on China .
And in 1968 , an errant weather satellite crashed into the Pacific , but federal teams managed to recover its plutonium battery intact from the Santa Barbara Channel , off California .
Such accidents cooled enthusiasm for the batteries .
But federal agencies continued to use them for a more limited range of missions , including those involving deep - space probes and top - secret devices for tapping undersea cables .
The offices of the state television station were ransacked
Budapest protests
The clashes happened following a rally demanding the resignation of PM Ferenc Gyurcsany , after it was revealed his government had lied during an election .
The worst fighting came when protesters stormed the state television building .
Dozens of people were hurt , including many police officers .
The city is now said to be calm .
It was the first such unrest to take place in Hungary since the fall of communism and the establishment of democracy in the late 1980s .
An emergency meeting of the national security cabinet was called for Tuesday morning .
The main opposition party , the centre - right Fidesz , says it will boycott parliament .
Petition
The BBC's Nick Thorpe , in central Budapest , says the trouble at the state television station began when a small group of protesters who had spent the day outside parliament tried to hand in a petition .
The police used tear gas and water cannon on a group of protesters who broke into the building .
For a brief period the station went off the air .
We screwed up .
Not a little , a lot .
No European country has done something as boneheaded as we have
Ferenc Gyurcsany
Excerpt from leaked tape recorded in April
" Nothing like this has happened since 1956 , " one young protester told Reuters news agency , referring to Hungary 's failed uprising against Soviet rule in October 1956 .
Officials told state news 150 people were injured in the violence , including 102 police officers .
Our correspondent says the city is now mostly quiet , with only a handful of protesters left in the area .
Earlier Mr Gyurcsany told the state news service he had no plans to resign .
" The street is not a solution , but instead causes conflict and crisis , " he said .
" Our job is to resolve the conflict and prevent a crisis . "
He said those who had called for a " radical solution " to Hungary 's problems were also partly to blame .
Smaller protests were also held in other cities around Hungary .
Leaked tape
Mr Gyurcsany 's comments , which sparked the violence , were heard in a tape of a meeting he had with his MPs a few weeks after April 's election , and leaked to local media on Sunday .
In excerpts broadcast on state radio , Mr Gyurcsany says harsh economic reforms are needed .
" There is not much choice .
There is not , because we screwed up .
Not a little , a lot .
No European country has done something as boneheaded as we have .
" Evidently , we lied throughout the last year - and - a - half , two years ...
You cannot quote any significant government measure we can be proud of , other than at the end we managed to bring the government back from the brink .
Nothing . "
In a speech sprinkled with obscenities , Mr Gyurcsany says : " We lied in the morning , we lied in the evening . "
' Telling the truth '
The prime minister has received the backing of Socialist MPs who on Monday voted unanimously to support him .
Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators
However , Hungary 's President , Laszlo Solyom , said Mr Gyurcsany had created a " moral crisis " , and opposition parties have called for his resignation .
Matyas Oersi , an MP with the Free Democrat Party - the junior coalition partner in the government - told the BBC : " It 's a surprise - though understandable - that the people are angry at a political leader who , for the first time , is telling the truth : that the whole political class was lying . "
Protests had already been planned this week over tough austerity measures imposed following the Socialists ' victory in last April 's election , which have seen the government 's popularity plummet .
The measures , imposed under pressure from Brussels , include higher taxes and benefit cuts , are aimed at reducing Hungary 's large public deficit .
But our correspondent says the leaked revelations were , for some of the protesters , the straw that broke the camel 's back .
Local elections are scheduled in two weeks ' time .
The Socialists and their liberal coalition allies are trailing Fidesz in the polls .
Target , the large US based retailer is suing “ John Doe ” , a blogger who has posted Target ’s anti-shoplifting policies online in an attempt to unmask his / her identity , according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle :
The Minneapolis - based company is suing the unidentified ‘ € œ John Doe ’€ ? , who is believed to live in Georgia , in Federal Court for posting Target ’€™s anti-theft procedures on Web sites and various retail employee forums on the Internet in July .
The information is used to secure Target ’€™s merchandise from shoplifters and other wrongdoers .
Target says in a court filing it is provided to employees on a ‘ €œneed - to - know ’€ ?
basis .
To find out who the ‘ € œ John Doe ’€ ? is , Target is seeking the help of AOL , Yahoo !
Inc. and Microsoft Corp .
It ’€™s unclear whether these companies will comply , though .
The lawsuit , filed Sept. 5th in Federal Court in Atlanta , follows a two and a half month campaign that included efforts to get the multiple postings deleted from various message boards .
IN THE late 1990s a previously blameless American began collecting child pornography and propositioning children .
On the day before he was due to be sentenced to prison for his crimes , he had his brain scanned .
He had a tumour .
When it had been removed , his paedophilic tendencies went away .
When it started growing back , they returned .
When the regrowth was removed , they vanished again .
Who then was the child abuser ?
His case dramatically illustrates the challenge that modern neuroscience is beginning to pose to the idea of free will .
The instinct of the reasonable observer is that organic changes of this sort somehow absolve the sufferer of the responsibility that would accrue to a child abuser whose paedophilia was congenital .
But why ?
The chances are that the latter tendency is just as traceable to brain mechanics as the former ; it is merely that no one has yet looked .
Scientists have looked at anger and violence , though , and discovered genetic variations , expressed as concentrations of a particular messenger molecule in the brain , that are both congenital and predisposing to a violent temper .
Where is free will in this case ?
Free will is one of the trickiest concepts in philosophy , but also one of the most important .
Without it , the idea of responsibility for one 's actions flies out of the window , along with much of the glue that holds a free society ( and even an unfree one ) together .
If businessmen were no longer responsible for their contracts , criminals no longer responsible for their crimes and parents no longer responsible for their children , even though contract , crime and conception were “ freely ” entered into , then social relations would be very different .
We , the willing
For millennia the question of free will was the province of philosophers and theologians , but it actually turns on how the brain works .
Only in the past decade and a half , however , has it been possible to watch the living human brain in action in a way that begins to show in detail what happens while it is happening ( see survey ) .
This ability is doing more than merely adding to science 's knowledge of the brain 's mechanism .
It is also emphasising to a wider public that the brain really is just a mechanism , rather than a magician 's box that is somehow outside the normal laws of cause and effect .
Science is not yet threatening free will 's existence : for the moment there seems little prospect of anybody being able to answer definitively the question of whether it really exists or not .
But science will shrink the space in which free will can operate by slowly exposing the mechanism of decision making .
At that point , the old French proverb “ to understand all is to forgive all ” will start to have a new resonance , though forgiveness may not always be the consequence .
Indeed , that may already be happening .
At the moment , the criminal law — in the West , at least — is based on the idea that the criminal exercised a choice : no choice , no criminal .
The British government , though , is seeking to change the law in order to lock up people with personality disorders that are thought to make them likely to commit crimes , before any crime is committed .
The coming battle
Such disorders are serious pathologies .
But the National DNA Database being built up by the British government ( which includes material from many innocent people ) , would already allow the identification of those with milder predispositions to anger and violence .
How soon before those people are subject to special surveillance ?
And if the state chose to carry out such surveillance , recognising that the people in question may pose particular risks merely because of their biology , it could hardly then argue that they were wholly responsible for any crime that they did go on to commit .
Nor is it only the criminal law where free will matters .
Markets also depend on the idea that personal choice is free choice .
Mostly , that is not a problem .
Even if choice is guided by unconscious instinct , that instinct will usually have been honed by natural selection to do the right thing .
But not always .
Fatty , sugary foods subvert evolved instincts , as do addictive drugs such as nicotine , alcohol and cocaine .
Pornography does as well .
Liberals say that individuals should be free to consume these , or not .
Erode free will , and you erode that argument .
In fact , you begin to erode all freedom .
Without a belief in free will , an ideology of freedom is bizarre .
Though it will not happen quickly , shrinking the space in which free will can operate could have some uncomfortable repercussions .
U.S. sides with Iran , Sudan to bar gay groups from UN Eric Resnick

In a surprising reversal , the United States voted with Iran and other anti-gay countries at the United Nations to deny observer status to two gay rights groups at the world body .
The UN Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the United Nations Economic and Social Council voted January 23 , 10 - 5 with three abstentions to deny the International Lesbian and Gay Association of Brussels and the Danish National Association for Gays and Lesbians of Denmark consultive status at the UN .
Such status , which is enjoyed by over 3,000 NGOs around the world , allows access to UN proceedings , presence at conferences , and the right to propose agenda items .

ILGA operates in 90 countries , including the U.S. , to reduce discrimination against gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people , and respond to homophobic attacks .
The group has sought consultive status since 2002 , which the U.S then supported .
The resolution to reject was put forth by Iran .
Joining them and the U.S. in support of it were Cameroon , China , Cuba , Pakistan , Russian Federation , Senegal , Sudan , and Zimbabwe .
Iran and Zimbabwe in particular are among the world 's most GLBT - oppressive nations in the world .
Voting against the rejection resolution were Chile , France , Germany , Peru and Romania .
Columbia , Turkey , and India abstained .
Ivory Coast was not present .
Germany publicly objected to the vote , calling the denial an act of discrimination against NGOs whose sole purpose was to combat discrimination .
" The message the majority of the committee had sent to the NGOs and to the world was clear , " said their statement .
" Discrimination against persons on the grounds of their sexual orientation was okay . "
The U.S. issued no statement explaining their vote , but have subsequently said that ILGA was unacceptable because due to a past association with the North American Man Boy Love Association .
However , when State Department spokesperson Noel Clay was asked what has changed since then , Clay referred the reporter to another spokesperson , Edgar Vasquez , who ignored multiple attempts for comment .
Further , according to the 2002 U.N. minutes , testimony was given that NAMBLA had been expelled from IGLA in 1997 , and IGLA abides by the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which recognizes the age of consent around the world to be 18 .
The reason the Danish group was denied is not known .
IGLA is active in Iran where its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is waging a pogrom against gay men , including stalking , torture , imprisonment and public hangings .
Consultive status would give IGLA more opportunity to document the plight of Iranian gays for the world .
Outraged , the Persian Lesbian and Gay Organization has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice demanding a reversal of the U.S. position .
The letter is signed by Arsham Parsi , the group 's secretary of human rights affairs , Aryan Varjavandi , who is the group 's secretary general , and four other officers , all living in exile having fled Iran .
" After the atrocity terrorist attack on the U.S. in September 2001 , the Iranian youth were the only youth group in the Middle East to walk with candles and show their support for the U.S. and their solidarity with the U.S. people , " says the letter , adding , " Your action in ECOSOC was like a slap in our face and caused a great disappointment indeed . "
" We , Iranian GLBT hope that democracies in the world will use UN mechanisms and human rights to help oppressed people to gain their rights , " it concludes .
GLBT advocacy groups in the U.S. are also demanding an explanation from the State Department .
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force director Matt Foreman issued a statement saying , " Apparently Iran , which President Bush has deemed part of the ' Axis of Evil ' is a suitable partner when it comes to discriminating against gay people . "
On Jan. 25 , 39 GLBT and human rights organizations led by NGLTF , the Human Rights Campaign , Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission released a statement demanding an explanation from Rice .
" This vote was an aggressive assault by the U.S. government on the right of sexual minorities to be heard , " said Scott Long of Human Rights Watch .
" It 's astonishing the U.S. would align itself with Sudan , China , Iran and Zimbabwe in a coalition of the homophobic . "
Democrat Rep. Tom Lantos ( D - CA ) , the ranking member of the House Committee on International Relations , joined the call Jan. 31 with a letter to U.N. Ambassador John Bolton .
" I sincerely hope that the U.S. vote on this issue was a technical error or the unfortunate result of an undisciplined U.S. officer operating on his or her own without instructions , " wrote Lantos .
" In any case , I am asking you to clearly and publicly disavow and explain this anti-human rights vote before it does any long - term damage to U.S. moral authority at the U.N.
I would also like to discuss with you , at length , any possible breakdown in State Department procedures that may have lead to this most unfortunate U.S. action . "
To date , Rice and the State Department have remained silent .
In 2003 , a Human Rights and Sexual Orientation Resolution was considered by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights .
That resolution , offered by Brazil , was tabled in part due to U.S. lack of interest .

Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legislative powers of government reach actions only and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ' make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , ' thus building a wall of separation between church and state .
George Washington
The Treaty of Tripoli , January 4 , 1797 , approved by President John Adams and Secretary of State Timothy Pickering and ratified by the Senate ,
The United States is in no sense founded upon the Christian doctrine .
point
The New Colossus
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame
With conquering limbs astride from land to land ;
Here at our sea- washed , sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch , whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning , and her name
Mother of Exiles .
From her beacon- hand
Glows world - wide welcome ; her mild eyes command
The air - bridged harbor that twin cities frame .
" Keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp ! " cries she
With silent lips .
" Give me your tired , your poor ,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore ,
Send these , the homeless , tempest - tossed to me ,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! "
[ amended 5 July to correct which president approved the Treaty of Tripoli ]
Lady Liberty stands in New York Harbor to both welcome the travelers , the visitors and the homeward bound , and to show forth to all the world what we believe in .
She 's called " Liberty Enlightening the World " , and her torch shines forth as a beacon to those arriving , and those still journeying , promising them hope .
She 's crowned with a diadem of seven spikes , representing the seven oceans of the world , across which her pilgrims travel to reach her , and she carries a plaque with the date July 4 , 1776 written on it - the date when our Republic took its first full breath of life .
Below her is a pediment with the invitation - nay , the command - " Bring me your tired , your poor ... " Liberty stands , stern and unyielding , the guardian of what we in this country have always held most dear .
But now ...
A church in Memphis Tennessee - with the attractive name of World Overcomers Outreach Ministries Church - has turned the Lady into a Jesus freak .
Into a travesty .
She holds , not a torch to light the darkness , but a cross .
Her crown is emblazoned with the name Jehovah .
She carries the Ten Commandments , and beneath her there they are again .
And she 's crying .
Well she might be , poor Liberty , dragooned into the service of a religiosity that no longer knows what it means , that confuses patriotism with religion , and seeks to show that America belongs to Jesus .
This evil twin of Liberty does n't want to welcome , but to dominate .
And although Jesus echoed some of her concerns , it 's clear that many of his followers do n't .
Liberty is much older than Jesus .
A statue was erected to her on the Aventine hill during the Second Punic War , which was more than two centuries before he was born .
Christian liberty , so called , is not the same thing .
It is , according to Bible studies , called " the glorious liberty of the children of God " ( Romans 8:21 ) but consists of being free from spiritual burdens :
There 's only one of those things that deserves the name of ' liberty ' , and that 's freedom from slavery - and the Bible 's pretty clear that slavery exists and is a good thing , and for that matter , though in Corinthians Paul says " we " are " children of the free woman and not of the slave " , in Philemon he sends Onesimus back to his owner , and he frequently admonishes slaves to be obedient to their masters .
Slaves could be Christians , and Christians could own slaves : it just was n't a deal - breaker for Paul even though he constantly harped on being " born free " .
But even then , he did n't mean liberty .
For the early Church , freedom was n't liberty .
After all , Jesus is Lord - and that is a political term .
Lord = " one having power and authority over othersa ruler by hereditary right or preeminence to whom service and obedience are due , " or " a master of servants " ( It 's the , after all , not the Republic of Heaven .
God is " King of Kings " and " Lord of Lords " and Jesus is the " Prince " of Peace ... Christians are always told to yield to those set in authority over them - only worshipping false gods is forbidden them .
Occasionally some rebellious sect rises up ( think of the Puritans ) but even they set someone up in authority over the people to replace the one they overthrow .
Political liberty is simply not a Christian concept .
It 's anconcept though - nurtured by the great thinkers of the Enlightenment and transformed from a radical idea into a political reality by the Founders , liberty is , in fact , the quintessential American concept .
It 's inseparable from that other great American concept : the separation of Church and State .
Liberty does n't care what god you worship , as long as you accept Her .
And establishing one church over another puts some people over others , and that 's not good for Church or State .
As Thomas Jefferson wrote to the Baptists of Danbury ( who were a religious minority in Connecticut and who had written to him to complain that in their state , the religious liberties they enjoyed were not seen as immutable rights , but as privileges granted by the legislature - as " favors granted . " )
: Take another look at the travesty in Memphis .
There 's no separation there : she 's ready to beat other religions over the head with that cross , and to shove her tablet of religious laws into the face of anyone who dares to disagree .
She 's draped in Christianity .
She might as well continue to wear that veil to hide her shame .
Church members said the mixture of the statue and Christian symbols represent " America belonging to God through Jesus Christ . " gives them the lie direct :
There 's no denying most Americans are Christians .
But that 's beside the point - well and truly beside the point .
Theis that America is a " nation , conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . "
Christians may choose to subordinate themselves in a servant / Lord / ruled / ruler relationship with their god , just as Muslims submit to theirs , but Americans are free .
" We the people " are our own rulers .
Merging Liberty with Christianity is not merely ( merely , I say ! ) crappy civics , it 's crappy theology .
But this Memphis horror is n't Liberty .
Liberty welcomes all , not just the elect .
Here 's what the Lady who stands in New York Harbor says to the world :
Let 's not change that message for the narrow - minded , religious dogma exemplified by the Travesty in Memphis .
Lady Liberty , Goddess of America : long may you lift your lamp against the darkness .

TMZ has learned that Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey have divided up the assets in their marriage , and Nick agreed to less than his share in order to avoid an ugly court fight .
The couple amassed a fortune during their three - year marriage , in no small part because of their MTV reality show " Newlyweds " and the avalanche of endorsements and other deals that followed .
Jessica refused to sign a prenuptial agreement , so under California law the assets -- estimated at $ 36 million -- are to be divided equally .
So Jessica and Nick should each get $ 18 .
Nick will take significantly more than the $ 1.5 million , but considerably less than 50 %
As TMZ first reported , Jessica ( we 're told at the behest of her dad , Joe Simpson ) offered Nick a relatively measly $ 1.5 million to walk away from the marriage .
Sources say Joe Simpson believed Nick did n't have the stomach to put up a fight over money .
Nevertheless ,
Nick rejected the offer and the former sweethearts decided to make their divorce final and try to hammer out a property settlement .
Sources say in the property settlement -- which has not yet been filed in court --
Nick will take significantly more than the $ 1.5 million , but considerably less than 50 % of what he and Jessica earned during the marriage .
Two sources in Nick 's camp made it clear to TMZ that Lachey agreed to end the dispute because he does not want to hurt anyone in a contentious court battle .
Ironically last week , a reporter on a red carpet relayed a message from Joe and Jessica Simpson to Nick : " They love you .
You 're still part of the family . "
Nick blanched and said " Well , good , that 's nice to hear .... "
The reporter persisted " ... Jessica will always love you . "
Nick 's classic reply : " Okay , then ! "

" Identity Production in a Networked Culture : Why Youth Heart MySpace . "
American Association for the Advancement of Science , St. Louis , MO. February 19 .
[ This is a rough , unedited crib of the actual talk . ]
Much appreciation to the Macarthur Foundation for funding this research and to the rest of the Digital Youth team for guidance and insight .
If you have feedback about this talk / essay ( especially if you think i'm wrong ) , write me : zephoria@zephoria.org
This crib has been translated to French thanks to Laurence Allard .
NOTE : This talk morphed into a proper peer - reviewed academic article published in the MacArthur Series on Digital Learning by MIT Press : " Why Youth Heart Social Netowrk Sites : The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life . "
For academic purposes , I encourage you to use this article instead .
Introduction :
I want to talk with you today about how teenagers are using a website called MySpace.com .
I will briefly describe the site and then discuss how youth use it for identity production and socialization in contemporary American society .
I have been following MySpace since its launch in 2003 .
Initially , it was the home to 20 - somethings interested in indie music in Los Angeles .
Today , you will be hard pressed to find an American teenager who does not know about the site , regardless of whether or not they participate .
Over 50 million accounts have been created and the majority of participants are what would be labeled youth - ages 14 - 24 .
MySpace has more pageviews per day than any site on the web except Yahoo !
( yes , more than Google or MSN ) .
Many of you may have heard about MySpace , most likely due to moral panic brought on by the media 's coverage of the potential predators and bullying .
There is no doubt that the potential is there , but there are more articles on predators on MySpace than there have been reported predators online .
Furthermore , bullying is a practice that capitalizes on any available medium .
Moral panics are a common reaction to teenagers when they engage in practices not understood by adult culture .
There were moral panics over rock&roll , television , jazz and even reading novels in the early 1800s [ 1 ] .
The media , typically run by the parent generation , capitalizes on and spreads the fear with little regard for data or actual implications .
Examples are made out of delinquent youth , showing how the object of fear ruined them in some way or other .
The message is clear - if you do n't protect your kids from this evil , they too will suffer great harm to their minds , bodies or morals .
There _are_ potential risks on MySpace but it is important not to exaggerate them .
The risks are not why youth are flocking to the site .
To them , the benefits for socialization outweigh the potential harm .
For this reason , i want to ask you to put your fears aside for the duration of this presentation and try to see the values of MySpace for youth .
What they are doing is really fascinating .
What is MySpace :
So what is MySpace ?
MySpace is a social network site .
In structure , MySpace is not particularly unique .
The site is a hodgepodge of features previously surfaced by sites like Friendster , Hot or Not , Xanga , Rate My Teacher , etc .
At the core are profiles that are connected by links to friends on the system .
Profiles are personalized to express an individual 's interests and tastes , thoughts of the day and values .
Music , photos and video help users make their profile more appealing .
The friend network allows people to link to their friends and people can traverse the network through these profiles .
An individual 's " Top 8 " friends are displayed on the front page of their profile ; all of the rest appear on a separate page .
Bands , movie stars , and other media creators have profiles within the system and fans can friend them as well .
People can comment on each others ' profiles or photos and these are typically displayed publicly .
Originally , the site was 18 + and all data was public .
Over time , the age limit dropped to 16 and then , later , to 14 .
The youngest users are given the option to make their profiles visible to friends - only and they do not appear in searches .
When someone starts an account , they are given an initial friend - Tom Anderson , one of the founders of MySpace .
By surfing the site , they find and add additional friends .
Once on MySpace , most time is spent modifying one 's own profile , uploading photos , sending messages , checking out friends ' profiles and commenting on them .
Checking messages and getting comments is what brings people back to MySpace every day .
When MySpace was initially introduced , skeptics thought that it would be just another fad because previous sites like Friendster had risen and crashed .
Unlike the 20 - somethings who invaded Friendster , the teens have more reason to participate in profile creation and public commentary .
Furthermore , MySpace 's messaging is better suited for youths ' asynchronous messaging needs .
They can send messages directly from friends ' profiles and check whether or not their friends have logged in and received their email .
Unlike adults , youth are not invested in email ; their primary peer - to - peer communication occurs synchronously over IM .
Their use of MySpace is complementing that practice .
Many teens access MySpace at least once a day or whenever computer access is possible .
Teens that have a computer at home keep MySpace opened while they are doing homework or talking on instant messenger .
In schools where it is not banned or blocked , teens check MySpace during passing period , lunch , study hall and before / after school .
This is particularly important for teens who do n't have computer access at home .
For most teens , it is simply a part of everyday life - they are there because their friends are there and they are there to hang out with those friends .
Of course , its ubiquitousness does not mean that everyone thinks that it is cool .
Many teens complain that the site is lame , noting that they have better things to do .
Yet , even those teens have an account which they check regularly because it 's the only way to keep up with the Jones's .
Of course , not all teens are using the site , either because they refuse to participate in the teen fad or because they have been banned from participating .
Such non-conformity is typical of all teen practices .
With this framework in mind , i want to address three issues related to MySpace : identity production , hanging out and digital publics .
Profiles :
Every day , we dress ourselves in a set of clothes that conveys something about our identity - what we do for a living , how we fit into the socio- economic class hierarchy , what our interests are , etc .
This is identity production .
Around middle school , American teens begin actively engaging in identity production as they turn from their parents to their peers as their primary influencers and group dynamics take hold .
Youth look to older teens and the media to get cues about what to wear , how to act , and what 's cool .
Most teens are concerned with resolving how they perceive themselves with how they are perceived .
To learn this requires trying out different performances , receiving feedback from peers and figuring out how to modify fashion , body posture and language to better give off the intended impression .
These practices are critical to socialization , particularly for youth beginning to engage with the broader social world .
Because the teenage years are a liminal period between childhood and adulthood , teens are often waffling between those identities , misbehaving like kids while trying to show their maturity in order to gain rights .
Participating in distinctly adult practices is part of exploring growing up .
Both adults and the media remind us that vices like sexual interactions , smoking and drinking are meant for adults only , only making them more appealing .
More importantly , through age restrictions , our culture signals that being associated with these vices is equal to maturity .
The dynamics of identity production play out visibly on MySpace .
Profiles are digital bodies , public displays of identity where people can explore impression management [ 2 ] .
Because the digital world requires people to write themselves into being [ 3 ] , profiles provide an opportunity to craft the intended expression through language , imagery and media .
Explicit reactions to their online presence offers valuable feedback .
The goal is to look cool and receive peer validation .
Of course , because imagery can be staged , it is often difficult to tell if photos are a representation of behaviors or a re-presentation of them .
On MySpace , comments provide a channel for feedback and not surprisingly , teens relish comments .
Of course , getting a comment is not such a haphazard affair .
Friends are _expected_ to comment as a sign of their affection .
Furthermore , a comment to a friend 's profile or photo is intended to be reciprocated .
It is also not uncommon to hear teens request comments from each other in other social settings or on the bulletin boards .
In MySpace , comments are a form of cultural currency .
For those seeking attention , writing comments and being visible on popular people 's pages is very important and this can be a motivation to comment on others ' profiles .
Of course , profile owners have the ability to reject comments and Tom rejects most of them .
Some people literally spam their network with comments .
Last week , there were " Valentine 's cards " that people made and added to the profiles of all of their friends via comments .
People advertise events through mass comments .
Some comments are also meant to be passed on , creating virus like memes .
The rules of friending are also very important .
It is important to be connected to all of your friends , your idols and the people you respect .
Attention - seekers and musicians often seek to be friended by as many people as possible , but most people are concerned with only those that they know or think are cool .
Of course , a link does not necessarily mean a relationship or even an interest in getting to know the person .
" Thanks for the add " is a common comment that people write in reaction to being friended by interesting people .
While these dynamics may not seem particularly important , they are essential to youth because they are rooted in the ways in which youth jockey for social status and deal with popularity .
Adults often dismiss the significance of popularity dynamics because , looking back , it seems unimportant .
Yet , it is how we all learned the rules of social life , how we learned about status , respect , gossip and trust .
Status games teach us this .
Hanging Out :
So what exactly are teens _doing_ on MySpace ?
Simple : they 're hanging out .
Of course , ask any teen what they 're _doing_ with their friends in general ; they 'll most likely shrug their shoulders and respond nonchalantly with " just hanging out . "
Although adults often perceive hanging out to be wasted time , it is how youth get socialized into peer groups .
Hanging out amongst friends allows teens to build relationships and stay connected .
Much of what is shared between youth is culture - fashion , music , media .
The rest is simply presence .
This is important in the development of a social worldview .
For many teens , hanging out has moved online .
Teens chat on IM for hours , mostly keeping each other company and sharing entertaining cultural tidbits from the web and thoughts of the day .
The same is true on MySpace , only in a much more public way .
MySpace is both the location of hanging out and the cultural glue itself .
MySpace and IM have become critical tools for teens to maintain " full - time always - on intimate communities " [ 4 ] where they keep their friends close even when they 're physically separated .
Such ongoing intimacy and shared cultural context allows youth to solidify their social groups .
Digital Publics :
Adults often worry about the amount of time that youth spend online , arguing that the digital does not replace the physical .
Most teens would agree .
It is not the technology that encourages youth to spend time online - it's the lack of mobility and access to youth space where they can hang out uninterrupted .
In this context , there are three important classes of space : public , private and controlled .
For adults , the home is the private sphere where they relax amidst family and close friends .
The public sphere is the world amongst strangers and people of all statuses where one must put forward one 's best face .
For most adults , work is a controlled space where bosses dictate the norms and acceptable behavior .
Teenager 's space segmentation is slightly different .
Most of their space is controlled space .
Adults with authority control the home , the school , and most activity spaces .
Teens are told where to be , what to do and how to do it .
Because teens feel a lack of control at home , many do n't see it as their private space .
To them , private space is youth space and it is primarily found in the interstices of controlled space .
These are the places where youth gather to hang out amongst friends and make public or controlled spaces their own .
Bedrooms with closed doors , for example .
Adult public spaces are typically controlled spaces for teens .
Their public space is where peers gather en masse ; this is where presentation of self really matters .
It may be viewable to adults , but it is really peers that matter .
Teens have increasingly less access to public space .
Classic 1950s hang out locations like the roller rink and burger joint are disappearing while malls and 7/11s are banning teens unaccompanied by parents .
Hanging out around the neighborhood or in the woods has been deemed unsafe for fear of predators , drug dealers and abductors .
Teens who go home after school while their parents are still working are expected to stay home and teens are mostly allowed to only gather at friends ' homes when their parents are present .
Additionally , structured activities in controlled spaces are on the rise .
After school activities , sports , and jobs are typical across all socio- economic classes and many teens are in controlled spaces from dawn till dusk .
They are running ragged without any time to simply chill amongst friends .
By going virtual , digital technologies allow youth to ( re ) create private and public youth space while physically in controlled spaces .
IM serves as a private space while MySpace provide a public component .
Online , youth can build the environments that support youth socialization .
Of course , digital publics are fundamentally different than physical ones .
First , they introduce a much broader group of peers .
While radio and mass media did this decades ago , MySpace allows youth to interact with this broader peer group rather than simply being fed information about them from the media .
This is highly beneficial for marginalized youth , but its effect on mainstream youth is unknown .
The bigger challenge is that , online , youth publics mix with adult publics .
While youth are influenced by the media 's version of 20 somethings , they rarely have an opportunity to engage with them directly .
Just as teens are hanging out on MySpace , scenesters , porn divas and creature of the night are using MySpace to gather and socialize in the way that 20 somethings do .
They see the space as theirs and are not imagining that their acts are consumed by teens ; they are certainly not targeted at youth .
Of course , there _are_ adults who want to approach teens and MySpace allows them to access youth communities without being visible , much to the chagrin of parents .
Likewise , there are teens who seek the attentions of adults , for both positive and problematic reasons .
That said , the majority of adults and teens have no desire to mix and mingle outside of their generation , but digital publics slam both together .
In response , most teens just ignore the adults , focusing only on the people they know or who they think are cool .
When i asked one teen about requests from strange men , she just shrugged .
" We just delete them , " she said without much concern .
" Some people are just creepy . "
The scantily clad performances intended to attract fellow 16 - year - olds are not meant for the older men .
Likewise , the drunken representations meant to look " cool " are not meant for the principal .
Yet , both of these exist in high numbers online because youth are exploring identity formation .
Having to simultaneously negotiate youth culture and adult surveillance is not desirable to most youth , but their response is typically to ignore the issue .
Parents also worry about the persistence of digital publics .
Most adults have learned that the mistakes of one 's past may reappear in the present , but this is culturally acquired knowledge that often comes through mistakes .
Most youth do not envision potential future interactions .
Without impetus , teens rarely choose to go private on MySpace and certainly not for fear of predators or future employers .
They want to be visible to other teens , not just the people they they 've friended .
They would just prefer the adults go away .
All adults .
Parents , teachers , creepy men .
While the potential predator or future employer do n't concern most teens , parents and teachers do .
Reacting to increasing adult surveillance , many teens are turning their profiles private or creating separate accounts under fake names .
In response , many parents are demanded complete control over teens ' digital behaviors .
This dynamic often destroys the most important value in the child / parent relationship : trust .
Conclusion :
Youth are not creating digital publics to scare parents - they are doing so because they need youth space , a place to gather and see and be seen by peers .
Publics are critical to the coming - of - age narrative because they provide the framework for building cultural knowledge .
Restricting youth to controlled spaces typically results in rebellion and the destruction of trust .
Of course , for a parent , letting go and allowing youth to navigate risks is terrifying .
Unfortunately , it 's necessary for youth to mature .
What we 're seeing right now is a cultural shift due to the introduction of a new medium and the emergence of greater restrictions on youth mobility and access .
The long - term implications of this are unclear .
Regardless of what will come , youth are doing what they 've always done - repurposing new mediums in order to learn about social culture .
Technology will have an effect because the underlying architecture and the opportunities afforded are fundamentally different .
But youth will continue to work out identity issues , hang out and create spaces that are their own , regardless of what technologies are available .

An MBA Thanksgiving
A holiday feast for 24 is the home cook 's biggest management problem .
We call in the consultants
By JACOB HALE RUSSELL
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
November 19 , 2005 ; Page P1
As a vice president at Sutter Health , a big California hospital network , Ellen Meier has to deal with 500 Bay Area doctors and more than 40,000 employees .
But that 's not what is keeping the 53 - year - old M.B.A. up at night these days :
It 's Thanksgiving .
She 's still not over the time she accidentally served still - raw turkey to her 10 guests .
" We go completely dysfunctional , " she says .
" It 's so stressful , and by the time you sit down to eat , your stomach hurts and you 're not hungry . "
This Thursday , home chefs all across America will tackle the most complicated meal of the year .
From selecting the lineup of side dishes to devising a seating plan that separates your bickering cousins , pulling together a successful Thanksgiving dinner requires purchasing decisions , project - leadership skills and a dash of crisis management .
In short , it 's a time of year when the family home is essentially turned into a business .
So we decided to take a page from companies that struggle with their own problems of just - in - time delivery and resource allocation -- and call in the management consultants .
We went to five consulting firms and asked them to re-engineer our Thanksgiving dinner .
Their assignment : Develop a step - by - step game plan , starting this weekend and concluding with dinner at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day , for a meal that would satisfy 24 guests without stressing out the host .
Our ground rules left no part of the ritual off - limits , not even the cranberry sauce .
When the project reports arrived -- some in PowerPoint format , of course -- they were full of consulting - world buzzwords .
They even offered some useful advice .
One firm , for instance , identified a little - noticed Thanksgiving troublemaker : green beans , a B - list side dish that can clog up the kitchen assembly line .
They cracked that problem using the " innovation fulcrum , " a concept that the consultants say has helped fuel strong profit margins at Irvine , Calif. , fast - food chain In - N - Out Burger .
PricewaterhouseCoopers even came up with a " burner theorem " to optimize the number of side dishes .
Another firm recommended we borrow management strategies from Southwest Airlines ( specifically , the way it empowers flight attendants ) to squeeze productivity out of family members helping in the kitchen .
And then there was the advice feared by employees across corporate America whenever consultants arrive : Downsize .
More than one of our firms told us to hand out pink slips to guests whose performance at previous holidays failed to meet expectations .
Strategic planning , the key type of advice we sought for Thanksgiving , is the fastest - growing segment of the consulting business .
But overall growth in the industry has slowed in recent years , largely because of weakness in information - technology consulting :
Total revenues were an estimated $ 197.8 billion in 2004 , up 1.4 % from the previous year , according to research firm Kennedy Information .
One of the industry 's biggest catchphrases right now is " complexity reduction . "
For corporations , that often involves identifying non-core functions and then outsourcing them to specialists , like the booming call - center industry in India .
That was also the biggest theme in the consultants ' recommendations for Thanksgiving .
For instance , several companies advised focusing on the turkey and outsourcing the mincemeat pie to a guest .
Another buzzword concept : identifying " strategic intent , " or uncovering your real goals .
In other words , figuring out what you want most out of your holiday .
For Katzenbach Partners , a New York firm founded by former McKinsey consultants , which meant that careful preparation of an heirloom turkey might be the key to happiness for a family of foodies , while a host with dysfunctional relatives would be advised to concentrate on " social network analysis . "
From the firm 's presentation : " If the value proposition for each of your stakeholders is n't crystal clear , ask them directly . "
Below , a smorgasbord of the consultants ' ideas .
Bain & Co .
Bain , one of the largest management consulting firms , began our case the way it often does , with market research : in this case , a survey of 280 Bain employees asking for the biggest headaches , and most crucial components , of Thanksgiving .
The central discovery ?
The turkey , stuffing and gravy are the dishes guests most want to have home - cooked -- so outsource , or guest - source , the rest .
Bain assigned our case to Mark Gottfredson , global head of performance improvement , whose specialty includes complexity reduction .
He compared Thanksgiving dishes to stock - keeping units , or SKUs , retail - industry lingo for individual products offered .
" As companies innovate over time , more SKUs get on their menu , and there 's very little mechanism for them to come out , " he says .
But more SKUs mean more complexity -- and more costs .
It 's easily solved , Mr. Gottfredson says , by applying the 80 - 20 rule : focus on the 20 % of things that drive 80 % of the value .
For Thanksgiving , this comes down to cooking your " core product line " -- turkey , stuffing , gravy .
That 's what In - N - Out Burger does :
It has only four types of items on its menu .
Consultants call that the " innovation fulcrum " -- enough products to satisfy customers without creating complexity .
In - N - Out has expanded sales an estimated 9.2 % in 2003 , twice the normal growth rate for fast - food companies , according to Bain .
Mr. Gottfredson cites the fast - food company in a Harvard Business Review article he coauthored .
In - N - Out says it was n't contacted for the article and did n't supply the sales figure .
Eliminating or outsourcing dishes also can increase your Overall Equipment Efficiency ( OEE ) , which measures how much of your available equipment is being used .
According to Mr. Gottfredson , the truly industrious home chef might make a matrix of each homemade dish , its cooking time and when you need it finished , and then use that to decide in what order you should cook your dishes .
PricewaterhouseCoopers
Managing your guests is central to the plan from PricewaterhouseCoopers , a large firm that provides tax and auditing services along with strategic advice .
It begins with downsizing : Do n't invite family members known as troublemakers simply out of guilt or obligation .
It may be hard , but it 's important to just bite the bullet and get over it , says Joe Duffy , the U.S. practice leader for performance improvement .
( The firm 's PowerPoint submission included an imitation food pyramid , where " troublesome guests and relations " replace fat and sugars -- the avoid - or - use - sparingly category . )
Mr. Duffy also presented a Guest - Capacity Theorem :
Do n't exceed either the number of usable chairs , or the amount of usable table space -- contiguous table space divided by 24 inches , the optimal amount per person .
Tell your invitees that if they want a dish you do n't plan to cook -- say , pickled squash -- they should bring it themselves .
And remind them that they have to bring not just the deliverable , as business language would call the pickled squash , but the necessary " capacity " for you to keep and serve it .
" If the deliverable is Aunt Millie bringing lemon pie , " Mr. Duffy says , " does she clearly understand it needs to come , and that if it needs refrigeration , bring a cooler with ice ? "
Still , PricewaterhouseCoopers emphasizes that , like any company with multiple divisions or locations , you need a risk - management strategy in case your supplier , Aunt Millie , falls through .
The Boswell Group
Kerry Sulkowicz was a practicing psychiatrist before he founded the Boswell Group , which applies psychoanalysis to businesses and their leaders , often family businesses .
At Thanksgiving , " mom , " as he calls the chef , needs to take a cue from the stereotypical " dad " :
Be a bit more controlling .
( In contrast , he says , he often advises CEOs to be more maternal , nurturing and self - revealing . )
" When you have a clear task at hand -- in this case it 's getting the meal on the table -- creativity is really counterproductive , " he says .
So mom needs to take more of a military approach .
Still , mom should n't let her authority turn into narcissism -- which for Thanksgiving might mean substituting a non-traditional main dish for turkey .
That decision is similar to a common mistake made by new CEOs when they make changes simply for the sake of change , says Mr. Sulkowicz : " Mom ought to ask herself , ' Am I making the duck because I really believe everyone 's going to be happier with duck , or am I doing this because I want to come across as different ? ' "
Mr. Sulkowicz compares
Thanksgiving to a family business , and notes that an estimated three - quarter of family businesses fail at the transition from the first generation to the second .
So if your relatives do n't get along , he advises , do n't force them to try merely out of guilt or obligation -- and do n't substitute endless fussing over logistics as a defense mechanism .
Invite friends instead of family , or at least have some friends attend to buffer tension .
Mr. Sulkowicz says he often tells family businesses to bring in outside managers .
Katzenbach Partners
Even the best - intentioned leader can cause problems by not delegating .
That 's one of the organizational principles of the Katzenbach Thanksgiving .
The firm suggests assigning your child to handle what restaurants call the " staff meal , " in this case dinners that will keep your family well - fed during the week of preparation .
The goal : to eliminate " human resource bottlenecks , " which are limitations caused not by tasks but by people -- in this case , you .
Also watch out for " operational bottlenecks , " key points in manufacturing that disproportionately slow down delivery .
A Thanksgiving analogue might be failing to begin defrosting a frozen turkey until Thursday morning .
Because your labor force is unpaid , you 'll have to motivate them -- " pride - building , " in Katzenbach 's lingo .
Give your helpers a chance to exercise their judgment and truly run their own tasks , says Niko Canner , co-founder and managing partner .
That 's a contrast , for instance , to the overly scripted and inflexible routines typical of call centers .
Pride - building is an approach familiar to Southwest Airlines , says Mr. Canner , which gives its crews " a great deal of latitude to create a quirky , fun experience for customers . "
The Monitor Group
Michael Kunst , global accounts manager at the Monitor Group , which is known for consulting on issues like competitiveness and designing distinctive brands , advises doing some market research before setting your Thanksgiving menu .
The chef , Mr. Kunst says , should " segment " his or her market to see what different groups of guests want .
Rather than trying to find lowest common denominators , create products -- in this case dishes or activities -- that please each of your audience groups .
Mr. Kunst breaks the Thanksgiving market into four segments : kids , men , women and older people , more - objective labels than " needs - based " ones like " lonely , depressed people . "
The problem with needs - based labels is that there 's no good way , he points out , to identify and therefore market to all " lonely , depressed people . "
Once you 've defined your groups , answer some basic questions about what each segment wants , like a favorite dish or holiday activity .
Ensuring that there 's something for every segment might mean having two small turkeys , one roasted and one deep - fried .
Finally , Mr. Kunst , a foodie who thinks cooking might be a good second career , has a tip that 's served him well at Thanksgiving :
Buy turkey wings and thighs and cook your gravy on Wednesday night .
Gravy is critical to the meal , but it 's time - consuming and distracting to worry about at the last minute .
" Like with Coke 's secret ingredient and much like in any professional restaurant , recipe and sauce production needs to be in your , the CEO 's , hands , " he says .
" Do n't take this lightly : A so - so gravy versus a blow - away gravy can make all the difference in your product perception . "

Ken. July 2014 All Reviews Audio Reviews Apple Reviews Quick Overview Adorama pays top dollar for your used gear .
B&H Photo - Video - Pro Audio
I use these stores .
I can't vouch for ads below .
There are a zillion settings in iTunes , but most make big files that limit how many songs will fit , while others do n't sound as good .
I 'll get into details below , but here are the best settings to use to import your CDs into iTunes ( and therefore your iPods , iPads and iPhones ) with perfect fidelity , as well as fitting as many songs as possible into these devices .
This is how to do it in iTunes 11 .
I 've used the same settings since 2006 and will use these in the future .
Different versions of iTunes will have different ways to set these , but the values to set remain the same .
Settings for Popular Music
For 99 % of the music most people love , like rock , jazz , AOR , country , hip - hop , funk , jazz , techno , pop , R&B , rap , western , reggae , Christian , punk , bayou , industrial , disco , Latin , gospel , bluegrass , folk & etc. , set : AAC ( Apple Advanced Coding ) .
128 kbps ( kilobits per second ) .
VBR ( Variable Bit Rate ) .
Error Correction ON .
Settings for Classical Music Popular music is actually recorded with multiple mono mics , which makes it easier to encode efficiently .
For acoustic classical , baroque , medieval , renaissance , romantic , chamber music and opera that 's actually recorded in real stereo with spaced stereo pairs of microphones , we need to import our CDs with slightly higher data rates to capture all that extra stereo information .
This is because the first thing that suffers with reduced data rates is that the stereo image starts to collapse at softer levels and in reverberation tails .
For classical music , I import my CDs at these settings just to be safe : AAC .
160 kbps. VBR .
Error Correction ON .
Why not other settings ?
These settings are from my own research into what settings sound exactly like the original CD while listening on state of the art pro audio gear .
Honestly , even at 96 kbps AAC VBR it still sounds really , really good .
128 or 160 kbps AAC VBR sounds 100 % perfect , while 96 kbps VBR sounds 95 % perfect even on an advanced audio system .
If you 're happy with internet audio , you 're probably only getting 80 kbps ( 80 kbps AAC HE ( High Efficiency ) ) which sounds about 90 % perfect .
Satellite radio like Sirius XM sounds relatively awful because it 's only about 20 kbps .
128 or 160 kbps AAC sounds perfect .
Feel free to use higher data rates , like Apple 's current default of 256 kbps AAC VBR , but the music wo n't sound any better and you 'll only be able to fit half as many songs on your device .
Apple 's default used to be 128 kbps with no VBR .
VBR ( Variable Bit Rate ) is a newer and smarter way of encoding music .
Use it .
It gives improved sound because it lets iTunes use a few more bits wherever it needs to to optimize the sound .
The only reason not to use VBR is if you have an ancient iPod incompatible with VBR files .
Do n't use MP3 , which is a very popular but inferior older format .
It 's much less advanced than AAC , so it does n't sound as good at any given data rate or file size .
You 'll need about 320 kbps for an MP3 to sound as good as a 128 kbps VBR AAC .
Only use MP3 if you need compatibility with ancient non-Apple players .
A 128 kbps MP3 is n't going to sound very good .
Apple Lossless ( ALC ) and AIFF make huge files that do n't sound any better than 128 or 160 kbps , but result in huge files and much fewer songs fitting on your device .
ALC and AIFF are intended for scientific , testing or production purposes , not for enjoying as much music as possible in a portable device .
WAV is a huge file for windows computers .
Ignore WAV files for portable devices .
How to Import CDs in iTunes 11 Under iTunes >
Preferences >
General , be sure to select SHOW CD for " When a CD is Inserted , " and that " Automatically retrieve CD track names from Internet " is checked , both as shown here : iTunes 11 > Preferences > General .
Once this is set , put your CD into your computer .
If your computer has no CD drive , use an external drive .
The CD should pop up in iTunes like this .
i Tunes ' preferences can be set many ways and yours will probably look different ; the important part is to click the CD so you have the contents of the CD displayed and have an IMPORT CD button to click someplace .
As shown here , it's on the top right : iTunes 11 about to import a CD .
Click IMPORT CD , and you 'll get these options ( you also can set these back at Preferences > General >
When a CD is inserted > Import Settings ) : iTunes 11 import CD options .
" Import Using " selects among many file formats .
Select AAC ( Apple Advanced Coding ) as shown here .
AAC sounds the best for any given file size .
Be sure to check " Use error correction when reading Audio CDs . "
If you forget , you 'll probably get clicks and pops !
Click the " Setting : " selector and select and click Custom , and you 'll see this box : iTunes 11 import CD options for most music .
Here 's where you select the bit rate ( 128 kbps shown here ) , as well as the important " Use Variable Bit Rate ( VBR ) " option .
Be sure VBR is checked , and not the other two below it .
( HE encoding only works at 80 kbps and below . )
Hit OK , and your CD will import to your computer .
With iTunes 11 , you 'll usually even get the artwork with it .
How to convert larger files to VBR AAC in iTunes 11 First , set your import preferences as above ( 128 kbps VBR AAC , or 160 kbps VBR AAC for classical ) , then right - click a song in iTunes .
Select " Create AAC Version " and you 're good to go .
Converting files in iTunes 11 .
You also can do this from the top menu bar as File > Create New Version .
Older article from 2006
My wife got herself a 4GB white Nano iPod in 2006 .
I was volunteered to fill it with her CDs .
I wanted to be sure that I only had to import our 600 CDs once .
I needed to ensure I did it right the first time so I 'd never have to go back and do it again in the years ahead .
I needed to discover the optimum settings to fit as much music as possible into any iPhone , iPod or iPad , and still have it sound perfect , exactly like the original CD .
CDs sound extraordinary .
The only limitation is how well your CDs are recorded in the first place , which is a different story .
Use iTunes properly , and you can have perfect sound forever encoded efficiently on your computer and on all your portable players .
In a former life I worked in audio for a living , and even wrote an engineering paper on audio data compression .
Back in the 1990s , compressed data rate audio did n't sound very good , even at 384 kbs .
I was n't expecting much from an iPod since I presumed the sound quality was awful .
WRONG !
These little things sound great , especially for serious music listening , if you encode your CDs properly in iTunes as I 'll explain .
Audiophiles who 've never actually listened to an iPod will tell you they sound poor , but as a musician who uses my iPod Touch to feed the tube amplifier that drives my reference Stax SR - 007 Omega II headphones , mine sounds awesome !
Follow these instructions and yours will , too — especially if you 're using top - notch professional electrostatic gear .
There 's no better way to organize and get to your music fast than with iTunes and iDevices , so have at it .
There 's no need for exotic music players and servers when the Apple devices already sound so great , and no other device makes it so easy to find your music .
Today we have more storage space than when I first wrote this in 2006 — but I also have a bigger music collection , and today I want to carry it all with me on my iPod .
My 64 GB iPods and iPads still can't hold all my music , so thoughtful consideration to the optimum bit rate is as important as ever — unless you do n't really like music and only listen to one album .
It 's important to encode your CDs in iTunes into files as small as possible so you can have as much of your music as possible you in your portable devices , and the files have to be big enough to sound perfect .
So what 's the best setting ?
iTunes iTunes is Apple 's free software used to copy all your CDs into your computer so you can load them into an iPod .
It also allows you to play and manage your entire CD library from your computer , and it sounds great for serious listening .
The AAC coder in iTunes sounds great at 128 kbs AAC VBR , and that 's for serious listening on high - end audiophile systems with your eyes closed and your full attention on the music .
Just plug in a set of professional headphones that cost more than the iPod , or plug the one ounce Nano , which is smaller than a business card and 1/4 " thick , into a 400 pound classical recording studio monitoring system and you 'll have the same epiphany I did .
I used the analog outputs from my Quad G5 and my classic Beyer DT990 headphones , through which I can hear more than through my Quad ESL63 or B &W 801 monitors .
I 've also played CDs burnt from compressed iTunes files through these monitors , as well as through a Krell / Martin Logan electrostatic system and it sounds exactly like the original CDs .
Most critical listeners from outside the recording industry do n't realize that most audible artifacts are part of the recordings they buy , not the gear used to reproduce them .
These folks , often called audiophiles , spend their lives trying to work around the nasty things we audio engineers do to the audio before it gets to you .
Do your own tests if you prefer .
Beware that many of the defects many people blame on data compression are in the CDs they bought in the first place .
I listened for differences between the original CD and the iTunes rendition .
Hearing no difference is perfection , and I got that at 128 kbs variable bit rate .
Better compression schemes can't get rid of defects already recorded into your CDs .
For that you need something like a dBx 3BX I use when listening to over - the - counter recordings , but not for today 's tests .
iTunes also allows recording music without any data loss and also at 96 k Hz sampling rates to save more space .
I 'll get to that later .
This documents what I learned in a day of listening tests .
In one day of listening I only got to compare the formats I mention below .
Others spend lifetimes worrying about compression formats .
A day was all I wanted to invest , and I 'm quite happy with the results .
I 'd rather listen to music than algorithms .
I eventually imported my 600 CD library , which took a month and 36 GB , and it sounds great .
Error Correction
I 'm amazed that I caught Apple in a technical faux - pas .
If you use iTunes ' default importing options you will probably get an occasional click in your sound .
That 's because under PREFERENCES > ADVANCED > IMPORTING
Apple left the " Use Error Correction " box unchecked .
This means when any inevitable invisible speck of dust covers a couple of bits on your CD that you may get a click or short dropouts .
It drove me nuts at first thinking I had a dirty connection on playback .
I never thought Apple could make such an obvious mistake .
CDs always need error correction .
Without error correction you 'll always have problems .
Every CD player and every CD - ROM reader always applies error correction without you ever having to ask .
CDs do n't work without it .
CHECK THE " USE ERROR CORRECTION WHEN READING AUDIO CDs " BOX under iTunes > PREFERENCES > GENERAL > IMPORT SETTINGS .
Once I did , I 've never had a problem .
Apple cautions that checking this may take more time to import .
So what ?
It takes no longer from what I can see .
If it does take longer that sure beats having to throw away the imported files and starting over !
LONG and CONNECTED TRACKS : CLASSICAL , PINK FLOYD and MORE Serious music often involves longer compositions which span several tracks .
Good news :
As of iTunes 7 Apple claims to have fixed this .
You may no longer need to jack with the tricks below .
I hope so !
Classical music often has several movements which flow into each other without stopping .
Pink Floyd divides their albums into tracks , but each side is often one complete work .
Heck , if you really pay attention , the last thing you hear at the end of of " The Wall " is actually a clip missing from the very start of the album !
The whole four LP sides / 2 CDs are actually one long ring cycle .
It 's not just old music which does this .
Annie Lennox ' 2003 " Bare " has a chord which continues between tracks 7 and 8 ( Loneliness and The Saddest Song I 've Got ) .
Sting 's " Sacred Love " ( 2003 ) has sound that runs between tracks 1 - 3 and 7 - 8 .
Most people might not notice it , but LPs and CDs preserve this musical integrity and iTunes can , too .
I 'm sure there 's a lot more ; these are just what I 've noticed while stocking my wife 's iPod with tunes .
Importing iTunes and iPod add slight breaks of silence between tracks by default .
This is fine most of the time .
This sounds awful if you get a blank in the middle of two tracks that are supposed to play thorough the track change .
Trick 1 : Uncheck the crossfade on playback in iTunes under iTunes > Preferences > Playback > Crossfade .
Leave it on to get segues similar to DJs and radio , uncheck it for classical music .
Secret Trick 2 : Even with trick # 1 you 'll always have a moment of blank silence between tracks .
Once you 've imported your music there 's no way around this .
Trick # 2 works on import , only .
Now that I 've discovered this trick I 'll have to go back and reimport some of my music to take advantage of this .
You can tell iTunes , only on import , that certain tracks are supposed run into each other .
It then will import them to play properly .
It s easy but hidden .
Highlight the tracks which should play as one .
Now go to Advanced > Join CD
Tracks .
You 'll see them now have just one blue " play " checkmark for the lot and be linked together on your screen with a little vertical line .
For classical music it's easy to identify which pieces belong to each other because they are called out as movements .
Popular music usually requires you to audition the transitions between tracks and join them accordingly .
Pink Floyd's Division
Bell runs together tracks 1 - 5 , 7 - 9 and 10 - 11 .
Tracks 6 and 9 are independent .
Once imported these tracks now appear as 5 tracks instead of 11 .
Each song is now named as a concatenation of the songs inside .
Instead of three songs with name of Song One , Song Two and Song Three , you 'll have one song names " Song One - Song Two - Song Three . "
This is fine for the classics , but darned if I know how to cue to any particular movement or song inside one of these .
The Track Number field in iTunes shows the correct track number that correlates to the first of each series .
You 'll see the other track numbers not listed .
Playback iTunes has a setting to crossfade tracks ( iTunes > Preferences > Playback > Crossfade Playback ) .
This segues music together just like the radio .
It sounds great for popular music , since it turns your computer into your own radio station programmed by you and your favorite songs .
I believe this crossfading is set by default .
This sounds awful when it segues together two movements of a symphony !
When I first heard it jam together two movements I thought " What the ??? ? " and later realized what was happening .
For classical and long - form music you 'll want to uncheck this .
iTunes needs this setting to apply differently for each playlist .
I have to reset it when I swap between my popular and classical playlists .
ENCODER SETTINGS
Set these under iTunes > PREFERENCES > GENERAL > IMPORT SETTINGS .
After finding Apple 's error correction blunder I decided to spend the day experimenting on myself to hear what I could hear for encoder quality .
I used my reference Beyer DT990 headphones , since I can hear more through them than my Quad ESL63 electrostatics or B &W 801 studio monitors .
I compared results using a stack of our favorite commercial CDs .
I used the headphone output of my Quad G5 , which sounds transparent to me .
I was struck with how great this all sounds today .
Even the distortions introduced by crummy digital audio compression are nicer than the distortions in previous consumer distribution media like LP vinyl records and cassette tapes .
The great thing about CDs is that they offer consumers the same quality we took for granted from master tapes , but never heard outside a studio until CDs came along .
Even master tapes are gone today .
Today music is recorded uncompressed on hard drives .
Back to the story :
At the lower rates the audible distortions were swishy phasing effects , especially audible on choral backgrounds during percussive events .
These are also called " swirlies . "
I knew that .
These are the same weird sounds one hears over cell phones .
At the bit rates used for music these only happen if you really listen for them .
The most surprising and annoying defect is alteration to the stereo image .
I first heard this with a true stereo ( two - mike ) choral recording .
The natural reverberation decayed normally , and depending on the data rate would eventually decay to mono !
At higher rates it 's fine and at 96 kbs it sounded weird when I first heard it .
There 's an obvious explanation for this .
Data compression is all about eliminating redundancy .
The more uniform the sound the easier it is to compress .
Music compression takes a lot of advantage that most music is similar in both channels .
Natural stereo reverberation becomes completely random with zero correlation between channels .
Therefore it 's much tougher to compress a reverb tail than the program sometimes , which is why the lower rate encoders gave up and summed it to mono at low levels .
The biggest audible defects at lower rates today are n't obvious things to which you can point a new listener , like clicks or pings .
The degradation is a loss of stereo space and image .
This becomes much more obvious on headphones .
You 'd probably never notice on speakers , and never if you 're doing something else while playing music .
128 kbs AAC iTunes 6 uses 128 kbs AAC as default .
This is fine .
I really have to use my imagination to make myself think I hear any difference between audio coded that way and the original CD .
I could almost hear the ends of reverb tails in one classical recording sum to mono and that was about the only defect .
This default is fine , especially if you have an old iPod which can't handle the variable bit rates which sound better below .
With a newer iPod I use : 128 kbs Variable Bit Rate ( VBR ) AAC : My Choice
For only about a 5 % penalty in file size I use variable bit rate encoding for better quality .
This lets the coder use more bits when it has to .
I set this by clicking , at least in iTunes 7.3.2 as of August 2007 : iTunes > Prefs >
Advanced > Import > Import Using : AAC Encoder , Setting : Custom .
In AAC Encoder box that opens after you hit Custom , check Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding and OK .
Apple has this pretty well hidden .
I leave the rest at default of 128 kbs , auto and auto .
VBR sounds better for the same file size .
As far as I can see the only reason Apple does n't default to this is for compatibility with old iPods .
Having a new iPod Nano , no problem !
I could n't hear any defects .
128 kbs VBR AAC sounds the same as my CDs .
Any defects I heard were accurate reproductions of flaws in the original CDs.
96 kbs AAC 96 kbs AAC sounds fine for normal use while not paying rapt attention to your music .
It sounds worse than the others listening carefully .
It got a little bit swimmy , phasey or flangey if you compared it to the original , and the ends of classical reverb tails would sum to mono if you were paying close attention .
I 'd not use this unless you 're stuck on an old iPod which can't handle VBR .
96 kbs VBR 96 kbs VBR sounds better than regular 96 kbs .
It 's not much bigger , maybe 5 % , in file size .
I can hear a slight difference between regular and VBR at 96 kbs .
I can't hear a difference between 128 kbs standard and 128 kbs VBR .
The reason I chose 128 kbs VBR over 128 kbs standard is because I can hear the difference at 96 kbs .
This way I 've got some extra , although inaudible , quality improvement over 128 kbs standard with almost no file size penalty .
Since 96 kbs VBR is about the same size as regular 96 kbs I 'd suggest 96 kbs VBR if you 're really trying to cram in as much music as possible .
I would n't notice anything wrong if I was doing something else while listening , which is how most people listen .
160 kbs VBR I also tried this .
It makes bigger files and I could n't hear any improvement over 128 kbs VBR .
128 kbs VBR sounded identical to my CDs .
WHAT IS AAC ?
AAC is one of many ways to compress audio files .
MP3 is another .
There are many people with PhDs who spend careers developing and comparing them .
Many thanks to these people whose work has given us transparent audio quality at 128 kbs .
I did n't go off and try to compare all these systems .
It took a day just to compare a few bit rates of AAC .
My research was trying to find an optimum setting for getting my wife 's CDs into her iPod with the best possible quality at the smallest file size .
I 'm a music lover who prefers listening to music over comparing coding schemes .
Encoders get better every year .
That 's why 128 kbs sounds better today than 384 kbs used to sound .
MP3 , actually MPEG - 1 layer 3 , was OK several years ago .
It became popular for illegally copied music .
Sadly young people who should know everything changes each year have adopted " MP3 " as a generic phrase for music files , even though MP3 is already obsolete .
AAC works better today .
Better means better sound for the same file size , or smaller files for the same quality .
You have to ask yourself if it makes sense to re-encode all your stuff every couple of years for better sound and smaller files .
Today I 'd skip MP3 .
I 'm not going to explain AAC itself , sorry .
I already explained all this in a paper I delivered some years ago .
You can find this and info on all the other compression systems elsewhere in the Internet .
CONCATENATION
These tests were made compressing ( importing ) uncompressed material .
Each item was compressed only once .
Concatenation is taking a compressed file and compressing it again .
This adds artifacts to whatever is already there .
Artifacts add up .
A second pass through a compression scheme which sounds perfect the first time might not sound perfect the second time .
Any artifacts that are inaudible today could become audible when added to any new artifacts if you recompress things in the future .
Playing , copying , storing and transmitting files is not recompressing .
There 's no problem .
Make three backup copies of all your music .
If you lose one , all the others are still perfect copies .
Recompressing and concatenations is if you burn them back to audio CDs and import them again .
Concatenation happens if you convert your files to different bit rates .
Even converting a compressed file to a higher bit rate will lose quality since the higher bit rate file is created by recompressing the first file .
People who import all their CDs and then throw them away no longer have originals .
They could be screwed in five years if they want to re-convert their music to some newer format .
These tests were made compressing ( importing ) uncompressed material .
Each item was compressed only once .
I have n't experimented with what settings are needed to survive more than one compression pass .
You will most likely need to use higher bit rates if you intend to retain quality over more compression passes .
They will want to import at a higher rate , if they plan to dispose of the originals and then work from the compressed versions in the future for any future compression schemes .
FUTURE RESEARCH
These tests were run primarily with contemporary popular music , like the Celine Dion to which my wife listens and for which I was doing this research .
Popular music is usually recorded with numerous mono tracks pan-potted into stereo , which means that there is n't as much random phase difference between left and right channels as with true stereo recordings used sometimes for classical and other acoustic music .
Pop music is simple ; it does n't usually use more than a dozen performers at a time .
Thus future work will involve true stereo recordings of natural classical music .
As I heard above , the stereo stage information was the first to go before other audible artifacts , so I suspect natural acoustic stereo recordings might require a few more bits .
A Brahms Requiem may be a different story to encode than a female pop vocal .
The good news is from what little natural music I did use in my testing , 128 kbs VBR sounded great as well .
Even if reverb tails sounded weird at lower rates , even at 96 k the music sounded fine .
For classical I was too lazy to do more tests .
I use 160 kbs VBR and I 'm perfectly happy .
HOW ABOUT THOSE AUDIOPHILES ?
Audiophiles are people more in love with equipment and algorithms than music .
They prefer listening for artifacts over enjoying music .
They , like most people , hear things based on what they expect to hear .
Tell them something was data - reduced and it really will sound worse to them , even if you play them an uncompressed selection !
Most people do n't worry themselves sick about the oxygen content of their power cables or green magic marker on the edges of their CDs .
Audiophiles oddly are deaf to the clicks , pops , scratches , horrendous inner groove distortion and speed and pitch changes caused by eccentric pressings of the vinyl records they still hoard .
An audiophile is not to be confused with a music lover .
The semantic key is that they love audio , not music .
For audiophiles there is lossless coding which preserves each and every bit of audio data .
They would select Apple Lossless Coder under PREFERENCES > ADVANCED > IMPORTING > Import Using & Setting > Custom .
This lossless coder makes big files , about five times as big as 128 kbps VBR .
I find 128 kbs VBR transparent .
If I was really worried about things I can't hear I 'd use a higher rate AAC VBR setting , like 160 kbs or 256 kbs .
You may also be able to use AIFF , or the actual uncompressed data from the CD .
iTunes Hijacking Your System Every Time You Insert a Disc iTunes will hijack whatever I 'm doing and bring up the iTunes window whenever a new CD is inserted .
I want iTunes to recognize my CD for import , but I find it a severe violation of my time to have it swap active windows on it's own while I 'm usually in the middle of something complex , like saving a file , for my website .
Other than disabling the auto CD recognition in Preferences I have no idea how to right this .
The iTunes product manager should n't have such hubris .
I 'm doing as lot more at one time than just using iTunes .
TEXT FIELDS and SORTING Using iTunes 10 with iOS 4.3 on an iPod Touch in 2011 : Cover Flow ( sorts by Album Artist or Artist , then Album ) Cover Flow ( hold the iPod horizontally ) puts albums in order of Album Artist , and then Album .
If you have no Album Artist defined , which is usually the case , it sorts instead by Artist , which is often the orchestra , and not the composer .
To get your covers to flow by composer , be sure to put Mozart or Bach in the Album Artist fields in iTunes , otherwise , it flows randomly by conductor or orchestra .
Apple warns that the Album Artist should be the same for all tracks on an album , otherwise iTunes splits your album .
Album Listings ( sorts by Album ) The Album listing ( hold iPod vertically and tap bottom left Albums ) orders listings by their Album listing in iTunes .
To have albums listed by composer , rename Album titles to start with the composer 's last name .
For instance , rename " Murray Perahia plays Bach Keyboard Concertos " to " Bach : Keyboard Concertos , Murray Perahia , " and put Murray Perahia in the Artist field .
Composers
To flow smoothly by composer , use the same name for the same composer .
Your CDs undoubtedly will use different punctuations and spellings from CD to CD .
Enter names in iTunes as LAST , FIRST , and ideally , use the same spelling every time .
I use the search field at the top right of iTunes and search for " Moz " to get everything by Mozart .
I selecting the relevant items ( for instance , exclude Leopold Mozart ) , then right click on the items and select Get Info .
Select the Info tab , and enter " Mozart , Wolfgang Amadeus ( 1756-1791 ) " in the Composer field .
All the items wil now have exactly the same value as you 've pasted it .
Be careful : when multiple selections have different entries in each field , these fields will look blank when you call up Get Info for many albums at once .
Be careful before you accidentally rename every album with the same title !
Recommendations
If a single - composer album : Artist : The performer .
Album Artist : Composer 's name , for instance " Mozart , Wolfgang Amadeus ( 1756-1791 ) . "
Album : Rename with composer 's name first , for instance , " Mozart : Marriage of Figaro . "
If a multi-composer album : Artist : The performer .
Album Artist :
List the genre before the artist 's last name , for instance , " Piano : Horowitz , Vladimir ( 1903 - 1989 ) , " so Cover Flow puts all the piano albums together , instead of having to go look through Cover Flow for a particular pianist .
Album : I prefer to begin the Album title with some sort of genre and then the performer and the title , like " Piano : Horowitz - Horowitz in Moscow . "
SUMMARY
The beauty of iPod and iTunes is that you have the flexibility to use any of these schemes , and that it sounds great if you leave everything alone so long as you remember to check " Use Error Correction " as I warned at the top .

Palestinian factions fought on the streets of Gaza and the West Bank yesterday as the territories slid further into violence and political confrontation .
In Gaza City the Palestinian prime minister , Ismail Haniyeh , appeared before a rally of tens of thousands of Hamas supporters while in Ramallah at least 30 people were hurt , many seriously , in clashes between Hamas and Fatah gunmen .
Tony Blair is due to visit the Middle East shortly to promote an " arc of moderation " in the region and a return to peace talks .
On a visit three months ago Mr Blair tried to encourage the creation of a national unity government and raised the prospect of talks between the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , and the Palestinian president and Fatah leader , Mahmoud Abbas .
Since then the unity talks have broken down and there has been no meeting between Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas .
The Palestinian factions traded accusations yesterday over violence in Gaza this week .
Hamas accused a senior Fatah figure , Mohammad Dahlan , of trying to assassinate Mr Haniyeh in a gun battle at the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border on Thursday .
The border was closed by Israel , to stop Mr Haniyeh bringing in $ 35 m ( £ 18 m ) in donations from Islamic countries , then the crossing was stormed by Hamas gunmen .
Late at night Mr Haniyeh crossed without the money , but ran straight into a gun battle that left a bodyguard dead and his son injured .
" We are here to be martyrs , not ministers , " Mr Haniyeh told the crowd at the Yarmouk football stadium in Gaza yesterday .
He pointedly made no call for calm .
Khalil Hayah , head of the Hamas bloc in parliament , repeated that the movement would not recognise Israel - one of the demands that Israel and the west have made of the Hamas government before they end a financial boycott .
" We will not recognise Israel and we will not join any government that does recognise Israel , " Mr Hayah told the crowd .
Mr Abbas is due to give a speech in Ramallah today at which some think he may raise the prospect of an election early next year .
But it is not clear that he has the legal power to do that , nor is it certain that Fatah has regained enough support to win a vote 11 months after its surprise defeat .
There is anger in Fatah .
" What is happening here looks like civil war , " said Ala 'a Yaghi , a Fatah MP .
" We see every day killing , kidnapping and shooting ...
Hamas has the money and the authority and the rest of the Palestinian people have nothing .
How can we change this ? "
Mr Olmert says that he regards Mr Abbas as someone he could talk to , but Fatah is struggling on the ground .
Ghassan Khatib , a former Palestinian planning minister and now a political analyst , said that it was Hamas that was emerging strongest from the crisis .
" Hamas does n't have any motive to go for a national unity government that involves concessions , " he said .
Mr Haniyeh 's trip abroad , during which he secured promises of around $ 350 m in funding from Iran , Qatar and Sudan , was seen by many Palestinians as an endorsement of his rule .
" That was a message for people here that he received legitimacy in the Arab world , " said Mr Khatib .
Despite the donations , Hamas remains far short of the approximately $ 600 m
Israel has kept from the Palestinian Authority in tax revenues .
But the economic crisis does not seem to have dampened Hamas 's support .
Mr Khatib said his polling research suggested Hamas would keep its majority if elections were called now .
Some 2,000 people were believed to be living at the makeshift camp
The clearances have left about 700,000 people without their homes or livelihoods , according to UN estimates .
The human rights group said its film showed people made homeless and then dumped at an informal site .
The images , shot in August , depict a makeshift camp and people queuing up for water at the site near Harare .
Amnesty said people there had to cope with shortages of food and clean water .
The site may have housed up to 2,000 people , it said .
But the organisation said it feared the problem could be widespread , urging the government to say whether other areas like the site shown on the film existed in other parts of the country .
The government in Zimbabwe describes its drive as an urban renewal campaign designed to cut crime and curb illegal development .
It says last month 's UN report - which said a total of 2.4 m people had been affected in some way - is biased and exaggerated .
' Secretly dumped '
Amnesty said the film was shot at Hopley Farm on the outskirts of Harare on 4 August and then smuggled out of the country .
It said the images showed people who lost their homes during Operation Murambatsvina ( Drive Out Trash ) and who were initially taken to the so - called transit camps .
But the organisation said that such camps in Harare and also Bulawayo were closed following the damning UN report .
The government of Zimbabwe is compounding suffering and human rights violations by attempting to hid the most visible signs of internal displacement
Audrey Gaughran
Amnesty International
" The people who had been in those transit camps were taken under cover of darkness and dumped at various rural areas in the country , " Amnesty International researcher Audrey Gaughran said .
" They were left in most cases with no shelter , no food , no access to sanitation and little or no access to clean water .
" Rather than confront the massive humanitarian crisis that its actions have created , the government of Zimbabwe is compounding suffering and human rights violations by attempting to hide the most visible signs of internal displacement , " she added .
Ms Gaughran said that since the footage was shot , aid groups had been able to persuade the government to grant them access to the Hopley Farm site .
I just read a book called John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing .
Every few years I read a book that causes a discontinuity in my thinking -- a step function that 's a lot larger than the little insights that most books or articles produce .
For me , this was one of them .
Incidentally , I do n't expect it will have the same impact on everyone .
I think there 's a right time for every book .
You have to struggle with some set of issues for a while before the right book can really hit home .
You might like it , but I 'm not necessarily going to recommend it .
It 's more of a history or a biography than a technical book .
I thought I 'd talk about some of the realizations , probably already obvious to you , that really " clicked " when I read it .
What Math Really Is
I finally realized how important math is .
Innumeracy , the mathematical version of illiteracy , is crippling me and most of the rest of the programming world .
Von Neumann was originally " just " a mathematician ( and chemical engineer ) , but he made lasting and often central contributions to fields other than pure mathematics .
Yes , he invented the computer and computer programming as we know it , which is a fine thing to have on your resume , but it 's only a tiny part of his work .
The list is so long that the book I read could n't begin to mention it all , let alone discuss it .
I 'll list a handful of his accomplishments here , but they do n't begin to paint the full picture .
Johnny co-invented game theory , made critical contributions to the field of economics , and extended his game theory to formalize the theory of linear programming , which is now a staple optimization method for many disciplines , including some that we employ at Amazon ( e.g. operations research ) .
He singlehandedly invented the theory of cellular automata -- you know , the one that madman Stephen Wolfram tries to take credit for in A New Kind of Science -- and was one of the pioneers of methods for understanding the human brain , which spun off any number of sub - fields .
He also did pioneering work in the theory of building large , reliable systems comprised of unreliable components .
He was one of the key contributors to the atomic bomb on the Manhattan Project .
He 's the one who suggested the implosion device for achieving reliable detonation ( they had been trying to use a gun / projectile method ) , and he was instrumental in working out the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic problems in understanding the shock waves and blast behavior .
Regardless of your feelings about nuclear weapons , you have to appreciate his contributions in a critical wartime initiative .
He made many major contributions to the field of numerical approximation .
Many real - world problems are non-tractable to mathematical analysis ; e.g. they 're only describable by systems of high - order partial differential equations .
Johnny tackled these problems with gusto , inventing or extending a huge number of different approaches for doing approximations or probabilistic analyses that yielded results where rigorous analysis had failed .
This is the primary reason that he went to all the effort to invent the modern computer .
He was n't satisfied with simply designing and building it ; he used it to solve a huge variety of real - life problems .
For instance -- and this is just one example -- he turned weather forecasting into a science .
Before Johnny decided to tackle the problem ( and he knew nothing of meteorology ; he had to learn it in order to solve it ) , it was n't possible to get accurate 24 - hour weather predictions , and the experts in the field had given up hope of ever making scientific weather predictions .
You now get accurate weather forecasts because Johnny decided it was an interesting problem .
" Watching " Johnny von Neumann work in this book gave me a new appreciation for the importance of having a strong mathematical foundation .
Math is a funny thing ; it 's not the way most people think of it -- it 's an ever - expanding set of tools for modeling and solving problems .
It 's very much driven by practical considerations ; if a new problem comes up , and it's not tractable to existing mathematical methods , then you work to make up new ones .
So math is very much like programming : it 's a set of tools and practices that you use to model and solve problems .
There are often multiple approaches that have their own pros and cons .
You might be able to model a particular problem algebraically , geometrically , and numerically .
One approach might be more accurate but more difficult to compute .
Or an approach might be accurate and easy to compute , but only when your instance of the problem satisfies certain constraints .
We have hundreds of problems at Amazon that nobody has tried to analyze mathematically .
Von Neumann would have been excited by all of this ( and possibly disgusted that we 've been in business a decade without bringing in mathematicians to help us solve our problems .
In fact we regularly turn them down as part of our interview process . )
My new motto is " Math every day . "
I 'm giving myself one year to master all the math I was supposed to have learned in high school and college : algebra , geometry , trigonometry , limits and conic sections , differential calculus , integral calculus , multivariate calculus , simple differential equations , linear algebra and eigenvectors / eigenvalues , discrete math and logic , probability and statistics .
I " knew " it all at one time or another , without really understanding what the heck it was for , so I should be able to put it all together again fairly quickly , if I put my mind to it .
Math every day .
You learn things a little at a time .
Practice something every day for half an hour and you 'll become comfortable with it in no time .
What Computers Really Are
Another realization I had while reading the book is that just about every course I took in my CS degree was either invented by Johnny von Neumann , or it 's building on his work in mostly unintelligent ways .
Where to start ?
Before von Neumann , the only electronic computing devices were calculators .
He invented the modern computer , effectively simulating a Universal Turing Machine because he felt a sequential device would be cheaper and faster to manufacture than a parallel one .
I 'd say at least 80 % of what we learned in our undergrad machine - architecture course was straight out of his first report on designing a programmable computer .
It really has n't changed much .
He created a sequential - instruction device with a fast calculation unit but limited memory and slow data transfer ( known as the infamous " von Neumann bottleneck " , as if he 's somehow responsible for everyone else being too stupid in the past 60 years to come up with something better .
In fact , Johnny was well on his way to coming up with a working parallel computer based on neuron - like cellular automata ; he probably would have had one in production by 1965 if he had n't tragically died of cancer in 1957 , at age 54 . )
Von Neumann knew well the limitations of his sequential computer , but needed to solve real problems with it , so he invented everything you 'd need to do so : encoding machine instructions as numbers , fixed - point arithmetic , conditional branching , iteration and program flow control , subroutines , debugging and error checking ( both hardware and software ) , algorithms for converting binary to decimal and back , and mathematical and logical systems for modelling problems so they could be solved ( or approximated ) on his computing machine .
He did much of the hardware and materials engineering himself , working closely with engineers to come up with solutions for memory , secondary storage , input and output ( including hooking up an oscilloscope to the computer to visually check results that were too complex for punch cards ) .
He secured the funding for building the computer and computing lab from government and other sources , developed training programs to teach people how to program computers , and worked with domain experts to find problems that were too hard for mathematical analysis but tractable to numerical solutions on his computer .
Of course he knew what was computable on his machine , because he worked out new definitions of elegance and efficiency , came up with the mathematical models for analyzing the complexity of algorithms being executed on his device , and with his staff , ran hundreds of experiments to learn what worked well and what did n't .
John von Neumann invented our universe .
Then he died at the depressingly early age of 54 , robbing the world of perhaps the greatest genius of the 20th century .
" Those who know " generally seem to rank Albert Einstein ahead of von Neumann , but Johnny always gets a solid # 2 vote .
Frankly , though , I think Johnny had a far bigger impact on my life , and not just because I 'm a programmer .
What did Albert do , really ?
Dashed all our hopes of faster - than - light travel , that 's what he did .
Whined a lot about not agreeing with quantum mechanics , that 's what he did .
To the best of my knowledge , Einstein did n't even know EJB , which according to many Amazon folks makes him a retard .
When I say that von Neumann invented our universe , I 'm not trying to be poetic or rhetorical .
What I 'm saying is that his first attempt at a computing machine , one that he did n't really like all that much and considered mostly a prototype , is still the one sitting on my desk today .
That means we 're a bunch of frigging boneheads .
You , me , everyone .
Discrete math , data structures , algorithms : they 've all been refined since he died , sure , but he started it all .
Virtually every discipline that we think of as " computer science " is like Euclidean geometry : useful , sure , but far from the only kind out there .
Operating systems , threads , and processes are just a pathetic attempt at fooling you into thinking you have a parallel computer , right ?
Gosh , computers are so darn fast that you can have the processor zing around like Feyman 's hypothetical " only electron in the universe " , and it almost looks as if we 're smart .
But we 're not .
All the world at large truly understands is serial execution , which is precisely why we 're so lost in the whole distributed computing space .
Everyone talks about agents and crawlers and web services and all this other crap we do n't understand ; Johnny would have taken one look at it and invented tractable mathematical solutions .
Compilers : now there 's one discipline where Johnny clearly did n't have much influence .
He was a big old - school proponent of doing everything in machine code .
He might have changed his mind if he'd lived another few decades ; hard to say .
But ordinary mortals realized they needed shortcuts : higher - level languages that would be translated into Johnny 's machine instructions .
So people came up with a bunch of crap-ass languages that still had the exact same abstractions as the underlying machine : a global memory that you update by issuing statements or instructions , expressions that can be computed by the arithmetic - logic unit , conditional branching and loops , subroutines .
Everything you need to be " Turing - complete " , which is equivalent to von Neumann - complete .
The new languages simply added various shortcuts : named storage locations ( " variables " ) , syntax for dealing with memory addresses , " types " for telling the compiler that a variable comes from a particular set of valid values and has a particular set of legal operations , " scopes " and " namespaces " for organizing your code a little better , " objects " for anthropomorphizing your data so it can be happy or sad ( mostly sad ) , and other cruft .
Bu it 's all crap .
Why ?
Because it 's all just sugaring for the capabilities of assembly language on von Neumann serial machines , plus a smattering of support for calling into the operating system code so you can pretend your program is performing truly parallel operations .
And none of that parallel stuff works very well , since we do n't understand it , because we do n't know math .
What about data structures , you ask ?
Surely that 's one island of purity , something that exists outside of the von Neumann universe ?
After all , we worked so hard to understand them .
( Well , some of us did .
Plenty of folks did n't even do that ; they just call an API and it all works like magic . )
Sorry to disappoint you , but most of our data structures are fundamentally based on Johnny 's sequential machine .
Think of all those pointers : they 're just memory addresses .
The best you can do for a sorting algorithm , complexity - wise , assuming radix sort is n't possible , is n*logn .
Or so you thought ; there are parallel algorithms that run in linear time .
All your cherished data structures are simply the best that clever people could do at organizing data on a Turing Machine .
If someone created a set of data structures whose pointers were URLs , that would be a step away from von Neumann .
What about SMP or NUMA ?
Surely adding multiple processors is a huge step towards parallel computing ?
Nope , sorry .
Well , not much of one .
There 's still a von Neumann bottleneck ; the channel has just been made a bit shorter .
We need it to be made infinitely wider by creating a truly parallel computer that does n't consist of CPUs all trying to update the same global store .
Face it : Computer Science was a misnomer .
It should have been called Johnny 's First Universe .
OK , so let 's speculate about what would have happened if Johnny had lived another 30 years , and built his parallel computer based on neural networks and cellular automata theory , and we all used those instead of the Turing devices .
What things out of an undergraduate computer science degree would still be relevant ?
That 's easy : Math .
Everything that 's relevant would stem from math .
There would be data structures , but they'd be different ones , derived from the complexity analysis of the " inner economy " of the parallel computer .
There would be algorithms , but they 'd also be different , and designing your own algorithms would require mathematical analytical abilities , just like they do today .
There would be control systems and feedback loops and type systems and semantic nets , just like today , but all of those things are just useless superstition without math .
Just like everything , really .
It 's hard to think of useful courses in school that did n't eventually require you to start doing some mathematical analysis in order to understand the advanced concepts .
Even philosophy , psychology and social sciences need math -- let 's not forget that logic , statistics and stochastic / probabilistic methods are still branches of mathematics .
Other than math , the other big one is Linguistics .
It 's a field that has its share of math , to be sure , and in the end , mathematics will probably solve the problem of why people are so scared of languages .
But until the human brain is really mapped out , which could be a while , an understanding of languages and how they work is going to be fundamental .
We can't even do math without having a language for it .
Programming Languages
I said earlier that all programming languages are just desperate attempts to provide shortcuts for operations on the von Neumann architecture .
Actually , that 's not entirely true .
A handful of languages are designed to express computations in a " pure " form , not tied to Johnny 's omnibus .
One such language is Prolog .
There 's a branch of math ( what else ? ) that focuses on being able to describe or model a computation as a set of rules , and then having an engine evaluate the rules , supposedly without having to know or care how the engine does it .
In practice , you do need to know how it does it , in order to be able to compute the complexity of the algorithm .
This model is quite useful for certain problem domains , and Prolog is a language that gives you access to a rules engine , and provides " normal " language features for situations where the rules engine does n't help .
There are others , but I wo n't go into them because at the moment , I do n't understand them yet .
Some of them are n't so much languages as they are " approaches " that can be used in any language -- some of them approaches to doing truly parallel computation , for instance .
But Lisp is particularly interesting , because unlike most other languages , it was n't designed as a language for the Turing machine .
One of Alan Turing 's professors , Alonso Church , was working on a mathematical model for expressing computations at the same time Turing came up with his Turing Machines .
Church had created a system called the Lambda Calculus , and he and Turing quickly realized they were formally equivalent , albeit very different - looking .
The Lambda Calculus is a system for building up computations by writing and composing functions .
As it turns out , Turing machines are easier to implement in ( 1950s ) hardware , and the Lambda calculus is easier for people to read and write by hand , as you 'll know if you 've ever tried to write out a significant - sized Turing machine .
In 1958 , the year after von Neumann passed away , John McCarthy invented a mathematical notation called Lisp , which was based on the Lambda calculus , and allowed him to express programs much more conveniently than the von Neumann instruction set allowed him to do .
Soon afterwards , a grad student decided to turn it into a programming language .
Lisp survives today as the second oldest programming language still in use , after Fortran , which was invented in 1957 .
The fact that Lisp is based on the lambda calculus is important .
It means it 's not some cheesy hack to provide syntactic sugar for von Neumann machine language .
It 's a model for writing programs that 's intrinsically powerful and expressive .
For one thing , being a functional language , Lisp translates far more easily to parallel machines , because it does n't assume the world works by moving a head around on an infinite tape ; i.e. it does n't work by side - effect .
isp has some pragmatic additions to allow you to do programming by side - effect .
Some people think this is bad , because that paves the way to ugly bugs .
But as long as von Neumann machines are the norm , it 's going to be practical .
At least Lisp encourages you to program without side - effects .
C , C++ , Java , Perl , and most other languages embrace the von Neumann architecture and force you to write error - prone code .
And Lisp 's design gives it at several distinct technical advantages over other functional languages such as ML and Haskell .
I 'll leave them out of scope for the moment , but all of them contribute to Lisp 's ability to write more compact code -- the larger the system , the more compact the code .
C++ , Java and Perl code bases seem to grow almost linearly with the functionality , but carefully engineered Lisp code bases have a way of growing at a rate that feels closer to the log of the feature complexity .
Big Systems
Sometimes I hear people hint that we 're wasting time when we talk about little toy code examples , or about programming languages .
Their feeling is that it 's silly to be talking about these things when people doing " real " work here are busy building giant production systems .
But if you consider my July 16th blog entry Lisp Wins ( I think ) , where I talk about high - level language constructs like " map " saving you reams of code , or my September 24th blog entry Saving Time , where the Second Point talks about how I did n't give up on a function until I 'd written it to be 60 % shorter , you 'll realize I 've got a running theme here : big systems suck , and you should n't write them .
In the 1930s , people were solving large computational problems by accumulating huge masses of laborers , and doling out little parts of the computation to each person , who would work it out on paper using a slide rule or sometimes a calculator .
People who did bits of calculations for a living were called " computers " , and groups of people dividing up a calculation are now called " human computers " .
The human computers in in the 1930s were n't the first , either ; they 'd been around and well - documented , here and there , since the 16th century .
And you 've heard the speculations that the monks ' religious rituals in some ancient monasteries were actually a ruse to carry out some large computation .
But as computing machines increased in power , the need for human intervention in computations decreased .
Or did it ?
If that 's the case , why are we hiring hundreds more programmers ?
Are we just churning big prayer - wheels here ?
Mathematicians have traditionally avoided problems that they considered " intractable " to analysis .
They 've known about numerical methods for centuries ; even Newton devised a few , as did the ancient Greeks .
But brute - force methods have traditionally been met with some disdain , because the results of large - scale human computations rarely justify the cost of the undertaking .
Clairaut 's work in 1757 , in which he and two other people labored for 5 months to trace the orbit of Halley 's Comet to compute its perihelion , garnered widespread criticism after his team missed the true perihelion by thirty - one days .
Larger - scale computing groups have met with similar results : you can perform large , expensive computations , e.g. to create trigonometric tables , but humans make errors , and human computers generate unreliable output that becomes worse the harder they push to get it done faster .
Before von Neumann 's programmable computer , mathematicians had few other options .
They pushed pure analysis to its limits , but some physical and natural phenomena can only be described with complex systems of equations that cannot be solved analytically .
Many problems had to be solved informally .
Von Neumann changed all that ; he embraced numerical methods and invented entire new branches of math for use with the computers he was inventing -- the sequential computer for the most part , but also his planned parallel computers .
And he was able to perform larger and larger computing tasks with small - ish teams .
When a task grew large enough , requiring more than , say , 20 people , it was considered intractable .
Rather than trying to secure funding for more people , he and his colleagues went to work on creating intrinsically more powerful mathematical models to make the problem tractable .
And do n't you think for a moment that his problems were " easier " than the ones Amazon faces today .
Looking at the speed at which he was pioneering the development of parallel computational models and research on intelligent , self - reproducing , self - repairing systems in the last few years of his life , it 's pretty clear that he would have been successful .
Johnny 's approach was to make intractable tasks tractable .
That 's not the way the computer programming industry works today .
What is software engineering , if not dividing up problems to be worked on by multiple people ?
And coordinating the division of labor for huge computing tasks ?
It might seem more glamorous than doing arithmetic , but is it really ?
I do n't think so .
We 're still just a big human computer , with a fancier slide rule .
All because we do n't know math .
Epilogue
I used to think I was too old to go back and get good at math .
I do n't think that anymore .
" Math every day . "
That 's my new motto .
Another good one might be : " Think outside the tape . "
( The Turing - machine tape , of course . )
Various ( much slower ) researchers have continued to advance the mathematics behind neural nets , cellular automata , parallel algorithms , and parallel languages .
If Johnny came back today , he 'd probably catch up with all of the advances in math , computer science , and genetics of the past 45 years within about , oh , maybe 18 months .
I 'll probably never catch up , not if I live to be 100 .
But I 'm not worried ; at least now I know that the better I get at math , the better I 'll be at virtually everything I try my hand at .
I went and bought a bunch of math books today .
Many of them were by the same guy : if there 's one person who 's had nearly as big an impact on Computer Science as Johnny von Neumann , it 's the brilliant mathematician Donald Knuth .
I 'm going to be reading everything he ever wrote .
I 've also bought myself some nice titles that teach you math and math history simultaneously , including Mathematics and its History by John Stillwell .
I 've decided that the only way to make math non-boring is to put it in historical perspective .
Reading about the people , the discoveries , the competition and the breakthroughs makes it interesting in a way my math courses never managed to do .
And I bought some works by Noam Chomsky and other linguists .
Time to familiarize myself with linguistics , too , since the field has such a huge similarity to the study of programming languages and other computer - science disciplines like search and natural language recognition .
No need to drop everything else to do this ; a few hours of study a week should more than suffice .
I 'm looking forward to my new education .
Math every day .
Postscript
There are so many reviews of Stephen Wolfram 's insane rant about cellular automata that it's hard to find any one in particular that you 're looking for .
I was browsing them looking for the one that mentioned that Von Neumann was the man who invented CAs ; it turns out to be the one titled The Emperor 's New Kind of Clothes by Joe Weiss , and comes up first if you sort the reviews by Most Helpful First .
( Hard to believe that 's not our default configuration . )
The first few Most Helpful reviews of Wolfram 's book are all quite good , but one of them is so good I just have to mention it here ; otherwise you might not go read it .
I 've read some funny customer reviews in my time , but this one might be my new all - time favorite : A new kind of review .
Enjoy !

Living with a Ghost
Your house has a ghost .
Most of the time as you go about your business , nothing eventful happens , but occasionally you notice weird things .
Usually it 's harmless stuff , you turn off a light , then it turns back on .
Sometimes you hear the toilet flushing randomly or the radio turn on .
And every once in a while , a sharp knife just floats out of the kitchen drawer and comes at your face .
It 's quite terrifying , stuff just moves around on its own !
But then one day you come across an Ouija board and you decide to communicate with the ghost .
Turns out the ghost is a nice fellow and is n't trying to harm you .
Not at all , in fact , he 's similarly jeopardized by your activities ( he said you 've almost stabbed him 4 times ! ) .
He says he 's not leaving , he needs to live in the house the same as you .
But he 's a reasonable ghost and you work out a system where you can both live in the same house , share the same stuff and not stab each other in the face .
You quickly figure out for many things in the house there is only one of you who ever use it , so those things will need no coordination .
And for some things it does n't matter if you both try use it .
Like the couch , it 's not a problem if you both sit on it , it still works just fine as a couch .
That 's what couches do , they allow many people to REST simultaneously .
Ghost reading Chicken Soup for the Soul
Other things require some coordination , like the shower and stove .
So you devise ways to signal to the other side when you are going to use it , like putting a piece of tape on the stove to show its being used , and if there is tape already on there you wait until its gone before you use it .
This mostly works , but sometimes you suspect it 's not as efficient as you 'd like .
Most of the time when the ghost has his tape on it he 's only using one burner and sometimes the stove is n't even on .
What the hell is he doing over there ?
Occasionally the ghost or you get a little confused about the coordination procedures and who 's allowed to use what and then accidents happen .
Stuff gets spilled and things get lost .
It sucks , and sometimes causes a big giant mess for everyone , but for the really important things you guys are pretty careful and bad stuff does n't happen .
Much .
You 'd like to move somewhere without ghosts , but you find out pretty much every house in town is this way .
Some houses have more than one ghost .
Some of the really big houses have dozens , hundreds , even thousands of ghosts .
You 've been warned to avoid those houses , most people quickly go insane trying to live there .
One ghost is bad enough .
But there is one neighborhood you 've heard of where there are no ghosts , things always behave consistently and rationally , nothing ever magically moves or changes before your eyes , knives never suddenly fly at your face .
It 's rumored to be pretty expensive to live there , you hear only the richest , most vitally important people live there .
While you do n't have the exact figures you know you probably can't afford it , not with your meager resources .
No way .
So you go on living with ghosts .
Twist ending :
The other side was n't a ghost , it was M. Night Shyamalan and this whole story was really about the problems of shared state threading ( try to act surprised ) .
Take that Hollywood !

Publishers and learned societies are fighting a last ditch action to stop the research findings of thousands of British academics being made freely available online .
The UK research councils , which control billions of pounds worth of funding , have announced their intention to make free access on the internet a condition of grants in a bid to give British research more impact worldwide as it is taken up and cited by other researchers .
The move has been backed by Sir Tim Berners - Lee , the inventor of the world wide web , and other academics .
But publishers who fear that open access will hit sales and damage the UK's 25 % share in the £ 7bn worldwide learned journals market are lobbying hard against the proposal .
Both sides believe the battle has reached a critical stage .
Ian Diamond , the chief executive of Research Councils UK , the umbrella body representing the eight research councils , has proposed that from October academics archive final versions of their papers in repositories belonging to their own universities or subject bodies .
These would not be edited , and possibly corrected , by a journal , but would be available free of charge to other researchers via the internet .
This month , the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers ( ALPSP ) , whose members publish more than 8,000 journals , wrote privately to Prof Diamond seeking consultation and urging delay .
The policy would not only damage big publishers , but also hurt scores of learned societies , which publish journals , said Sally Morris , the association 's chief executive .
Journals organise the all - important peer review process , which is the quality control for research - although the academics involved do it for free - and this has to be paid for somehow , she pointed out .
Once all of a journal 's content was available free online , university librarians would stop buying it , she said .
The advent of Google Scholar meant it was now easy to find the contents of a journal scattered among different repositories .
Ms Morris conceded that those physics journals where 100 % of content was open access had not lost subscriptions yet , but there was a worrying trend of academics no longer reading the journals .
" We are worried that the research councils in the UK are trying to push in the direction of a parallel economy without thinking of the possible damage to the journals on which they parasitise .
" We need to talk together to maximise the dissemination of funded research , but without killing the goose .
We need to examine very carefully the real risk to publishers and what we can do to minimise it , " added Ms Morris .
But a letter to the research councils signed by Sir Tim Berners - Lee , Stevan Harnad , professor of cognitive science at the University of Southampton , and other advocates of open access , dismisses the publishers ' fears .
" Not only are these claims unsubstantiated , but all the evidence to date shows the reverse to be true : not only do journals thrive and co-exist alongside author self - archiving , but they can actually benefit from it - both in terms of more citations and more subscriptions , " they said .

It 's Funny .

Based on long experience , I can only assume that this is a question that many managers ask themselves on a daily basis : “ Do I hate my team enough ? ” Quickly followed by : “ How can I demonstrate the extent to which I hate my team ? ”
Well , I feel it ’s my job in life to help managers , so here ’s my tip : if you want to demonstrate unequivocally that you hate your team , send them on a team building / training exercise .
Now , be careful here .
I mentioned “ training ” because that what these team building seminars are often called .
Having said that , it ’s vitally important that any training component be of no value whatsoever to the people undertaking said training .
The training should be about “ team building ” , “ problem solving ” ( note : not problems they will actually encounter in their work but abstract or conceptual problems ) “ conflict resolution ” ( you ’ll need this for when they come back wanting to kill you ) and best of all “ corporate values ” .
For best effect , the training / team building environment needs to be as unrelated to the work environment as possible .
A consistent winner is sending IT development teams on wilderness survival treks .
These geeks spent their high school years being bullied by the sporty types who run these outdoors activities .
They miss it .
A few years ago paintball tournaments were very popular .
Shrewd managers thought it would be funny to make pasty dweebs run around with weapons .
Bad idea .
Even facsimile weapons can give geeks inspiration for wreaking revenge on you .
High powered rifles and paint ball guns handle in a remarkably similar manner .
Tailor the team building exercises to be humiliating as possible .
If your staff are desk bound and have seen neither the light of day nor the inside of a gym for years , send them rock climbing .
If they are introverted and socially awkward , force them into uncomfortably intimate situations or maybe make them perform some “ hilarious ” skits .
Hilarious for people who enjoy watching torture anyway .
When your staff say “ I ’m too busy for this , ” you say “ You need to make the time for your personal development . ”
When they say “ Giving up this time for this stupid team building exercise will make the project late , ” you say “ You need to prioritise more effectively – work smarter , not harder . ”
When they say “ This is a waste of fucking time ! ” you say “ You ’re not a team player . ”
( This is an excellent all - purpose phrase that carries the veiled threat of a bad performance review and no pay raise / bonus )
When they say “ I have evidence that you ’re taking kickbacks from the training company , ” you say “ You ’re fired . ”
Most of all , make sure the team building event is no fun whatsoever .
I ’ve had team days in the past before that were lots of fun and they did the managers involved no good whatsoever .
When people have fun once , they expect more fun later .
A team that ’s had fun returns to work invigorated and lively ; and an invigorated team is scary as hell for a manger who ’s out of their depth .
Plus , a team that enjoys each other ’s company ends up being united and what sort of manager wants to deal with a strong , united team ?
When you get right down to it , a team building seminar can be the ultimate Zen moment for a manager .
It ’s a perfect moment when you make someone ’s life miserable while giving the outward appearance of doing something positive .
So this is my call to managers everywhere : go for it !
Take a good , hard look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself :
“ How much do I hate my team ? ”
The crater dwarfs the next largest known Saharan crater
Enlarge Image
Boston University experts found the 31 km ( 19 mile ) wide crater while studying satellite images of the area .
It is more than twice the size of the next largest Saharan impact depression and more than 25 times the size of Arizona 's famous Meteor Crater .
The American team that found it says its sheer size may have helped it escape detection all these years .
The structure , which has an outer rim surrounding an inner ring , has been named " Kebira " , which means " large " in Arabic and also relates to the crater 's physical location on the northern tip of the Gilf Kebir region in southwest Egypt .
" Kebira may have escaped recognition because it is so large , " said Dr Farouk El - Baz , director of the Boston University Center for Remote Sensing , where the find was made .
" Also , the search for craters typically concentrates on small features , especially those that can be identified on the ground .
The advantage of a view from space is that it allows us to see regional patterns and the big picture . "
Desert glass
Water and wind erosion may also have helped hide its extra-terrestrial origin .
Meteor Crater is probably the most studied impact structure on Earth
The crater 's vast area suggests the location may have been hit by a meteorite equivalent in size to the diameter of the famous Meteor ( or Barringer ) Crater in Arizona which is 1.2 km across .
The impact would have wreaked devastation for hundreds of kilometres .
The 65 million - year - old Chicxulub crater in Mexico is estimated to be 160 to 240 km ( 100 to 150 miles ) wide and is a likely culprit in the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Of those 1,351 stores we ’ve found three which have a giant Target painted on the roof , all of which are unsurprisingly located near major international airports ( not air force bases , because that would be silly ;-) ) .
The first target store is in Rosemont ( with the Allstate Arena just to the south ) and lies in the flight paths to O’Hare International Airport .
Our second target is in Queens , New York City and is just east of La Guardia Airport .
Another store in Everett , a suburb of Boston , just west of Logan International Airport .
And lastly we zip across to Australia for this target , which I assumed was advertising for the benefit of those landing at Brisbane Airport but I was wrong , as noted in the comments by Neilâ€ ¦
The Target store is used as a reporting point for the Archerfiled aerodrome , which is to the West .
The Target represents the entry point for aircraft entering the Archerfiled control zone from the East , and has nothing to do with the Brisbane Airport , which is to the North .
Although very similar looking the Target chain of Australia is actually a completely separate company to the U.S. version .

Ragel State Machine Compiler
Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular languages .
Ragel targets C , C++ and ASM .
Ragel state machines can not only recognize byte sequences as regular expression machines do , but can also execute code at arbitrary points in the recognition of a regular language .
Code embedding is done using inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax .
The core language consists of standard regular expression operators ( such as union , concatenation and Kleene star ) and action embedding operators .
The user ’s regular expressions are compiled to a deterministic state machine and the embedded actions are associated with the transitions of the machine .
Understanding the formal relationship between regular expressions and deterministic finite automata is key to using Ragel effectively .
Ragel also provides operators that let you control any non-determinism that you create , construct scanners , and build state machines using a statechart model .
It is also possible to influence the execution of a state machine from inside an embedded action by jumping or calling to other parts of the machine , or reprocessing input .
Ragel provides a very flexible interface to the host language that attempts to place minimal restrictions on how the generated code is integrated into the application .
The generated code has no dependencies .
Ragel code looks like :
action dgt { printf ( " DGT : %c
" , fc ) ; } action dec { printf ( " DEC : .
" ) ; } action exp { printf ( " EXP : %c
" , fc ) ; } action exp_sign { printf ( " SGN : %c
" , fc ) ; } action number { /* NUMBER */ } number = ( [ 0 - 9 ] + $ dgt ( '. ' @ dec [ 0 - 9 ] + $ dgt ) ? ( [ eE ] ( [+\-] $ exp_sign ) ? [ 0 - 9 ] + $ exp ) ? ) % number ; main := ( number '
' )*;
.. and it compiles to :
st0 : if ( ++p == pe ) goto out0 ; if ( 48 <= ( * p ) && ( * p ) <= 57 ) goto tr0 ; goto st_err ; tr0 : { printf ( " DGT : %c
" , ( * p ) ) ; } st1 : if ( ++p == pe ) goto out1 ; switch ( ( * p ) ) { case 10 : goto tr5 ; case 46 : goto tr7 ; case 69 : goto st4 ; case 101 : goto st4 ; } if ( 48 <= ( * p ) && ( * p ) <= 57 ) goto tr0 ; goto st_err ;
… and it visualizes as :
What kind of task is Ragel good for ?

Lexical analysis of programming languages .
Validating user input .

Live View
News :
Live View 0.7b is now available for download
Version 0.7 added support for Vista and Server 2008 , 0.7b was a maintenance release .
For more information , see the changelog
We appreciate the feedback and encourage you to continue to report bugs and make suggestions to help make this tool more useful for everyone .
The best way to do this is to post to the forums
Live View is a Java - based graphical forensics tool that creates a VMware virtual machine out of a raw ( dd - style ) disk image or physical disk .
This allows the forensic examiner to " boot up " the image or disk and gain an interactive , user - level perspective of the environment , all without modifying the underlying image or disk .
Because all changes made to the disk are written to a separate file , the examiner can instantly revert all of his or her changes back to the original pristine state of the disk .
The end result is that one need not create extra " throw away " copies of the disk or image to create the virtual machine .
Live View is capable of booting
Full disk raw images
Bootable partition raw images
Physical Disks ( attached via a USB or Firewire bridge )
Specialized and closed image formats ( using 3rd party image mounting software )
Containing the following operating systems
Windows 2008 , Vista , 2003 , XP , 2000 , NT , Me , 98
Linux ( limited support )
Behind the scenes , Live View automates a wide array of technical tasks .
Some of these include : resolving hardware conflicts resulting from booting on hardware other than that on which the OS was originally installed ; creating a customized MBR for partition - only images ; and correctly specifying a virtual disk to match the original image or physical disk .
Lisa M. Collins , Detroit News , Oct. 14
With a dwindling tax base , a recalcitrant union work force , and pension and health care benefits it cannot afford , Detroit is running out of money and will not be able to pay its bills if major changes are n’t made , according to a report released Thursday by Detroit Auditor General Joe Harris .
“ The truth is that Detroit ’s treasury is hemorrhaging , ” said Harris , whose 10 - year term as an independent city auditor appointed by the City Council ends in November .
“ Insolvency is certain .
The only question is the timing . ”
Detroit Finance Director Sean Werdlow recently told the City Council that Detroit could run out of cash as early as December .
That same day , Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick told the council that if the unions did not agree to contract concessions by Monday , he would announce layoffs .
The city is spending $ 15 million more a month than it brings in , Harris ’ report says .
Most of these costs are in salaries and benefits .
Insolvency would mean that Detroit would not be able to pay workers and contractors on time .
If payroll , medical benefit or bond payments are late , the state government would have to consider appointing a financial manager to oversee the city ’s finances , as Michigan has done in Hamtramck and Ecorse .
{snip}
“ In Detroit , the problem is that it ’s been so horribly mismanaged , ” Schimmel said .
“ They always think the answer is money .
The answer is not money .
It ’s changing the structure .
You can liken it to what ’s happening in the corporate world .
In the ‘60s and ‘ 70s , companies were giving away health care benefits they could n’t afford to pay and all kinds of other things .
The cost was made up by the cost of the car .
The employer said , ‘ We are in our heyday ; we can afford this stuff . ’
And then China showed up , and India and everywhere else .
And Delphi said , ‘ The cost of labor is so expensive we ca n’t compete . ’
The same thing is going to happen to cities .

German police baffeled by Bush poo-flags
Police in Germany are hunting pranksters who have been stickingminiature flag portraits of US President George W. Bush into piles ofdog poo in public parks .
Josef Oettl , parks administrator for Bayreuth , said : " This has been going on for about a year now , and there must be2,000 to 3,000 piles of excrement that have been claimed during thattime .
"
The series of incidents was originally thought to be some sort ofprotest against the US - led invasion of Iraq .
And then when it continuedit was thought to be a protest against President George W. Bush ' scampaign for re-election .
But it is still going on and the police saythey are completely baffled as to who is to blame .
" We have sent outextra patrols to try to catch whoever is doing this in the act , " saidpolice spokesman Reiner Kuechler .
" But frankly , we do n't know what wewould do if we caught them red handed . "
Legal experts say there is nolaw against using feces as a flag stand and the federal legal expertssay there is no law against using feces as a flag stand and the federalconstitution is vague on the issue .
Ahh Christmas .
The tree , the stockings , the mistletoe and - of course - the holiday television programming .
Some of my fondest Christmas memories were spent in front a of television watching such classics as the animated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer or one of the myriad versions of Dickens ' ' A Christmas Carol ' .
So without further ado , I am presenting you with my big , big list of holiday specials .
I 've tried to categorize the list into subsections to make it a little more bearable and consumable .
The list is in no particular order , though the first section , ' essentials ' , are ( in my humble opinion ) the cream of the crop .
I should also note that I 've only included programs for which I was able to find online videos so you 'll notice some glaring omissions ( like ' A Christmas Story ' and ' Miracle on 34th Street ) .
In any event , here 's wishing you a great Christmas .
Now sit back and dig into some of the best Christmas content on the web ...
If you can only watch a couple of holiday specials , these are the ones to watch .
This is the proverbial ' hall of fame ' of Christmas programming .

There are n't too many specials in this category , but the legendary Rudolph the Red Nosed Reinder ( listed as entry # 3 in the " Essentials " section ) make it necessary to call out other specials in this genre .

Seabron Ward , 19 , a student at the University of Colorado at Denver , said that many students consider it a status symbol to build a big friend list .
" This one guy on my list has a thousand , " she said , a bit enviously .
" I only have 79 . "
The time - sucking potential of MySpace became an issue at the small record label where Ms. Ward works , Suburban Home Records , at least in the eyes of her boss , Virgil Dickerson .
He said he started worrying when he noticed younger employees spending hours surfing through MySpace .
" It was a drag on productivity , for sure , " Mr. Dickerson , 30 , said .
" They were always goofing around , seeing if such - and - such added them as a friend or whatever . "
In the winter three of his single employees got into relationships around the same time , meaning they could all graduate from the " single " designation on their MySpace pages .
It was a big deal , and Mr. Dickerson gave an office party , complete with an ice cream cake with the message in frosting " Congrats Kyle , Joey , and Naomi on your MySpace Upgrade ! " "
As a man who makes his living from youth culture , he had to make peace with MySpace .
His company has responded to a slow period in the record business by selling T - shirts on eBay that read , " MySpace ruined my life . "
" They 're doing pretty awesome actually , " Mr. Dickerson said .
" I 'd say , as far as a cultural phenomenon , MySpace is as important , if not more important , than MTV . "
Like MTV , it is starting to create stars that glow brightly within its own universe .
The band Hollywood Undead , which did not exist three months ago , has achieved celebrity thanks to MySpace .
" We were just a bunch of loser kids who sat around our friend 's house all day , and we started making music and recording it on computer , " one of its vocalists , Jeff Phillips , said .
About two months ago the group posted a page on MySpace decorated with pictures of all seven members disguised in hockey masks and other forms of concealment .
They also included a few original songs , a fusion of heavy metal and hip - hop .
" In a matter of weeks it got huge , and it kept on getting bigger and bigger , " said Mr. Phillips , whose left earlobe was splayed open enough to accommodate a hollow ring the size of a wedding band .
Call it overselling , but we 'll tell you up front : we have killer material for this article .
This is only because I convinced my good friend Petru Marginean to be my coauthor .
Petru has developed a library facility that is helpful with exceptions .
Together , we streamlined the implementation until we obtained a lean , mean library that can make writing exception - safe code much easier .
Let 's face it , writing correct code in the presence of exceptions is a not an easy task .
Exceptions establish a separate control flow that has little to do with the main control flow of the application .
Figuring out the exception flow requires a different way of thinking , as well as new tools .
Writing Exception - Safe Code Is Hard : An Example
Let 's say you are developing one of those trendy instant messaging servers .
Users can log on and off the system and can send messages to each other .
You hold a server - side database of users , plus in - memory information for users who are logged on .
Each user can have friends .
The list of friends is also kept both in the database and in memory .
When a user adds or removes a friend , you need to do two things : update the database and update the in - memory cache that you keep for that user .
It 's that simple .
Assuming that you model per-user information with a class called User and the user database with a UserDatabase class , the code for adding a friend might look like this :
class User { ... string GetName ( ) ; void AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) ; private : typedef vector < User * > UserCont ; UserCont friends_ ; UserDatabase * pDB_ ; } ; void User : : AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) { //
Add the new friend to the database pDB_-> AddFriend( GetName( ) , newFriend. GetName ( ) ) ; //
Add the new friend to the vector of friends friends_.push_back ( &newFriend ) ; }
Surprisingly , the two - liner User : : AddFriend hides a pernicious bug .
In an out - of - memory condition , vector : : push_back can fail by throwing an exception .
In that case , you will end up having the friend added to the database , but not to the in -memory information .
Now we 've got a problem , have n't we ?
In any circumstance , this inconsistent information is dangerous .
It is likely that many parts of your application are based on the assumption that the database is in sync with the in -memory information .
A simple approach to the problem is to switch the two lines of code :
void User : : AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) { //
Add the new friend to the vector of friends //
If this throws , the friend is not added to // the vector , nor the database friends_.push_back(&newFriend ) ; //
Add the new friend to the database pDB_-> AddFriend( GetName( ) , newFriend. GetName( ) ) ; }
This definitely causes consistency in the case of vector :: push_back failing .
Unfortunately , as you consult UserDatabase : : AddFriend 's documentation , you discover with annoyance that it can throw an exception , too !
Now you might end up with the friend in the vector , but not in the database !
It 's time to interrogate the database folks : " Why do n't you guys return an error code instead of throwing an exception ? "
" Well , " they say , " we 're using a highly reliable cluster of XYZ database servers on a TZN network , so failure is extremely rare .
Being this rare , we thought it 's best to model failure with an exception , because exceptions appear only in exceptional conditions , right ? "
It makes sense , but you still need to address failure .
You do n't want a database failure to drag the whole system towards chaos .
This way you can fix the database without having to shut down the whole server .
In essence , you must do two operations , either of which can fail .
If either fails , you must undo the whole thing .
Let 's see how this can be done .
Solution 1 : Brute Force
A simple solution is to throw in ( sic ! ) a try - catch block :
void User : : AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) { friends_.push_back(&newFriend ) ; try { pDB_-> AddFriend( GetName( ) , newFriend. GetName( ) ) ; } catch ( ... ) { friends_.pop_back ( ) ; throw ; } }
If vector :: push_back fails , that 's okay because UserDatabase : : AddFriend is never reached .
If UserDatabase : : AddFriend fails , you catch the exception ( no matter what it is ) , you undo the push_back operation with a call to vector :: pop_back , and you nicely re-throw the exact same exception .
The code works , but at the cost of increased size and clumsiness .
The two - liner just became a ten - liner .
This technique is n't appealing ; imagine littering all of your code with such try - catch statements .
Moreover , this technique does n't scale well .
Imagine you have a third operation to do .
In that case , things suddenly become much clumsier .
You can choose between equally awkward solutions : nested try statements or a more complicated control flow featuring additional flags .
These solutions raise code bloating issues , efficiency issues , and , most important , severe understandability and maintenance issues .
Solution 2 : The Politically Correct Approach
Show the above to any C++ expert , and you 're likely to hear : " Nah , that 's no good .
You must use the initialization is resource acquisition idiom [ 1 ] and leverage destructors for automatic resource deallocation in case of failure . "
Okay , let 's go down that path .
For each operation that you must undo , there 's a corresponding class .
The constructor of that class " does " the operation , and the destructor rolls that operation back .
Unless you call a " commit " function , in which case the destructor does nothing .
Some code will make all this crystal clear .
For the push_back operation , let 's put together a VectorInserter class like so :
class VectorInserter { public : VectorInserter ( std::vector < User *>& v , User& u ) : container_( v ) , commit_ ( false ) { container_.push_back ( &u ) ; } void Commit ( ) throw ( ) { commit_ = true ; } ~ VectorInserter ( ) { if ( ! commit_ ) container_.pop_back ( ) ; } private : std::vector < User*>& container_ ; bool commit_ ; } ;
Maybe the most important thing in the above code is the throw ( ) specification next to Commit .
It documents the reality that Commit always succeeds , because you already did the work  Commit just tells VectorInserter : " Everything 's fine , do n't roll back anything . "
You use the whole machinery like this :
void User : : AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) { VectorInserter ins( friends_ , & newFriend ) ; pDB_->AddFriend( GetName( ) , newFriend. GetName( ) ) ; //
Everything went fine , commit the vector insertion ins.Commit( ) ; }
AddFriend now has two distinct parts : the activity phase , in which the operations occur , and the commitment phase , which does n't throw  it only stops the undo from happening .
The way AddFriend works is simple : if any operation fails , the point of commitment is not reached and the whole operation is called off .
The inserter pop_back s the data entered , so the program remains in the state it was before calling AddFriend .
The idiom works nicely in all cases .
If , for example , the vector insertion fails , the destructor of ins is not called , because ins is n't constructed .
( If you designed C++ , would you have called the destructor for an object whose very construction failed ? )
This approach works just fine , but in the real world , it turns out not to be that neat .
You must write a bunch of little classes to support this idiom .
Extra classes mean extra code to write , intellectual overhead , and additional entries to your class browser .
Moreover , it turns out there are lots of places where you must deal with exception safety .
Let 's face it , adding a new class every so often just for undoing an arbitrary operation in its destructor is not the most productive .
Also , VectorInserter has a bug .
Did you notice it ?
VectorInserter 's copy constructor does very bad things .
Defining classes is hard ; that 's another reason for avoiding writing lots of them .
Solution 3 : The Real Approach
It 's one or the other : either you have reviewed all the options above , or you did n't have time or care for them .
At the end of the day , do you know what the real approach is ?
Of course you do .
Here it is :
void User : : AddFriend ( User& newFriend ) { friends_.push_back(&newFriend ) ; pDB_->AddFriend( GetName( ) , newFriend. GetName( ) ) ; }
It 's a solution based upon not so scientific arguments .
" Who said memory 's going to exhaust ?
There 's half a gig in this box ! "
" Even if memory does exhaust , the paging system will slow the program down to a crawl way before the program crashes . "
" The database folks said AddFriend cannot possibly fail .
They 're using XYZ and TZN ! "
" It 's not worth the trouble .
We 'll think of it at a later review . "
Solutions that require a lot of discipline and grunt work are not very attractive .
Under schedule pressure , a good but clumsy solution loses its utility .
Everybody knows how things must be done by the book , but will consistently take the shortcut .
The one true way is to provide reusable solutions that are correct and easy to use .
You check in the code , having an unpleasant feeling of imperfection , which gradually peters out as all tests run just fine .
As time goes on and schedule pressure builds up , the spots that can " in theory " cause problems crop up .
You know you have a big problem : you have given up controlling the correctness of your application .
Now when the server crashes , you do n't have a clue about where to start : is it a hardware failure , a genuine bug , or an amok state due to an exception ?
Not only are you exposed to involuntary bugs , you deliberately introduced them !
Life is change .
The number of users can grow , stressing memory to its limits .
Your network administrator might disable paging for the sake of performance .
Your database might not be so infallible .
And you are unprepared for any of these .

Up to a million unexploded cluster bombs fired by Israel could be in south Lebanon , nearly three times as many as previously estimated , UN demining experts said Tuesday .
Israel has not responded to repeated UN requests to hand over detailed information about the cluster bomb strikes , making the task of clearing the bomblets far more difficult , they said .
” The situation in south Lebanon now , as a result of 34 days of bombing is that there is extensive unexploded ordnance lying all over the place , ” Chris Clark , the top UN demining official in Lebanon , told a news conference .
Slamming Israel UN : Israel cluster bomb use in Lebanon ‘ outrageous ’ Reuters Organization ’s humanitarian coordinator in Lebanon says ‘ most bomblets were fired by the time the conflict had been largely resolved in the form of Resolution 1701 ’ ; adds : it seems to me extraordinary that they were fired off in the last hours of the war into areas where civilian populations were known to be going UN : Israel cluster bomb use in Lebanon ‘ outrageous ’
The bomblets , half the size of a can of soda , are lying in people ’s houses , gardens , on the street and on farmland , he said .
So far , 14 people have been killed and around 90 injured from unexploded ordnance since the Aug. 14 ceasefire according to the United Nations Mine Action Center in Lebanon .
A week ago , the UN put the death toll at 15 .
Clark said it could take up to the end of 2007 to clear the cluster munitions .
” The job is not over yet , the casualties will reach a record high this year , ” said Col. Wassin Rizq , head of operations of the Lebanese army ’s National Demining Office .
The United Nations ’ humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon ,
David Shearer said a week earlier that Israel could greatly accelerate the overall clearance effort by handing over the
coordinates of where it fired the bombs , but has not done so .
But Clark complained that the Israeli authorities had not responded .
” We ’ve not received this so far , we ’ve asked and we are waiting , ” he said .
No treaties forbid use of cluster bombs
Children are particularly at risk because they are attracted to unfamiliar objects ; 2 have been killed and 32 injured .
In one 2 - 3 meter ( 6.5 - 10 foot ) radius , 10 cluster bombs were found on the pavement near the entrance to a hospital in the town of Tibnin , Clark said .
The UN Refugee agency said that 200,000 people were still displaced in south Lebanon because it was unsafe to return to their homes and it could take 2 years before they could all do so .
The UN Had previously said it believed 350,000 unexploded cluster bombs were in the south , but now estimates the figure at a million on the basis of Israeli media reports .
So far , UN and Lebanese demining teams have identified 590 cluster bomb strike locations and cleared 30,000 bomblets .
Fired by cannon or dropped from an aircraft , the bombs release hundreds of smaller bomblets in mid-air that are supposed to explode upon impact .
The failure rate in Lebanon , though , was around 30 to 40 percent and the density of cluster munitions in south Lebanon is higher than witnessed in Kosovo or Iraq , the UN said .
Israel has stressed that all the weapons it uses are legal under international law .
During the 34 - day war , Israel used the bombs to attack Hizbullah fighters , who often use village streets and civilian neighborhoods in southern Lebanon to launch rockets at Israel .
No international treaties or laws specifically forbid the use of cluster bombs , but the Geneva Conventions outline rules to protect civilians during conflict .
Because cluster bombs often maim civilians after fighting ends , their use by Israel against targets in Lebanese cities and towns has been criticized by human rights groups .

But perhaps it 's time to simply do away that expectation once and for all .
Yes .
It is way PAST time to expect the WASHINGTON POST or the NEW YORK TIMES or ABC or CNN or even NPR to do anything but stenographize this Administration 's line .

Sorry Brad , but you keep clinging to the OLD definitions of " debate " ..
See , we 've not had a DEBATE on almost ANY issue in decades ..
It 's been spin versus fact all this time .. it 's just that now ..
they can't hide it as veiled fact anymore because we 've gotten so far into lala land that even fact has become a foriegn concept to most Americans .
Some day , maybe .. before I die ..

Willing to have the hard talks like civilized people .

Brad , thanks for pointing out the spin of this WaPo article .
We are so surrounded by spin , spin , spin that it can become difficult to see it for what it is .
Fact - based journalism seems to be largely a thing of the past .
It is now kosher to get both " sides " to a story and present them with equal validity , without bothering to discover where the truth lies .
The media is content to repeat someone 's lies , and call that " news " .
As RLM says , it is sickening .
Combine that with an increasingly authoritarian system that tolerates no questiong or disagreement ( have n't our schools trained us well ) , and we are in deep , deep trouble if we hope to restore our democracy at some point in the future .

Does GM take " one side " , the dead and injured take the " other side " , and elected officials take the middle ground to make a " balanced " debate of it ?
Is GM allowed to say " these failures only occur when drivers are of a certain age group " , the dead and injured object to that characterization , and the politicians say lets compromise ?
Hell no .
GM issues a recall , or class - action lawsuits take place , and perhaps court injunctions and punitive damages take place .
The situation is intolerable no matter what age group is killed and maimed more than any other .
It is irrelevant .
Why should the electronic voting machine world be any different ?
Why should the issue be framed by politicians or vendors ?
If there is a security problem it must be fixed .
The election system must be secure and not faith based .
We do not do elections based on " trust me " dynamics .
Just like the SUV's , recall the machines and work to fix them until they are secure , as determined by scientists like Prof.
Michael Shamos and Harry Hursti .
Make sure watchdog groups like BBV and VR are also comfortable with it .
And keep after the FEC until it has formulated rules for mandating security , and until those rules are strictly enforced .
Public money used to purchase voting machines must be spent with at least as much dignity as money used to purchase an SUV .
The recall injects a sense of honesty and consumer confidence into the purchase of the SUV , and there surely should be as much " consumer confidence " in the purchase of election machines .
The reason is that upon these machines stands or falls the very democracy , freedom , and accountability of the US government and the American people .
Lets use what we already know about " unsafe at any speed " and the entire consumer safety movement .
Lets translate or transfer that into " unsafe at any precinct " and a robust election machine integrity and security movement .

They framed it , as the issue being the risk of exploiting a known security ... NOT that the security risk should n't exist .
That , my friend , is called " framing an issue . "
They should be arguing that the machines should be banned for having a hole to exploit , not debating the risk of exploiting the security hole .

Overall , I think that electronic voting is a good idea because it makes it easier & quicker to vote and tabulate the results .
However , that assumes that the people in control of tabulating election results are benovelent ( honest ) individuals .
Which is apparently NOT the case ...
Most of us know some of the sordid history of Diebold : when their CEO " guaranteed " that his home state 's electoral votes would go to Bush .
when MS - Access .mdb files from the Diebold system were found on an unprotected ftp site .
Analysis of the database files indicated that there were TWO tables of votecounts used , making surreptitious manipulation of the vote much easier , if one were so inclined ...
If electronic voting machines are to be used ( and it appears that they will be ) , there should be a bipartisan and independent group defined whose job would be to setup and maintain security standards for election software .
The source code for the sofware being used should be placed in the public domain .
It should not be left in the hands of companies such as Diebold to police themselves .

The public has been schooled well .
Blaming equally the dems for what the repubs are doing FAR more is a result of that schooling .
It is like framing a " balanced " issue on faux news .
The MSM frames it as corruption that by some mysterious " law of nature " must happen equally to dems and repubs .
Yet they do not mention that they are the ones that made up that mysterious " law of nature " ... in other words the framed the issue in the deceitful tradition of faux news .
Never mind that the facts show clearly that the republican dictatorship is no where near the corruption level of any other party .
No , they are the Supremely Corrupt Party hands down .
So those of you who fancy yourself as beyond psyops should begin to detect the virus in your thinking .
It even shows up here .
Corruption is a personal matter , not a political party matter .
However , once a party is infected and it does not go into emergency innoculation mode , the infection will spread .
The dems have shown far greater resistance but the republican dictatorship has warmly welcomed the corruption .
There is clearly a difference .

You said " that assumes that the people in control of tabulating election results are benovelent ( honest ) individuals .

This is not the best way to frame the debate .
The debate is whether election machines will be afforded the same scrutiny as other consumer products .
For instance heart machines .
Would you like to be hooked up to a heart machine that is governed by quality control rules that are prefaced with " do these rules if you want to , do n't do them if you do n't want to " .
Or your SUV ... what if safety was a voluntary matter ?
It would not be easy to frame and debate the issue if we said " those who sell SUV's must be bad people because " ... NO ! ... the issue is " are the machines safe for consumers as they MUST BY LAW be " ?

Regardless of the article�s slant , Michael Shamos ' quotes signal an important shift for him .
Being quoted on corporate laxity or negligence is new for Shamos as is the concern expressed that elections should not be vulnerable to an individual�s tampering .
He has a prominent role in the Pennsylvania Department State�s voting machine testing or certification process .
Recently the Department of State has been quite busy dealing with HAVA ( Help America Vote ACT ) compliance .
Computer scientists in general have been neglected on electronic voting but Shamos and a few others are now gaining recognition in the mainstream media .
Of course we�re in trouble a la Fox News style coverage .
But these quotes and others by Shamos in the traditional media could be quite helpful for those who are actively dealing with the impact of DRE�s ( Direct Registry Electronic voting machines ) on voting protection and security in a largely --- but by no means completely --- sleeping Pennsylvania .
The mainstream media�s recent coverage of electronic voting more than suggests a story that can no longer be ignored .

Keep in mind that this is n't starting to worry the media until it affects the Republican party .
We 'll see how much coverage the problem gets come election time when Democrats seem to lose despite exit polls giving them a healthy margin .
Or , I perdict that should the Dems manage to regain the majority , the media will blame the faulty election machines .
Hate to be the eternal sceptic , but the media is desperate to defend Bush and the Republicans these days .
So much show , they are n't even just slightly slanting to the right anymore .
They are actively doing everything they can do destroy Liberals and hype up conservatives .
The fact that the media is starting to finally wake up to this issue ( after 2 years of evidence being ignored ) only tells me that they are preparing their narrative for the elections this year .
Dems win and it will be blamed on faulty voting machiens .
Republicans win and it will be because they addressed the issue quick enough to fix the problem .

They still can�t put a face , ( or voice ) on Bruce Funk , but they can put one , on people like Bear and Shamos .
This is pathetic newsmaking .
Bear is little more then a doll with a �pull string� , saying the exact same thing every time and Shamos shouldn�t be allowed to do anything but apologize for his wildly off - mark appraisals of these machines in the past .
I suspect he hasn�t changed his mind other then to try to save his credibility , and has done much to put us in this position to begin with .
It reminds me of Tony Blakely , who is on the Diane Rheam show about every two weeks and says something so ridiculous that the guests gasp , but then , he is welcomed back two weeks later .
It literally makes me cringe to hear him say �good morning Diane� .
Actually , I rarely listen to the show any more , because of the blatant right wing slant on the show .
It �s always two right wing lunatics �against� someone from Newsweek !
This �debating � between people of like views has gotten out of control in the last year all over the media .
Someone should do a updated survey .
Blakley , Bear and Shamos are , as we know , the tip of the iceberg .
These pundits and �professionals �should be in the unemployment lines , not on my television or in my newspaper .
Any bets on whether these are the only articles that will come out about this ?

Some viewers complained about the ad to the BBC's Points of View
The Faces campaign , which featured a giant animated head made up of smaller heads , generated 1,300 complaints .
The BBC had defended the images , saying they represented the viewers who are able to watch digital TV .
A spokesman for the BBC said the trailer had " finished slightly early " , after it " achieved its goal " .
Offensive
He added that the BBC would now concentrate on trailing their Christmas schedule .
In a statement , the BBC said : " The digital faces trail was one of a very long series designed to capture the attention of viewers and stimulate interest in the BBC 's digital services .
" The latest , which was first transmitted on 5 November , has been very successful in this respect and early indications are that it has achieved its goal . "
" We have been very conscious that some viewers disliked the nature of the trail , although clearly it was not our intention to offend .
" Given that we feel the trail has achieved its aims , we feel that we can now conclude the campaign and use the air - time to let viewers know about the fantastic Christmas in store for them on the BBC . "
The research could have implications for restaurateurs
But labelling an unpleasant smell with a more appealing name can improve its aroma , an Oxford University team has found .
In an experiment , volunteers asked to smell a cheddar cheese odour rated it as more pleasant when it was labelled as " cheddar " than as " body odour " .
A label was enough to make them imagine a smell even when they were sniffing clean air , the journal Neuron reports .
Word power
Professor Edmund Rolls and his team scanned the volunteers ' brains while they were smelling the test aromas to see what was going on within the brain .
When the cheddar cheese smell was labelled correctly , higher areas of the brain that interpret smells were activated .
How you describe your food could potentially have an important influence on how you perceive it
Professor Rolls
Clean air labelled as cheddar cheese activated the same areas , but to a lesser extent .
But when the cheddar cheese smell or the clean air was labelled as body odour there was no activity in this brain area .
The researchers also checked whether how big a sniff the person took might change the results , which it did not .
Pleasantness of odour
Professor Rolls said : " A word label in our experiment actually influenced the sense of perception of an odour .
" It 's the pleasantness of the odour that is being modulated in a part of the brain called the orbito - frontal cortex , which is involved with emotions .
Vieux Boulogne is thought to be one of the smelliest cheeses in the world
" That high level influence descends down into the olfactory system . "
He said the findings could be important for understanding both health and disease .
For example , the orbit - frontal cortex is often damaged in dementia and in people who have had road traffic accidents .
Sometimes , these people have altered appetites as a result that can make them prone to obesity , said Professor Rolls .
He said impaired smell processing might be linked to this .
" Of course there is also a consumer side to this .
For example , people interested in creating wine and restaurateurs .
" How you describe your food could potentially have an important influence on how you perceive it . "
Tim Jacob from the smell research laboratory at Cardiff University said : " Smell is a very special sense .
" It activates systems in the brain which are subconscious .
" Memory has a major impact on smell and we are very suggestible .
" Perfume companies have surveyed potential customers on the smell of perfumes in different coloured and shaped bottles .
" And people think it is a different perfume just because it is in a different bottle even though it is the same smell . "
" No , you misunderstand , " he said firmly .
" These looters were n't Japanese .
They were foreigners . "
The reasons for this are complex and partly cultural , but one reason is that Japan has tried hard to stitch all Japanese together into the nation 's social fabric .
In contrast , the U.S. -- particularly under the Bush administration -- has systematically cut people out of the social fabric by redistributing wealth from the most vulnerable Americans to the most affluent .
It 's not just that funds may have gone to Iraq rather than to the levees in New Orleans ; it 's also that money went to tax cuts for the wealthiest rather than vaccinations for children .
None of this is to suggest that there are easy solutions for American poverty .
As Ronald Reagan once said , " We fought a war on poverty , and poverty won . "
But we do n't need to be that pessimistic -- in the late 1990's , we made real headway .
A ray of hope is beautifully presented in one of the best books ever written on American poverty , " American Dream , " by my Times colleague Jason DeParle .
So the best monument to the catastrophe in New Orleans would be a serious national effort to address the poverty that afflicts the entire country .
And in our shock and guilt , that may be politically feasible .
Rich Lowry of The National Review , in defending Mr. Bush , offered an excellent suggestion : " a grand right - left bargain that includes greater attention to out - of - wedlock births from the Left in exchange for the Right 's support for more urban spending . "
That would be the best legacy possible for Katrina .
Otherwise , long after the horrors have left TV screens , about 50 of the 77 babies who die each day , on average , will die needlessly , because of poverty .
That 's the larger hurricane of poverty that shames our land .

アセンブラでの高速 化
この文章では、アセンブリ言語で書かれたプログラムをさらに高速化し、CPUの持つ性能を十分に発揮させる方法を説明する。高級言語で書かれたプログラムの高速化に関して言われているような点について重複して述べることはしない。つまり、
アルゴリズムを工夫して計算量を減らす。
無駄な計算をしない 。
何度も使う値は先に計算しておく。
実行に時間のかかっている部分を見つけてそこを最適化する。
内側のループに注目して最適化する。
86系CPUには、8086、8088、80186、80286、80386、80486 、Pentium 、PentiumProなど、および各種の互換プロセッサがある。この文章では、8086、80286、80386、80486、Pentium、PentiumProを扱っている。次のように分けて解説しているので、CPUに応じて、必要な章を読んでほしい。
この文章では、レジスタを次のように表記する。文中であっても「AXレジスタ」などとは書かずに単に「AX」とだけ書くことにする。
8ビットレジスタ AL , CL , DL , BL, AH , CH , DH , BH 16 ビットレジスタ AX , CX , DX , BX , SP , BP , SI , DI 32 ビットレジスタ EAX , ECX , EDX , EBX , ESP , EBP , ESI , EDI セグメントレジス タ ES , CS , SS , DS , FS , GS 命令ポイン タ( 16,32ビット ) IP , EIP フラグレジス タ( 16,32ビット ) FLAGS , EFLAGS 個々のフラグ CF , PF , AF , ZF , SF , TF , IF , DF , OF
最適化の基本は、実行される命令数を少なくしたり、実行時間(クロック数)の短い命令を使ったりして、プログラムの実行に必要な合計のクロック数を減らすことである。実行される命令数を少なくすることはたいてい、プログラム中の命令数を少なくすることになるし、実行時間の短い命令を使うことはたいてい、短い(バイト数の少ない)命令を使うことになるので、実行時間の最適化は、同時にプログラムのサイズの最適化になることが多い。
例えば 、BXが0かどうか調べる場合、普通に
CMP BX,0
TEST BX , BX
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 CMP
BX,0 3 4 3 2 1 TEST BX , BX 2 3 2 2 1
命令自体の実行時間が同じでも、あるいはむしろ長くなっても、プログラムを短くすることは有利な場合が多い。短いプログラムは、ディスクなどからメモリに読み込む時間が短くてすみ、CPUが命令をメモリからフェッチする時間が短くなり、キャッシュの使用効率(80486以降)が上がる。だから、繰り返し何度も実行されるような、速度的に重要な部分だけは、実行に必要なクロック数に注目して最適化し、それ以外は、主にコードの長さ(バイト数)に注目して最適化するのがよい。
0に関する操 作
BXを0にする( フラグが保存されなくてよい場合 )
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 MOV

[ ADDR ],0 6 16 3 2 2 # XOR AX , AX / MOV [ ADDR ] , AX 5 13 5 4 2 # オフセットと即値の追加クロックを含む
続けていくつものデータを0にする場合は、かなりバイト数の節約になる。なお、連続したデータ領域を0で埋めるには、REP
STOS命令を使うとよい。
なお、メモリ上のデータが0かどうか調べるには、素直に
CMP [ ADDR ] ,

例 ;SIが指す多倍長数を 、DIが指す多倍長数に加える ; 多倍長数の長さはCXワード CLC L1 : LODSW ADC [ DI ] , AX INC DI INC DI LOOP L1 JC L2 ; オーバーフローしたときの処 理
ワードレジスタに対す るINC, DEC 命令は1バイトですむので、コードを短くするのに便利である。ワードレジスタに対する2までの加減算はINC,DEC命令を使うとよい。ただし、少し遅くなる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 ADD
BX,2 3 4 3 2 1 INC BX / INC BX 2 6 4 4 2
バイトレジスタに対し てINC, DEC 命令を使いたいときも、ワードレジスタに対する命令を使ったほうがよいこともある。例えばBXの下位バイトが0FFHでないことがわかっている場合、INC
BLの代わりにINC BXを使うと1バイト短くなる。
オペランドの値が0であることがわかっているとき、INC命令で1にしたり、DEC命令で0FFFFhにしたりすることができる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 MOV
AX,1 3 4 2 2 1 INC AX 1 3 2 2 1
オペランドの値が変化してよいときには、INC命令で0FFFFhかどうか調べたり、DEC命令で1かどうか調べたりすることができる。

即値
レジスタの上位バイトまたは下位バイトだけに関する、即値との論理演算は、部分レジスタを使うと1バイト短くなる。
例 AND BX,0FFFEH → AND BL,0FEH ( フラグは異なる ) OR BX,8000H → OR BH,80H ( フラグは異なる ) TEST BX,0006H → TEST BL,06H
逆に、レジスタ全体についての命令を使って、部分レジスタを二つ同時に変更することができる。例えば、桁上がりがなければ、
ADD AX,0FF01H は、ALに1を加え、AHから1を減ずる。

BXの値を変化させたくない場合は特に、後者が有利である。
アドレス指定で変位を使う場合、変位が8ビットで収まる(-128〜+127)ときには、範囲外のときに比べて1バイト短くなる。変位が0のときは変位なしとみなされて、2バイト短くなり、場合によっては実行時間も短縮される。
ただし、BP間接だけは、変位なしのエンコーディングがないので、変位が128〜+127のときに1バイト短くなるだけである。この他、BPを含むアドレシングモード([ BP+SI ]なども含む)は、デフォルトのセグメントがSSである点も特殊なので、注意して使うべきである。

3 11 3 2 1 8086では遅くなるので注意する。使えるレジスタの組合せに制限があるが、[BX+SI ]のようなレジスタ同士の加算や、[BX+SI+8]のような3オペランドの加算もできる。
単純に、あるアセンブラシンボルのオフセットアドレスをレジスタに入れるなら、LEA命令ではなくMOV命令を使うべきである。

ADDRがGROUP擬似命令でグループ化されたセグメント内のシンボルの場合、
MOV BX , OFFSET DGROUP : ADDR
のように、グループ名を明記する必要がある。ASSUME擬似命令でセグメントレジスタがそのグループを指していることを宣言している場合、そのセグメントレジスタを使って、
MOV BX , OFFSET DS : ADDR のように書いてもよい。 アセンブラによっては 、LEA 命令を使って書いても、自動的にMOV命令を使ったコードを出力してくれる( TASM 2.0など)。その場合には、上記の問題も同時に解決するので便利である。

オペランドの値が0または1であることがわかっているとき、SHR命令を使うと、オペランドを0にすると同時に、元のオペランドをCFにコピーすることができる。真偽値のクリアとテストを同時に行うのに便利である。真偽値をクリアでなくセットしたければ、続けてINC命令を使う(INC命令はCFを変更しない ) 。
80186以降では、オペランドの符号を値として設定したいときに、SHR,SAR命令を使うとよい。
負なら1 SHR AX,15 負なら -1 SAR AX,15
ジャンプ命令は、実行時間のかかる命令なので、なるべく使わないようにする。条件ジャンプを使う場合には、なるべくジャンプしなくてすむようにする。例えば、次のコード
TEST BP , BP JNZ L1 MOV AX,100 JMP L2 L1 : MOV AX,200 L2 :
MOV AX,100 TEST BP , BP JZ L2 MOV AX,200 L2 :
フラグをうまく使うと、条件ジャンプ命令をなくすことができる(フラグの節を参照 ) 。
無条件ジャンプのジャンプ先が1バイトまたは2バイト先で、フラグが変化してよいときは、JMP命令の代わりに、
DB 0A8H ; TEST AL , n
DB 0A9H ; TEST AX,
nn
ジャンプ先が同一セグメント内 のJMP命令は、ジャンプ先が-128〜+127バイトの範囲なら、短い形のエンコーディング(short形式)を利用できる。だから、ジャンプ先がなるべく近くになるようにルーチンを並べ変えれば、コードを短くすることができる。
マルチパスのアセンブ ラ( TASM で/ Mスイッチをつけたときなど )
では、可能なら自動的にshort形式を使ってくれる。そうでないアセンブラを使うときには、オペランドの前に「SHORT」をつける。
80286以前では、条件つきジャンプ命令にはshort形式しかないので、ジャンプ先が-128〜+127バイトの範囲にない場合には、無条件ジャンプ命令と組み合わせる必要がある。マルチパスのアセンブラ( TASMで/Mスイッチをつけ、JUMPS擬似命令を使った場合など)では、必要なら自動的に、例えば
JAE L3
JNAE L99 JMP L3 L99 :
JAE TO_L3
TO_L3 : JMP L3
マルチパスでないアセンブラでも、マクロを使えば、上のL99を使う形式を自動的に生成できる(前方参照のラベルが128バイトまでに入った場合でもこうなってしまうが)。このとき生成した
JMP L3 の位置もマクロで覚えておけば、以後の同じラベルにとぶジャンプ命令で、TO_L3の代わりに使える。
コール/リターン
CALL SUB1 RET
JMP SUB1
条件つきRET命令はないので、条件ジャンプ命令と組み合わせて使う。
JNAE L99 RET L99 :
JAE L_RET
L_RET : RET
速度的に重要な部分では、サブルーチンの呼び出しとリターンにかかる時間を節約するために、サブルーチン本体を呼び出し場所に埋め込む(インライン展開)とよい。長いサブルーチンなら、サブルーチンの中で頻繁に使われる部分だけを埋め込むこともできる。例えば、
SUB1 : CMP SI , [ BUFFER_END ] JNE L1 ; ; 長い処理 ; L1 : LODSB RET
LOOP L1 CALL SUB2 L1 : LODSB
SUB2 : ; ; 長い処理 ; MOV CX , [ BUFFER_END ] SUB CX , SI RET
farルーチンは、呼び出しやリターンに時間がかかるので、なるべく使わないようにする。コードを複数のセグメントに分けて書かなければならない場合でも、なるべく同じセグメント内で処理がすむようにする。場合によっては、farコール用のエントリを別に作ったり、ルーチンを二つのセグメントにコピーしたりしたほうがよいこともある。
同じセグメントのfarルーチンを呼ぶときには、次の置き換えが可能である。
呼び出し元と先が同じセグメントのfarルーチンを呼ぶ
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 CALL FAR PTR SUB2 6 28 13 +m 17+m 18 PUSH CS / CALL NEAR PTR SUB2 5 29 10 +m 9+m 6 この最適化を自動的に行うアセンブラもある( TASM 2.0など) 。8086では1クロック損するが、元が遅いのであまり気にしなくてよい。命令フェッチまで考えると、すぐにPUSH CSを実行できるぶん速いかもしれない。
レジス タ
オフセットBXのメモリのワードデータに3を加える。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 MOV AX , [ BX ] / ADD AX,3 / MOV [ BX ] , AX 7 31 11 8 3 ADD WORD PTR [ BX ] ,3 3 21 7 7 3
86系CPUの汎用レジスタは、SPを除いて7個しかなく、アドレシングモードや、いくつかの命令では特定のレジスタしか使えないため、レジスタ割り付けは簡単ではない。しかし、よく考えれば多くの場合、速度が重要なコード部分で使っているほとんどすべての値をレジスタに置くことができる。
AX , CX , DX , BXの四つのレジスタは 、AL , AH , CL , CH , DL , DH , BL , BHのように二つずつに分けて使うことができる。値を1バイトで表現できるときには、これらのレジスタを使うとよい。1バイトでは表現できないように見えても、実際に必要なのは1バイトだけですむ場合もあるので、注意する。例えば、上位バイトが共通な二つの数を使う場合などである。
1ビットで表現できるような値をたくさん使うときには、レジスタの各ビットをそれに割り当てて、AND,OR,XOR,TEST命令で操作するとよい。
レジスタ毎に性格が異なるため、以下に示すレジスタの特徴を考慮して、値を割り当てるレジスタを決める。
AX 乗除算の演算数や結果。ストリング操作命令のデータ。IN,OUT 命令のデータ。他のレジスタに比べて、1バイト短いエンコーディングを持つ命令がある。
CX ループ命令やストリング操作命令のカウンタ。CLは、ローテート/シフト命令のカウンタ。
DX 16ビット乗算の結果の上位が入る。16ビット除算の被除数の上位を入れる。16ビット除算の結果の剰余が入る。IN,OUT命令のポートアドレス。
BX バイトレジスタに分割できるレジスタのうち、アドレス指定に使える唯一のもの。
SP スタックポインタ。普通は他の用途には使わない。 BP アドレス指定に使えるが、デフォルトセグメントがSSなので注意。 SI アドレス指定に使える他、ストリング操作命令の転送元アドレスを指定する。
DI アドレス指定に使える他、ストリング操作命令の転送先アドレスを指定する。
CやPascalなどのコンパイル結果では、スタックフレームにローカル変数を置き、BPを使ってアクセスする方法がよく使われる。しかし、最初からアセンブリ言語で書かれたプログラムでは、普通はスタックフレームを使わないので、BPを、カウンタ、真偽値、一時記憶などに使うことができる。
サブルーチンに引数を渡したり、サブルーチンから結果を受け取ったりするときには、なるべくレジスタを使う。どのレジスタを使うかは、いっしょに使う他のルーチンとの兼ね合いで決める。アセンブリ言語では、サブルーチンをどこから呼び出すかはすべて把握できるので、重要な呼び出し場所で都合がよいように、レジスタの割り当てを決めればよい。
場合によっては、セグメントレジスタを値の一時記憶として使ってもよい。ただし、80286以降のプロテクトモードでは、セグメントレジスタに好きな値を入れることはできない。
スタッ ク
MOV CX,10 L1 : PUSH CX ; ; いろいろな処理 ; POP CX LOOP L1
PUSH , POP 命令は、メモリをオペランドにすることもできる。メモリ上のデータをコピーするときに、空いているレジスタがなければ、PUSHとPOPを使ってスタック経由でコピーするとよい(80486以降では逆効果 ) 。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 PUSH
AX / MOV AX , [ SI ] / MOV [ DI ] , AX / POP AX 6 46 16 12 4 PUSH WORD PTR [ SI ] / POP WORD PTR [ SI ] 4 43 10 10 10 MOVSW ( 参考 ) 1 18 5 8 7
セグメントレジスタを直接コピーする命令はないので、普通は汎用レジスタを経由するが、スタックを経由するとコードが短くなる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 MOV
AX , DS / MOV ES , AX 4 4 4 4 6 PUSH DS / POP ES 2 18 8 9 6
80186以降では、セグメントレジスタに即値を入れたいときにも、スタックを経由するとコードが短くなる。セグメントアドレスが1バイトで表せるときは、さらに1バイト短くなる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 MOV AX , DGROUP / MOV ES , AX 5 6 4 4 4 PUSH DGROUP / POP ES 4 8 9 4 PUSH 0 / POP ES 3 8 9 4
8086には、定数 をPUSHする命令がないので、空いているレジスタに定数を入れてPUSHする。アセンブラによっては、8086用にアセンブルするモードで
PUSH 999
PUSH AX PUSH BP MOV BP ,SP MOV [ BP - 2],999 POP BP
サブルーチンの入口で、使うレジスタをPUSHし、出口でPOPすると、サブルーチン中でレジスタを、高級言語のローカル変数のように使うことができる。サブルーチンの再帰呼び出しにも対応できる。
スタックポイン タ( SP ) に対して直接演算してもよい( 80486以降ではアドレス生成インターロックに注意)。例えば、
ADD SP,6 とすると、スタックに積んだ値を三つ捨てることができる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 POP
AX / POP AX / POP AX 3 24 15 12 3 ADD SP,6 3 4 3 2 1
PUSH BP MOV BP ,SP SUB SP,100 ; ; 処理 ; MOV SP , BP POP BP RET
スタックを、データの順序を反転するための一時記憶として使うこともできる。例えば、10進数表示ルーチンを、10での除算の繰り返しで実現する場合、桁の順序を反転する必要があるが、スタックを使うと次のように書ける。
; AXを10 進で表示する ; AX , CX , DXは破壊される ; PRCHRはALの文字を表示するサブルーチン
PRDEC : XOR CX , CX L1 : XOR DX , DX PUSH CX MOV CL,10 ; CH=0 DIV CX POP CX PUSH DX INC CX TEST AX , AX JNZ L1 L2 : POP AX ADD AL , '0 ' CALL PRCHR LOOP L2 RET
サブルーチンのリターンアドレスもスタックに積まれるので、スタックを操作する命令と組み合わせて使うことができる。例えば、nearサブルーチンで
ADD SP,2 とすると、リターンアドレスを捨てることができるし、
POP BX とすると、リターンアドレス をBXに入れることができる。また、
CALL SUB1 JMP SUB2
PUSH OFFSET SUB2 JMP SUB1
なお、
PUSH BX RET
PUSH ES PUSH BX RETF
リロケート可能なルーチンで命令ポインタ( IP ) の値を知りたいときには、CALL命令が相対アドレス指定であることを利用して、次のようにする。
CALL L3 L3 : POP BX
サブルーチンの最後で別のサブルーチンを呼ぶ場合、
CALL SUB RET
JMP SUB
複数のスタックを切り替えて使うときには、ときどきSSとSPを変更する必要がある。SSを変更する命令の直後(8086ではセグメントレジスタを変更する命令の直後)には、割り込み( NMIも含む)がかからないようになっているので、SS,SPの順に変更すればCLI命令を使う必要がない。
演算結果が0か、正か、負か、符号つき/符号なしのオーバーフローなどを判断する。
比較の結果が等しいか、符号つき/符号なしで大きいか/小さいかなどを判断する。
多倍長演 算( ADC , SBB命令では、CFをキャリーまたはボローとして使う)
ローテート/シフト命令であふれたビットがCFにはいる。RCL,RCR命令は、CF経由でローテートする。多倍長のシフトや、ビット順反転に利用できる。
10進補正命令は、前の演算で設定されたAFの値を使う。
フラグにはこの他にも、いろいろな使い道がある。
1ビットの値の受け渡し CFやZF、場合によってはPF,SF,OFを値の受け渡しに使う。サブルーチンのエラーや、判定結果などを返すのに便利である。MS-DOSのファンクションリクエストにも、CFやZFで結果を返すものがある。受け側では普通、条件ジャンプ命令で処理を分けることになる。
CFには専用のセット、リセット、反転命令があり、独立して操作できるが、他のフラグはそうではない。そのため、可能な状態を考えて値をフラグに割り当てる必要がある。ZFをセットするには、
CMP AL , AL を使うとよ い( CF , SF , OF はリセットされる ) 。ZFをリセットするには、レジスタが変化するが、
OR AL,0FFh などを使うとよ い( CF, OFはリセットされ 、SFはセットされる) 。CFは、他のフラグをいじるとリセットされてしまうことが多い(AND,OR,XOR,TEST命令では必ずリセットされる)ので、後でSTC命令を使ってセットするのもよい。
フラグを設定するときに、わざわざそのための命令を使う必要は必ずしもない。例えば、リングバッファが空かどうかをZFに返すルーチンは、リングバッファの先頭と末尾のポインタを比較して、そのままリターンすればよい。また、ALに数字のASCIIコードが入っているかどうかをCFに返すルーチンは、次のようにすればよい。
CMP AL , '0 ' CMC JNC NO CMP AL , '9'+1 NO : RET ALが変化してよければ 、 SUB AL , '0 ' CMP AL,10 RET でよい。このように、実際の処理で使いやすいようにフラグに値を割り当てるとよい。 もし、 値が0かどうかによって、CFを設定しなければならなくなったら、次のようにする。
AXが0ならCFをセット CMP AX,1 AXが0以外ならCFをセット NEG AX 逆に 、CFの値によってレジスタに0または0FFFFhを入れ、ZFをその通りに設定するには、
SBB AX , AX などを使 う( CFは保存される ) 。 条件ジャンプ命令には 、JBE命令( CFとZFのどちらかがセットされていたらジャンプ)のように、フラグを複合して調べる命令もある。これを使うと便利な場合もある。
CF の値を使った演算 例えば 、AXが100未満ならCXに1を加えたいなら、 CMP AX,100 ADC CX,0 とすればよい。逆 に 、AXが100以上な らCXに1を加えたいなら、 CMP AX,100 SBB CX , - 1 とすればよい。二番目の命令の即値を適当な値にすれば、1だけ異なる二つの数を場合分けによって加減算できる。 例えば、AXが100未満ならCXを30に、そうでなければ10にしたければ、
CMP AX,100 SBB CX , CX AND CX,20 ADD CX,10 とすればよい。定数の値によっては 、AND命令やADD 命令は不要である。 今までの例では 、CFをCMP命令でセットしたが、ADD,SUB命令や、ローテート/シフト命令などでもよい。特に、レジスタの値の符号によってCFを設定するときは、
0以上ならセット CMP AX,8000H または SUB AX,8000H 負ならセット SHL AX,1 または ADD AX , AX または ADD AX,8000H などがあるので、レジスタの値を変えてよいか、どちらでセットされるのが都合よいかに応じて選ぶ。
CF を最上位桁として利用 加減算の結果をすぐに2で割るときは、CFを最上位桁として利用できる。例えば、AXとCXの符号なし平均をとるときは、
ADD AX , CX RCR AX,1 とすればよい。 フラグの保存 フラグを設定する場所と使う場所の間にフラグを変化させる命令があるときには、フラグを保存する必要がある。普通はPUSHF, POPF命令を使う。AHが空いていて、OFを保存する必要がなければ、LAHF,SAHF命令を使うと、速く、何度も取り出せて便利である。AHが空いていなくても、例えばALが空いていて、CFだけ保存するのなら、
SBB AL , AL で保存して、 ROL AL,1 で取り出せばよ い 。80386と80486では、 ADD AL , AL で取り出したほうが速いが、8回までとなる。 Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 PUSHF 1 10 3 4 4 LAHF 1 4 2 2 3 SBB AL , AL 2 3 2 2 1 Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 POPF
1 8 5 5 9 SAHF 1 4 2 3 2 ROL AL,1 2 2 2 3 3 ADD AL , AL 2 3 2 2 1
86系CPUでは、MOV命令などの演算を行わない命令では、フラグは変化しない。これを利用すると、次のようなコードを書ける。
TEST AX , AX MOV AX,100 JZ L1 MOV AX,200 L1 :
メモリ
A DB ?
B DB ?
MOV WORD PTR A,5*256+3 ; Aに3,Bに5
メモリ上のバイトデータをワードレジスタにゼロ拡張して入れたいことが頻繁にあるなら、バイトデータの次のアドレスに0を入れておく。例えば、
COUNT DB ?
DB 0
MOV COUNT , AL ; バイトデータの書き込み MOV CX , WORD PTR COUNT ; ワードデータとして読み込み
初期化の必要なワークエリアは、大きな領域を規則的に埋める場合を除き、初期化のコードを書くより、データそのものを書いたほうがよい。例えば、10の冪のテーブルが必要な場合、
MOV AX,1 MOV DI , OFFSET ES : POW10 MOV CX,5 L1 : STOSW MOV DX , AX SHL AX,1 SHL AX,1 ADD AX , DX SHL AX,1 LOOP L1
POW10 DW 1,10,100,1000,10000
同時に使うことのない二つのワークエリアは、同じメモリ領域にとることができる。こうすると少ないメモリでプログラムを実行できるようになるし、80486以降ではキャッシュを有効に使うことになる。ただし、誤って同時に使ってしまわないように、常に気をつける必要がある。
プリフィックスのうち、セグメントオーバーライドプリフィックスは、プログラムの工夫でなくすことができる。多くの命令では、DSをデフォルトセグメントとして使うので、よく使うデータはなるべくDSでアクセスできるセグメントに置く。BPを含むアドレシングモードでは、デフォルトセグメントがSSになるので、DSとSSが同じセグメントを指しているとき以外は、DSの指すセグメントにあるデータをアクセスするのにBPを使ったアドレシングモードを使わないほうがよい。
セグメン ト
もし、速度的に重要な場所でセグメントの大きさを越えるデータを使うときには、セグメント内の処理を行うループの外に、セグメントレジスタを設定するコードを置くようにし、セグメントレジスタを頻繁にいじるのは避けるべきである。例えば、セグメントアドレスBXからBPパラグラフをクリアするには、次のようにする。
XOR AX , AX MOV DI , AX L1 : MOV ES , BX MOV CX , BP CMP CX,1000H JB L2 MOV CX,1000H ADD BX , CX L2 : SUB BP , CX SHL CX,1 SHL CX,1 SHL CX,1 REP STOSW TEST BP , BP JNZ L1
XOR AX , AX L1 : MOV DI , AX MOV ES , BX MOV CX,8 REP STOSW INC BX DEC BP JNZ L1
異なるセグメントにある何種類かのデータを同時に使いたいなら(例えば、二つまたは三つのデータに演算をして画面に書き込むような場合)、CSやSSの指すセグメントにデータを置いてもよい。逆に、データのあるセグメントの一部にコードを書いたり、スタックをとったりしてもよい。ただし、プロテクトモードでは、コードセグメントに書き込みができないので、CSを使ったデータアクセスでは読み出ししかできない。
データが128Kバイトまでなら、DSとESに分ける方法がある。例えば、MS-DOSの16ビットFATのように、高々2^16個の16ビットデータを扱う場合は、16ビットデータを上位と下位に分け、下位をDSの指すセグメントに、上位をESの指すセグメントに格納することができる。こうすれば、セグメントレジスタの値を変えずに全データをアクセスできる。
値の利 用
XOR AX , AX MOV [ X ] , AX L1 : ; ; 処理 ; MOV AX , [ X ] INC AX MOV [ X ] , AX CMP AX , [ X_LIMIT ] JNE L1
複数のレジスタに同じ値を入れたいときには、一つのレジスタに入れた値をMOV命令でコピーすればよい。バイトレジスタでなければ、コードが短くなる。8086ではクロック数も短縮される(バイトレジスタでも)
。Pentium とPentiumProでは、依存関係が増えて並列度が下がるかもしれないので、注意する。
AXのmsbが0であるとわかっているとき、例えば直前にAXを0にした場合などで、DXを0にしたいときは、CDW命令を使うとバイト数を節約できる。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 XOR DX , DX 2 3 2 2 1 CWD 1 5 2 2 3
アラインメン ト
80286以前では、命令のフェッチはワード単位で行われるので、よく使うジャンプ先は偶数アドレスに置いて、ジャンプ先の最初の命令全体がなるべく速くフェッチされるようにするとよい。アセンブラでは、EVEN擬似命令を使うと、その次の命令が偶数アドレスになるように、必要ならNOP命令を出力する。サブルーチンの先頭のラベルはこれで問題ないが、途中のラベルのときは、NOPの実行時間を節約するために、前の命令を故意に1バイト長くしたほうがよいこともある。例えば、次のコードでEVEN擬似命令がNOPを生成するなら、
MOV AX , [ SI+4 ] EVEN L1 : MOV [ DI ] , AX
DB 8BH,84H,04H,00H ; MOV AX , [ SI+0004 ]
L1 : MOV [ DI ] , AX
時間のかかる命令を減らす
乗算命令も、時間のかかる命令なので、速度が重要な場所では、MOVとシフトと加算の組合せに置き換える。例えば、AXを3倍するには
MOV CX , AX SHL AX,1 ADD AX,CX
時間のかかる演算の結果は、あらかじめ計算しておいて、メモリ上に置いておいたほうがよいこともある。例えば、円を描くための三角関数の値などは、メモリ上にテーブルを作っておいたほうがよい。
Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 LODSB 1 12 5 5 5 MOV AL , [ SI ] / INC SI 3 16 7 6 2 STOSB 1 11 3 5 5 MOV ES : [ DI ] , AL / INC DI 4 19 # 5 4 3 # # プリフィックスのクロックを含む
ストリング操作命令は、短い代わりに、使えるレジスタは固定されている。変えられるのは、方向(読み込みまたは書き込み後に、SIまたはDIを増やすか減らすかをDFで指定)と、転送元のセグメント(セグメントオーバーライドプリフィックスを使う)だけである。
リピートプリフィックスを使って繰り返し処理ができるのも、ストリング操作命令の有利な点である。ただし、8086では、セグメントオーバーライドプリフィックスと同時に使うと、うまく動作しないことがある(途中で割り込みがかかったときの処理にミスがあるため ) 。
REP STOS 命令や REP MOVS 命令で、たくさんのデータをストア/コピーするときには、なるべく大きいオペランドサイズを使うとよい。繰り返し回数が奇数の場合を考慮するなら、
SHR CX,1 REP MOVSW RCL CX,1 REP MOVSB
XCHG 命令
特定のレジスタを必要とする命令を、値を変えて交互に使う。例えば、DX:AXから始まるCX個の32ビット数を、ES:[DI ]から順にストアするには、
L1 : STOSW XCHG AX , DX STOSW XCHG AX , DX ADD AX,1 ADC DX,0 LOOP L1 とする。サブルーチン、ファンクションリクエストを呼ぶのにも使える。余分なレジスタを使う必要がないのが利点である。

レジスタの退避と値のロードを同時に行う。同様に、値のストアとレジスタの復帰を同時に行う。例えば、
PUSH BX MOV BX , [ POINTER ] ; ; 処理 ; MOV [ POINTER ] , BX POP BX の代わり に XCHG BX , [ POINTER ] ; ; 処理 ; XCHG BX , [ POINTER ] とする。 Bytes 8086 80286 80386 80486 PUSH

クロック数が増えてもバイト数を減らしたいときは、AXから、またはAXへのMOV命令の代わりに、XCHG命令を使うこともある。

ビットはめ込み ビットマップの操作などで、用意したマスクのビットが1の桁にだけ、あるパターンをはめ込みたいことがある。例えば、 元のビットマップ 01110111 パターン 10101010 マスク 00111100 結果 01101011 のような処理である。元のビットマップが[DI]に、パターンがAXに、マスクがDXにある場合、
AND AX , DX NOT DX AND [ DI ] , DX OR [ DI ] , AX のように処理すればできるが 、 XOR AX , [ DI ] AND AX , DX XOR [ DI ] , AX のようにしたほうが速く短い 。
のような処理である。元のビットマップが[ DI ]に、パターンがAXに、マスクがDXにある場合、 のように処理すればできるが、 のようにしたほうが速く短い。 マスクの生成 上記のようにしてポリゴンなどを描画するには、与えられた範囲のマスクを生成する必要がある。 下位のCL桁が0で残りは1 MOV AX,0FFFFH SHL AX , CL 下位のCL桁が1で残りは0 MOV AX,0001H SHL AX , CL DEC AX 下位 のCL+1桁が0で残りは1 MOV AX,0FFFEH SHL AX , CL 下位 のCL+1桁が1で残りは0 MOV AX,0002H SHL AX , CL DEC AX 上位 のCL桁が0で残りは1 MOV AX,0FFFFH SHR AX , CL 上位のCL桁が1で残りは0 MOV AX,0FFFFH SHR AX , CL NOT AX 上位 のCL+1桁が0で残りは1 MOV AX ,7FFFH SHR AX , CL 上位 のCL+1桁が1で残りは0 MOV AX,8000H SAR AX , CL PC-9800シリーズのグラフィックVRAMのように、バイト毎にmsbが左端に対応しているような場合には、バイト単位でマスクを作るか、ワード単位のマスクを作ってから、上下のバイトを入れ替えればよい。

80286以前では、同等な命令列と比べてJCXZ,LOOP命令が高速なので、ループカウンタにはなるべくCXを使い、JCXZ,LOOP命令を使うようにする。80386以降では、JCXZ,LOOP命令の使用はバイト数の節約にしかならず、特に80486以降では遅いので注意する。

ループ中で2つの値を交互に使いたい場合、XOR命令を使うと便利である。例えば、ALに3と6を交互に入れたいときには、ループ中に
XOR AL,5 を入れる。ループ開始前 のAX とDXを交互 にAX に入れたいときには、ループの外に XOR DX , AX を置き、ループ中に XOR AX , DXを入れる 。
3つあるいは4つの値を交代で使いたいときは、次のようにする。
3 つの定数a , b , c ループ外 : MOV AX , a MOV CX , a XOR b ループ中 : XOR AX , CX XOR CX , AX XOR CX , a XOR b XOR c
3つのレジスタの値AX , CX , DX ループ外 : XOR CX , AX XOR DX , CX ループ中 : XOR AX , CX XOR CX , AX XOR CX , DX

速度的に重要なループは、完全に展開する(繰り返し回数が固定のとき)か、適当な回数(例えば8回)だけ展開しておいてそれを繰り返す(繰り返し回数が可変のとき)ようにし、繰り返すためのジャンプなどのオーバーヘッドを少なくするとよい。
ループを展開するとき、前後の処理をつなげて高速化できることがある。例えば、
LODSB INC AL STOSB LODSB INC AL STOSB
LODSW INC AL INC AH STOSW
最初の境界までのビットの処理 バイトまたはワードごとの処理 残ったビットの処 理
ループではないが、再帰呼び出しされるサブルーチンで、引数が1ずつ増加または減少するものも、引数について展開することがある。こうすると、引数のためのレジスタも節約できるし、引数に関する演算を先にすませることもできる。
書き換えた命令が既にフェッチされていた場合、書き換え前の命令が実行されてしまう。特に80386や80486では、プリフェッチキューが大きいので、このようなことが起こりやすい。対策は、命令を書き換えてから実行するまでの間に、IPを変更する命令を実行して、キューをフラッシュすることである。
書き換えて余った場所に何もしない命令を入れる必要があることがある。1バイトならNOPがよさそうだが、80386以前だと3クロックかかるので、フラグが変化してよいなら、2クロックですむCLCなどがよい。2バイトなら、
MOV AL , AL などがよ い 。3バイトなら、フラグが変化するが、 TEST AX,0 などがよい 。
実行時コード生 成

複数のCPUで動くコード
複数の種類 のCPUを対象にするときには、最も低レベルのCPUの持つ命令セットの範囲でコードを書く。普通は、コードが短くなるように、または最も低レベルのCPUで速くなるように最適化するが、特に高速にしたい場合には、CPUの種類を見分けて、それぞれのCPUに適したコードを実行するようにしたほうがよい。
CPU の種類を判別するには、次のようにする。
準備中
判別には時間がかかるので、判別結果はメモリに格納しておいて、必要な場所で場合分けに使う。判別したときにコードの一部を直接書き換えたり、実行時にコード生成したりする方法も使われる。
32ビット命令
特に32ビットとは関係ないコードでも、32ビット命令を使う価値はある。例えば、
REP MOVSW の代わりに REP MOVSD を使うと、高速化できる。ループの展開でも、32ビットぶんまとめて処理することで高速化が期待できる。また、4バイトまでのキーワード、例えば「ON 」 、「 OFF 」 、「 AUTO 」などをCMP命令で直接比較することもできる。
32ビットアドレシングモードでは、ベースレジスタとインデックスレジスタの組合せがほぼ自由になったので、レジスタがアドレシングに使えるかどうか意識する必要はなくなった。次のようなアドレシングモードがある。
[ base ] base はEBP以外 [ offset ] [ base+disp ] [ base+index*scale ] base はEBP以 外 [ offset+index*scale ] [ base+index*scale+disp ] baseはベースレジス タ( EAX , ECX , EDX , EBX , ESP , EBP , ESI , EDI ) indexはインデックスレジス タ( EAX , ECX , EDX , EBX , EBP , ESI , EDI ) scaleはスケー ル( 1,2,4,8 ) offsetは32ビットのオフセットアドレス dispは8または32ビットの変位(定数)
インデックスレジスタを使うと、使わないときと比べて命令が1バイト長くなる。
インデックスレジスタを使わなくても、ESPをベースレジスタにした場合には、他のレジスタと比べて命令が1バイト長くなる。
ESP をインデックスレジスタにすることはできない。
変位は8または32ビットなので、変位が-128〜+127の範囲を出ると命令が3バイト長くなる。
[ index*scale ]
という形式はないので、これを使おうとすると、[offset+index*scale]の形式がoffsetが0として使われ、[base+index*scale]の形式より4バイト長くなる。
16ビットアドレシングモードと同様に、EBPをベースレジスタとして使う、変位なしの形式はない。
ベースレジスタがESPまたはEBPのときは、デフォルトセグメントがSSになる。通常はDSである。
80386 ベースレジスタとインデックスレジスタの両方を使うと、1クロック追加。
80486 インデックスレジスタを使うと、1クロック追加。即値を含む命令で、変位またはオフセットを使うと1クロック追加。
Pentium 即値を含む命令で、変位またはオフセットを使うと、ペアリング不可。
PentiumPro なし
16ビットモード(リアルモードと仮想8086モードを含む)で32ビットデータを扱う命令を使うと、命令の前に1バイトのオペランドサイズプリフィックスがつく。また、32ビットのアドレシングモードを使うと、命令の前に1バイトのアドレスサイズプリフィックスがつく。このため、16ビットモードで32ビットのデータやアドレシングモードを使うのは、32ビットが本当に必要な場合に限るべきである。
32ビットプロテクトモードでは、32ビットのデータやアドレシングモードを使ってもサイズプリフィックスはつかない。8ビットのデータもオペランドサイズプリフィックスを必要としない。逆に、16ビットのデータやアドレシングモードを使うと、プリフィックスがつく。だから、32ビットモードではなるべく16ビットのデータやアドレシングモードを使わず、8,32ビットのデータと32ビットのアドレシングモードを使うとよい。
80386以降のプロセッサで、プリフィックスつきの命令を使った場合の影響は、次の通りである。ここで、プリフィックスには、先頭バイトが0Fhの命令の0Fhも含む。
80386 デコードに追加クロックが必要になるが、たいていは命令の実行時間に隠れる。問題になるのはたいてい、ジャンプ先の最初の命令だけである。
80486 near条件ジャンプ以外は、デコード時間に1クロック追加される。前の命令が2クロック以上かかるときは、実行時間に隠れる。
Pentium near条件ジャンプ以外は、デコード時間に1クロック追加される。前の命令ペアが2クロック以上かかるときは、実行時間に隠れる。また、ペアリングに制限ができる。
PentiumPro 0Fh以外はデコードに1クロック追加される。
追加された命 令
32ビットへの符号拡張をするCWDE命令と、64ビットへの符号拡張をするCDQ命令が追加された。また、ゼロ拡張や符号拡張とMOV命令を複合した、MOVZX,MOVSX命令が追加された。これらは、80386では比較的高速で短く、便利である。MOVSX命令は、普通に
MOVSX EAX , BYTE PTR [ EBX ] のように使えるほか、 MOVSX ECX , CX のように 、EAX 以外のレジスタに対す るCWDE 命令として使うこともできる。なお、
MOVZX EBX , BX を使うよりは 、 AND EBX,0FFFFH または LEA EBX , [ BX ] を使うほうがよい。どちらもMOVZXより高速だが、AND命令はバイト数が多くなり、LEA命令は80486とPentiumでアドレス生成インターロックを受けるので、必要に応じて使い分ける。
任意のレジスタ同士、あるいはレジスタとメモリのIMUL命令が追加された。フラグレジスタを無視すれば、MUL命令としても使える。
SHLD , SHRD 命令は、多倍長シフトのための命令だが、32ビットレジスタのデータを16ビットずつ二つに分けるために使える。例えば、
SHLD ECX , EDX,16 とすると 、EDXの上位16ビットをECXに入れることができる( EDXは変化しないので、EDXの下位16ビットはDXにはいっている)。ただし、Pentiumでは、
PUSH EDX POP DX POP CX
逆に、二つの16ビットレジスタのデータをつなげて一つの32ビットデータにするには、SHRD命令を使うよりは
SHL ECX,16 MOV CX , DX
PUSH CX PUSH DX POP ECX
ビット操作命 令( BT , BTR , BTS , BTC ) では、ビット位置をレジスタまたは即値で直接指定できるため、ビット位置が可変のときのビット操作に便利である。次の例では、ビットのテストをしているが、BT命令を使った場合は結果がCFに入るので注意する。
DXのビットCXをテストする。 Bytes 80386 80486 MOV
AX,1 / SHL AX , CL / TEST DX , AX 7 7 5 BT DX , CX 3 3 3
BTR , BTS , BTC 命令は、ビットのリセット、セット、反転を行うと同時に、変更前のビットの状態をCFに入れる。ビットテストが不要の場合でも、BTR,BTS,BTC命令を使うと、コードが短くなったりワークレジスタが必要なくなったりするので便利である。
DXのビットCXをセットする。 Bytes 80386 80486 MOV
AX,1 / SHL AX , CL / OR DX , AX 7 7 5 BTS DX , CX 3 6 6
レジスタに対するビット操作命令と、ビット位置が即値のビット操作命令では、ビット位置は下位4または5ビットのみが有効である。メモリに対する、ビット位置がレジスタ指定のビット操作命令は、全ビットが有効になるので、非常に便利である。そのアドレスのワードまたはダブルワードだけでなく、符号つき16ビットまたは32ビットのビット位置で指定される任意のメモリのビットを操作できる。例えば、DS:SIで始まるビットベクトルのビットCXをテストするには、
MOV BX , CX SHR BX,3 AND CL,7 MOV AX,1 SHL AX , CL TEST [ SI + BX ] , AX
80386には他にも追加された命令があるが、普通のプログラムではあまり使わない。
LEA 命 令
例 : LEA ESI , [ EBX+EAX * 4+8 ] ; ESI にEBX+EAX *4+8を入れる LEA ESI , [ EBX + ( EAX+2 ) * 4 ] ; 上と同じ
LEA EAX , [ EAX+EAX * 2 ] ; 3 倍 LEA EAX , [ EAX+EAX * 4 ] ; 5 倍 LEA EAX , [ EAX+EAX * 8 ] ; 9 倍
16ビットモードでは、レジスタに定数を入れるときにLEA命令を使うと有利な場合がある。短い定数や、16ビットのオフセットを、32ビットレジスタに入れたい場合である。
EAXに3を入れる( 16ビットモード ) Bytes 80386 80486 MOV EAX,3 6 2 2 # LEA EAX , DS : [ 3 ]
5 2 2 # # サイズプリフィックスのデコードのための追加クロックを含む
EBXに16ビットセグメントのシンボルVのオフセットを入れる(16ビットモード)
Bytes 80386 80486 MOV EBX , OFFSET V 6 2 2 # LEA EBX , [V ] 5 2 2 # # サイズプリフィックスのデコードのための追加クロックを含む
ローテート/シフト
80386では、RCL,RCR命令は遅くなったので、なるべく使わないほうがよい。80486以降でも、回数が1以外のRCL,RCR命令は遅いので、使わないほうがよい。
80386 メモリアクセスが2回必要になり、最低2クロックの追加サイクル(メモリアクセスのウェイトによる)が必要になる。
80486 データがキャッシュにある場合でも、3クロックの追加サイクルが必要になる。80486のキャッシュは一部を除いてライトスルー方式だが、書き込みのときも4段の書き込みバッファがあふれなければ3クロックの追加サイクルになる。書き込みバッファがあふれたり、データがキャッシュにない場合の読み込みでは、メモリアクセスの方式やクロックの倍率により異なる。
Pentium 追加サイクルは80486とほぼ同様である。キャッシュがライトバック方式になったので、キャッシュにあるデータの書き込みでは書き込みバッファを意識する必要はない。書き込みバッファは1段なので、キャッシュにないデータに書き込むときは注意する。
PentiumPro データの読み出しがクワッドワード( 8バイト)境界をまたぐと4クロックの追加サイクルが必要になる。キャッシュライン(32バイト)境界をまたぐとさらに遅れる。データの書き込みでは、キャッシュライン境界をまたぐときだけ追加サイクルが必要になる。
コードのアラインメントは、プロセッサによって事情が異なり、80386以降で共通するやり方はない。強いていうなら、80386は元々遅いのでアラインメントによる遅れの寄与は小さいとみなして、80486に合せておけばよいだろう。
80386 命令のフェッチはダブルワード単位に行われるため、ジャンプ先の最初の命令がなるべく最初のダブルワードに入るようにする。
80486 命令のフェッチはキャッシュから16バイト単位で行われるため、ジャンプ先の最初の命令が16バイト境界をまたがないようにする。またいだ場合は2クロックの遅れが生じる。最初の命令が1クロックで実行できるときには、次の命令も含めて16バイト境界をまたがないようにする。
Pentium 命令のフェッチはキャッシュラインの境界をまたいでも遅れないので、コードのアラインメントは必要ない。
PentiumPro 命令のフェッチはキャッシュから16バイト単位で行われ、3命令まで同時にデコードできるため、ジャンプ先の最初の3命令がなるべく16バイト境界をまたがないようにする。

この状態を利用するメリットは、次の通りである。
リアルモード用の開発ツール( リンカ、デバッガ) を利用できる。
他の、リアルモード用のプログラム(デバイスドライバなど)と組み合わせるときに、モード切り替えのオーバーヘッドがない。
16ビットモードで動作するため、32ビット命令や32ビットアドレシングを使うと、プリフィックスが必要になり、コードが長くなる。80486以降では、実行速度も低下する。
仮 想86モードでは、この状態を利用できない。
BSWAP 命令
MOV EAX,0FFFFFFFFH SHR EAX , CL BSWAP
32ビットのビット逆順に使うこともできる。共通/80286以前のビット逆順の方法をそのまま32ビットにすると21命令必要だが、BSWAP命令を使えば17命令ですむ。
MOV ECX , EAX AND EAX,55555555H XOR ECX , EAX ROL EAX,2 OR EAX , ECX MOV ECX , EAX AND EAX,66666666H XOR ECX , EAX ROL EAX,4 OR EAX , ECX MOV ECX , EAX AND EAX,78787878H XOR ECX , EAX ROL EAX,8 OR EAX , ECX ROR EAX,7 BSWAP EAX
遅い命 令
リピートプリフィックスなしのストリング操作命令は遅いので、速度が要求されるところではMOV命令とINC命令などの組合せに置き換えたほうがよい(ストリング操作命令を参照)。そうすれば、Pentiumではペアリングも可能になる。
リピートプリフィックスつきのストリング操作命令は、繰り返し回数が少ないときのオーバーヘッドが大きいので、注意して使う。80486ではREP
LODSとREP STOS 、PentiumではREP LODSとREP SCASとREP CMPSは、普通の命令の組合せに置き換えたほうが速い。
JCXZ , LOOP 命令などは遅いので、普通の命令の組合せに置き換えたほうが速い。
MOVZX命令は高速化されなかったので、先にレジスタ全体をクリアしてからMOV命令を使うほうがよい。そうすれば、Pentiumではペアリングも可能になる。
オフセットEBXのバイトデータをゼロ拡張してEAXに入れる(32ビットモード)
Bytes 80386 80486 MOVZX EAX , BYTE PTR [ EBX ] 3 3 3 XOR EAX, EAX / MOV AL , [ EBX ] 4 6 2
シフト命令は高速化されなかったので、なるべく使わないほうがよい。ローテート/シフトで説明した、SHL→ADD、RCL→ADCの置き換えも利用するとよい。Pentiumでは一部を除いて高速化されたので、使ってもよい。
RCL , RCR命令を除いて、即値のローテート/シフトは、即値が1以外のためのエンコーディングのほうが速いので、
SHR EAX,1 を SHR EAX ,21H で置き換 え る( 80186以降では、シフトカウントは下位5ビットのみ有効)などして利用するとよい。
SAHF 命令は2クロックかかるので、ビットを直接調べたほうが速い。Pentiumではペアリングも可能になる。80386でも高速化されるが、寄与は小さい。

キャッシ ュ
80486は、8 KB( DX4は16KB ) の命令データ混在型のキャッシュメモリを内蔵している。データがキャッシュにのっていれば、1クロックで読むことができる。また、命令はキャッシュから16バイト単位でフェッチされる。命令がキャッシュにのっている限り、命令のフェッチ時間を考慮する必要はほとんどない(考慮が必要な点はアラインメントを参照 ) 。
80486 のキャッシュは、 write back enchanced 486DX2 を除いてライトスルー型で、キャッシュにのっているデータに書き込むと、メモリにも書き込まれる。4段の書き込みバッファがあるため、バッファに余裕がある限り書き込みも見かけ上1クロックで実行できる。命令とデータがすべてキャッシュにのっていれば、メモリに書き込む命令を実行しない限り、CPUからメモリへのアクセスは発生しないし、書き込む命令を続けて実行してバッファがいっぱいにならない限り、メモリへのアクセスで実行が待たされることもない。
80486のキャッシュは、16バイトのライン512個(DX4は1024個)から成る。各キャッシュラインは、16で割り切れる物理アドレスから始まる連続する16バイトのデータに対応する。キャッシュされていないデータを読むときには、CPUはキャッシュライン全体をメモリから読む。このとき、キャッシュラインのうちアドレスの小さいほうから読むのではなく、必要なデータを含むダブルワードから順に読む。
キャッシュラインは任意の物理アドレスのデータを保持できるわけではない。80486のキャッシュは
4 - way set associative 型で 、4個のキャッシュラインのセッ ト128 個( DX4は256個)で構成されている。各物理アドレスに対して割り当てられる可能性のあるキャッシュラインは1セット中の4個だけである。どのセットが使われるかは、物理アドレスのビット4〜10(DX4は4〜11)で決まる。物理アドレスの残りのビット(11〜31または12〜31)は各キャッシュラインに記憶される。
キャッシュの置換アルゴリズムは、次の通りである。各セットは、どのラインが新しいかを、3つのビットを使って記録している。4つのラインをA,B,C,Dとすると、一つはAまたはBとCまたはDのどちらが最近使われたかを、一つはAとBのどちらが最近使われたかを、一つはCとDのどちらが最近使われたかを記録している。キャッシュラインを置き換えるときには、この情報に基づいて古いほう捨てる。そのため、最も古いものではなく二番目に古いものを捨てることがある。
この後、キャッシュラインが満たされる前に、同じキャッシュライン中のデータをアクセスした場合、マニュアル上ではキャッシュライン全体を満たすまで待たされることになっているが、実際にはもっと長く(2倍程度)待たされる。この余計な待ち時間は、メモリアクセスの順番を工夫することで、なくすことができる。データをアドレス順に読み出している場合には、次のキャッシュライン中のデータに一度アクセスして、確実に現在のキャッシュラインを満たしてから、現在のキャッシュライン中のデータを順次処理すればよい。
例えば、80486の場合、ESIにダブルワードの配列のオフセット(キャッシュライン境界にアラインされているとする)、ECXに要素数/4がはいっているとき、
L1 : ADD EAX , [ ESI ] ADD EAX , [ ESI+4 ] ; ここで余計に待たされる ADD EAX , [ ESI+8 ]
ADD EAX , [ ESI + 12 ]
ADD ESI ,16 DEC ECX JNZ L1
ADD EAX , [ ESI ] DEC ECX JZ L2 L1 : ADD EAX , [ ESI +16 ] ADD EAX , [ ESI+4 ] ADD EAX , [ ESI+8 ] ADD EAX , [ ESI + 12 ]
ADD ESI ,16 DEC ECX JNZ L1 L2 : ADD EAX , [ ESI+4 ] ADD EAX , [ ESI+8 ] ADD EAX , [ESI + 12 ]
インデックスレジスタを使う命令は、1クロック余計にかかる。また、オフセットと即値の両方、または変位と即値の両方を使う命令も、1クロック余計に時間がかかる。また、この後述べる部分レジスタストールやアドレス生成インターロックによって余計なクロックが必要になることもある。この時間も続く命令のデコードの遅れを隠すのに使える。
XOR AH , AH INC AX
Write Read ストール AL AH 1 AH AL 1 AL AX 1 AH AX 1 AL EAX 1 AH EAX 1 AX EAX 1 AX AL 0 AX AH 1 EAX AL 0 EAX AH 1 EAX AX 0
Pentiumでは、部分レジスタストールは発生しない。
PentiumProでは、レジスタの一部に書き込んだ後、全体を読み出すと、その読み出す命令が5クロックの間ストールする。80486とは異なり、例えばALに書き込んだ後AHを読み出してもストールは発生しない。
ADD EBX,4 MOV EAX , [ EBX ] INC ECX
ADD EBX,4 INC ECX MOV EAX , [ EBX ]
MOV EAX , [ EBX+4 ]
ADD EBX,4 INC ECX
80486では、直前に変更したレジスタが、全体ではなく部分レジスタの場合、部分レジスタストールと合わせて、合計2クロックの遅れが生じる。ここで注意するべきことは、16ビットアドレシングモードを使った場合でも、32ビットぶん使っているかのように遅れることである。つまり、アドレシングモードが16ビットか32ビットかにかかわらず、直前に変更したレジスタが32ビットレジスタなら遅れは1クロックですむが、8または16ビットレジスタなら2クロックになる。
PUSH , POP , CALL , RET命令は、SPまたはESPレジスタを使ったメモリアクセスを行うので、直前の命令でSPまたはESPを変更した場合には、アドレス生成インターロックを受ける。ただし、80486では、CALL命令は遅れない。
PUSH , POP , CALL , RET命令はまた、SPまたはESPレジスタを変更するが、80486とPentiumは専用の回路を持っており、続けてPUSH,POP,CALL,RET命令を使ったり、メモリアドレスの指定にESPを使ったりしても、遅れはない。ただし、PentiumでRET命令に即値オペランドがある場合に限り、次の命令でアドレス生成インターロックが発生する。
ペアにできる命令は次の通りである。
U, Vどちらのパイプでもペアにできる MOV
r/m,r/m/i
PUSH r/i
POP r
LEA r, m
ADD SUB AND OR XOR CMP r/m,r/m/i
TEST r/m,r/m
TEST acc, i
INC DEC r/m Uパイプでのみペアにできる ADC SBB r/m,r/m/i
ROL ROR RCL RCR r/m,1
SHL SHR SAL SAR r/m , i Vパイプでのみペアにできる Jcc JMP short / near
CALL near
複雑そうだがペアにできる命令としては、LEA命令と、CALL(near直接)命令が挙げられる。逆に、ペアにできそうでできない命令としては、NEG,NOT,BSWAP命令と、TEST命令の一部の形式が挙げられる。
連続する二つの命令がペアになる条件は次の通りである。
先の命令 はUパイプでペアにでき、後の命令はVパイプでペアにできる。
先の命令が書き込んだレジスタを、後の命令で読んだり書いたりしない。これにはいくつか例外がある。
PUSH とPUSH 、PUSHとCALL、POPとPOPはペアにできる( スタックポインタの特例)
。PUSHとPOP、POPとPUSHもペアにできるが、同じメモリをアクセスするため同時には実行されない。
後の命令が条件ジャンプ命令のときは、先の命令がフラグレジスタに書き込んでいてもペアにできる(フラグレジスタの特例 ) 。
両方の命令がフラグレジスタに書き込んでいてもペアにできる(フラグレジスタの特例 ) 。
部分レジスタは全レジスタとして扱われる。
MOV 命令のうち、 MOV m , acc の形式は、accに書き込むかのように扱われる。
MMX な しPentiumでは、プリフィックスつきの命令は、Uパイプでのみペアにできる。ただし、near条件ジャンプはVパイプでペアにできる。MMX対応Pentiumでは、サイズプリフィックスがついた命令や0Fhで始まる命令も、両方のパイプでペアにできる。
オフセットと即値、または変位と即値を持つ命令は、MMXなしPentiumではペアにできず、MMX対応PentiumではUパイプでのみペアにできる。
文献3には、7バイトを越える命令はペアにできないと書かれているが、プリフィックスなしでは上の条件のほうが強く、7バイトの命令にプリフィックスをつけて8バイトにしてもペアにできたので、これは誤りであろう。もしかすると、文献4のPrefixesの章(HTML版日本語訳ではプリフィックスの章)に書かれている、MMX対応PentiumのFIFOバッファの制限を簡略化して説明したのかもしれない。
ペアになった命令の実行は、普通は、クロック数が多いほうの命令のクロック数ぶんかかる。ただし、ある場合には、余計なクロックを必要とすることがある。
ペアリングを有効に使うためには、次のようなことに注意する。
ペアにできない命令の使用を避け、複雑な命令を単純な命令に分割するなどして、ペアにできる命令を使う。ペアにすると後の命令の実行開始が遅れる、read-modify-write命令も、3命令に分割するとよい。
ペアにできるように命令を並べ替える。
キャッシュバンクを意識して命令を並べ替える。例えば、
MOV [ EBX ] , AL MOV [ EBX+1 ] , AL MOV [ EBX+9 ] , AL MOV [ EBX+10 ] , AL は MOV [ EBX ] , AL MOV [ EBX+9 ] , AL MOV [ EBX+1 ] , AL MOV [ EBX+10 ] , AL とする 。
は とする。 16 ビットコード でPUSH やPOP を続けるときは、初めのスタックポインタの値が4の倍数+2になるようにして、キャッシュバンク競合を避ける。
キャッシ ュ
MMX な しPentiumでは、命令キャッシュとデータキャッシュはともに、32バイトのラインサイズで、2-way set associative型である。そのため、80486よりキャッシュの競合が起きやすい。MMX対応Pentiumでは、どちらも4-way set associateve型に変更されている。
自己改変コードに対応するため、命令キャッシュにあるメモリアドレスに書き込む命令を実行すると、そのキャッシュラインは無効にされる。もし命令がデコードされていたら、それも無効にされる。命令は改めてメモリから(データキャッシュからではない)読み込まれる。
実際には、メモリからの読み出しでも命令キャッシュのキャッシュラインは無効にされ、また、一つ前のキャッシュラインも無効にされる。そのため、命令を含むキャッシュライン(32バイト単位)、またはそれに続く32バイト中にあるデータにアクセスすると、次にその命令を実行するときにメモリアクセスが発生することになり、実行速度がかなり低下してしまう。命令とデータはなるべく番地を離して置くようにするとよい。

ペアリングのために、最大2命令をはさんでアドレス生成インターロックが発生する場合がある。
Pentiumには、部分レジスタストールはない。文献3には、「レジスタが書き込まれたときと同じ境界で読み込めない場合は、ストールが発生する。これは、AH/EAX、BH/EBX、CH/ECX、DH/EDXのレジスタの組み合わせに該当する」とあるが、実際にはストールは観察されなかった。
ここでは 、MMXな しPentiumの分岐予測と予測ミスのペナルティーについて簡単に説明する。分岐予測の対象になるのは、IPまたはEIPを変更するすべての命令である(INTやIRETも含むか?)。分岐命令の実行が始まる前に、Branch Target Bufferに登録されている分岐先のアドレスにある命令(分岐しないと予測したときは次の命令)のフェッチとデコードを始めることで、分岐命令は高速に実行される。予測が失敗すると、フェッチとデコードをやり直すので、次の命令の実行開始まで時間がかかる。
分岐予測に成功した命令は、命令一覧に書かれたクロック数で実行できる。
分岐予測に失敗した命令は、通常は3クロック、ペアになって実行される条件ジャンプの場合は、4クロックの追加クロックが必要になる。
分岐予測に失敗した場合、次に実行される命令ペアに分岐命令が含まれていると、これは分岐しないと予測される。分岐する命令の実行が続く場合、最初に予測ミスが起きると、予測ミスがずっと続くことになる。
分岐しないと予測されるのは 、Branch Target Bufferにない命令と、続けて2回以上分岐しなかった命令だけである。それ以外はすべて分岐すると予測される。
このため、次の点に注意してコードを書くとよい。
条件ジャンプはなるべくジャンプするように配置する。
予測ミスの起きやすい分岐命令の後に実行される命令ペアに、分岐命令を入れないようにする。
コードの重要な部分では、サブルーチンを異なる場所から交互に呼んだりしないようにする。

PentiumProでは、レジスタの一部に書き込んだ後、全体を読み出すと、その読み出す命令が5クロックの間ストールする。ストール中でも、依存関係のない他の命令を実行することはできるが、5クロックをうめるのは難しい。それよりは、部分レジスタを使わなくてすむようにコードを変更したほうがよい。その際、PentiumProではMOVZXや乗算命令が高速化されていることを、利用するとよい。例えば、
MOV AL , [ ESI ] MOV AH , AL SHL EAX,8 ; ストール MOV AL , AH MOV [ EDI ] , EAX ; ストー ル
MOVZX EAX , BYTE PTR [ ESI ] MOV ECX , EAX SHL EAX,16 MOV EDX , ECX SHL ECX,8 OR EAX , EDX OR EAX,ECX
MOVZX EAX , BYTE PTR [ ESI ] IMUL EAX,10101H MOV [ EDI ] , EAX
特別な場合として 、SUB命令またはXOR命令でレジスタ全体をクリアしてから部分レジスタ(AH,CH,DH,BHを除く)を変更した場合は、ストールは発生しない。Pentium以前の、MOVZX命令が低速なCPUでも同じコードを実行したい場合、 MOVZX AL , [ ESI ] の代わり に
XOR EAX, EAX MOV AL , [ ESI ]
なお、ALとAHのような組み合わせでは、ストールは発生しないばかりか、同時にアクセスすることもできる。もちろん、書き込んだデータの一部を読み出す場合には、ストールは発生しない。
PentiumProではまた、メモリに書き込んだデータと書き込む前のデータを合成して読む必要があるときには、8クロックの間ストールする。例えば、
MOV [ EBX ] , AL MOV ECX , [ EBX ]
MOV [ EBX ] , EAX MOV ECX , [EBX+2 ]
MOV [ EBX ] , EAX MOV AL , [ EBX+2 ]
PentiumProではこの他に、FLAGSに関するストールにも注意する必要がある。次のような命令では、4〜5クロックのストールが発生する。

もし偶数なら 、2で割る。
もし奇数なら、3倍して1を足す。
n=1,2,3,…と1から順に確認するのなら、1になるまで繰り返さなくても、nより小さくなるまで繰り返せばよい。Pascal風に書くと、次のような操作を各nについて行えばよい。
x :=n ; s:=0 ; repeat s:=s+1 ; if odd( x ) then x:=x * 3+1 else x:=x div 2 until x<n
x :=n ; s:=0 ; repeat s:=s+1 ; if odd( x ) then begin s:=s+1 ; x:=( x div 2 ) * 3+ 2 end else x:=x div 2 until x<n
他にも、nが偶数のときは省いてよいなど、計算の手間を減らす方法がいろいろあるが、本題からはずれるので省略する。

実はまだ、改良できる 。Pascalで書いたときからある冗長性なのだが、then節を通ったときはxの値が増加するので、次の処理であるnとの比較は無駄で、単に次の繰り返しに入ればよい。L2をループの最初のラベルとすると、

Pentium向けの最適化
最初のINC命令とMOV命令はペアになる。次のMOV命令とSHR命令は、SHR命令がUパイプでのみペアになるため、ペアになれない。MOV命令は単独で実行される。続くRCR命令もUパイプでのみペアになるので、SHR命令も単独で実行される。RCR命令とJNC命令は、フラグレジスタの特例によりペアになる。この部分は、INC命令をSHR命令とRCR命令の間にはさめば(INC命令がCFを変えないことを利用)、すべてペアにすることができる。
L2 : MOV EBX , EDX MOV ECX , EAX SHR EDX,1 INC EBP RCR EAX,1 JNC E2
次のINC命令とADC命令は、ADC命令がUパイプでのみペアになるため、ペアになれない。次のADC命令とJNC命令はペアになれる。INC命令がCFを変えないこと再び使って、二つのADC命令の間にはさめば、すべてペアにすることができる。
ADC EAX , ECX INC EBP ADC EDX , EBX JNC L2
次のMOV命令とJMP命令はペアになるが、ここは上のJNC命令が予測ミスしたときに通るので、必ず予測ミスする(分岐予測を参照)
。JMP命令が最初のペアに入らないように、NOPを挿入してもよいが、次のように
MOV ESI,1 を2命令に分けて、合計のバイト数を減らすことにする。
XOR ESI , ESI INC ESI JMP E3
次のCMP命令とJA命令もペアになるが、 JNC E2 のジャンプ先なので、これで予測ミスが起きると必ず予測ミスする( 分岐予測を参照 ) 。
JNC E2 では予測ミスが起きやすいので、ペナルティーを頻繁に受けることになる。これもNOPを挿入する代わりに、CMP命令とSBB命令を使って、64ビットの大小比較をすることにする。
E2 : MOV EBX , EDX CMP EAX , ESI SBB EBX , EDI JNC L2
以上の改良の結果は次のようになる。ループ中の命令が実行されるパイプラインを、コメントのU, Vで示す。

GCCとの比較
次の関数は、この章の始め でPascal風に書いた処理を、C言語で書いたものである。
unsigned long check ( unsigned long long n ) { unsigned long long x=n ; unsigned long s=0 ; do { l1 : s++ ; if (( x&1 ) !
=0 ) { s++ ; x=(x >>1 ) * 3+2 ; goto l1 ; } x >> =1 ; } while ( x > =n ) ; return s ; }
これをGCCのバージョン2.7.2 p( Pentium対応版 ) でコンパイルした。出力は特殊なアセンブリ言語で表記されているため、MASMやTASMで使われている表記に直したものを右側につけて示す。

分岐予測がすべて成功した場合の、ループ1回のクロック数は、xが偶数で10クロック( JNE L13 が実行されたとき ) 、xが奇数で18クロックである。初めからアセンブリ言語で書いた場合と比べて、2〜3.6倍のクロック数を要する。遅さの主な原因は、ペアにできずに4クロックを要する、SHLD,SHRD命令を使っていることであるが、それを直してもまだ遅い(それぞれ6クロックと11クロック)。この章で使ったような、アセンブリ言語らしい最適化方法はほとんど使われていない。GCCの最適化は、まだ不十分である。

MadSci Network : Neuroscience Query :
Thank - you very much for this most intriguing question .
I am sorry it took me so long to respond , but despite an exhaustive search , I have been unable to find any research related to your question .
However , for readers who may have never heard of phosphenes , I am going to present a brief description of this phenomena , and in the end , I will present my own opinion of why it prompts you to fall asleep .
Most of the information below about phosphenes is based on a publication by Suzanne Carr and other information I have found on the Internet .
The Carr reference and a few others are given below .
It has been widely reported that prisoners confined to dark cells often see brilliant light displays , which is sometimes called the ``prisoner 's cinema . ''
Truck drivers also see such displays after staring at snow - covered roads for long periods , and pilots may experience phosphenes , especially when they are flying alone at high altitudes with a cloudless sky .
In fact , whenever there is a lack of external stimuli , these displays can appear .
They can also be made at will by simply pressing your fingertips against closed eyelids .
In addition , they can also be produced by an electrical shock .
In fact , reportedly , it was high fashion in the eighteenth century to have a phosphene party .
It is noted that Benjamin Franklin once took part in such an encounter where a circle of people holding hands would be shocked by a high - voltage electrostatic generator , so that phosphenes were created each time the circuit was completed or broken .
The earliest account of phosphenes is given by the Bohemian physiologist Johannes Purkinje in 1819 .
These subjective images are called phosphenes ( from the Greek phos , light , and phainein , to show ) .
Oster ( 1970 ) suggests that , because phosphenes originate within the eye and the brain , they are a perceptual phenomenon common to all mankind .
The visual areas of the brain at the back of the head ( occipital lobe ) can also be stimulated to produce phosphenes .
In regards to your question , I have never heard of the feedback loop you describe whereby viewing phosphenes would lead to a sleep state , nor have I been able to find any research on it .
The brain contains many ( perhaps an infinite number ) of feedback loops .
One of these involves a pathway between a part of the frontal lobe of the brain , which extends through the cingulate gyrus , caudate nucleus and down to the thalamus .
This particular pathway is associated with the neurotransmitter serotonin , which is involved in many biological processes , including those of depression and sleep , and has been associated with the disorder called obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Some people speculate that this particular pathway may also be active ( or perhaps too active ) in people who have problems falling asleep .
So perhaps watching phosephenes may help calm down or de-activate this particular system .
Another part of the brain that may be involved is the reticular activating system which is involved with arousal and sleep .
These may be interesting areas for you to pursue .
However , I would not entirely give up on the notion that the reason you fall asleep is due to relaxation or self - hypnosis .
For example , watching phoshenes may help clear your mind of distractions that keep you awake .
Similarly , this intense type of focusing is not unsimilar to various methods used for meditation .
In any event , I am sorry that I cannot give you a direct answer to your question , but I encourage you to keep searching !
Here are some sources of information that you can pursue .

I think one final problem is that SICP makes the point that there are conflicting definitions of " closure " .
Some of the books missing the term " closure " from the index might have used a different term so as not to confuse it with the " mathematical " definition , ...
That is a pretty good reason to leave " closure " out , but in the case of at least one textbook -- the one I co-authored -- it is n't the actual reason that motivated us .
I explained that in a privately emailed reply a moment ago to " bogo . "
Since this off - topic thread seems to be be continuing with or without my provocation , I herewith include it for the rest of you : Date : Tue , 6 Feb 2001 09:55:39 - 0600 From : Michael Bogomolny < bogo@bigfoot.com > ...
From a teaching perspective , Concrete Abstractions ( Hailperin , Kaiser , Knight ; Brooks / Cole Publishing Company ) and Simply Scheme ( Harvey and Wright ; MIT Press ) are both good books .
However , they both fail the " closure test " .
...
Thanks for the endorsement .
I probably should n't take our failure on the " closure test " as something to feel defensive about ( after all , we are in good company ) , but I thought I 'd offer some perspective on * why * we did n't include this vocabulary term .
Instead , we simply use " procedure " .
The reason is that " closure " only makes sense in a particular historical context , where procedures had previously been left " open " , that is with free variables not associated with any particular binding .
This was the case in various pre-Scheme Lisps , and lead to what was known as the " funarg problem , " short for " functional argument " , though it also was manifested when procedures were used in other first - class ways than as arguments , for example , as return values , where it was confusingly called the " upward funarg problem " ( by contrast to the " downward funarg problem , " where the arg was genuinely an arg ) .
The " funarg problem " is what logicians had been calling " capture of free variables , " which occurs in the lambda calculus if you do plain substitution , without renaming , in place of proper beta-reduction .
So anyhow , an evolutionary milestone in the development of the Lisp family of languages was the realizations that procedures should be " closed " , that is , converted into a form where all the variables are bound rather than free .
( The way this is normally done , as others have written in this thread , is by associating the procedure text , which still has free variables , with a binding environment that provides the bindings . )
Because this was such a big deal in terms of the languages ' evolution , Lisp hackers took to using the word " closure " rather than just " procedure " to emphasize that they were talking about this great new lexically scoped kind of procedure .
As with so many words , it stuck , and people continued using it long after the distinction it was making ceased to be relevant .
( When was the last time you saw a procedure that had n't been closed ? )
I find this kind of anachronism endearing , just like I grinned a bit when I recently caught myself calling my compilers textbook the " red dragon book " -- a name that distinguishes it from the " green dragon book , " which has been extinct for a decade and a half .
But I would never consciously teach a new student to say " red dragon book " rather than just " dragon book . "
And I would never consciously teach a new student to say " closure " rather than just " procedure . "
So that 's the reason we left it out of our book -- it is a name that makes a distinction no longer relevant , and which would require historical context to explain that would distract from the main issues at hand .
( Of course , the distinction may be relevant in other contexts , like a programming languages course where you are learning about how languages work , and how else they could work .
So in EOPL it may make perfect sense . )

Is Mischa trying to make a statement with that tshirt ?
Not that ‘ Drop knowledge not bombs ’ could be a little dangerous if people start dropping books from the sky .
But as statements come , Mischa is definitely making one with that Alice McCall skirt .
It ’s a piece from Australia designer , Alice McCall ’s , spring summer 2006 range , nicknamed The Zig Zag club .
Mischa probably picked up the skirt along with other freebies during her paid trip to Australia curtsey of David Jones department stores to help promote their Spring / Summer launch .
You can pick up the matching top as seen at the Alice McCall Sping / Summer show modeled by British model Lily Cole at OzDesigner.com now .

Rice is one of the world 's most important crops
The Norwegian government will hollow out a cave on the ice - bound island of Spitsbergen to hold the seed bank .
It will be designed to withstand global catastrophes like nuclear war or natural disasters that would destroy the planet 's sources of food .
Seed collection is being organised by the Global Crop Diversity Trust .
" What will go into the cave is a copy of all the material that is currently in collections [ spread ] all around the world , " Geoff Hawtin of the Trust told the BBC's Today programme .
Mr Hawtin said there were currently about 1,400 seed banks around the world , but a large number of these were located in countries that were either politically unstable or that faced threats from the natural environment .
" What we 're trying to do is build a back - up to these , so that a sample of all the material in these gene banks can be kept in the gene bank in Spitsbergen , " Mr Hawtin added .
The Norwegian government is due to start work on the seed vault next year , when it will drill into a sandstone mountain on Spitsbergen , part of the Svalbard archipelago , about 966 km ( 600 miles ) from the North Pole .
Permafrost will keep the vault below freezing point and the seeds will further be protected by metre - thick walls of reinforced concrete , two airlocks and high security blast - proof doors .
The number of seeds and types of plants in the bank would be determined by the countries wishing to use it .
PBS set to ask if voting rights are ' under assault '
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday August 30 , 2006
Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) is set to air a segment posing the possibility that the voting rights of many Americans are under attack , RAW STORY has learned .
A nation - wide push for laws to target voter fraud is likely to disqualify many who are legally eligible to vote , the PBS program NOW will claim in a segment tomorrow night titled , " Your right to vote -- is it under assault ? "
A Florida law that could have leveled enormous fines against non-partisan groups organizing voter registration drives , and a Georgia law requiring photo ID at the polls will be put under scrutiny by the program .
These laws , NOW will explain , will often prevent legally eligible and registered voters from casting ballots in the upcoming elections -- yet many have been approved by the Department of Justice .
Minorities , the poor , the elderly and disabled are expected to be hit especially hard .
" This is a concerted effort to make sure that certain people do n't have the opportunity to vote , that they do n't have the opportunity to participate in their own democracy , " Georgia state representative Alisha Thomas Morgan will be seen telling the program .
NOW is also preparing to use the Internet to support the story .
Tomorrow morning , features on the program 's website will include a state - by - state overview of election rights , an exploration of the voting rights act , and a list of " the 11 worst places in America to vote . "
The segment will run tomorrow , September 1 , at 8:30 p.m .

Voyager II detects solar system 's edge By Ker Than
SPACE.com
Voyager II is about 6.5 billion miles away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) or or Create Your Own ( SPACE.com ) --
Voyager II could pass beyond the outermost layer of our solar system , called the " termination shock , " sometime within the next year , NASA scientists announced at a media teleconference Tuesday .
The milestone , which comes about a year after Voyager 1's crossing , comes earlier than expected and suggests to scientists that the edge of the shock is about one billion miles closer to the sun in the southern region of the solar system than in the north .
This implies that the heliosphere , a spherical bubble of charged low - energy particles created by our sun 's solar wind , is irregularly shaped , bulging in the northern hemisphere and pressed inward in the south .
Scientists determined that Voyager I was approaching the termination shock when it began detecting charged particles that were being pushed back toward the sun by charged particles coming from outside our solar system .
This occurred when Voyager 1 was about 85 AU from the sun .
( Full story )
One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun , or 93 million miles .
In contrast , Voyager II began detecting returning particles while only 76 AU from the sun .
" This tells us that the shock down where Voyager II is must be closer the sun than where Voyager I is , " said Ed Stone , Voyager project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
The researchers think that the heliosphere 's asymmetry might be due to a weak interstellar magnetic field pressing inward on the southern hemisphere .
" The [ magnetic ] field is only 1/100,000 of the field on the Earth 's surface , but it 's over such a large area and pushing on such a faint gas that it can actually push the shock about a billion miles in , " Stone explained .
Both Voyager spacecrafts were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida : Voyager II headed out on August 20 , 1977 , Voyager I on September 5 , 1977 .
Currently , Voyager I is about 8.7 billion miles from the sun and traveling at a speed of 3.6 AU per year while Voyager II is about 6.5 billion miles away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year .

There will be some parts of the world affected by strong feedback and others not
Rolf Philipona
The scientists say that rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are increasing humidity , which in turn amplifies the temperature rise .
This is potentially a positive feedback mechanism which could increase the impact of greenhouse gases such as CO2 .
The research is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The scientists involved have used research networks and weather stations across Europe to measure temperature , humidity and longwave radiation , which plays a key role in the greenhouse effect .
Not from the Sun
" We observed that between 1995 and 2002 , the amount of longwave radiation coming downwards to the Earth in Europe increased significantly , whereas solar radiation did not , " said study leader Rolf Philipona , from the World Radiation Center in Davos , Switzerland .
" We wondered if this effect was simply because of a temperature increase at the surface - you would just get more radiation going up , and so more coming back down , " Dr Philipona told the BBC News website .
" But we allowed for this , and for the impact of extra clouds , but still we found an increase . "
The researchers calculated that this increase is partly down to higher concentrations of the gases such as carbon dioxide which are often described as causing the " man- made greenhouse effect " ; but increased water vapour appears to have a larger effect , accounting for about 70 % of the observed temperature rise .
Not all regions of Europe are affected equally .
Between 1995 and 2002 , Eastern states appear to have warmed by a rate equivalent to about 2C per decade - considerably faster than their western counterparts .
According to the new study , that may well be down to humidity differences ; broadly speaking , humidity has risen fast in the east but not in the west , where evaporation may be limited by the dryness of the Iberian peninsula .
Undervalued water
The ASRB unit at Gornergrat in the Alps measures longwave radiation
Because human activities change its concentrations very little , it is generally not mentioned in discussions of modern - day greenhouse warming .
But climate scientists have been aware for decades that mechanisms involving water vapour could amplify temperature increases , and have attempted to model these effects in computer simulations .
Researchers sceptical about projections of human - induced climate change base their criticism partly on what they see as flawed simulations of water vapour and clouds .
So will this discovery force a re-evaluation of climate models ?
William Ingram , from the UK's Meteorological Office and Oxford University , believes not .
" This careful study confirms that this aspect of the climate system is behaving broadly as expected , " he told the BBC News website .
" It is therefore consistent with projections by the scientific consensus . "
Local hotspots
" There will be some parts of the world affected by strong feedback and others not - perhaps even a drying in some places , " he said .
" We would see that water vapour would go up where there is enough water on the ground . "
An increased concentration of water vapour is just one of the feedback mechanisms which could change or amplify the progress of human - induced global warming .

Subject : you 've changed my life .
thanks , I think .
Date : 31 March 2004 Message -ID : 4b9cfdb7.0403311145.2a446dc3@posting.google.com
I have had a most extraordinary last two weeks and I owe much of it to this group , or more accurately , the talkorigins.org website and I 'm writing to say thanks .
I have been raised my whole life as a Jehovah 's Witness and ( therefore ) an old - Earth creationist .
I 'll be the first to admit that I 've not always been the world 's best JW , but I had always felt that when I was being good I was at least standing on relatively firm ground .
My upbringing and books like " Life - How Did it Get Here , By Evolution or Creation ? " taught me the complete absurdity and hopelessness of the evolutionist , secular humanist view of how we got here .
The arguments presented seemed to make sense and I was satisfied that my questions were being answered honestly and meaningfully .
It 's so strange then what has happened over the last few weeks .
It started simply enough .
My wife and I were discussing the Flood and the promised Paradise Earth and we wound up postulating some rather difficult questions for ourselves .
Questions like , " If all the animals were originally herbivores ( as the Bible says they were before the flood and would again be in the future ) , would n't that have disastrous environmental consequences ? "
" Would n't one - celled life and insects continue to have a role to play in the food chain ?
If so , would n't at least some of it be carnivorous or parasitic ? "
Once I started thinking of questions I could n't stop ( and more importantly , I could n't think of any rational answers ) .
A few days later some friends came over and we all got to talking about the Ark and the Flood and pondering some of the same questions .
Now , these friends are JW's and I have no reason to believe they have abandoned " The Truth " ( as it 's referred to in the organization ) but one of them sent me a link to a document on TalkOrigins about the flood a few days later saying that he thought it was interesting .
Interesting did n't even begin to describe it .
I was blown away .
Now , I do n't think I 'm a stupid person .
I am a 30 - year - old professional software developer with a 142 IQ .
I read a lot .
I consider myself educated , open - minded and capable of recognizing fact versus fiction and yet there I found myself realizing for the very first time that I had been blindly accepting as a fact something that was completely impossible .
Perhaps some sort of flood happened in pre-history , but a global flood , the Biblical flood of Noah as described by Jehovah 's Witnesses , could not have happened the way they say .
It was so obvious when all the issues were laid out in one document and yet I had never noticed it before .
For once , I felt stupid .
I felt like I had been believing in Santa Claus ( JW 's do n't do the Christmas thing , BTW , so it 's the closest I 've ever come TO believing in Santa Claus ) .
I could have left it at that , but I did n't .
If the " logic " given to me to explain the flood was wrong , I had to know what else was wrong too .
Oh boy .
I went back to the beginning .
In Genesis 3:15 is the first Messianic prophecy .
Everything Jehovah 's Witness teach about why we are here , the purpose of life , the reason Jesus came to Earth , the hope for the future ... all of it , is rooted in the Garden of Eden , the Genesis account .
I decided to re-examine , with an actual open mind , the question of Creation vs. Evolution ( as I pictured it , rather naively ) .
Could the chronology of the Bible , the location of Eden , the Genesis creation account , any of it , be reconciled with science ?
Did any of it , in fact , happen ?
Now , chronology is vitally important to Jehovah 's Witnesses .
It 's how they calculate the " end times " and why they are sure we are living in them .
If the entire basis for all Bible chronology was based on a fictional story , everything started to go out the window .
It all broke down .
I dug out my " Creation " book and dug in and what I discovered made me sick to my stomach .
The last time I read it I was 15 and it was incredibly convincing .
This time I did the actual research .
I looked up the references .
I checked the quotations and examined the lines of reasoning and found ... pseudo - science .
Fallacies .
Misquotes .
Deliberately misleading re-writes of quotes .
Argument through incredulity .
Appeals to authority .
Ignorance of evidence .
Selective presentation of facts .
Outdated information .
This was worse than determining that the flood story was impossible .
This was evidence that the religion I have been raised in was actually resorting to outright deception and taking quotes out of context and presenting as science something that is really just propaganda ... and that I 'd fallen for it .
See , JW 's pay a lot of lip - service to examining the scriptures , researching your faith , PROVING that it 's THE TRUTH , keeping an open - mind .
At the same time ( and I 'm not making this up ) they have a song that has the following words :
" We must act together as one
independance wisely we shun
harmony and one - ness of mind
bring peace of rarest kind "
I never felt right singing those words .
Regardless , I always believed that my religious beliefs would stand up to scrutiny .
I took comfort in that .
I thought I HAD scrutinized them .
That is what we are supposed to do .
This is supposed to be a religion based on reasons for faith .
To see that book for what it really was ... that hurt .
Anyhow , after being basically crushed over the empty shell that is the Creation book I decided to take a serious look at evolution for the first time in my life outside of the writings of Jehovah 's Witnesses .
Oh. My. God . I never knew .
I just never knew .
I have spent the last week absorbing everything I can .
I have downloaded the entire TalkOrigins.org website onto my laptop to read offline .
I stayed up all night watching the Discovery Science channel the night before last because of a program on hominid evolution and I just kept watching every show afterwards .
I bought The Blind Watchmaker and I 'm almost done reading it .
I have researched radioactive dating methods , transitional fossils , creationist arguments , abiogenesis theories and lots more and over and over and over again I have found a mountain of evidence , a mountain of evidence I had been informed did n't exist .
I have found intelligent people who think for themselves , who ( yes ) argue and change positions and interpret things differently but who are firmly grounded in reality .
The actual study of the actual world as it is , not the study of how a book says it should be and an obsession with trying to make the world appear to fit that model .
I do n't know what this means for me .
I know this ...
I am now , and on some level have always been , a secular humanist .
I am suddenly comfortable in my own skin , like my mind is clear for the first time .
I no longer know what role , if any , the concept of God plays in my life .
It 's certainly not the role that was there two weeks ago .
Now that I actually understand the theory of evolution to some extent I realize it's not just a bunch of wishful - thinking atheists working on some quack theory and calling it a fact .
I have developed a whole new awe and appreciation for the world I see around me , like I 'm really seeing it for the first time .
The geese outside my office looked like little dinosaurs to me and I got the chills .
I 'm 30 years old , my entire family , my wife and all my friends are Jehovah 's Witnesses .
If they knew for even a minute that I 've conclusively disproved ( for myself ) all the fundamental teachings that underlay their ( and my former ) theology , that I had come to realize the fact of evolution ( still hard for me to type that sentence ... ) and rejected the chronology of the Bible as impossible ... they would probably never speak to me again .
I do n't like the position I 'm in now .
I 'm scared .
I have no idea what to do .
I have no idea how to proceed .
I feel like I just opened my eyes for the first time and I do n't know what the next step is .
I do , however , want to thank all you long - suffering rational folks out in Talk .
Origins land .
You 've put together a resource that has radically changed my life in the blink of an eye and I am grateful .

The theory of evolution , as understood by biologists , cannot and does not explain " everything " .
The only obvious prediction about homosexuality that one could make based on an understanding of evolution is that a species which requires two sexes of that species to mate for reproduction will not be exclusively homosexual .
That follows simply from the fact that in order to evolve , a population must reproduce .
Reproduction is one of the requirements of evolution .
I notice that this was not one of your options and that , unlike evolution , one could say that religion can explain exclusive homosexuality ( or chastity , as the Shakers practiced it ) in such a species with a straight face because a supernatural agent could always create the next generation out of clay .
Reproduction is not necessary when you have supernatural creation .
Other than that obvious prediction , various degrees and amounts of homosexuality can have little to no impact on reproductive success of a population within particular reproductive strategies .
For example , a harem species where most females are controlled by a single male and there are many males left ' single ' can clearly tolerate substantial homosexual behavior and even homosexual orientation without significantly affecting reproductive success .
That might lead to a prediction that human societies where harem behavior exists or where there are substantial numbers of all male groups isolated from female contact ( certain Islamic and fundamentalist societies that rigidly separate the sexes , all - boy or all - girl schools , prisons , certain armies ) might exhibit higher frequency of homosexual behavior , but not necessarily homosexual orientation .
Societies where there is tolerance of homosexuals might exhibit higher self - reported homosexual orientation .
These are hypotheses that can be tested .
One can obviously propose an evolutionary ( usually meaning , among the simpler minds that ignore neutral events , that one can propose a natural selection " purpose " or " just - so story " for why a certain feature exists in a certain organism ) explanation for many things that exist in biology .
That does not mean that that hypothesis is correct in any particular case .
To provide evidence , to test that a particular hypothesis is what science requires .
First , you would have to show that the specific behavior had a genetic basis ( at least in part ) and that the differences in behavior within the species was linked to alternative genotypes ( or showed heritability ) .
Second , you would have to demonstrate that there was differential reproductive success of those different genotypes , keeping in mind the possibility of frequency - dependent selection , heterozygote advantage , and , for quantitative traits , the fact that , in most cases , each generation produces a broader variance at birth with a culling from the two tail ends to narrow the variance at reproduction , but usually without changing the position of the mode / median / mean .
Let 's take homosexuality as an open question and ask how or if evolution impacts upon it .
The first thing I would want to know is whether homosexual orientation is 1 ) common , 2 ) infrequent , or 3 ) extremely rare or absent in human cultures and whether the frequency varies in different types of cultures .
That is , I would want to start with empirical knowledge of the frequency of homosexual orientation rather than idly and armchair " predict " it from theory .
After all , I have already pointed out why , other than the simple extreme I mentioned , it is quite possible for there to be a significant range in the frequency of homosexual behavior and orientation without affecting reproductive success of the population .
One might then ask if there are any special attributes of societies with higher than average rates of homosexual orientation .
[ At this point , one would have to be very careful in one 's methodology because people 's actual sexual behavior and desires and their reported behavior and desires are not usually the same thing , even among members of fundamentalist churches -- as evidenced by things like divorce and teen pregnancy rates . ]
Then one would ask if the frequencies match , roughly , the frequencies seen in animals with similar mating systems ( carefully distinguishing behavior and orientation ) .
But remember that evolution only deals with that fraction of phenotypic variance that is genetic ( transmissible to future generations ) .
If , say , it were found that pedophilia were due to brain damage or childhood trauma , then pedophilia would be of no evolutionary consequence ( other than that it obviously means that the wiring of the human brain or mind can become damaged so as to produce a pedophile ) .
That is , one must not geneticize all of biology ( I speak as a geneticist ) .
And one must understand that genes set up a norm of reaction .
That is , the same genes can produce different phenotypes depending upon their interaction with the environment .
Behavior in humans , in particular , is highly flexible and has a broad range of phenotypes for the same genotypes .
A person one generation removed from a tribal , hunter - gathering existence may be a medical doctor or auto mechanic .
It may well be that there is no specific gene for homosexuality .
Homosexual orientation may simply be one tail of a bell - shaped curve ( which is ascribed as a qualitative difference ) , where most people are capable of loving and bonding to both sexes to some extent but are generally sexually attracted to the opposite sex .
Homosexuality , then , may be the evolutionarily harmless ' cost ' required for our species to have males capable of bonding with other males in co-operative behavior ( like hunting ) .
[ There are , of course , species where male - male co-operation is rarely seen .
And they would have , I would hazard to guess , a significantly lower frequency of homosexual behavior than herd or tribe species . ]
The other extreme tail end of such curve , which is not discussed and is perhaps best described as a narcissistic ' loner ' sociopath , is a decidedly less pleasant addition to most human societies ( and also less likely to be reproductively successful -- extreme heterosexuals may not be individuals that get along well in society ) .
Evolution by natural selection , of course , is very good at finding the ' sufficing ' mini-max solution to such problems ( to the extent that the differences are genetic ) as can be seen in the simplified case of sickle - cell anemia , where the optimal frequency of sickle cell allele can be quickly reached .
So if you want , I would predict that evolution , IF it is involved in producing homosexuals at all ( that is , if homosexuality has a significant genetic basis ) , probably produces the optimal level of homosexuals given our local mating systems and societal requirements .
IF homosexual orientation is a quantitative trait there is also likely a less reproductively fit individual at the other extreme of the curve ranging from extreme heterosexual orientation to extreme homosexual orientation .
That is because natural selection usually works as a conservative agent reducing the extremes in the variance produced each generation .
That optimal level will differ from species to species ( and perhaps from culture to culture ) based on local features such as mating system , group dynamics ( tribe or herd as opposed to solitary hunter ) , environment , age , social status , degree of pair bonding , etc .
I would expect some of these to consistently favor or disfavor homosexual behavior / orientation .
Evolution by natural selection says that ( to the extent that the feature in question is genetically based ) , that feature will succeed relative to a genetic variant to the extent that it furthers the mean or average reproductive success of organisms in the population with that variation in a local environment .

An Introduction to the Evolution / Creationism Debate Post of the Month Honorable Mention : March 2004 by John Wilkins Our apologies , but you must have JavaScript enabled to view author contact information .
Subject : For Grade 7 students Date : 19 March 2004 Message -ID : 1gaw8kv.1s6ayr6nxj43aN%john_SPAM@wilkins.id.au
My son asked me to do a thing on evolution and creationism ( interestingly , he did n't even know I was pro-evolution in this debate ; I 'm being too even handed at home , obviously ) for his classmates .
This is what I came up with - it was something of a success , including for the Christian kids ( it 's a public school ) .
Evolution and creationism
=========================
In 1859 , Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species , and this book convinced pretty well every scientist that evolution happened .
There were three main theories in Darwin 's book :
1 . That species changed into different species occasionally ( transmutation ) ;
2 . That related species had a shared ancestral species ( common descent ) ;
3 . That natural selection was the process that caused adaptation of organisms to their environment .
He also thought that natural selection caused new species , but this did not win much acceptance from scientists until quite recently , and then only in some cases .
Why is it , then , if evolution is accepted as a fact by biologists and paleontologists around the world , that some people reject it , and call themselves " scientific creationists " ?
Who are these " creationists " and what is it they believe ?
Creationism began in the 1920s when a small group of American churches adopted what they called the " fundamentals " of Christianity - one of these being a belief in the literal truth and inerrancy of the Bible .
These people went by the name " fundamentalists " .
Now , if you read the Bible as straight history , you pretty well have to believe that the world is around 6000 - 10,000 years old , that every species alive then is unchanged since , and that all species are about the same age .
Also , you have to believe that there was a global flood that covered the entire land of the earth , including the mountains .
Most religious groups , including most Christian churches , both Catholic and Protestant , reject this view .
It is clear to them that the evidence points to an old earth , and that there were different species in earlier ages , and that there never has been a flood that covered the earth , although there have been , and continue to be , many floods in different areas , as inhabitants of Queensland can tell you .
It is worth pointing out , though , that all Christian teaching says that God created the world .
All Christians , most Jews and all Muslims believe this .
What they do not necessarily believe is that He did this 6000 years ago and all at once .
Since Darwin's day , most thinkers who are believers in creation but accept science have said something like this :
God created at the beginning and continues to create , using natural methods , and evolution is one of those methods .
Creationism , though , is the view that species do not change , and that creation was completed in a single period after which things remain as God made them .
There are two kinds of creationism - young earth , and old earth .
Young earth creationists ( YECs ) take the strictly literal approach to the Book of Genesis in the Bible , and go for the 6000 year version .
Old earth creationists ( OECs ) accept that the earth is as old as science shows , and think only that God created species as they are now , but that older species were created back then .
In both cases , species do not change once created .
None of this would matter if it were just a religious dispute .
People are free to believe what they like , and to teach their children those beliefs .
We live in a tolerant country that allows freedom of religion to all , no matter what we think of those ideas .
But creationism has another side to it .
In the 1960s , a movement arose that called itself " scientific creationism " .
Their view was that not only was Genesis correct as history , but also that science proved it .
They try to argue this , because in America , the government is not allowed to make laws that promote one religious view over another .
If it is science , though , then they can get creationism taught in schools .
Indeed , if it were science , then it should be taught in science classes .
These YECs have a lot of rather muddled arguments , often taking small sentences from scientists out of context to " prove " that YECism is true , which sound to someone who does n't know a lot of science as if there is a real case in its favour .
Although the American courts have each time struck down laws forcing teachers to teach creationism , the end result has been almost as harmful , and here is why :
America is a massive market , especially for books .
And one of the most profitable markets in publishing is school books ( think about it , tens of millions of people have to buy their books each year ) .
But because publishers are nervous about mentioning evolution in their textbooks , because that means that YEC fundamentalists in some states will not buy their books , they have downplayed it or , in some cases , removed it altogether .
Many school textbooks in Australia are just revised versions of the American editions ( not , I am pleased to say , the biology books used in Victorian schools ) .
This means that , if a school board ( which in the US is an elected committee of the public , not of teachers or scientists ) rejects books that teach evolution as science in Texas or Alabama , publishers will tend to cover less evolution , and this will affect what is published in many other English - speaking countries .
The end result is that we are " dumbing down " the science we teach around the world .
And what is next ?
The Bible also teaches that the earth is stationary and the sun moves around the earth .
Shall we censor astronomy ?
What about geology ?
It is based on theories that are in contradiction to the Bible , too .
In the end , you may miss out on good scientific education because of the religious views of a small minority .
Similar movements are happening in Turkey , which is Islamic , and in other Muslim nations .
There are even a small number of Jewish creationists in Israel , and in India , Hindu creationists ( who have a different set of teachings and holy books to Christians - they are very OECs and believe that the universe is hundreds of billions of years old , not the 14 billion years that science says it is ) .
This is why I work to counter creationism .
If you are interested in following this up , the Talk .
Origins Archive is a website that provides counter - creationism arguments and evidence ( including the best human evolution site on the web , by an Australian who lives in Canberra ) , and links to creationist websites .
The best book to read is Tower of Babel by Rob Pennock ( MIT Press , 1999 ) .
You can get a free copy of the Jehovah 's Witnesses antievolution book Life - how did it get here ?
by asking them .

Before I get to Woody 's terrible list , I would suggest that you look at http://home.entouch.net/dmd/whereanimals.htm.
The pattern of fossils in the fossil record simply does n't support the young - earth position .
Now to Woody 's list .
It is the silliest thing one could have done and shows that he has no understanding of how fossilization takes place .
When a species evolves , it has very few individual members .
They may occupy a single small island in the middle of a river , or they may occupy some micro-ecological niche somewhere .
Because they are so small in numbers , the odds that any of the individuals of that species would be fossilized is quite small .
And then even if they were fossilized , the odds of us looking at just the right spot on earth while their bones are being eroded out of the earth , is equally miniscule .
Most fossils are destroyed by meteoric water as it seeps into the soil and degrades the rock below the soil profile , so often we do n't even get a chance to see the fossils that are destroyed .
Now you have two very unlikely events for a tiny population of a newly evolved species -- unlikely fossilization and unlikely discovery .
As the newly evolved species / genus / family becomes more numerous , and occupies a larger and larger area of the earth , it becomes more and more likely that multiple members of a species will be fossilized .
And as the numbers of fossils increases , so does the chance that one will be discovered .
The above issues also work in sediments being deposited today .
Signor and Lipps took a core of sediment in a modern bay and looked for the buried bodies of animals living in the bay today .
What they found was that even species with numerous members , who are living on the bay 's bottom today , have a chance of not leaving a potential fossil in the rock record for quite a distance down .
Here is the picture of what they found :
http://home.entouch.net/dmd/SignorLippsEffectMeldahlNightComestoCretaceousP139.JPG
Depth increases downward .
The animals who left no body fossils as deep as half a meter appear to have gone extinct , as far as the sedimentary record is concerned , but they are still alive .
These are the types of statistical effects which limit the ' proper age ' of Woody 's list .
So when we go looking for fossils , this statistical nature of the record means something very , very important when one is dealing with the earliest discovered specimen of a species / genus / family etc .
It means that the earliest specimen is highly unlikely to be the earliest living member of that species / genus / family .
So , there are statistical techniques used to predict how much earlier than the first specimen the group actually evolved .
On average , it is believed that a fossil group is about 1/3 older than its earliest specimen .
One can quibble about the exact percentage , but you get the idea .
The first fossil specimen is not very likely to have come from the very first evolved member of the group .
The same thing can be said when a population is going extinct .
The temporal sightings of the black - footed ferret got fewer and more separated in time as they got rarer and rarer .
The same thing happens in fossilization .
As a species / genus / family is going extinct and the members are few , it gets more and more unlikely that they will be fossilized and then the chances of finding a member of that group also drops .
So , when Woodmorappe lists the ' proper age ' on his table , he is actually using the known extent or duration of the creature .
But as we saw above , that is not likely to be the true temporal extent of the species / genus / family .
When we find a rare example of a fossil outside of its known temporal range , it does n't mean that evolution is false , it just means that our knowledge of the known duration of a species / genus / family have been enlarged .
Our knowledge has been made better .
While I wrote this page for another purpose , it applies here .
Take a look at the gaps in time between the first and second occurrence of various fossil / archaeological items on my page http://home.entouch.net/dmd/gaps.htm
If you look at the 3rd entry in that list .
The mammal bones .
That is the discovery of an earlier beaver .
It does n't destroy evolution .
It just means that beavers ' fossil record is quite sparse .
A lot of his entries fit the above pattern .
When it comes to some of the forams , spores , pollen etc , you will see that they are mostly cases of ancient pollen found in younger strata .
That is because of the reworking of such tiny fossils into modern sediments .
What happens is that pollen is quite tough to destroy .
Today along the rivers of S. Texas , you will find ancient pollens , spores and forams which are contained in the rocks along the river banks , are being eroded , and then re-deposited in modern deltas .
Nowhere do we find those spores / pollen or forams living today or coming from living trees .
One can tell the reworked pollen / spores / forams from modern ones because they are usually a different color ( modern pollen is clear , the older pollen gets the darker it gets ) and because of wear on the outer textures of the foram .
Reworked forams have more damage than those that are fresh from living creatures .
If you look at reference 93 on Woody 's page you will see : Windle T.M.F. 1979 .
Reworked Carboniferous Spores : An Example from the Lower Jurassic of Northeast Scotland .
RP 27:174-5 .
That " reworked " is something Woody is n't telling his readers the meaning of .
It is very important to assessing the validity of what Woody is doing .
Because of things like this , Woody 's list makes no impact on what scientists believe .
Woody has n't properly assessed the situation .

Since a rebellion began in Sudan 's Darfur region nearly four years ago , violence has spilled over its borders into eastern Chad and northern CAR .
Prime Minister Pascal Yoadimnadji said as Sudan was attempting to destabilise both Chad and CAR there should be a " general mobilisation " of the people .
During a three - week long offensive , CAR rebels have captured three towns .
Earlier this week , an UN official said up to 10,000 people had fled the latest rebel advance in the north - east .
At the same time , the Chadian government has declared a state of emergency in the south - east , where escalating violence has forced some 70,000 villagers from their homes .
' Horrendous violence '
During a speech to the National Assembly the prime minister said that Chad could not remain indifferent to the plight in CAR .
I am deeply concerned that the horrendous violence that has been wracking Darfur is affecting Chad ,
UN 's Louise Arbour
" A popular saying goes that if your neighbour 's house is on fire , you go to help him , or you risk the fire spreading to your house , " Mr Yoadimnadji said .
" At the moment we speak , two columns of mercenaries are progressing towards the [ CAR ] towns of Bria and Ndele . "
He did not specify how many soldiers the government planned to deploy .
Former colonial power France has also pledged its logistical and intelligence support to CAR .
Meanwhile , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour called on Friday for immediate action to be taken to prevent a human rights catastrophe in Chad .
" I am deeply concerned that the horrendous violence that has been wracking Darfur is affecting Chad , " she said in a statement .
According to the government , about 300 people have been killed in the violence since late October in eastern Chad .
Peacekeepers
Both Chad and Central African Republic have called for the deployment of international peacekeepers to secure their borders with Sudan
But Sudan has refused to permit a robust UN peacekeeping force to relieve an over - stretched African Union contingent in Darfur .
Chad 's army has been unable to stop attacks in the east
In April , Chad rebels reached the capital , N'Djamena , before being repulsed .
Sudan denied claims it had backed Chad 's rebels , while Chad denied supporting the black African rebels in Darfur .
Eastern Chad and Darfur have a similar ethnic make - up .
Some two million people have been displaced in Darfur and at least 200,000 are estimated to have died in the three - and - a - half year conflict .
Sudan 's government says it is disarming Arab militias , known as Janjaweed , who have been accused of carrying out genocide on its behalf .

Mosquitoes Challenge India .
India has been very often challenged by rats and mosquitoes .
Earlier it was plaque which struck India a few years ago .
Now it is Dengue fever and chikenguniya .
India 's capital city of New Delhi reported scores of dengue cases .
Authorities have stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak that has claimed at least 13 lives .
Many doctors were struck with Dengue and one of them died .
The dengue fever is becoming an epidemic
India is projecting itself as a model for other developing countries to follow .
A country whose IT prowess has taken it far in the globalization , a country which has a strong intellectual capital and doing breakthrough R&D in everything from IT to pharmaceuticals but unable to handle the onslaught of mosquitoes and rats .
What a shame ?!!!
India needs to do more .
It needs to keep the country clean , improve sanitation , roads and basic infrastructure .
The news of Dengue , plague and chickenguniya etc does not bode well for a country that has captured the imagination of the rest of the World .
Unless the politicians do something about simple and controllable infectious diseases it may lose its advantage in everything .
Investors will walk away because companies cannot operate in a sick environment .
India needs to learn a lot from china especially about sanitation and hygiene .

Density map of dark matter in a halo the size of the Milky Way galaxy 's dark matter halo .
Credit : University of California , Santa Cruz
Researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz , have used NASA 's most powerful supercomputer to run the largest simulation to date of the formation and evolution of the dark matter halo that envelopes the Milky Way galaxy .
Their results show substructures within the halo in unprecedented detail , providing a valuable tool for understanding the evolutionary history of our galaxy .
Every galaxy is surrounded by a halo of mysterious dark matter that can only be detected indirectly by observing its gravitational effects .
The invisible halo is much larger and more spherical than the luminous galaxy at its center .
Recent computer simulations have shown that the halo is surprisingly clumpy , with relatively dense concentrations of dark matter in gravitationally bound ' subhalos ' within the halo .
The new study , which has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal , shows much more extensive substructure than any previous study .
" We find almost 10,000 subhalos , about one order of magnitude more than in any past simulations , and some of our subhalos exhibit ' subsubstructure . '
This was expected theoretically , but we have shown it for the first time in a numerical simulation , " said Piero Madau , professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper .
Jürg Diemand , a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and first author of the paper , said the new results exacerbate what is known as the " missing satellite problem . "
The problem is that the clumpiness of the normal matter in and around our galaxy -- in the form of dwarf satellite galaxies -- does not match the clumpiness of the dark matter seen in the simulation .
" Astronomers keep discovering new dwarf galaxies , but there are still only about 15 or so , compared to about 120 dark matter subhalos of comparable size in our simulation .
So which ones host the dwarf galaxies , and why ? "
Diemand said .
Theoretical models in which star formation is restricted to certain types of dark matter halos -- sufficiently massive or early - forming ones -- may help to resolve the discrepancy , Madau said .
Although the nature of dark matter remains a mystery , it appears to account for about 82 percent of the matter in the universe .
As a result , the evolution of structure in the universe has been driven by the gravitational interactions of dark matter .
The " normal " matter that forms gas and stars has fallen into the " gravitational wells " created by clumps of dark matter , giving rise to galaxies in the centers of dark matter halos .
Initially , gravity acted on slight density fluctuations present shortly after the Big Bang to pull together the first clumps of dark matter .
These grew into larger and larger clumps through the hierarchical merging of smaller progenitors .
This is the process the UCSC researchers simulated on the Columbia supercomputer at the NASA Ames Research Center , one of the fastest computers in the world .
The simulation took a couple of months to complete , running on 300 to 400 processors at a time for 320,000 " cpu-hours , " Diemand said .
Coauthor Michael Kuhlen , who began working on the project as a graduate student at UCSC and is now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , said the researchers set the initial conditions based on the most recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) experiment .
Released in March , the new WMAP results provide the most detailed picture ever of the infant universe .
The simulation starts at about 50 million years after the Big Bang and calculates the interactions of 234 million particles of dark matter over 13.7 billion years of cosmological time to produce a halo on the same scale as the Milky Way's .
The clumps within the halo are the remnants of mergers in which the cores of smaller halos survived as gravitationally bound subhalos orbiting within the larger host system .
The simulation produced five massive subhalos ( each more than 30 million times the mass of the Sun ) and many smaller ones within the inner 10 percent of the host halo .
Yet only one known dwarf galaxy ( Sagittarius ) is that close to the center of the Milky Way , Diemand said .
" There are big clumps of dark matter in the same region where the disk of the Milky Way would be .
So even in the local neighborhood of our solar system , the distribution of dark matter may be more complicated than we have assumed , " he said .
Astronomers may be able to detect clumps of dark matter within the Milky Way 's halo with future gamma-ray telescopes , but only if the dark matter consists of the types of particles that would give rise to gamma-ray emissions .
Certain dark matter candidates -- such as the neutralino , a theoretical particle predicted by supersymmetry theory -- could annihilate ( that is , be mutually destroyed ) in collisions , generating new particles and emitting gamma rays .
" Existing gamma - ray telescopes have not detected dark matter annihilation , but upcoming experiments will be more sensitive , so there is some hope that individual subhalos may produce an observable signature , " Kuhlen said .
In particular , astronomers look forward to interesting results from the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) , scheduled for launch in 2007 , he said .
The simulation also provides a useful tool for observational astronomers studying the oldest stars in our galaxy by providing a link between current observations and earlier phases of galaxy formation , Diemand said .
" The first small galaxies formed very early , about 500 million years after the Big Bang , and there are still today stars in our galaxy that formed at this early time , like a fossil record of early star formation .
Our simulation can provide the context for where those old stars came from and how they ended up in dwarf galaxies and in certain orbits in the stellar halo today , " Diemand said .

Brain scans as lie detectors ?
A lying thief checks it out By Malcolm Ritter , Associated Press CHARLESTON , S.C. 
Picture this :
Your boss is threatening to fire you because he thinks you stole company property .
He does n't believe your denials .
Your lawyer suggests you deny it one more time — in a brain scanner that will show you 're telling the truth .
Associated Press science writer Malcolm Ritter has a brain scan .
Mary Ann Chastain , AP Wacky ?
Science fiction ?
It might happen this summer .
Just the other day I lay flat on my back as a scanner probed the tiniest crevices of my brain and a computer screen asked , " Did you take the watch ? "
The lab I was visiting recently reported catching lies with 90 % accuracy .
And an entrepreneur in Massachusetts is hoping to commercialize the system in the coming months .
" I 'd use it tomorrow in virtually every criminal and civil case on my desk " to check up on the truthfulness of clients , said attorney Robert Shapiro , best known for defending O.J. Simpson against murder charges .
Shapiro serves as an adviser to entrepreneur Steven Laken and has a financial interest in Cephos Corp. , which Laken founded to commercialize the brain - scanning work being done at the Medical University of South Carolina .
That 's where I had my brain - scan interrogation .
But this lab is n't alone .
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have also reported impressive accuracy through brain - scanning recently .
California entrepreneur Joel T. Huizenga plans to use that work to start offering lie- detecting services in Philadelphia this July .
His outfit , No Lie MRI Inc. , will serve government agencies and " anybody that wants to demonstrate that they 're telling the truth , " he said .
Both labs use brain - scanning technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI .
It 's a standard tool for studying the brain , but research into using it to detect lies is still in early stages .
Nobody really knows yet whether it will prove more accurate than polygraphs , which measure things like blood pressure and breathing rate to look for emotional signals of lying .
But advocates for fMRI say it has the potential to be more accurate , because it zeros in on the source of lying , the brain , rather than using indirect measures .
So it may someday provide lawyers with something polygraphs can't : legal evidence of truth - telling that 's widely admissible in court .
( Courts generally regard polygraph results as unreliable , and either prohibit such evidence or allow it only if both sides in a case agree to let it in . )
Brain scans as lie detectors ?
TRUTH MACHINE : Scientists are testing whether brain scans can serve as lie detectors .
THE CONCERN : Some ethicists are worried about accuracy , privacy and how juries might react if this technology were used in the courtroom .
THE MARKET : Two companies plan to start offering brain scans for lie detection this year .
Laken said he 's aiming to offer the fMRI service for use in situations like libel , slander and fraud where it's one person 's word against another , and perhaps in employee screening by government agencies .
Attorneys suggest it would be more useful in civil than most criminal cases , he said .
Of course , there 's no telling where the general approach might lead .
A law review article has discussed the legality of using fMRI to interrogate foreigners in U.S. custody .
Maybe police will use it as an interrogation tool , too , or perhaps major companies will find it a cheaper than litigation or arbitration when an employee is accused of stealing something important , other observers say .
For his part , Shapiro says he'd switch to fMRI from polygraph for screening certain clients because he figures it would be more reliable and maybe more credible to law enforcement agencies .
In any case , the idea of using fMRI to detect lies has started a buzz among scientists , legal experts and ethicists .
Many worry about rushing too quickly from the lab to real - world use .
Some caution that it may not work as well in the real world as the early lab results suggest .
And others worry that it might .
Unlike perusing your mail or tapping your phone , this is " looking inside your brain , " Hank Greely , a law professor who directs the Stanford Center for Law and the Biosciences , told me a few days before my scan .
It " does seem to me to be a significant change in our ability ... to invade what has been the last untouchable sanctuary , the contents of your own mind , " Greely said .
" It should make us stop and think to what extent we should allow this to be done . "
But Dr. Mark George , the genial neurologist and psychiatrist who let me lie in his scanner and be grilled by his computer , said he does n't see a privacy problem with the technology .
That 's because it 's impossible to test people without their consent , he said .
Subjects have to cooperate so fully — holding the head still , and reading and responding to the questions , for example — that they have to agree to the scan .
" It really does n't read your mind if you do n't want your mind to be read , " he said .
" If I were wrongly accused and this were available , I 'd want my defense lawyer to help me get this . "
So maybe the technology is better termed a " truth confirmer " than lie detector , he said .
Whatever you call it , the technology has produced some eyebrow - raising results .
George and his colleagues recently reported that using fMRI data , a computer was able to spot lies in 28 out of 31 volunteers .
I joined an extension of that study .
That 's why I found myself lying on a narrow table in George 's lab while he and his assistants pulled a barrel - shaped framework over my head like a rigid hood .
As it brushed the tip of my nose and blotted out the light from the room , I looked straight ahead to see a computer screen , which would be my interrogator .
Then the table eased into the tunnel of the fMRI scanner , a machine the size of a small storage shed .
Only my legs stuck out .
As I focused on the questions popping up on the computer screen , the scanner roared like a tractor trying to uproot a tree stump .
It was bombarding me with radio waves and a powerful magnetic field to create detailed images of my brain and detect tiny changes in blood flow in certain areas .
Those changes would indicate those areas were working a bit harder than usual , and according to research by George and others , that would in turn indicate I was lying .
Some questions that popped up on that screen were easy :
Am I awake , is it 2004 , do I like movies .
Others were a little more challenging :
Have I ever cheated on taxes , or gossiped , or deceived a loved one .
As instructed , I answered them all truthfully , pushing the " Yes " button with my thumb or the " No " button with my index finger .
Then , there it was : " Did you remove a watch from the drawer ? "
Just a half - hour or so before , in an adjacent room , I 'd been told to remove either a watch or a ring from a drawer and slip it into a locker with my briefcase .
This was the mock crime that volunteers lied about in George 's study .
So I took the watch .
As I lay in the scanner I remembered seizing its gold metal band and nestling it into the locker .
So , the computer was asking , did I take the watch ?
No , I replied with a jab of my finger .
I did n't steal nuthin . '
I lied again and again .
Other questions about the watch popped up seemingly at random during the interrogation .
Is the watch in my locker ?
Is it in the drawer ?
Did I steal it from the drawer ?
The same questions came up about the ring , and I told the truth about those .
It would be a different computer 's job to figure out which I was lying about , the watch or the ring .
It would compare the way my brain acted when I responded to those questions vs. what my brain did when I responded truthfully to the other questions .
Whichever looked more different from the " truthful " brain activity would be considered the signature of deceit .
Finally , after answering 160 questions over the course of 16 minutes — actually , it was 80 questions two times apiece — I was done .
The machine returned me to the bright light of the scanning room .
The computer 's verdict ?
That would take a few days to produce , since it required a lot of data analysis .
I did n't mind waiting .
It 's not like the result would help get me fired , or lose a lawsuit , or send me to jail .
Nobody in George 's studies faced consequences like that , which is one reason the lab results may not apply to real - world situations .
George has already begun another study in which volunteers face " a little more jeopardy " from the mock crime .
He declined to describe it because he did n't want prospective volunteers to hear about it ahead of time .
That work is funded by the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute .
Other questions remain .
How would this work on people with brain diseases ?
Or people taking medications ?
How would this work on people outside the 18 - to - 50 age range included in George 's recent work ?
How about experienced liars ?
George hopes eventually to study volunteers from prisons .
Mary Ann Chastain , AP Kevin Johnson , a graduate student at the Medical University of South Carolina , records data during the brain scan of Associated Press science writer Malcolm Ritter , background , in the MRI room at the university in Charleston , S.C .
And then there 's the matter of the three people who got away with lying in his recent study .
For some reason , the computer failed to identify the object they 'd stolen .
George says he does n't know what went wrong .
But in a real - world situation , he said , the person being questioned would go through an exercise like the ring - or - watch task as well as being quizzed about the topic at hand .
That way , if the computer failed in the experimental task , it would be obvious that it could n't judge the person 's truthfulness .
Because of that , George said , he 's comfortable with entrepreneur Laken 's plans to introduce the scanning service to lawyers , though just on a limited basis , by the middle of this year .
Lab studies are obviously necessary , he said , but " at a certain point you really have to start applying and see how it works .
And I think we 're getting close . "
But Jennifer Vendemia , a University of South Carolina researcher who studies deception and the brain , said she finds Laken 's timetable premature .
So little research has been done on using fMRI for this purpose that it's too soon to make any judgment about how useful it could be , she said .
Without studies to see how well the technique works in other labs — a standard procedure in the scientific world — its reliability might be an issue , said Dr. Sean Spence of the University of Sheffield in England , who also studies fMRI for detecting deception .
Speaking more generally , ethical and legal experts said they were wary of quickly using fMRI for spotting lies .
" What 's really scary is if we start implementing this before we know how accurate it really is , " Greely said .
" People could be sent to jail , people could be sent to the death penalty , people could lose their jobs . "
Greely recently called for pre-marketing approval of lie-detection devices in general , like the federal government carries out for medications .
Judy Illes , director of Stanford 's program in neuroethics , also has concerns : Could people , including victims of crimes , be coerced into taking an fMRI test ?
Could it distinguish accurate memories from muddled ones ?
Could it detect a person who 's being misleading without actually lying ?
Her worries multiply if fMRI evidence starts showing up in the courtroom .
For one thing , unlike the technical data from a polygraph , it can be used to make brain images that look simple and convincing , belying the complexity of the data behind them , she said .
" You show a jury a picture with a nice red spot , that can have a very strong impact in a very rapid way ....
We need to understand how juries are going to respond to that information .
Will they be open to complex explanations of what the images do and do not mean ? "
Science Snapshot
A brief history of the mystery of an ancient Athens plague in this week 's Science Snapshot .
There 's also a philosophical argument in case fMRI works all too well .
Greely notes that four Supreme Court justices wrote in 1998 that if polygraphs were reliable enough to use as evidence , they should n't be admitted because they would usurp the jury 's role of determining the truth .
With only four votes , that position does n't stand as legal precedent , but it 's " an interesting straw in the wind " for how fMRI might be received someday , he said .
It did n't take any jury to find the truth in my case .
" We nabbed ya , " George said after sending me the results of my scan .
" It was n't a close call . "
I was ratted out by the three parts of my brain the technique targets .
They 'd become more active when I lied about taking the watch than when I truthfully denied taking the ring .
Those areas are involved in juggling the demands of doing several things at once , in thinking about oneself , and in stopping oneself from making a natural response — all things the brain apparently does when it pulls back from blurting the truth and works up a whopper instead , George said .
Of course , nobody is going to make me or anybody else climb into an fMRI scanner every time they want a statement verified .
The procedure is too cumbersome to be used so casually , George says .
But he figures that if a perfect lie detector were developed , that practical consideration might not matter .
The mere knowledge that one is available , he said , might provoke people to clean up their acts .
" My hope , " George said , " would be that it might make the world operate a little bit more openly and honestly . "

The four men , all in their 20s , were arrested on Tuesday , police said .
At least 10 bullets were fired at Oslo 's only synagogue early on Sunday .
Nobody was hurt in the attack .
Norwegian secret agents bugged the main suspect 's car and recorded the suspects planning the attacks , a prosecutor told an Oslo court .
Police were seeking a court order to continue holding the men for questioning .
" They spoke in detail about how to attack the synagogue and the US and Israeli embassies , " prosecutor Unni Fries was quoted as saying .
Defence lawyers quoted by Reuters news agency said one suspect was of Turkish origin , two had Pakistani backgrounds and one was a native Norwegian .
One suspect had been detained briefly in Germany in June , on suspicion of planning an attack during the football World Cup .
Microsoft has modified Windows Vista to prevent a high - profile exploit demonstrated at security conferences this summer but the fix creates as many problems as it solves , according to the security researcher who identified the original problem .
The bug , demonstrated by Joanna Rutkowska of security firm Coseinc , created a possible mechanism for hackers to bypass security protection built into 64 - bit versions of Vista in order to inject potentially hostile code into the kernel of prototype versions of Windows .
This so - called " pagefile attack " defeated a feature called Vista kernel protection .
Windows Vista Release Candidate 2 frustrates this attack by blocking write - access to raw disk sectors for user mode applications , even if they are executed with elevated administrative rights .
Rutkowska writes that Microsoft 's fix is fraught with difficulties because it prevents legitimate applications , such as disk editors and recovery tools , from functioning without their own signed kernel - level driver .
Hackers might be able to hijack such legitimate drivers so all Microsoft has done has created extra work for developers in displacing - but not resolving - the problem .
During a presentation at the Black Hat conference in August , Rutkowska explained two other approaches Microsoft might take in defeating the page - file attack as well as highlighting the problems with simply blocking write - access to raw disk sectors for user mode applications .
" Microsoft actually decided to ignore those suggestions and implemented the easiest solution , ignoring the fact that it really does n’t solve the problem , " she writes . ®
HarperCollins announced the dismissal of the wild - and - crazy editor , who created quite a stir with her plans for a book and TV interview with O.J. Simpson .
The firing is " effective immediately " and was announced at 7 p.m. New York time ( did they really expect this to go unnoticed ? )
NYT reports that HarperCollins CEO Jane Friedman , who announced the news in a statement , " has long had a strained relationship with Ms. Regan . "
The statement said that Regan publishing , which had moved to L.A. earlier this year , will remain part of HarperCollins .
No details on how that will work .
HarperCollins is part of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
* WSJ reports that Regan 's imprint has come under fire regarding an upcoming novelization of the life of Mickey Mantle .
( It apparently takes more than a few liberties , including suggestions that Mantle and Marilyn Monroe had an affair . )
While Regan makes a lot of noise , her imprint generates revenue of only around $ 50 million , according to a Journal source .
That 's out of HarperCollins ' total revenues of $ 1.3 billion .
Perhaps Regan was finally considered more trouble than she was worth .
It is curious that when the plug was pulled last month on the O.J. book and TV interview , a News Corp. source said no one would be fired over the incident .

Summer and fall are lean times for polar bears in the Arctic .
In the colder months , they prey on seals , which sprawl on the sea ice that fringes the bears ' terrain .
But in the summer , much of this icy real estate melts away , and the seals take to the open seas or move north toward ice floes beyond the polar bears ' reach .
Left without their usual prey , the bears occasionally resort to a disturbing behavior : cannibalism .
A new article in the journal Arctic suggests that polar bear cannibalism — typically the predation of small bears or cubs by much larger adult males — is either much more commonplace than previously thought , or has lately become more common .
In the paper , leading polar bear biologist Ian Stirling and nature photographer Jenny Ross detail three recent instances of the behavior among polar bears in Norway 's Svalbard Archipelago , each of which was photographed from the decks of ecotourism and research boats anchored a few hundred yards away .
Ross ' vivid photographs show young cubs drooping from the jaws of huge males , their bright blood dashed against the pristine snow .
Stirling , a scientist emeritus with the Canadian Wildlife Service and adjunct professor at the University of Alberta , relied on his extensive knowledge of polar bear physiology and behavior to glean information from the photos .
" [ T ]he data we present suggest that in late summer when there is not much ice left and the seals are present but mostly in the water and inaccessible , a smaller bear represents a potential food source , " Stirling told Life 's Little Mysteries , a sister site to LiveScience .
" What I do n't know is whether this has been going on for a long time and has only come to light as there are now lots of [ ecotourism ] ships going into the loose pack at the end of summer , or if it is something new . "
The scientists are asking : are polar bears more often resorting to cannibalism because of increased hunger and desperation , or are we simply more frequently observing a behavior that has always existed ?
They say it 's an important question to answer , because it will reveal whether or not the Svalbard polar bear population has started to feel the heat from climate change .
[ Is Cannibalism Becoming More Popular ? ]
Past research by Stirling and others , including Eric Regehr , a polar bear biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , shows that , as global warming has caused Arctic sea ice to start melting earlier and earlier each summer ( as well as causing more of it to melt ) , some polar bear populations have been adversely affected .
According to a 2009 article by Regehr , Stirling and co-authors , the minimum amount of sea ice present during the Arctic summer has fallen by 8 to 9.5 percent per decade since 1979 .
" As the sea ice declines , bears can spend less time on the sea ice hunting their preferred prey , seals , " Regehr wrote in an email .
" Lower food ( i.e. , seal ) access has been shown to result in lower body condition ( i.e. , thinner bears ) . "
Regehr explained that in some parts of the Arctic , such as the western Hudson Bay and the southern Beaufort Sea , the diminishing sea ice has already caused polar bear populations to decline .
In other areas , such as the northern Beaufort Sea , this has not yet started to happen .
Commenting on Stirling 's new study , Regehr said there are reasons to believe sea ice decline in Norway may be putting nutritional stress on the polar bears there , pushing them toward cannibalism , but there 's also reason to think otherwise .
" In general , observations of cannibalism may be consistent with the idea that as bears become more nutritionally stressed due to sea ice loss — which there is evidence for in some parts of the Arctic — they will seek out alternative food sources , " Regehr said .
" However , the bears [ in this study ] were all in pretty good body condition .
A fat bear would n't be very motivated to risk attacking another polar bear just for food .
So , we should certainly be cautious in interpreting these observations and remain open to other explanations . "
Stirling agreed .
" We do not have the information to separate those two possibilities . "

The Netherlands has long been Europe ’s most permissive society — everything from window - shopping in Amsterdam for scantily clad hookers ( 50 to 80 Euros for 15 to 30 minutes ) to hashish aroma in marijuana smoke - filled cafes .
The government and the sex workers union protect some 30,000 women .
The pimps are landlords and the aging prostitutes are quickly replaced with a steady influx from the former Soviet republics and East European countries .
A Dutch brothel chain is suing the government for failing to green - light the “ Yum Yum Caviar Club ” at Schiphol Airport “ to cater to stressed travelers in transit . ”
The government responded that plans for an airport bordello were on hold pending new building and space in the departure areas .
It was such Dutch tolerance , pragmatism and guilt about the country ’s colonial past that allowed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Muslim Indonesia ( a Dutch colony from the 17th century until World War II ) to flood into tiny Holland .
Today , Muslims are a majority among children under 14 in the Netherlands ’ four largest cities .
There are 1 million Muslims ( 6 percent of the population ) now living in Europe ’s most crowded small country .
Some 30,000 new Muslims arrive every year .
They tend to live among themselves , with their own schools , mosques and restaurants .
Most are horrified by what they view as sacrilegious in their own religion .
Their imams speak no Dutch and know nothing of the Netherlands ’ history and culture .
Western Europe as a whole gets about half a million new Muslims a year .
Most make their way from sub-Sahara Africa and North Africa , illegal immigrants smuggled by boat to Spain and Italy where they are free to travel with impunity to the rest of Europe .
Thus , Europe ’s Muslim population has doubled to 20 million in the last 10 years .
The anti-Muslim backlash spawned far right - wing parties .
Belgium ’s highest court this week ruled the anti-immigration Flemish Bloc party — the most popular political force in Dutch - speaking Flanders — will lose the government subsidies allocated to all parties , and is now forced to disband .
It quickly renamed itself the Flemish Interest Party , and toned down its inflammatory rhetoric .
Europe ’s largest mosque is in Rotterdam , which is also Europe ’s busiest port .
Half the people there are of foreign origin .
Unemployment among the Muslims is high .
And the Dutch live - and - let - live permissiveness made this nation , a quarter of it below sea level and protected by 1,500 dikes , ideal breeding grounds for Muslim fundamentalism and the kind of extremism that spawned one of Osama bin Laden ’s European fan clubs .
But for years the government was in denial about Islamist extremism in what is otherwise a well - managed society .
Dutch Muslims , repelled by the freewheeling lifestyle , sought solace with radical imams in the mosques .
There men outnumber women .
And women are relegated to a part of the mosque where they can be neither seen nor heard .
What Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo Van Gogh saw as the shabby treatment of females throughout the Muslim community led him to produce documentaries that portrayed Muslim men as tormentors of women , especially their wives .
One recent scathingly critical Van Gogh film ’s carried the message that Islam promotes violence against women .
Last week , Van Gogh , a grandnephew of the painter , was shot as he cycled to work .
He managed to get up and stagger across the street to his building where he collapsed .
The assailant followed him and slit his throat before pinning to his chest with a knife a five - page manifesto that called on Muslims to rise against the “ infidel enemies ” in the West .
Dutch security authorities launched a nationwide manhunt for the murderer of the popular Van Gogh .
A hand grenade injured four policemen as they went after two suspects in a working - class district of The Hague .
Air space over the capital was closed for a day as Dutch Special Forces lay siege to a building and the two surrendered after a 14 - hour standoff .
Ten others were arrested , including the prime suspect , a Muhammad Bouyeri , a 26 - year - old Dutch Moroccan , who was charged with murder and suspected links to an al Qaeda group .
A two - time visitor to Saudi Arabia , he had doffed Western clothes in favor of Arab dress .
Both Mr. Bouyeri and his close friend Samir Azzouz , 18 , another Dutch Moroccan , moved between five apartments in an Amsterdam suburb favored by Islamist radicals .
They were on Dutch intelligence ’s terrorist watch list as they communicated with like - minded extremist cells throughout Western Europe .
Last year , Mr. Azzouz was stopped in Ukraine and turned back as he made his way to Chechnya to fight the Russians .
Released by the Dutch and then rearrested because bomb - making equipment and detailed maps of public buildings were found with his fingerprints , he is in jail awaiting trial .
Tit - for - tat terrorism quickly followed Van Gogh ’s assassination in widely scattered parts of the otherwise peaceful Netherlands .
An arson attack against a Muslim school was followed in the same village of Uden by a Muslim attack against a primary school that was set ablaze and completely gutted .
Then a small bomb damaged a Muslim school in Eindhoven .
A score of mosques and churches were targeted by arson attacks in one week .
Two young men were also arrested for putting a video on the Internet that promised 72 virgins in paradise for the “ beheading ” of Geert Wilders , a popular right - wing politician who decries the dangers of radical Islam .
Two years ago , Pim Fortuyn , a populist politician who called for a halt to immigration , by simply saying the Netherlands was “ full , ” was similarly gunned down .
Over the past year , the presence of 1,300 Dutch troops in Iraq triggered repeated threats from Muslim groups .
Last summer , a last will and testament was found when an 18 - year - old man of Moroccan - born parents was arrested for plotting terrorist attacks in the Netherlands .
The list of targets included the Dutch parliament , Schiphol and the nuclear reactor at Borssele .
Floor plans of several public buildings were also found .
The former student wrote in his will he wants his newborn son to live “ in the spirit of jihad . ”
Described by a police psychiatrist as “ fearless and fatalistic , ” the student “ gradually fell under the spell of ideas about the oppression of Islam . ”
During a court hearing , his family remained seated as all present rose when the judge entered .
The mother was covered in a head - to - toe chador in Muslim fundamentalist fashion .
Islamist extremists even penetrated the Dutch intelligence service with a double agent .
One officer was arrested last September .
The government hastily drafted a Patriot Act - like law which enables it to strip citizens of their citizenship and deport them if they engage in extremist acts .
Could the Netherlands be a curtain - raiser for a wider clash of civilizations in the old Continent ?
Hundreds of thousands of young Muslims in Europe are potential jihadis , according to European intelligence chiefs speaking not for publication .
They have been warning their political masters about the tinderboxes that many Muslim communities have become .
Jihadi volunteers are known to have left for Iraq from a number of Muslim slums on the outskirts of major European cities .
Recruitment posters come on regular European and Arabic news programs — from the Abu Ghraib prison pictures to the battle of Fallujah .

Fusion reactor shows its metal Agençe France - Presse
The US researchers say they have found a way to cut down erosion of the metal reactor wall , which would be a crucial step to improving efficiency .
They publish their work online today in the journal
In fusion , atomic nuclei are fused together to release energy , as opposed to fission , the technique used for nuclear power and atomic bombs , where nuclei are split .
In a fusion reactor , particles are rammed together to form the charged gas plasma , contained inside a doughnut - shaped chamber called a tokamak , by powerful magnetic coils .
A consortium of countries signed a deal last year to build the
But many experts have been shaking their heads at the many challenges facing the ITER designers .
One challenge has been the phenomenon of edge localised modes , or ELMs , sudden fluxes or eddies in the outer edge of the plasma that erode the reaction chamber 's inner wall .
The tokamak 's inner wall is an expensive metal skin that absorbs neutrons emitted from the plasma .
And erosion would mean that the wall would have to be replaced more often .
Eroded particles also have a big impact on the plasma performance , diminishing the amount of energy it can deliver .
A team led by Todd Evans of General Atomics , California , believes that the problematic ELMs can be cleverly controlled .
The scientists found that a small resonant magnetic field , derived from special coils located inside a reactor vessel , creates ' chaotic ' magnetic interference on the plasma edge , which stops the fluxes from forming .
The experiments were conducted at the General Atomics ' DIII - D National Fusion Facility , a tokamak in San Diego .
Turbulence inside a tokamak ( Image : US National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center ) Nuclear fusion is the same process used by the Sun to radiate energy .
In the case of our star , hydrogen atoms are forced together to produce helium .
On Earth , the fusion would take place in a reactor fuelled by two istopes of hydrogen , deuterium and tritium , with helium as the waste product .
Deuterium is present in seawater , which would make it a virtually limitless resource .
Tritium would be derived from irradiating the plentiful element lithium in the fusion vessel .

If ITER works , a prototype commercial reactor would be built , and if that works , fusion technology would be rolled out across the world .
Other problems facing fusion technology include the challenge of creating a self - sustaining plasma and efficiently containing the plasma so that charged particles do not leak out .
In existing tokamaks , no one has achieved a self - sustaining fusion event for longer than about five seconds , and at the cost of using up far more energy than is yielded .
A huge jolt of heat of nearly 100 million°C is needed to kick - start the process , which then has to be sustained by tiny amounts of fuel pellets .
Physicists say they have cracked a problem facing nuclear fusion , touted as the cheap , safe , clean and almost limitless energy source of the future .

Pythagoras introduced numbers into this mix and put them on the male side of the ledger .
In the Pythagorean system , thinking about numbers , or doing mathematics , was an inherently masculine task .
Mathematics was associated with the gods , and with transcendence from the material world ; women , by their nature , were supposedly rooted in this latter , baser realm .
At the end of the Middle Ages , Pythagorean interest in a mathematical approach to science began to gain ground , and it is here that we begin to see the seeds of modern physics .
Image Lise Meitner , seen here in the 1930s , developed the theory of nuclear fission but was not included in the 1944 Nobel .

“ The creation of number was the creation of things , ” Thierry of Chartres wrote in the 12th century , when the first universities were formed and academic learning was formalized .
The universities were founded to educate the clergy , and since women could not be priests they could not attend .
Many university departments did not admit women at all until the early 20th century , and physics departments were often among the last to accept students and professors who were women .
The Pythagorean association of mathematics with transcendence was easily imported into a Christian context , giving rise to the idea of the Judeo - Christian god as a mathematical creator .
When Stephen Hawking links a theory of everything to the mind of god today , he is reiterating an essentially Pythagorean view .
But this godly - mathematical connection also sat easily with the Catholic tradition of a male - only priesthood .
Thus , from the start , women were excluded from this academic field and its associated sciences .
When the early scientific societies formed in the 17th and 18th centuries , most continued this misogynistic trend .
Henry Oldenburg , an original secretary of the Royal Society in Britain , wrote that the organization ’s mission was to “ raise a Masculine Philosophy . ”
Not until 1945 did this bastion of science admit a woman as a full member .
Female physicists have continued to confront deep - seated prejudices .
Emmy Noether , who discovered that all physical conservation laws were associated with mathematical symmetries , was a contemporary to Einstein and helped work out some of the math of general relativity .
She did so without a formal academic position and mostly without pay .

All of these fit a theme .
Which is :
If everyone did these unselfish things , traffic would be much better :
When you tailgate , you have to tap your brakes at the slightest speed change .
You tap for a second , the guy behind you taps for two , the guy behind him for four , and so forth .
Ripple effect that equals slowdown .
ACCELERATE !
Get up to a speed that matches overall traffic , then merge seamlessly .
Too many people here merge into 60 mph traffic at 40 mph .
People hit their brakes , and again you get a ripple effect .
Move over when not overtaking cars .
Yes , we 've talked this one to death .
Just do it .
Incessant lane changes for little real gain can cause slowdowns for much the same reason as the onramp example above .
Think ahead :
Will the lane you 're in peter out soon , or turn into an exit - only lane ?
Get yourself in one that will see you through to your destination .
If you 're first in line waiting at a light , be sure you 're pulled up far enough , as someone here already noted .
Then PAY ATTENTION !
Watch the light .
When it changes , go !
Driving is war , and you 've got the point -- so stay alert !
That goes for everyone in the back of the line too , but we have way too many people at the front who use stoplight time to apply makeup , read the paper , change the radio station or eat french fries off their car 's floor .
If traffic 's going 60 in your lane , why are n't you keeping up with the guy ahead of you ?
Why do you feel the need to go 57 ?
Again , you 're part of a collective out there .
Join in , please .
Because every time someone gets pulled over , it gums up traffic for the rest of us .
People rubberneck and irrationally brake ( like the trooper 's gonna drop you to go after them ) , and the aforementioned ripple effect ensues .
So drive briskly , but do n't risk a ticket .
If you 're going over 70 in a 60 mph zone , you 're risking it .
I get on I - 5 northbound everyday from Fairview at Mercer .
Two lanes from Fairview are onramp only .
Invariably someone is sitting in the middle , onramp - only lane who wants to go straight .
And he just sits there , and people are stuck behind him .
It happens at every signal , because the mope did n't READ THE SIGNS .
Look ahead .
Lookahead .
Look way past that big hurkin' SUV you 're behind , if you can .
The sooner you see signs and the sooner you see trouble , the sooner you can avoid messing up in a way that affects the rest of us .
Let people in .
Wave when someone lets you in .
I wish I had a buck for every time I 've signaled to enter a gap in a lane , and the car that 's far back in that lane guns it to try to keep me from moving over .
No wait , I do n't wish I had a buck , I wish I had his head on a pike .
But you 've gotta check that impulse too .
Do unto others ... you know .
This is covered in many of the points above , but driving is not simply something you do to pass the time while listening to the radio .
Driving is the all - consuming task at hand .
So DO it -- briskly , efficiently and competently .
So that we can all get out of each other 's way .
Thank you .

The Pentagon ’s latest quarterly " progress " report to Congress on Iraq is a grim tale of a lost war .
The Pentagon told Congress what Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , and propaganda organs such as Fox " News " never tell the American public , namely :
The Sunni - based insurgency remains " potent and viable " despite spiraling Sunni -Shiite violence and beefed up US forces .
Since the last report three months ago , Iraqi casualties from " sectarian clashes " — the Pentagon ’s euphemism for civil war — have soared by more than 50 percent .
From May when the new Iraqi government was established until August , the average number of weekly attacks increased sharply to 800 .
Since the previous report , Iraqi daily casualties have jumped by 50 % from 80 per day to 120 per day .
Currently , Iraqis are dying at the rate of 43,800 per year from violence .
The Iraqi government cowers behind the fortified walls of the " Green Zone . "
On August 31 , the Kurds in the north took down the Iraqi flag and replaced it with the Kurdish one .
Most of Iraq is ruled by Shiite and Sunni militias .
Conflict between them has forced 160,000 Iraqis to flee their homes .
Who is going to tell Bush that the war is lost ?
Is Rumsfeld going to tell him ?
Is Cheney going to tell him ?
How can they tell him after all the bravado and false reports ?
This is a delusional administration .
Confronted with three major polls showing that two - thirds of Americans oppose the Iraq war , Bush declared that he is staying the course , demonstrating yet again his disdain for common sense and the will of the American people .
If Bush and his neoconservative cabal were judged by their performance they would be ridden out of town on a rail .
If a court of law judged their actions , they would walk the plank .
Everything this moronic regime promised about a " cakewalk " war and the ease of pacifying Iraq and turning it into an American puppet democracy has turned to ashes in President Bush ’s mouth .
Having lost the Iraq war , the neoconservatives are determined to initiate war with Iran .
National security expert John Prados says , " The pattern of manipulation and misuse of intelligence that served the Bush administration in the drive to start a war with Iraq is being repeated today for its neighbor Iran . "
It is now established beyond a reasonable doubt that the neocons intentionally cooked up false intelligence in order to justify the invasion of Iraq , an invasion that has resulted in tens of thousands of Iraqi and American casualties , both dead and maimed .
Aggressive wars are themselves war crimes .
To intentionally create a false basis for an aggressive war is an act of high treason .
Alarmed by the neoconservative drive to start a war with Iran before the US can extricate itself from the Iraq catastrophe , the CIA firmly declared that any Iranian nuclear weapon is a decade away .
This undermines the neoconservatives ’ urgency to attack Iran now .
Neoconservative fanatics tried to discredit the CIA with a recent report by the House Intelligence Committee Republican staff written by neoconservative Frederick Fleitz , a protg of neocon heavyweight John Bolton , a person active in concocting the false case for war against Iraq .
Fleitz alleges that the CIA is a know - nothing agency that lacks the ability to assess Iran ’s ability to make nuclear weapons .
Neocons also dismiss the findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which issued a report on August 31 reaffirming that there is no tangible proof that Iran ’s nuclear energy program has a military aspect .
The neoconservatives plan to plunge America into war with Iran before they can be held accountable for the lost war in Iraq .
This neoconservative conspiracy against the United States and Iran must be stopped .
Neocons must be removed from the government that they have betrayed and held accountable for their crimes .
Before America can preach democracy to the world , we must first rescue American democracy from the Bush regime and re-establish government accountability to the people .

Today , our international internet links are bedevilled by unavoidable lag - the time it takes for data to travel from the US to a user 's PC in Australia .
For most of its journey , the data travels at the speed of light along optical fibres .
But each time the information stream is switched , amplified , reprocessed or regenerated , it requires silicon - based electronics , which are much slower .
These bottlenecks stand in the way of a 1000 - fold increase in the practical speed of the internet , the centre 's researchers say .
But they could be removed with optical computing , which uses light to switch light , without electronic interference .
Research director Ben Eggleton says the centre 's program has four strands : a " regenerator " that reproduces an optical signal without electronics ; a switch that uses a light signal to direct another light signal ; optical buffers to slow light pulses , making them easier to handle ; and three - dimensional photonic circuits .
The centre 's participants at Sydney University and the Australian National University are about a month away from demonstrating an optical switch , he says .
( The centre 's other members are Macquarie University , University of Technology Sydney , and Swinburne University of Technology . )
Although scientists around the world work on the same problem , Professor Eggleton says the centre takes a unique approach .
It is working with a soft glass called chalcogenide , which changes its refracting properties when hit by high - intensity pulses of light - becoming a basic switch .
The glass switches at very low powers , which makes it easier to work with and promises more practical applications .
Chalcogenide can also be printed , to create circuits .
Scientists created " band gap " structures within the glass - patterns of tiny holes that further control the light beams .
Professor Eggleton says this band gap could be the photonic equivalent of the basic unit of electronics - the semi-conductor .
" The band gap allows light to be moved in a particular direction .
It allows us to make circuitry , " he says .
" So we have a very compact , low - power optical switch that can be incorporated into an optical circuit , which can be made using basic lithography ( circuit printing ) . "
Other optical switches have been demonstrated using silicon , but the use of glass should allow much higher speeds .
The team hopes to demonstrate its first optical switch within the next few months .
This would be an early step in creating a practical photonic circuit .
Such a circuit would dramatically improve the speed of data - flow around the world .
" The aim is to do more and more signal processing optically , " Professor Eggleton says .
A beam of light is much faster and more agile than an electronic current .
" Electronics relies on electrons moving through semi-conducters and that has a real , inherent speed limit , " Professor Eggleton says .
" Photonics could be used in telecommunications or even in computing technology . "
THE PHOTONIC CHIP 1 Optical data signals ( light pulses ) enter the chip via glass fibres thinner than a human hair .
They are squeezed to fit the optical circuitry .
2 A switch , controlled by light , rapidly combines packets of optical data .
3
Integrated components act on the light , for instance changing its colour from blue to red , amplifying or delaying the signals .
4
The prism - like structure allows some colour data channels to be dropped while other channels are added for the next leg of the trip .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Fortune ) --
A roomful of 300 - odd flaks gathered over rubber chicken on Friday to hear a panel of 7 top tech journalists talk about the big stories as we see them .
If you 're interested in the collective wisdom of Don Clark at the Wall Street Journal , David Satterfield at the San Jose Mercury News , Joel Dreyfuss at The Red Herring , Steve Fox at Infoworld , Andreas Kluth at The Economist , moderator Larry Magid of CBS News , and me , listen to the podcast here .
One of the main topics was the coming son - of - Google boom .
With Google 's ( Charts ) stock price north of $ 500 , it 's clear the company is still on an upward trajectory .
The company continues to command respect in the Valley .
It has a great brand and is raking in cash .
Meanwhile , smart people like Joe Kraus continue to join the fold .
And yet , just over two years after the IPO , employees have begun trickling out .
The evidence is mostly anecdotal at this point , yet everyone seems to know someone who has either left the company or is about to go .
Of course this always happens with a successful company .
But Google 's famously lofty hiring standards and arduous interview regimen seems to be hastening the process .
Too many smart people
I met Kraus over coffee a couple weeks ago , 10 days into his new job as director of product management ( Google acquired his latest wiki startup , Jotspot ) .
When I asked him about his first impressions , he said his colleagues were smarter than he could have imagined .
Seeing that I was unimpressed by the observation , Kraus grew more insistent .
" Ten days in a new job and you do n't meet anyone who 's dumb ?
That 's weird , " he said .
Kraus meant it as a compliment for his new colleagues and to his new employer .
Every company wants to hire the smartest people possible , and Google has clearly succeeded .
But you know what you get when you get too many smart people in one room ?
You get the corporate equivalent of the U.S. Olympic basketball team .
Think about it : there can only be one smartest person in every room .
There are dozens of trophy hires and incredibly smart , entrepreneurial minds buried inside Google who are fast - becoming frustrated with their inability to accomplish anything .
And while Google motors along , minting money with its AdSense and AdWords programs , these brilliant minds are getting antsy .
Armed with seven - figure bank accounts and professional networks of dozens of other equally brilliant and rich new friends , those frustrated Googlers are bound to set out on their own and ignite a son - of - Google wave of innovation .
If a company the size of PayPal can kick off a second wave that includes LinkedIn , Slide , Yelp , YouTube , Clarium Capital , and Room 9 Entertainment , among others , the sons - of - Google wave should be a world - changer .
But what will it mean for Google ?
For starters , it 'll provide an additional food chain for new products and features .
The profligate M&A spending of all the GAMEY ( Google , Apple ( Charts ) , Microsoft ( Charts ) , Ebay ( Charts ) , Yahoo ( Charts ) ) companies has touched off a run of feature innovation over the last few years .
You can be sure Google will be on the inside track to acquire the latest ideas of former employees .
But this trend should also alter the company 's hiring practices .
With less and less obvious upside in GOOG stock , the company can no longer count on hiring the cr�me .
Which is just fine .
I guarantee there are a ton of menial jobs at Google that would bore the average Googler to tears .
If you need someone to write press releases , you do n't start the hiring process with Pulitzer prize winners .
If you need someone to hold the camera for the weekly vlog , it 's in no one 's best interest to recruit a Ivy League grad with an Academy Award nomination .

I 've decided that the Yoneda lemma is the hardest trivial thing in mathematics , though I find it 's made easier if I think about it in terms of reverse engineering machines .
So , suppose you have some mysterious machine .
You know it 's a pure functional Haskell machine ( of course ) with no funny stuff ( no overlapping or incoherent instances or anything like that [ 1 ] ) .
The machine works like this : for some fixed type , whenever you give it a function of typeit gives you back an object of type .
You can chooseto be whatever type you like , it always works .
Is it possible to reproduce the machine exactly after testing it just a finite number of times ?
Sounds impossible at first , it seems the machine could do just about anything .
Think about how this machine could work .
You can choosefreely , and whateveryou choose , it needs to come up with an object in .
There is no way to do this uniformly in Haskell without doing funny stuff .
( I 'm rulingto be funny stuff too . )
So how could this machine possibly generate a ?
There 's only one possible way , it must use the function of typeto generate it .
So that 's how it works .
It has an objectof typeand when you hand it anit returns .
You should also be able to convince yourself that there 's no way it could vary thedepending on whatyou give it .
( Try writing a function that does ! )
Having narrowed the machine 's principle down , it 's now easy to figure out what a the machine is using .
Just hand itand it 'll hand you back .
So in one trial you can deduce exactly what the machine does ( at least up to functional equivalence ) .
We can specify this formally .
The machine is of type : .
The process of extracting thefrom the machine , by giving it the identity , can be described by this function :
Given the output of thefunction , we can emulate the machine as follows :
You 're probably wondering why the functions are called these names .
See footnote [ 2 ] for that .
I 'll leave it to you to prove thatandare inverses to each other .
But now there 's another machine to consider .
This one takes as input a functionand gives you back , not just onebut a whole list full of them .
Maybe you 're already guessing how it works .
If it 's generating a bunch of objects of typethen it must surely have a bunch of 's and it must be applying your functionto each one .
In other words , the machine 's behaviour must be something like thisSo if this were the case , how would we determine whatwas ?
How about using the same trick as before :
You should be able to prove thatandare mutual inverses .
" But what about this ... " you ask , suggesting an alternative definition for the machine : That has the correct type signature but it does n't seem to have the same form as .
However , with a tiny bit of work we can show it 's functionally equivalent to one that does .
In fact we can just plugintoand it will give us a list of A's that can be used in .
Instead ofwe could use any functionand we 'd still get a sensible result out of .
The reason is that ifis of typethenequals .
( This is a Theorem for Free ! .)
So we can rewriteaswhich looks just like our .
So however we munge up our list to make our machine unlikewe can always ' commute ' the munging to the right so it acts on the internal list of 's , converting into a machine like
One last example :
This time we hand our machine aand it gives us back another function , but this one is of the type , for some fixed .
It modifies the ' front end ' of the input function so it can take a different argument .
How could that possibly work ?
There 's one obvious way : internally the machine is storing a functionand when you hand it your function it returns the composition with the function it 's storing .
Here 's a potential design for this machine :
Maybe you think there 's another type of machine that converts 's to's .
If you do , try writing it .
But I think there is n't .
So now we can write the code to reverse engineerpulls extracts the internally representedandmakes a functionally equivalent machine out of one .
So ... I hope you 're seeing the pattern .
To make it easier , I 'll define some functors :
Now all three example machines have the same form .
For some functorthey map a functionto an object of typeand we deduce that internally they contain an .
We can now write out versions ofandthat work for all three machines :
The above examples follow when we consider the functorsand ( for various values of c ) respectively .
Yoneda 's lemma is essentially the statement thatandare mutual inverses .
So if you understand my examples , then you 're most of the way towards grokking the lemma .
At this point I should add some details .
We 're working in the category of Haskell types and functions .
Expanding out the category theoretical definition of a natural transformation , between two functorsandingives .
In this category , natural transformations correspond to polymorphic functions between functors with no funny stuff so this equality actually comes for free .
( To be honest , I have n't seen a precise statement of this , but it 's essentially what Theorems for Free ! is about . )
Yoneda 's lemma actually says that for all functorsthere is an isomorphism between the set of natural transformations of the typeand the set of instances of .
So now I can give proofs : I 'll confirm thatis natural , ie .
that ( check f ) . ( fmap g ) = ( fmap g ) .
( check f ) , although , as I mentioned above , this is automatically true for polymorphic functions without funny stuff .
So that 's it , Yoneda 's lemma .
It 's trivial because the isomorphism is implemented by functions whose implementations are a couple of characters long .
But it 's hard because it took me ages to figure out what it was even about .
I actually started with examples outside of Haskell .
But Haskell has this weird property that polymorphic functions , with minor restrictions , are natural transformations .
( I think this is the deepest mathematical fact about Haskell I 've come across . )
And as a result , is an excellent category in which to learn about Yoneda 's lemma .
I also recommend What 's the Yoneda Lemma all about ? by Tom Leinster .
His presheaf example is the one at which these ideas started making sense to me - but that 's because I 've spent a lot of time playing with Čech cohomology on Riemann surfaces , so it might not work for everyone .
This comment is also worth some thought .
In fact , is the Yoneda lemma itself a Theorem for Free ?
I have n't said anything about the deeper meaning of the Yoneda lemma .
That might have something to do with the fact that I 'm only just getting the hang of it myself ...
And if you 're still confused , let me quote the ubiquitous John Baez : " It took me ages to get the hang of the Yoneda lemm [ a ] " .
And nowadays he's one of the proprietors of the n-Category Café NB Everything I 've said is modulo the equivalence of natural transformations and polymorphic unfunny functions .
I may have got this wrong .
If so , someone please correct me as I 'm sure everything I say here will still hold after some minor edits :-) [ 1 ]
Consider the following compiled using GHC with - fallow - overlapping - instances - fglasgow - exts : is the identity for everything except for objects of type .
This is an example of what I call " funny stuff " . [ 2 ]
The accent on this letter ' č ' is called a caron or háček .
The book from which I learned about the Yoneda lemma used the caron to indicate the function I call .
I called it that because the TeX command to produce this symbol is \check .
This is a multilayered pun , presumably by Knuth .
It could just be that ' check ' is an anglicised abbreviation for háček .
But it 's also a characterisically Czech accent so it 's probably also an easier ( for English speakers ) spelling for ' Czech ' .
And I think it 's also a pun on Čech .
The caron is used on an H to represent Čech cohomology and so it's also called the ' Čech ' accent .
( I hope you can read those characters on a PC , I wrote this on a Mac. )

It should be no secret that the Medialoper team loves words .
We ’re crazy about tools that help us organize and clarify our thoughts .
We ’re suckers for outliners , and we really adore a good text editor .
And while we use TextMate every single day , sometimes we want to work more closely with other members of the team .
Collaboration is a good thing .
That ’s why we like SubEthaEdit so much .
What is this SubEthaEdit we speak of , and how can it be so great if you ’ve never heard of it ?
So glad you asked .
It ’s a collaborative writing environment that allows multiple authors to work simultaneously on the same text file .
It ’s sort of like chat mode for writers .
You may have noticed the use of the word “ we ” .
That ’s because Kassia and Kirk are collaborating on this story , or , rather , Kirk and Kassia are co-writing this story .
Jim is out this week , and , conveniently , it ’s his turn to write “ That ’s What I Like ” .
He asked us to fill in for him – probably for the last time ( Jim , this is why they invented pre-posting ) .
Even if Jim were here , he could n’t participate with us .
SubEthaEdit only runs on Mac , and there ’s nothing even remotely similar for Windows ( trust us , we ’ve looked ) .
We ’re not Mac zealots by any means ( okay , that ’s a lie ) , but the Mac environment offers a lot of cool tools designed to enhance the creative process ; if you ’re on the switching edge and have the soul of an artist , remember that .
Right about now Windows users are probably grumbling , we know .
What sort of collaborative environment does n’t support Windows ?
SubEthaEdit gets its power from Bonjour ( nee Rendezvous ) which is Apple ’s brand name for Zero Configuration Networking ( which you do n’t have to know about to use ) .
Microsoft is building support for the protocol into the next version of Windows – which should be out any year now .
If Windows users wait long enough , they might be able to join the party .
In the meantime , you ’ll have to borrow a Mac .
If you have a Mac and have enabled Bonjour , you can join the SubEthaEdit party , provided you ’ve been invited to play along .
SubEthaEdit has the necessary security to keep the riff - raff out of your document .
Author contributions are color coded so you know who to blame when someone finds a typo ( actually , we always know who to blame ) .
It ’s great for brainstorming .
You can get a lot of ideas down very quickly .
We like to bounce around , adding a thought here , expanding an idea there .
One might be getting all technical on one point while the other is listing every thought that comes into her mind , hoping it will either make sense later or someone else will figure out what ’s going on .
SubEthaEdit creates a different kind of writing energy .
Writing is generally a solitary endeavor — with good reason — but brainstorming is often more successful when ideas are shared and expanded .
Granted , final edits should be done in a less collaborative environment .
There ’s a time for change , and the last draft ai n’t it ( unless we ’re writing for Medialoper ) .
Sure , collaborative writing can be both incredibly fun and sometimes maddening , especially when someone begins to edit a block of text that you ’re about to work on or changes something you got JUST RIGHT ( oops , we just changed something we wrote ) .
That ’s collaboration .
If you ’re the sort of person who likes to write and you have a Mac — and at least one friend — give SubEthaEdit a try .
One of the other great things about SubEthaEdit is that it ’s free for personal use .
Remember , two writers are faster than one .
And they could eventually be used to make more advanced prosthetic limbs , say researchers at University of Texas .
Writing in Science , they say these artificial muscles are 100 times more powerful than the body 's own .
They said they could even be used in " exoskeletons " to give superhuman strength to certain professions such as firefighters , soldiers and astronauts .
The approach could transform the way complex mechanical systems were built
Dr John Madden , University of British Columbia
Two types of muscle are being investigated by US researchers at the Nanotech Institute at the University of Texas in Dallas , working with colleagues from South Korea .
Both release the chemical energy of fuels , such as hydrogen and alcohol , while consuming oxygen .
In effect they are replicating the first stage in " breathing " - by taking in oxygen .
The existing form of artificial muscles are driven by batteries .
However , neither of the types developed by the Texan researchers resembles a normal muscle - being made up of wires , cantilevers and glass bottles .
' Mimicking nature '
The most powerful type , " shorted fuel cell muscles " convert chemical energy into heat , causing a special shape - memory metal alloy to contract .
Turning down the heat allows the muscle to relax .
Lab tests showed that these devices had a lifting strength more than 100 times that of normal skeletal muscle .
Another kind of muscle being developed by the team converted chemical energy into electrical energy which caused a material made from carbon nanotube electrodes to bend .
Dr John Madden , from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , writing in Science , said " the approach could transform the way complex mechanical systems were built " .
He said the artificial muscles mimicked nature in a number of ways .
" The muscle consumes oxygen and fuel that can be transported via a circulation system ; the muscle itself supports the chemical reaction that leads to mechanical work ; electrochemical circuits can act as nerves , controlling actuation ; some energy is stored locally in the muscle itself ; and , like natural muscle , the materials studied contract linearly . "
But he said the challenge now was to create a circulation system like that of humans that replaces the wires in the artificial muscles .
Dr Madden said pressures needed to be generated so that waste gases could be produced , and the artificial muscles could truly be described as " breathing " .
Forgive me if I call them tar sands , dear readers .
I know that the marketing people want to call them " oil " sands , because it is better for the real estate values .
After all , would you rather have oil on your land or tar ?
And what sounds better when you meet some new people down at the club and want to impress them : " Hello , I 'm in the tar business " or , " Hello , I am an oilman " ?
I am sure that you can see the difference .
One guy drills oil wells , and there is no question about it .
The other guy might fix roofs for a living , or seal your driveway .
What are the Canadian tar sands ?
So what are we talking about ?
The Canadian tar sands are an extensive deposit of oil - rich bitumen ( another word for tar ) located in northern Alberta , Canada , with some extensions into adjacent Saskatchewan .
These sands consist of a mixture of crude bitumen , which is a semisolid form of crude oil ( aka tar , because the hydrocarbons are more carbon and less hydrogen ) that impregnates rocks that are composed primarily of sand and clay .
The bitumen is almost entirely immobile within the rock matrix , and does not flow into a well bore like conventional crude oil .
You have to , as the expression goes , " add energy " to make bitumen flow and to extract the product .
Add energy ?
And a whole lot more , as we shall see .
And there 's the rub .
The largest deposit in Alberta is called the Athabasca tar sands , and there are two other smaller bodies known as the Peace River and Cold Lake deposits .
Together , these tar sand deposits cover about 140,000 square kilometers ( about 54,000 square miles , or an area about the size of Florida ) .
The terrain in the region is one of sparsely populated boreal forest and peat bogs .
It is , in many respects , a part of the far north right out of a Robert Service poem .
The Athabasca sands are named after the Athabasca River , which cuts through the heart of the eponymous deposit .
Traces of tar and heavy oil have been found along the riverbanks since ancient times .
Just as with the Seneca Indians of Pennsylvania and New York , who recovered oil from seeps long before Col .
Drake ever set foot in the region , the Cree and Dene tribes of the more westerly region waterproofed their canoes using the Alberta bitumen .
The first record of the Canadian tar sands being noted by European explorers was in 1788 .
How is oil extracted from the tar sands ?
One of the most important characteristics of the above - described Athabasca deposit is that it is the only one shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining .
That is , about 10 % of the Athabasca sands are covered with less than 75 meters ( about 250 feet ) of overburden .
The area amenable for mining , according to data supplied by the Alberta government , covers about 3,400 square kilometers ( about 1,300 square miles ) north of the city of Fort McMurray .
The overburden consists of 1 - 3 meters ( 3 - 10 feet or so ) of water - logged muskeg on top of up to 75 meters ( 250 feet ) of clay and barren sand .
The pay zone , the underlying tar sands , are typically 40 - 60 meters thick ( up to about 200 feet ) and are deposited above relatively flat limestone beds .
It is a strip miner 's dream .
The first " tar sand strip mine " was started by Great Canadian Oil Sands ( now Suncor ) in 1967 .
The Syncrude mine , among the largest mines in the world , followed in 1978 .
The Albian Sands mine , operated by Shell Canada , opened in 2003 .
All three of these strip mines are associated with massive handling and processing systems that mine the rock with giant earthmoving equipment and hauling trucks the size of a McMansion .
The mined rock is hauled to a massive facility that upgrades the material and converts the otherwise almost unusable bitumen into synthetic crude oil for shipment to refineries in Canada and the United States .
In addition to the ones named here , there are many more such mines and facilities in the planning stage and coming on line .
Do the facts live up to the hype ?
The attendees of the ASPO conference in Boston were privileged to hear the views of one David Hughes , whose employer is an agency named the Geological Survey of Canada ( GSC ) .
I should note at the outset that Mr. Hughes was speaking from his " personal perspective , " based on his more than 30 years of work as a geologist , and " not as an official spokesperson for the GSC or the government of Canada . "
Of course .
Personal or no , within a few seconds of opening his mouth , you just plain knew that Mr. Hughes understands what he is talking about .
And he was talking about the Canadian tar sands , except for some reason he called them " oil " sands .
Marketing , I suppose .
Mr. Hughes noted at the outset that there have been more and more exuberant forecasts issued over the past several years for the Canadian sands .
They are , he said , the " Great White Hope of a panacea to support business as usual " in the world of increasing energy consumption based on depleting conventional oil reserves .
But , he says , the " forecasts do not live up to the hype . "
The immense numbers often quoted for reserve and resource calculations , some as high as 300 billion barrels of oil equivalent , are " comforting , " says Mr. Hughes , " but also meaningless when it comes to offsetting declines in conventional oil production . "
The difficulty , according to Mr. Hughes , is in " growing deliverability . "
What does this mean ?
According to Mr. Hughes , the tar sands " are a complex resource , requiring much time , energy , capital , and other inputs to achieve deliverability . "
Yes , they are a significant hydrocarbon resource , but the issue is whether or not they are ultimately " deliverable " as a useable end product , at a total price that Canada and its customers can afford .
Here is a summary of the well - informed perspective of one expert in the field .
The drawbacks : long lead times , large capital investment According to Mr. Hughes , the Canadian tar sands cannot significantly offset the impending decline in world oil production , because of the long lead times and massive capital investment required .
Even under the best and most optimistic of scenarios , Canadian tar sands might yield about 3 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of product by 2025 , or about 2.5 % of forecast world demand of 120 million bpd by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
This latter number is itself , from the IEA , remarkably rosy .
120 million bpd of total world oil usage by 2025 ?
From what sources will that oil originate ?
I have addressed this point in many of my previous articles in Whiskey & Gunpowder , and this will continue to be a subject of my writing efforts .
But back to ASPO and Mr. Hughes .
Restrictions on natural gas supply Production of " oil " from the tar sands is a very energy - intensive process .
Production estimates for 2025 are that the energy input will require between 1.6 - 2.3 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of natural gas per day , approximately equal to the planned maximum capacity of the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline ( 1.9 bcf /d ) out of northern Canada , or about one - fifth of anticipated daily Canadian gas production .
Pipelines or no , the energy requirements of the projects planned for tar sands development already exceed the amount of available natural gas from the entire Mackenzie River project .
Virtually all estimates for natural gas usage in tar sands operations by 2015 , just 10 years hence , exceed the projections for available amounts of natural gas .
Something has got to give .
In another respect , using natural gas for Canadian tar sands development creates a political issue for Canada due to its obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
The NAFTA issue arises because if Canada uses natural gas for tar sands development , that nation will have that much less gas available for export to the U.S .
But also under the terms of NAFTA , Canada cannot reduce natural gas exports to the U.S. unless it also reduces natural gas consumption within Canada .
And because sometimes it gets cold in Canada in the wintertime , there may be a domestic Canadian political issue wrapped up in all of this .
Thus the expansion of Canadian tar sands capacity is limited by natural gas supply , and indirectly by the price of natural gas , which will drive the economics of expansion and continued use of the sands resource .
One possible exception to the natural gas limitation would be to develop nonthermal processing technology or to switch to alternate fuels for the tar sand process heat required .
These types of alternate solutions are not even on the drawing boards , and hence are highly speculative .
If any alternatives to using natural gas are going to be adopted , these new energy sources will have to be fast - tracked to get them online in time for the tar sands projects to make use of them .
Some examples of alternate energy sources are burning the bitumen that is extracted from the tar sands , or using coal bed methane .
Each technique will require its own rather extensive industrial infrastructure .
And each of these energy sources emits relatively higher levels of greenhouse gases that natural gas , so Canada will face international criticism , if not other sanctions , over higher CO2 emissions .
( Darn , there 's that " global warming " thing again . )
There are proposals to use nuclear plants in the Alberta area to provide process heat or other required energy input .
But nuclear plants create issues of their own .
These include the capital costs for the plants , the difficulty of constructing such facilities in the Alberta region , time - to - build issues , safety and nuclear waste issues , and the need to construct energy transmission facilities for electricity or steam .
Plus , there are the same kind of " not in my backyard " ( NIMBY ) people in Alberta as there are in most other locales of North America .
Do you want a nuclear plant near you ?
A lot of people do not .
Limitations on water supply Another limitation on tar sands expansion is that processing capacity is limited by water supply .
Much water is already being recycled using current technology , but current production techniques require 1 - 2 barrels of " makeup " water per barrel of product .
It will be imperative to develop technology that uses less water or that recycles even more of the water being used .
And doing this is not nearly as easy as you might think .
Surface water flows , principally from the Athabasca River , are simply inadequate to meet forecast needs .
And deeper water , from underground aquifers , is saline and must be diluted with fresh water or otherwise desalinated .
Whoops .
This will require more of that energy input stuff .
Immense amounts of water are currently being discarded into settlement ponds , in which it may take 200 years for the smallest particles to settle down to the bottom .
Meanwhile , the water is toxic , and mixed with exceedingly high levels of heavy metals and other exotic elements that you probably do not want to eat .
Some of these impoundment ponds are many miles in area , and will pose an environmental problem or hazard for many centuries .
Other limitations : transport and diluent Assuming that there will be sufficient energy and water to utilize in tar sands operations , any expansion of bitumen export capacity from Alberta may be limited by projected shortfalls of what is called " diluent . "
What is diluent ?
Begin with the fact that bitumen is thick , heavy , and viscous .
It will not flow , and cannot be moved through a pipeline unless it is diluted with a lighter medium , or diluent .
The best types of diluents are natural gas condensates , but these are becoming rapidly scarce due to depletion of gas reserves .
Tar sand bitumen needs a one - third blend of condensates or a half blend of synthetic light oil to move it through a pipeline .
The alternative is to utilize synthetic crude of light oil as diluent .
But from where will the diluent come ?
One company named Enbridge ( ENB ) is looking to import 150,000 - 200,000 barrels per day of condensate or light oil , just to re-export it as diluent in pipeline operations .
The projected cost exceeds $ 4 billion per year .
This is expensive , but without importing diluent to the Alberta region , it will be necessary to upgrade bitumen on site to a " synthetic " grade and use it for that purpose .
This will require additional capital investment and cost .
Of interest , the pipeline that Enbridge is proposing to construct will run from the tar sands region to the Pacific coast and supply product for export to overseas markets , in all likelihood to China .
Pipeline problems
As if the shortage of diluent were not enough , the existing pipeline system in the Alberta region is inadequate to support the anticipated exports of bitumen , let alone the possible imports of significant quantities of diluent .
Thus , the region will require new pipeline capacity of about 1 million barrels per day .
The existing Alberta pipeline system will be at maximum capacity by mid-2008 .
There are , of course , proposed expansions that are intended to accommodate product movement , but these expansions will be fully utilized by between 2009 - 2011 .
There are no announced plans for pipeline capacity expansion after 2011 ( these might come along later , but they are not being proposed just yet . )
But absent even further expansion of the pipeline system , by 2011 , there will be an absolute limit of about 3.5 million barrels per day on product movement .
This includes diluent coming in and product going out .
Who will meet the capital costs ?
All construction and expansion activities in support of Canadian tar sands development in Alberta are competing within a world market for materials , equipment , and labor .
This includes everything from steel and cement , to complex industrial equipment , to engineering talent and field labor .
Some firms are flying welders into the region from as far away as Nova Scotia , and there is a serious housing shortage in the tar sands region .
It takes us back to that Robert Service line about being " camped there in the cold . "
As with almost all major energy development projects in the world , cost overruns in the tar sands region are epidemic .
For the past three years , each year and every major project has seen major , and increasing , overruns .
Petro-Canada , for example , has put its Fort Hills project on hold until 2008 due to cost estimates ballooning to the range of $ 19 billion , or over $ 130,000 per barrel per day of capacity .
Shell Canada has also scaled back expansion plans due to cost estimates more than doubling .
A while ago I wrote WPHP ( or perhaps more accurately I put it together from other people 's pieces ) for embedding a PHP app in Python with a WSGI facade .
The ultimate goal of that was actually to run specifically Wordpress under Python .
So I spent some time last night doing that , and created PyWordpress .
It seems to work .
It 's really very small , since WPHP does almost all the work .
( I might implement the Paste appinstall deployment setup which would expand its scope , but I 'm not sure . )
It does open up some development questions .
The biggest one is that this requires modifications to the Wordpress source .
Right now you just need the source plus a fixed wp - config .
php .
But if the appinstall stuff is implemented a new wp - admin / install .php will required .
Ultimately we want to embed Wordpress in Zope with topp.zwsgi , which means that authentication will come from Zope , so the authentication routines probably will have to change to respect REMOTE_USER .
Any number of other things may be added .
I doubt these would be reasonable upstream changes , though maybe so ( you could implement similar things with appropriate Apache configuration ) .
So , I have to figure out how to manage a minor fork of the Wordpress code , while also tracking upstream updates .
So it looks like I have a real use for Distributed Version Control .
I guess there 's really just two options I 'd consider : bzr ( or maybe Mercurial -- it 's hard for me to really distinguish them ) or svk -- svk seems unremarkable except for its relation to Subversion , but I want to track a Subversion repository , so maybe it 's perfect , I dunno .
The space shuttle 's external tank is used for just eight minutes , then ditched over the Indian Ocean .
It holds more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen , the highly volatile gases the craft 's main engines burn on the leap into orbit .
The tank is covered with plastic foam ; without that , it would ice over with moisture sucked from the Florida air .
At the dawn of the shuttle program , NASA rules said no foam at all should be allowed to hit the shuttle and possibly damage the fragile heat - resistant tiles that cover its aluminum skin .
But fidelity to those standards was relaxed over time ; in fact , foam fell from a PAL ramp in two early missions , including the one in June 1983 on which Sally Ride became the first American woman in space .
There may have been many more incidents , but dozens of shuttle missions have been launched in darkness , with no visual record of foam , and the tanks themselves cannot be retrieved from the ocean for analysis .
As the early tank was replaced with two lighter successors , the PAL ramps remained -- one a 19 - foot baffle along a channel for cables and pressurized lines along the forward end of the tank and the other the 37 - foot strip along the flank of the cylindrical midsection of the fuel tank .
And as experience showed NASA that shuttles returned safely despite well over 100 nicks and gouges requiring repair on many flights , the concerns abated over time .
Until Feb. 1 , 2003 , the day the Columbia disintegrated on its way home to Cape Canaveral .
It turned out that on liftoff , 16 days earlier , a 1.67 - pound piece of foam had fallen from the tank and struck the leading edge of the shuttle 's left wing .
Despite years of assurance that such a strike could do no serious damage -- a mind - set the Columbia Accident Investigation Board would call the " normalization of deviance " -- the foam had cracked open a hole that admitted superheated gases when the shuttle re-entered the atmosphere , burning it up like a torch from within .
After the accident , NASA examined all possible sources of liftoff debris , eventually identifying more than 170 .
Engineers recognized that they could not eliminate all risk from debris , but they could do a much better job of reducing it .
The PAL ramp became a focus of attention : like the bipod arm ramp , the part of the tank implicated in the Columbia disaster , it is covered with foam by hand .
NASA conducted extensive wind tunnel tests to see whether the ramp could be removed .

We grabbed our usual assortment of tools to make the board .
Our fine tip 15 watt soldering iron , a set of " helping hands , " a tube of solder some pliers and pair of diagonal or flat cutters .
Of course , we always keep a multi-meter handy .
Take a few minutes to lay out all of your parts .
Grab the instruction sheet and make sure you got everything .
Once it 's all accounted for , you 'll be ready to start building .
The instructions include just enough information to get you going .
The big chip is the PIC controller that runs the show ; it provides the control interface and feeds the data to the decoder chip .
The Daisy is an odd marriage of SMD decoder chip and monstrous PIC controller .
The real star is this little guy .
It 's a MP3 / WAV decoder and headphone amp all in one .
Soldering this chip to the board is the single most difficult , but important part of the build .
To mount the SMD chip , we tinned the solder pads with some solder .
If you 've got some liquid flux , your life will be easier later on .
If you do n't , just do n't cook the solder too much as you tin the pads .
Be sparing , it does n't take much .
Yeah , yeah , we know this looks ugly , but we prettied it up later .
Place the chip on the pads and heat each pin to melt the solder onto it .
While the rest of the board is clear , make sure you 've got a solid connection at each pin .
You can check them with your multimeter - we put one probe on the top of the lead , and the other at the tip of the solder pad .
If you 're picky , you can use some desoldering braid to remove some of the excess solder .
There are two crystals in the kit .
The marked crystal is 24.576 Mhz , while the unmarked is 10 Mhz .
They 're not polarized , so they can be mounted in either direction , just be sure to put them in the right locations .
After each component is soldered on , we trim each lead .
We 've found that flat cutter like these leave duller edges and help reduce flying bits .
If you have n't worked with resistor networks before , you 'll be missing a vital bit of information .
The dot on the end indicates the common lead .
This corresponds with the bar on the resistor nets in the instruction diagram .
With long components , we usually solder one lead , and position the part while it 's still hot .
After that , finishing the job is easy .
( To ensure good connections , make sure you heat the lead , then melt the solder on the hot tip / part lead . )
The headphone jack has fairly large leads .
Since it 's another surface mount component , we tinned the pads before mounting it .
You can get away without doing it -- in fact , we did n't bother when we installed the SD card jack .
Make note of the position of the notch on the DIP jack for the PIC controller .
It wo n't effect operation , but the notch indicates the pin numbering .
It 's good to be in the habit of following the standard .
The symbol for a diode looks like a triangle with a bar across one corner .
The bar indicates the cathode of the diode -- the line on the end of the diode also indicates the cathode .
Make sure you orient these in the proper direction before soldering them down .
The shape of the leads on the .01 uf capacitors is by far the most annoying part of the build .
They are too wide for all of the mounting holes .
The fix is simple enough .
Grab a pair of pliers and carefully straighten the leads .
Just do n't torque on the lead near the body of the capacitor !
Once that 's done , the biggest pain in the neck is placing all the caps in the various board locations .
We noted a botched stencil mask job here - the labels for c11 and c12 overlap with the solder pads for the decoder chip .
Ah well , we got the idea .
Mounting the voltage regulator is easy , just spread the leads a bit and insert it .
The flat face corresponds with the stencil on the board .
This 10 uf capacitor requires a bit of a bending job .
Make sure to orient the leads correctly before you bend them .
The cap does n't quite fit between the resistor net and the chip socket .
We bent the network over a bit and made sure it did n't interfere with chip insertion .
The biggest flaw in the instructions has to do with the LEDs .
LEDs are polarized -
The instruction sheet only notes the flat side of the LED to indicate polarity -- but the small LEDs that come with the kit lack a flat side .
The short lead on the LED also indicates the cathode .
So insert the LEDs with the short lead at the flat notation of the LED on the board .
Careful now !
When you try to install the PIC controller chip , you 'll find that the leads are a bit wider than the socket .
This is always the case with DIP hardware .
To fix it , place the edge on a flat surface and push down gently .
The idea is to bend all the pins uniformly .
We powered our Daisy up with 5 v from our bench top PSU .
( Modified PC power supply )
We noted some noise from the PSU in the sound output - battery power prevents this .
To use the Daisy , you 'll have to format either a SD / MMC card or a miniSD or microSD card in a SD adapter .
( We scored a 256MB miniSD with adapter for $ 10 , but you internet ferrets can probably do better . )
Once we formatted the card to FAT32 with an external card reader , we loaded up some MP3s and powered the Daisy up in it 's default configuration ( no jumpers -- it would have been nice if the kit included some in the kit ) .
The player started playing immediately at a decent volume .
The sound quality is actually very good .
We 'd say that the kit is a medium difficulty build -- the SMD chip is the hardest part .
After that , it 's pretty easy .
The most interesting feature of this mp3 player is the flexibility of the configuration .
Thanks to all the inputs and jumper configurations , the player can be customized to perform in most ways you can think of .
We wish it included a USB port to allow the memory card to be easily accessed .
For now you 'll need something else to load your songs with .
The various d-pins are temporarily grounded to tell the player what to do : track , volume , pause , etc .
Alright , we built it , now we 'll tell you what we think about it .
The good :
Open source -- you can modify the firmware ( especially with in - circuit programming ) .
Lots of room to grow with that monstrous new PIC controller .
The decoder chip sounds great .
Serial controllable .
Flexible from the get go -- you can choose the right mode and integrate it with other projects .
You need a PC and a card reader to format your card to FAT32
No USB interface for loading data .
Should include jumpers for the price -- they 're cheap , but can be a pain to hunt down .
No display interface .
The bad : What we 'd love from Daisy 2 : If it was a full on surface mount project .
The board would be smaller and the component cost could be reduced .
Include a die cut transparency to apply solder with and cook it on some aluminum foil over the stove .
In it 's current state it 's a neat project , but if all you want is music , a first - gen generation iPod nano does n't cost much more -- and has serial control available through the dock connector .
But you did n't buy this thing because you wanted a nano , obviously , you bought it because you wanted to build your own MP3 player just like Jobs and Gates .
Well , now you can !
The project is still very much in a laboratory phase , he said .
The researchers are still trying to refine the process , both to increase contrast and to extend control over the lifespan of the print process .
During the 1990s , the Japanese office equipment maker Ricoh developed a commercial system that made it possible to remove toner from paper to make recycling possible , he said .
It was possible to recycle individual pieces of paper up to 10 times , according to Ricoh , but that system is no longer commercially available .
Xerox has not yet decided whether it will commercialize its technology , Mr. Shrader said , but the goal is to create a system where the specially coated paper costs between two and three times standard copier paper , making the total cost of the system substantially less than conventional paper when paper is reused repeatedly .
The company said the precise nature of the technology was proprietary and that Xerox had applied for a number of related patents covering the invention .
The researchers describe the invention as being based on compounds that can change color when they absorb a certain wavelength of light , but can then gradually revert to their original appearance .
The compounds currently self - erase in about 16 to 24 hours , or can be erased immediately when heated .
The challenge Xerox faces is to find a market for a new paper printing technology in an era when information is increasingly being viewed and read on electronic displays of all types .
For example , PARC itself has done extensive research on the idea of “ electronic paper . ”
Its researchers separately developed an “ electronic reusable paper ” system called Gyricon .
A Gyricon sheet is a thin layer of transparent plastic composed of small beads similar to toner particles .
The beads are “ bichromal , ” with light and dark sides .
When a voltage is applied at different positions on the sheet , the beads rotate to create an image .
Xerox tried unsuccessfully to commercialize the technology .
The Sony Reader , introduced this year , is based on a similar technology developed by the E Ink Corporation of Cambridge , Mass .
“ I worry that this would be like coming out with Super 8 just before the video camera , ” said Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley researcher who has been a consultant to Xerox .
“ This would have been a bigger deal 10 years ago .
These days there ’s so much getting read online I wonder if time has n’t passed this by . ”
At a law school Supreme Court conference that I attended last fall , there was a panel on “ The Rehnquist Court . ”
No one mentioned Bush v. Gore , the most historic case of William Rehnquist ’s time as chief justice , and during the Q. and A. no one asked about it .
When I asked a prominent law professor about this strange omission , he told me he had been invited to participate in another Rehnquist retrospective , and was told in advance that Bush v. Gore would not be discussed .
The ruling that stopped the Florida recount and handed the presidency to George W. Bush is disappearing down the legal world ’s version of the memory hole , the slot where , in George Orwell ’s “ 1984 , ” government workers disposed of politically inconvenient records .
The Supreme Court has not cited it once since it was decided , and when Justice Antonin Scalia , who loves to hold forth on court precedents , was asked about it at a forum earlier this year , he snapped , “ Come on , get over it . ”
There is a legal argument for pushing Bush v. Gore aside .
The majority opinion announced that the ruling was “ limited to the present circumstances ” and could not be cited as precedent .
But many legal scholars insisted at the time that this assertion was itself dictum — the part of a legal opinion that is nonbinding — and illegitimate , because under the doctrine of stare decisis , courts cannot make rulings whose reasoning applies only to a single case .
Bush v.
Gore ’s lasting significance is being fought over right now by the Ohio - based United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , whose judges disagree not only on what it stands for , but on whether it stands for anything at all .
This debate , which has been quietly under way in the courts and academia since 2000 , is important both because of what it says about the legitimacy of the courts and because of what Bush v. Gore could represent today .
The majority reached its antidemocratic result by reading the equal protection clause in a very pro-democratic way .
If Bush v. Gore ’s equal protection analysis is integrated into constitutional law , it could make future elections considerably more fair .
Another government IT disaster .
10 years behind schedule , the Dunblane gun register is ' unfit for purpose ' .
The article also mentions it is ' fundamentally flawed ' .
I 've already blogged about the firearms register in the context of ID cards .
If we can't put together a firearms register after 10 years of effort , if it is ' fundamentally flawed ' and ' unfit for purpose ' ( according to the Police ) , how much money do we think the government 's going to waste on ID cards ?
Once again the tax payer will be footing the bill for another broken IT system .
In the context of ID cards : These are the words of Tony Blair , in a passionate speech against Identity Cards to the 1995 Labour party conference in Brighton .
And it 's cheaper and more effective than a broken computer system .
Wages for low - wage workers have been flat in recent years but health care costs have been increasing .
For a company like Wal - Mart , which pays many of its workers modest wages but does offer a reasonable health insurance plan , this is an invitation to adverse selection .
As the value of the wage component of the Wal - Mart benefit package has declined relative to the value of the health insurance component Wal - Mart has attracted more workers who want the job for the health benefits , i.e. sicker workers .
Reed Abelson writing in the NYTimes notes :
The Wal - Mart work force reflects a growing fear of many employers that the
people who work for them are increasingly at risk for health problems .
Many of
Wal - Mart ’s employees are obese , the company says , and a result is rapidly rising
numbers of cases of diabetes
or heart
disease .
The prevalence of these diseases among Wal - Mart employees is
increasing much faster than the national average , it says .
" The low - income population generally is not as healthy and does not engage as
much in preventive care , " said Diane Rowland , executive director of the Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured .
A risk that a company like Wal - Mart
faces , especially when it competes with smaller retailers that offer no
insurance at all , Ms. Rowland said , is attracting too many workers who want the
job primarily for the health coverage .
Wal - Mart ’s health care costs are rising faster than their revenues .
Other companies are trying to shift some of the cost of health care onto their workers but Wal - Mart ’s workers are already paying more than the national average so Wal - Mart may try to reverse adverse selection by adjusting their work and benefit package .
An internal memo suggests that :
… the company could require all jobs to include some
component of physical activity , like making cashiers gather shopping carts .
It
also recommends redesigning and expanding benefits to appeal to a different type
of worker , someone more interested in buying a home , say , than in getting health
insurance .
Wal - Mart will probably be pilloried for this sort of thinking but you can hardly blame them when the workers are engaging in almost the identical actions in reverse .
The more fundamental problem is the tying of insurance to work , a problem for which I am afraid there no win -win solution .
Comments are open .
Addendum : Rey Lehmann offers excellent commentary .

What Makes You Go For The Best Personal Injury Lawyer
The lawyer is a legal professional whose traditional functions are , on the one hand , to advise his clients on legal questions , whether they relate to their daily legal life , or to more specialized fields , and on the other part , to defend them an injustice , by pleading to protect their interests and , more generally , to represent them .
Representation by a lawyer is sometimes made compulsory by national law , in particular , to ensure the rights of the defense .
Here are the options for the legal information about personal injury for you now .
The Lawyer Can Intervene In Several Fields And Exercise Several Functions In These Fields .
The professions of lawyer and legal counsel have merged to form only one , under the single term “ lawyer ” .
The lawyer is therefore the only high - level legal partner who assists and defends the client in all areas of daily life , whether it is the lives of individuals or of businesses commercial companies , individual traders , artisans , liberal professionals .
The lawyers here are the bests for you now .
The lawyer can plead but it also has the task of advising the client on all matters relating to the legal field , even outside all litigation .
If necessary , he works alongside or in partnership with other legal professionals like notaries , solicitors , bailiffs , etc. or figures chartered accountants .
The lawyer advises his clients and , in the event of a trial , defends them .
A lawyer for you will be useful in every way now .
In order to fully exercise its advisory and defense mission , here is a non-exhaustive list of the different tasks assigned to the lawyer :
The Lawyer Informs And Advises His Client
The law is constantly evolving and extremely complex for a layperson , the assistance of the lawyer is essential .
It is advisable , before any litigation or even before any legal process , to question a lawyer in order to know the rules applicable in the field concerned .
A law firm is the best choice for you now .
The mission of the lawyer is to inform the client of the state of the regulations applicable to his situation and to make his project possible by giving it the most appropriate legal form , by carrying out the formalities and procedures necessary to make it effective and lawful , and this , in all areas of law for example business law , social law , tax law , family law , transport law , insurance law , criminal law , real estate law , environmental law .
Consulting a lawyer for advice makes it possible to carry out useful and compulsory formalities , to draft appropriate correspondence with interlocutors or partners , to avoid having to resort to a trial afterward .
Go for the law firms for you now .
This preventive role is an essential function of the lawyer and saves the client time and money .
It is the daily mission of the lawyer .
For the individual , the lawyer acts like a personal adviser at all times choice of a matrimonial regime , drafting of a PACS , advice on inheritance matters , various disputes , works contractors , insurers , bankers , employers , etc .
An attorney is the best choice for you now .
In the life of the company , it also ensures this mission by helping the professional , the entrepreneur , the craftsman , the trader or the company , to choose the form of the company , and to complete all the formalities of incorporation and management of the company creation of company , drafting of company statutes , restructuring , merger , rental management , spin - off , merger absorption , partial contributions of assets .
He therefore advises the operator throughout his activity by providing him with recommendations in all areas .
As an advisor to the company , he can also perform a legal , social or tax audit mission and help the company in its relations with partners drafting of distribution agreements , licenses or again with the employees ’ redundancy procedures , social plan .
The attorneys will help you in every way now .
The Lawyer Is Mandated To Act On Behalf Of His Client
When the client is confronted with the payment difficulties of his debtor , the lawyer can , at his request , take all the necessary measures , amicable or legal , to compel the debtor to pay , taking if necessary all the guarantees useful collateral , mortgages , etc .
The best legal help is right here .
When the client is in a difficult economic situation or is over - indebted , the lawyer is responsible for advising him and implementing all the measures necessary to find an amicable solution plans for staggering your debts , payment terms , forgiveness of debts with partners , creditors and employees of the company , before any legal action or in conciliation once the proceedings are initiated .
Taking the Legal help is the best choice here .
The lawyer can carry out , on behalf of his client , any approach with insurance companies , banks or companies in the event of damage suffered by his client in order to obtain amicable compensation .
The lawyer will then take all necessary steps to ensure his client compensation for his loss and to control any offers of compensation possibly made by insurers both on the amount proposed and on the compliance of these offers with the rights of the client and case law .
He can also complete all the formalities necessary for the review , renewal or termination of a contract , under the mandate given by his client .
A personal consultation can be useful here .
If you do n't have a sense of humor , stop reading now , go somewhere else , otherwise , continue reading this purposefully over the top rant .
Keep in mind , I 'm discussing VB , C# , and Java , not [ insert your favorite language where these things do n't apply ] .
On occasion , I 'm forced to get into other peoples code , in Smalltalk , this is usually a pleasure and a chance to learn something .
In other languages ( VB , C# , and Java ) where code is n't of the general quality of the average Smalltalker , I continually run into the same things over and over again that drive me insane .
Off the top of my head , here 's a few ...
Inability To Grok Booleans
Using an if statement to evaluate a boolean , only to return a boolean ...
if( someCondition ) return true ; else return false ;
Instead of ...
return someCondition ;
Comparing a boolean to true or false , as if it is n't already one ...
if( someCondition == true ) doSomething ( ) ;
Inability To Grok Assignment
I can't tell you how many times I 've seen this code ...
ArrayList someItems = new ArrayList ( ) ; someItems = BuildSomeList ( ) ;
when it's so blindingly obvious that this is equivalent ...
ArrayList someItems = BuildSomeList ( ) ;
Seriously , I can't imagine what mental defect makes people thing they have to create an ArrayList before the variable will allow an ArrayList to be assigned to it .
Ignorant Prefixing
From VB'ers , prefixing declared object variables with an " o " , as in oXml , to declare it an object , as if everything else somehow is n't an object .
In fact , Hungarian notation in general .
Stop prefixing your damn code with type declarations .
Booleans do n't need to start with b , strings do n't need to start with " str " , wake the hell up and join this decade people .
Single Exit Points
Constantly jumping through hoops and writing extra unnecessary code just to have a single return statement in a method ...
string result = " " ; if( someCondition ) result = " foo " ; else result = " bar " ; return result ;
Instead of ...
if( someCondition ) return " foo " ; return " bar " ;
There 's not a shortage of return statements , use them liberally , exit early and often , it produces much cleaner and much less ambiguous code .
Those old papers about structured programming that recommend this practice , no longer apply , we have garbage collection and your methods should n't be that damn long to begin with .
1000 Line Methods
A method should be 7 to 10 lines of code , any longer than that and you start having to comment sections to explain them , which is what methods are for in the first place .
There are exceptions , but they are exceedingly rare , on average , method should be short and simple and require little if any explanation beyond the method name itself .
Seriously , I 'm starting to think we should eliminate the scroll bar in code editors , when you hit the bottom , the computer should just start beeping at you like you 're an idiot for typing that much .
Declaring Variables At The Top Of A Method
In languages that allow it , you should always declare your variables and initialize them in the exact spot you want to use them .
Do n't declare variables as if they 're somehow a limited resource and keep reusing the same one over and over in different sections of code .
Declare your variables at the minimum level of scope necessary for them to be useful .
If you only need a variable inside a loop , then declare it in the loop ( optimizations aside ) , the code will be cleaner and more readable .
This is another one of those mental quirks that seems to come from having a history in Basic .
Stop it , please .
Too Many comments / Worthless Comments .
If I see more green than code , somethings wrong .
This modern JavaDoc style stuff is ignorant , if you need to explain the code that much , it sucks , really .
Comments should not replicate what the code says , they should augment what it can't , things like " why " you made a design choice belong in comments .
How , is for code , do n't repeat the how in the comments .
Do n't comment closing tags .
if ( foo == bar ) { // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code // bunch of code } // end if ( foo == bar )
this is beyond ignorant , you should be shot .
If you can't see the beginning of a tag on the same screen as the end of a tag , you need to learn how to factor .
Break thing up into smaller methods .
See 1000 line methods above , you have a disease , seek help .
Do n't comment sections of code to explain it , factor it into its own method and make the method name explain it .
Then if necessary , comment the method explaining the " why " .
Functions / Methods are the most basic building block of programs , they should be as small as bricks , not the size of entire freaking houses .
You can't compose solutions from a few giant functions , only from many many small ones .
Giant functions are n't reusable , maintainable , or acceptable , ever .
Still Using Error Codes
Stop using error codes and return values , use exceptions instead .
To put it simply , use the Samurai Principle , a method either succeeds , or blows up with a suitable exception .
Error codes are not acceptable in a modern language , it 's a dead technique .
Lack Of Consistency And Style
I might not like certain styles , but all too often I see code that lacks any style at all .
Code should have a style , things like naming conventions , casing conventions , factoring conventions , something .
Nothing bugs me more than code that clearly lacks any sort of style whatsoever .
Do n't name thing haphazardly , sometimes uppercase , sometimes lowercase , sometimes abbreviated , sometimes long .
Pick a style for local variables , parameters , instance variables , method names , class names , package names , constructor names , and accessor names .
If you have n't actually thought out how you want to do these things , stop , take the time , it 'll allow you to think much less in the future and write code cleaner and faster .
Go read Kent Beck 's Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns , steal his style until you develop your own .
Pick a style , stick with it , do n't write schizophrenic random looking code , it 's maddening to people who read it later .
Still Using Switch Statements
Stop using them , period .
There 's hardly any cases where polymorphism is n't more appropriate .
Use a class for each case , and break up these nightmare methods into separate pieces that can be worked on in isolation without fear of breaking the other cases .
Your switch statements will be duplicated , eventually , so just start with classes and avoid the inevitable refactoring .
There 's a reason Smalltalk has never had a case statement , think about it , HARD .
If you think you can't live without them , think harder , you 're wrong .
Obsessed With Simple Types
Though you can represent anything with a string , it 's ignorant to do so .
Every program should not be expressed with only Strings , Chars , Booleans , Integers , Doubles , and Decimals .
Build your own primitive types and use them as such .
Things like Money , SocialSecurityNumber , Address , Contact , User , Name , Email , Url , Company , and OrderNumber can all be primitives as well .
Write your programs in the language of the domain , not in the language of existing primitive types that are native to your language .
Stop passing around specially formated strings and validating them constantly , just stick them into a real object and use it instead .
Pass around whole objects , not id's to objects that you can look up later .
Learn to override ToString / asString / to_string so that your object print well when you stick them into things like drop down lists and such .
Writing code with objects native to the domain in general , greatly reduces the amount of code necessary to express rules in that domain in large part because it greatly eliminates duplicate code .
XML Hell
Stop using XML as if it were an object model .
Trees of objects are far superior to trees of strings loaded up into a generic DOM .
Use a real object model , and then if you need XML , serialize the objects into XML for transport .
Rarely should XML be built manually , use objects instead , they work better , are easier to force business rules onto , and are easily serialized into any format .
XML is for configuration files and data transport , not for general purpose programming .
I 'm sure there are more , but this post is getting a bit long .
Anyone have any other major pet peeves they like to share ?
Homes FEMA deemed habitable called unfit by Houston officials FEMA deemed these homes habitable
Labeling Katrina homes as livable makes owners ineligible for more aid , but officials here call structures unfit
A New Orleans house flattened but for a concrete staircase on a crumbling facade was among many storm - ravaged structures that federal officials deemed fit for occupancy by Katrina victims now living in Houston , Mayor Bill White said Friday .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has notified about 8,900 heads of households in Houston , representing more than 20,000 Katrina evacuees , that they will be ineligible for the cash assistance intended to replace a massive city voucher program that has paid their rent .
A common reason was that the evacuees ' former homes were now habitable .
A team from Houston 's Hurricane Housing Task Force , however , conducted a spot check of 43 New Orleans homes deemed " habitable " by FEMA and found 70 percent unfit for occupancy , White said Friday after a briefing by the team .
" Some of our worst fears were realized , " White said .
" Many of these notices were simply in error .
The vast majority of the structures we inspected were not habitable by any standard . "
The Houston team found 13 homes habitable and 30 uninhabitable , White said .
The city released photographs showing apartments and houses , including the one with little standing but the stairway , in severe disrepair .
One apartment building , surrounded by a chain link fence , had been condemned , White said .
The city did not release information linking individual evacuees to the houses pictured .
But those individuals had been notified by FEMA that they would be ineligible for further aid , and the city confirmed that the aid was denied because structures were deemed habitable , officials said .
FEMA spokesman Frank Mansell said the agency could not immediately respond to White 's comments because its senior officials were still discussing the issues he raised .
On Thursday , Mancell had said the agency was reviewing the list of evacuees denied further aid to ensure that it was accurate .
White said that FEMA reversed a small number of ineligibility determinations after learning about the city team 's New Orleans visit .
FEMA could not confirm that on Friday .
White said a " reasonable deadline " for evacuees to be self - sufficient would be a year to 18 months from now , or about two years after the hurricane .
" It should n't be forever , " the mayor said .
FEMA 's eligibility decisions illustrate a general problem with the federal government 's response to Katrina , White said .
Letters informing evacuees that they had been deemed ineligible for further aid were confusing , White said , and city officials had to do considerable research to determine the reasons why evacuees had been denied .
" We think there ought to be an orderly process , " White said .
" ( Evacuees ) should n't be treated as code numbers on a spreadsheet . "
FEMA is transitioning evacuees from the city 's voucher program , which has provided free apartments for almost 35,000 evacuees , to its individual assistance program , which provides cash payments good for three months of rent .
Houston 's voucher program and assistance by nonprofits has prompted expressions of gratitude from federal officials .
" All of us are keenly aware that Houston assumed a large share of responsibility for housing evacuees following Hurricane Katrina , a demonstration of civic initiative that will not soon be forgotten , " FEMA 's acting director , R. David Paulison , said in a letter to White on Monday .
White said he had had a " productive conversation " with Paulison Thursday and was confident the latest problems could be resolved .

THE VAXORCIST
Remember how much fun you had upgrading your systems to VMS V5.0 ?
Well , you had it easy ......
THE VAXORCIST
-------------
A rough draft of a video presentation by Christopher Russell Operations Manager , Dept of Mechanical Engineering University of Maryland -------------------------------------------------------------------------
( SCENE : Inside of a VAX computer room .
CREDITS ROLL as the SYSMGR is sitting in front of the console terminal , typing .
He pauses , picks up a small magnetic tape , walks over to a tape drive , mounts it , and returns to the console where he continues typing . )
( There is a knock at the door .
SYSMGR walks to the door and opens it , revealing USER . )
USER : Any idea when the system will be up ?
SYSMGR : Well , I just installed version 5.0 of VMS , so I 'm going to run some diagnostics on it overnight to make sure it works alright .
Assuming everything goes alright , the system should be up first thing tomorrow morning .
USER : Great .
Thanks .
( Exits ) ( SYSMGR closes the door and returns to the console . )
ROD SERLING - LIKE VOICE : This is John Smith , University of Maryland System Manager .
In an effort to make his system the best it can be , he has just installed VMS Version 5.0 onto his VAX .
But little does he know that the Version 5 documentation kit from Digital includes a one - way ticket to ... the VMS TWILIGHT ZONE !
( ominous music - fade out ) ( Fade in .
The SYSMGR scans the console for a moment , then turns , picks up his coat and walks to the door .
He stops at the door for a moment , looking back at the big machine .
Finally , he turns out the light and exits , closing the door behind him . )
( Cut to the Console Terminal .
We read the following as it is printed on the console terminal : ) VMS V5.0 DIAGNOSTICS -- DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 1 STARTING ... DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 1 FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY .
DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 2 STARTING ... TESTING MICROCODE ... SUCCESSFUL TESTING DECNET ... SUCCESSFUL TESTING LICENSE MANAGEMENT
UTILITY ... SUCCESSFUL TESTING SYSTEM SERVICES ... SUCCESSFUL TESTING HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPLETELY UNDOCUMENTED AI ROUTINE ... ( Cut to view of the Tape in the Tape drive .
The tape spins for a moment , and suddenly stops . )
( Cut to view of the Machine Room .
A fog has begun drifting across the floor , and the hardware is slowly being backlit by a pulsing red light .
A peal of weird laughter cuts through the silence .
A variety of bizarre things occur : A VT100 monitor sitting on a table slowly rotates 360 degrees ; the tape drive opens and tape begins spewing out of it ; slime begins pouring out of a disk drive ; the line printer begins form - feeding like mad .
These continue for several minutes , or for as long as we can keep them up .
FADE OUT ) ( SCENE : Hallway outside of the computer room .
SYSMGR walks up to the door and is met by USER . )
USER : System going to be up soon ?
SYSMGR : ( as he speaks , he tries to open the Machine room door , but the door is apparently stuck . )
The diagnostics should be done by now , so we should be up in about 15 minutes ... ( he succeeds in opening the door , but is confronted by floor to ceiling magnetic tape .
Tangled at about eye level is an empty tape reel .
SYSMGR takes the reel and looks at it .
CLOSE UP of the reel so we can read the label , which reads : VAX / VMS V5.0 DIAGNOSTIC KIT . ) ( to USER ) ... give or take a few days ....
( SCENE : View of TSR ( Telephone Support Rep ) from behind as she is sitting in a cubicle , a terminal in front of her .
Beside her on the wall is a poster which reads " Digital Has It Now - But You Can't Have It " .
We can see the terminal , but we should not be able to read what is on it .
She is wearing a headset . )
TSR : Colorado Customer Support .
What is your access number , please ?
SYSMGR VOICE : 31576 TSR : And your name ?
SYSMGR VOICE : John Smith .
( Cut to SYSMGR standing beside his console .
He his holding a phone to his head with his right hand , and holding a printout in his left which he is perusing while he talks on the phone . )
TSR VOICE :
And what operating system are you using ?
SYSMGR : VMS version 5 . TSR VOICE :
And is this a problem with the operating system or a layered product ?
( As the SYSMGR looks up from the printout , his eyes suddenly widen and he drops the printout and ducks .
At that second , a disk platter flies through the air where his head just was .
Slowly , SYSMGR stands up and looks to where the disk went .
PAN BACK to reveal a stack of boxes with a disk embedded in one of them at neck height . )
SYSMGR : ( into the phone ) Operating System .
Definitely the Operating System .
( Cut back to TSR sitting at her desk . )
TSR : Can you describe the problem , please ?
( SYSMGR voice can now only be heard as mumbling ) TSR : Yes ...
Tape drive spewing tape into the air ... yes ...
Line printers printing backwards ... yes ... miscellaneous hardware flying through the air ... uh huh ... disk drives melting ... yeah ... strange voices coming from the CPU board ... I see ... yes .
Is that all ?
( pause as she finishes typing at the terminal )
Well , I 'm afraid that that team is busy at the moment , can I have them get back to you ?
( CUT TO SCENE : MANAGER sitting behind a large desk in a plush office .
DEVELOPER is pacing in front of him , hands behind his back . )
( SUBTITLE : Meanwhile at Maynard ... )
MANAGER : So tell me !
What the hell happened ?!
DEVELOPER : ( turning to face MANAGER )
It 's a glitch , a fluke .
A one in a billion chance .
And it 's not Development 's fault .
Not really .
MANAGER : Then who 's fault is it ?
DEVELOPER : We traced it back to the Software Distribution Center .
It seems that there was a mixup and some of the code for the experimental AI routine was copied onto the distribution from the wrong optical disk .
( He removes a CD from his jacket )
This one , to be precise .
MANAGER : And what 's that ?
DEVELOPER : ( reading the label ) " Ozzy Osbourne 's Greatest Hits " .
Normally , it would n't have made any difference , as the AI routine is n't used yet .
But when they began running diagnostics , it hit the routine and the computer just sort of became a thing possessed .
MANAGER : Wonderful .
Were any other distributions affected ?
DEVELOPER : No , just the University of Maryland's .
MANAGER : Well , that 's a relief .
We 've got to get them taken care of before anyone finds out .
Can you imagine what Digital Review would do if they heard about this ?
DEVELOPER : We could always blame it on the Chaos Computer Group .
MANAGER : No , we 've already used that one .
This calls for drastic action .
( MANAGER picks up the phone and begins flipping through the rolodex ) DEVELOPER :
Who are you going to send ?
( CUT to the Rolodex so that we can read the cards .
The first card reads : SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Ron Jankowski , x474 he flips to the next card : BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Bob Candless , x937 he flips to the next card : REALLY BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Michelle French , x365 he flips to the next card OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Mike West , x887 he flips to the next card and taps the card with forefinger : SYSTEM FUCKED UP BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION - The VAXorcist , x666 ( CUT to Machine Room .
SYSMGR is standing by the console holding an RA60 disk cover and using it as a shield to defend himself from various pieces of hardware which are flying at him from off - camera .
There is a knock at the door .
Slowly , SYSMGR makes his way to the door and opens it .
Standing there , backlit amidst outrageous amounts of fog is the VAXORCIST , wearing a trench coat and fedora , and carrying a briefcase . )
VAXORCIST : ( in a hushed voice ) DEC sent me .
I hear you 're having some problems .
( CUT to SYSMGR OFFICE , a small but pleasant office with posters on the walls and clutter on the desk .
As the VAXORCIST enters , he removes his coat and hat , revealing a very techie outfit beneath .
He is wearing a DEC badge . )
SYSMGR : ( Frantic ) Problems ?
Problems ?!?
You could say I 'm having some problems .
4.6 was fine .
4.7 was fine .
I install 5.0 and all Hell breaks loose .
The damn thing ate two of my operators this morning !
VAXORCIST : Calm down , everything will be alright .
I 've dealt with situations like this before .
SYSMGR : You have ?
VAXORCIST : Four years ago at an installation in Oregon , a programmer renamed his Star Trek program to VMB.EXE and copied it into the system directory .
When the system was rebooted the next day it phasored the entire accounting department claiming that they were Klingon spies .
There was a similar problem in Texas three years ago , and then , of course , there was the IRS fiasco that we 're not allowed to talk about .
But do n't worry .
These things can be fixed .
Before I can help you , though , I have to ask you a few questions .
( The VAXorcist opens his briefcase and removes a clipboard ) Now , according to the report , the strange occurences began after you installed VMS Version 5 , is that correct ?
SYSMGR : Yes , that 's correct .
VAXORCIST : Now , did you carefully read the Installation Guide for VMS Version 5 ?
SYSMGR : ( confused ) Installation Guide ?
VAXORCIST : Yes , it should have come with the Release Notes .
SYSMGR : ( still confused ) Release Notes ?
( SYSMGR begins rooting about on his disk , shifting papers around as if he might find them underneath ) VAXORCIST : ( annoyed ) Yes , Release Notes .
They should have come with your documentation upgrade .
SYSMGR : ( completely confused - looks up from his rooting through the papers on his desk ) Documentation upgrade ?
VAXORCIST : ( angry ) YES !
The Documentation upgrade for your VMS Documentation Set! SYSMGR : Documentation S...?
Oh , you mean the grey binders ?
They 're over there .
( he points to the wall behind the VAXORCIST .
The VAXORCIST turns and we see a closed glass - front bookcase packed with grey binders .
A small red sign on the front of the bookcase reads : " IN CASE OF EMERGENCY , BREAK GLASS " ) .
VAXORCIST : Right .
This is going to be tougher than I thought .
Let 's go take a look at your system and see just how bad everything is .
( CUT to the Machine Room .
The room is neat and tidy and there is no sign that anything is wrong .
The VAXORCIST enters the room with the SYSMGR behind him . )
VAXORCIST : Everything looks okay to me .
SYSMGR : Maybe it 's hibernating .
VAXORCIST : Unlikely .
It 's probably trying to lure us into a false sense of security .
SYSMGR : Sounds like VMS alright .
( VAXORCIST gives him a dirty look ) VAXORCIST : I 'm going to have to test it 's power .
This could get ugly , you may want to leave .
( The SYSMGR shakes his head no .
The VAXORCIST brings himself up to full height in front of the VAX and points a finger at it )
By the power of DEC , I expel thee from this system !
( Clap of thunder ) ( CUT to door to the machine room .
The SYSMGR is pulling a cart on which sits the VAXORCIST wrapped from head to toe in magnetic tape ) SYSMGR : Any other bright ideas ?
VAXORCIST : Just shut up and get this damn stuff off of me .
( CUT to SYSMGRs office ) VAXORCIST : ( Writing on the clipboard )
Things look pretty bad .
I think we 're going to need a full - scale VAXorcism here .
SYSMGR : Is there anything I can do to help ?
VAXORCIST : As a matter of fact , there is .
We 've got to incapacitate the VAX to keep it from causing any more damage until I 'm ready to deal with it .
Now , I 've got some software here that will do that , but it 's got to be installed .
( VAXORCIST hands SYSMGR a tape )
With that running , the CPU will be so bogged down , the VAX wo n't be able to harm anybody .
SYSMGR : ( Examining the tape )
What is it ?
A program to calculate pi to the last digit ?
VAXORCIST : Better than that .
It starts up All - in - 1 with a 10 user load .
( CUT to Hall outside of Computer Room .
The VAXORCIST approaches the door .
As the SYSMGR approaches the door , the VAXORCIST holds him back .
VAXORCIST : I appreciate your help , but it wo n't be safe for you in there .
SYSMGR : What ?
You 're going in there to face that thing alone ?
You 're nuts !
VAXORCIST : Hey , it 's my job .
( VAXORCIST turns to the door ) SYSMGR : Wait a minute .
( VAXORCIST stops and turns around )
You better take this with you .
( SYSMGR removes a very large and very nasty looking gun from the inside of his jacket ) VAXORCIST : ( Smiling )
No , I wo n't need that .
I 've got something more powerful .
( VAXORCIST holds up a small guide - sized orange binder , opens it , and shows it to SYSMGR .
CUT to closeup of the book which reads : " GUIDE TO VAX / VMS SYSTEM EXORCISM " ) ( CUT to view of Machine room door as seen by the VAX .
The VAXORCIST enters the room and stands in front of the VAX .
CUT to view of the Machine Room showing the SYSMGR confronting the VAX ) VAXORCIST :
By the power of DEC , I command thee , Evil Spirit , to show thyself .
VAX : Bugger off .
VAXORCIST : ( Shaken )
What ?
VAX : I said Bugger off !
Now get out of here before I core - dump all over you !
VAXORCIST : ( Recovered )
Threaten me not , oh Evil one !
For I speak with the power of DEC , and I command thee to show thyself !
( A rumble is heard and again the VAX becomes backlit by red lights and a fog begins to roll across the floor .
The VAX cabinet doors slowly creak open to reveal two small red lights in the dark cabinet which appear to be the creature 's eyes ) VAX : There .
Happy ?
Now get out of here before I drop a tape drive on your private parts .
VAXORCIST : ( Opening the orange binder , he begins intoning SHUTDOWN .COM in gregorian chant .
The VAX screams . )
VAX : Stop that !
Stop that !
You , you DOS LOVER !
Your mother manages RSX systems in Hell !
( The VAXORCIST continues and the VAX screams again . )
VAX : Stop it !
( a large wad of computer tape is thrown at the VAXORCIST , apparently from the VAX ) .
Eat oxide , bit - bucket breath !
( The VAXORCIST continues and the VAX screams once more . )
VAX : Mount me !
Mount me !
VAXORCIST : ( finishing the intonation )
And now , by the power of DEC , I banish thee back to the null - space from which you came !
( The VAX screams and the scream fades to silence . ) ( CUT to the doorway of the Machine room , which now stands open .
The VAXORCIST is once again wearing his trench coat and fedora . )
SYSMGR : So it 's over ?
VAXORCIST : ( Putting his hat on ) Yes , it 's over .
SYSMGR : ( Shaking the VAXORCISTs hand ) Thank God.
Listen , thanks a lot .
I do n't know what we would have done without you .
VAXORCIST : Hey , it 's the least we could do .
The Software Distribution Center should be sending you a patch tape in a week or two to patch out that AI routine and prevent this from happening again .
Sign here .
( he hands SYSMGR the clipboard , SYSMGR signs at the bottom and hands it back )
Have a good one .
( VAXORCIST leaves ) .
( SYSMGR enters the machine room .
Camera follows him in . )
SYSMGR : ( Calling to someone off - camera ) Okay , you guys , let 's get rolling .
Get those backup tapes out .
We 've got a clean system again !
( cheers are heard from off - camera .
The SYSMGR leaves the picture , leaving only the VAX with it 's cabinet doors still open in the picture .
Slow zoom in to the LSI unit .
Slowly , the LSI unit begins to emit a pulsing red glow ) ( Fade to black .

Astronauts are trained to withstand as much as nine times the force of gravity .
( Three Gs , by comparison , could make the average guy pass out . )
But even the toughest among them fall out of the running when it comes to a launch concept from a small civilian company in Goleta , California .
To survive the ride on Launchpoint Technologies 's invention , the payload has to be able to survive a brain - splattering 10,000 Gs .
The design calls for a high - speed accelerator that whips a projectile as heavy as 220 pounds around a circular 1.5 - mile - radius vacuum tunnel .
Powerful electromagnetic motors inside the tunnel will accelerate the unit , strapped to a magnetic sled , in circles until it reaches a velocity of six miles per second and then will eject the projectile from a launch ramp into space .
The system is still just an idea on paper , but the U.S. Air Force has awarded Launchpoint a two - year , $ 500,000 grant to prove it can work .
Project leader Jim Fiske , an expert in magnetic levitation , believes that the magnetic forces would counteract the pulverizing G - forces generated by radial acceleration and prevent the sled from touching the tunnel wall .
As for the system 's cost , its low power requirements would allow spy micro-satellites to be slung into orbit for $ 50,000 , a small fraction of the current $ 5 - million launch cost .
That explains the Air Force 's interest , but the system could also be a boon for space exploration .
An inexpensive magnet - propelled pipeline could toss construction materials , food and other basic resources into orbit to supply tomorrow 's space colonies .
" You could send a block of aluminum , water or even frozen mashed potatoes , " Fiske suggests -- anything durable enough to handle the stress .
Fiske says a demonstration device could be ready in four years and will probably be located on a dry lake bed at the Department of Energy 's Nevada Test Site .
But future launch rings , he adds , could sit near mountain ranges or even float on the ocean .
How it works :
The sled :
The projectile is encased in a protective polycarbonate sabot and attached to a magnetic sled with a Kevlar sheet .
When the sled reaches launch speed , a laser slices through the sheet , freeing the projectile to enter the launch ramp .
The launch :
The projectile contains a small rocket engine and avionics that enable it to steer itself into orbit once it escapes Earth 's atmosphere .
The track : Magnetic motors above and below the vacuum tube create a magnetic field that accelerates the sled to six miles per second .

Top Ten Creepy Fossil Finds of 2006
by Loren Coleman , coauthor , Creatures of the Other Edge .
As often happens with fossil finds , sometimes they are stored away , forgotten , rediscovered , even exhibited , but then all of a sudden , an old find experiences a grand new awareness .
The fossil is significant again .
Or the fossil might be a recent or actual new find gaining its fifteen minutes of popular media fame , often before the journal articles are written .
Such has been the case regarding the following selections , all from extinct species ( supposedly ) .
It is a roundup of certainly a unique collection of ten bizarre fossil species that were found for the first time , or rediscovered by the media during the Year of 2006 .
1. Volaticotherium antiquus – Ancient Gliding Beast .
Discovered in Mongolia , this little half a pound squirrel - like animal is a whole new order of animals .
It is a mammal that glided 70 million years before any other mammals — and maybe before birds flew .
2. Sinohydrosaurus lingyuanensis – Two - headed Aquatic Reptile .
This miniature two - headed young aquatic reptile is the first fossil ever found with two necks and two heads .
It was discovered in China , and aged to 100 million years ago .
3. Ekaltadeta – Riversleigh Killer Kangaroo .
News digs at the Riversleigh site in northwest Queensland have unearthed new specimens and apparently a new species ( unnamed ) of the carnivorous giant rat- kangaroos from Australia .
4. Bullockornis – Demon Duck of Doom
Also discovered at Riversleigh , in the same site as the " Killer Kangaroo , " were examples of the " Demon Duck of Doom , " so , of course , the press had a field day with that .
5. Bubalus cebuensis – Dwarf Buffalo .
A new dwarf buffalo species from the Pleistocene was discovered by chance in the Philippines .
This color drawing of the new species may be made clearer and more full - sized ( even though it is a tiny animal to begin with ) by clicking on it .
6. Camelus sp. unknown species – Giant Camel .
A 13 feet tall camel — double the size of the modern - day camel — was discovered in Syria .
Dating back 100,000 years , the fossil bones clearly demonstrate the animals that they came from were much bigger than modern camels .
7. Killikaike blakei Large new unidentified monkey .
The fossil of a new species of monkey that once roamed the rainforests of Patagonia , South America , dating to 16.4 million years ago , was discovered .
8. Homo sp. unknown species – Small new hominid ?
A new hominid cranium was found in two pieces at Gawis in Ethiopia ’s northeastern Afar region .
It is believed to be between 500,000 and 250,000 years old .
It is relatively small , and seems to point to a link between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens .
9. Australopithecus sp. unknown species – Little Foot or Stw 573 .
The remains of Little Foot which were discovered in a cave complex at Sterkfontein , South Africa , came under new analysis this year .
The species had been tentatively dated to three to four million years before present , but the new findings show the small upright Australopithecus died only about 2.2 million years ago and thus co-existed with Homo .
10 . Homo floresiensis – Flores Human – Hobbits .
During the continuing debate , in which the 8 - 9 individual Hobbit fossil finds are being lost in the shuffle , the first skull replica of the Hobbits , Homo floresiensis became available from Bone Clones .
It is the most famous fossil discovery of recent memory , and now you can own an affordable but good quality replica , if you wish .
That ’s what I call a " celebrity fossil . "

java sucks .
© 1997-2000 Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
I think Java is the best language going today , which is to say , it 's the marginally acceptable one among the set of complete bagbiting loser languages that we have to work with out here in the real world .
Java is far , far more pleasant to work with than C or C++ or Perl or Tcl / Tk or even Emacs - Lisp .
When I first started using Java , it felt like an old friend : like finally I was back using a real object system , before the blights of C ( the PDP - 11 assembler that thinks it 's a language ) and C++ ( the PDP - 11 assembler that thinks it 's an object system ) took over the world .
However , as I settled in , I found a lot of things about Java that irritate me .
As this happened , I wrote them down .
The following document was mostly written while I was learning the language , during the design and development of Grendel back in 1997 .
Therefore , some of the following complaints might have been addressed in later versions of the language , or they might have been misunderstandings on my part .
It 's too bad Sun has been working as hard as they can , in their typical Sun way , to destroy Java by holding on to it so closely that nobody else can actually improve it .
I 've also merged in a few complaints from Dan Bornstein and Richard Mlynarik .
Thanks guys !
About the Java name , and associated politics :
The fact is that there are four completely different things that go by the name ``Java ' ' : A language ;
An enormous class library ;
A virtual machine ;
A security model .
Sun would like you to believe that these are all the same thing , and that the name ``Java ' ' implies all of them , but this is marketing fiction .
Worse than that , the fact that Sun has tried so hard to push this idea has done grievous damage to the acceptance of Java .
Java - the - language is , overall , a very good thing , and works well .
Java - the - class - library is mostly passable .
Java - the - virtual - machine is an interesting research project , a nice proof of concept , and is basically usable for a certain class of problems ( those problems where speed is n't all that important : basically , those tasks where you could get away with using Perl instead of C. )
Java - the - security - model is another interesting research project , but it only barely works right now .
In a few years , maybe they 'll have it figured out or replaced .
If Sun had n't tried so hard to conflate these four completely different things , if they had first shipped native - code Java compilers , then the VM , then the security model , then Java probably would have completely displaced C++ by now .
The whole ``write once run anywhere '' idea ( which is to say , the virtual machine ) is a wonderful idea , and I wish it the best of luck .
But it 's not true yet .
It might be someday : in the meantime , I 'd like to write programs in Java today , the way I can write programs in C today .
So I have to recompile for every architecture on which I want to run .
Ok , I wish I did n't , but that 's what I have to do today anyway , but I have to do it in C instead of Java .
Virtual machines are cool .
Security models that allow network - distributed code are cool .
Serialization and agent - like behavior is also cool .
But these are not what I 'm most interested in .
There are a lot of people who are most interested in those things , but me , I just want to write a program that will run on some suitable number of architectures .
I 'm happy distributing binaries for each architecture to do that .
Sure , having one binary that ran on everything would be nice , but you know , it 's just not a hard requirement .
Today , I program in C . I think C is a pretty crummy language .
I would like to write the same kinds of programs in a better language .
First the good stuff :
Java does n't have free ( ) .
I have to admit right off that , after that , all else is gravy .
That one point makes me able to forgive just about anything else , no matter how egregious .
Given this one point , everything else in this document fades nearly to insignificance .
But ...
About the Java language itself :
( I 'm separating my complaints about Java the language , and Java the class library , despite Sun 's repeated attempts to blur this important and fundamental distinction . )
It 's hard to live with none of : lexically scoped local functions ; a macro system ; and inlined functions .
of : lexically scoped local functions ; a macro system ; and inlined functions .
I really hate the lack of downward - funargs ; anonymous classes are a lame substitute .
( I can live without long - lived closures , but I find lack of function pointers a huge pain . )
The fact that static methods are n't really class methods ( they 're actually global functions : you can't override them in a subclass ) is pretty dumb .
It 's far from obvious how one hints that a method should be inlined , or otherwise go real fast .
Does ` final ' do it ?
Does ` private final ' do it ?
Given that there is no preprocessor to let you do per-function shorthand , and no equivalent of Common Lisp 's flet ( or even macrolet ) , one ends up either duplicating code , or allowing the code to be inefficient .
Those are both bad choices .

Two identical byte [ ] arrays are n't equal and do n't hash the same .
Maybe this is just a bug , but :
You can't fix this by subclassing Hashtable .
You can't fix this by subclassing Array because it 's not really an object .
What you can do is wrap an Object around an Array and let that implement hashCode and equals by digging around in its contained array , but that adds not - insignificant memory overhead ( 16 bytes per object , today . )
Gee , I know , I 'll write my own hash table .
I 've only done that a thousand times .
arrays are n't and do n't hash the same .
Maybe this is just a bug , but : I can't seem to manage to iterate the characters in a String without implicitly involving half a dozen method calls per character .

The other alternative is to convert the String to a byte [ ] first , and iterate the bytes , at the cost of creating lots of random garbage .
to a first , and iterate the bytes , at the cost of creating lots of random garbage .
Generally , I 'm dissatisfied with the overhead added by Unicode support in those cases where I 'm sure that there are no non-ASCII characters .
There ought to be two subclasses of an abstract String class , one that holds Unicode , and one that holds 8 - bit quantities .
They should offer identical APIs and be indistinguishable , except for the fact that if a string has only 8 - bit characters , it takes up half as much memory !
Of course , String being final eliminates even the option of implementing that .

They should offer identical APIs and be indistinguishable , for the fact that if a string has only 8 - bit characters , it takes up half as much memory !
Interfaces seem a huge , cheesy copout for avoiding multiple inheritance ; they really seem like they were grafted on as an afterthought .
Maybe there 's a good reason for them being the way they are , but I do n't see it ; it looks like they were just looking for a way to multiply - inherit methods without allowing call - next - method and without allowing instance variables ?
There 's something kind of screwy going on with type promotion that I do n't totally understand yet but that I 'm pretty sure I do n't like .
This gets a compiler error about type conflicts : abstract class List { abstract List next ( ) ; } class foo extends List { foo n ; foo next ( ) { return n ; } } I think that 's wrong , because every foo is -a List .
The compiler seems to be using type - of rather than typep .
I think that 's wrong , because every .
The compiler seems to be using rather than .
This ``integers are n't objects '' nonsense really pisses me off .
Why did they do that ?
Is the answer as lame as , ``we wanted the `int ' type to be 32 bits instead of 31 ''?
( You only really need one bit of type on the pointer if you do n't need small conses , after all . )
The way this bit me is , I 've got code that currently takes an array of objects , and operates on them in various opaque ways ( all it cares about is equality , they 're just cookies . )
I was thinking of changing these objects to be shorts instead of objects , for compactness of their containing objects : they'd be indexes into a shared table , instead of pointers to shared objects .
To do this , I would have to rewrite that other code to know that they 're shorts instead of objects .
Because one can't assign a short to a variable or argument that expects an Object , and consequently , one can't invoke the equal method on a short .
Wrapping them up in Short objects would kind of defeat the purpose : then they'd be bigger than the pointer to the original object rather than smaller .
And in related news , it 's a total pain that one can't iterate over the contents of an array without knowing intimate details about its contents : you have to know whether it 's byte [ ] , or int [ ] , or Object [ ] .
I mean , it is not rocket science to have a language that can transparently access both boxed and unboxed storage .
It 's not as if Java is n't doing all the requisite runtime type checks already !
It 's as if they went out of their way to make this not work ...
Is there some philosophical point I 'm missing ?
Is the notion of separating your algorithms from your data structures suddenly no longer a part of the so - called ``object oriented '' pantheon ?
, or , or .

After all this time , people still think that integer overflow is better than degrading to bignums , or raising an exception ?
Of course , they have Bignums now ( ha ! )
All you have to do ( ha ! ) is rewrite your code to look like this : result = x.add(y.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf( 7 ) ) ).pow(3).abs ( ) .setBit( 27 ) ; Note that some parameters must be BigIntegers , and some must be ints , and some must be longs , with largely no rhyme or reason .
( This complaint is in the ``language ' ' section and not the ``library '' section because this shit should be part of the language , i.e. , at the syntax level . )
I miss typedef .
If I have integers that represent something , I can't make type assertions about them except that they are ints .
Unless I 'm willing to swaddle them in blankets by wrapping Integer objects around them .

Similarly , I think the available idioms for simulating enum and : keywords are fairly lame .
( There 's no way for the compiler to issue that life - saving warning , `` enumeration value `x ' not handled in switch '' , for example . )
They go to the trouble of building a single two - element enumerated type into the language ( Boolean ) but wo n't give us a way to define our own ?
and are fairly lame .
( There 's no way for the compiler to issue that life - saving warning , `` '' , for example . )
As far as I can see , there 's no efficient way to implement ` assert ' or ` #ifdef DEBUG '.
Java gets half a point for this by promising that if you have a static final boolean , then conditionals that use it will get optimized away if appropriate .
This means you can do things like if ( randomGlobalObject .
DEBUG ) { assert ( whatever , " whatever ! " ) ; } but that 's so gratuitously verbose that it makes my teeth hurt .
( See also , lack of any kind of macro system . )

By having ` new ' be the only possible interface to allocation , and by having no back door through which you can escape from the type safety prison , there are a whole class of ancient , well - known optimizations that one just cannot perform .
If something is n't done about this , the language is never going to be fast enough for some tasks , no matter how good the JITs get .
And `` write once run everywhere '' will continue to be the marketing fantasy that it is today .

The finalization system is lame .
Worse than merely being lame , they brag about how lame it is !
To paraphrase the docs : `` Your object will only be finalized once , even if it 's resurrected in finalization !
Is n't that grand ?!''
Post - mortem finalization was figured out years ago and works well .
Too bad Sun does n't know that .

Post - mortem finalization was figured out years ago and works well .
Too bad Sun does n't know that .
Relatedly , there are no ``weak pointers . ''
Without weak pointers and a working finalization system , you can't implement a decent caching mechanism for , e.g. , a communication framework that maintains proxies to objects on other machines , and likewise keeps track of other machines ' references to your objects .
You can't close over anything but final variables in an inner class !
Their rationale is that it might be ``confusing . ''
Of course you can get the effect you want by manually wrapping your variables inside of one - element arrays .
The very first time I tried using inner classes , I got bitten by this -- that is , I naively attempted to modify a closed - over variable and the compiler complained at me , so I in fact did the one - element array thing .
The only other time I 've used inner classes , again , I needed the same functionality ; I started writing it the obvious way and let out a huge sigh of frustration when , half way through , I realized what I had done and manually walked back through the code turning my Object foo = < whatever > ; into final Object [ ] foo = { < whatever > } ; and all the occurence of foo into foo [ 0 ] .
Arrrgh !

The access model with respect to the mutability ( or read - only - ness ) of objects blows .
Here 's an example : System.in , out and err ( the stdio streams ) are all final variables .
They did n't used to be , but some clever applet - writer realized that you could change them and start intercepting all output and do all sorts of nasty stuff .
So , the whip - smart folks at Sun went and made them final .
But hey !
Sometimes it 's okay to change them !
So , they also added System.setIn , setOut , and setErr methods to change them !
``Change a final variable ?!''
I hear you cry .
Yep .
They sneak in through native code and change finals now .
You might think it'd give 'em pause to think and realize that other people might also want to have public read - only yet privately writable variables , but no .
Oh , but it gets even better : it turns out they did n't really have to sneak in through native code anyway , at least as far as the JVM is concerned , since the JVM treats final variables as always writable to the class they 're defined in !
There 's no special case for constructors : they 're just always writable .
The javac compiler , on the other hand , pretends that they 're only assignable once , either in static init code for static finals or once per constructor for instance variables .
It also will optimize access to finals , despite the fact that it 's actually unsafe to do so .
Something else related to this absurd lack of control over who can modify an object and who cannot is that there is no notion of constant space : constantry is all per-class , not per-object .
If I 've got a loop that does String foo = " x " ; it does what you 'd expect , because the loader happens to have special - case magic that interns strings , but if I do : String foo [ ] = { " x " , " y " } ; then guess what , it conses up a new array each time through the loop !
Um , thanks , but do n't most people expect literal constants to be immutable ?
If I wanted to copy it , I would copy it .
The language also should impose the contract that literal constants are immutable .
Even without the language having immutable objects , a non-losing compiler could eliminate the consing in some limited situations through static analysis , but I 'm not holding my breath .
Using final on variables does n't do anything useful in this case ; as far as I can tell , the only reason that final works on variables at all is to force you to specify it on variables that are closed over in inner classes .
The locking model is broken .
First , they impose a full word of overhead on each and every object , just in case someone somewhere sometime wants to grab a lock on that object .
What , you say that you know that nobody outside of your code will ever get a pointer to this object , and that you do your locking elsewhere , and you have a zillion of these objects so you 'd like them to take up as little memory as possible ?
Sorry .
You 're screwed .
Any piece of code can assert a lock on an object and then never un - lock it , causing deadlocks .
This is a gaping security hole for denial - of - service attacks .
In any half - way - rational design , the lock associated with an object would be treated just like any other slot , and only methods statically ``belonging '' to that class could frob it .
But then you get into the bug of Java not doing closures properly .
See , you want to write a method : public synchronized void with_this_locked ( thunk f ) { f.funcall ( ) ; } but then actually writing any code becomes a disaster because of the mind - blowing worthlessness of inner classes .
There is no way to signal without throwing : that is , there is no way to signal an exceptional condition , and have some condition handler tell you ``go ahead and proceed anyway . ''
By the time the condition handler is run , the excepting scope has already been exited .
The distinction between slots and methods is stupid .
Doing foo .x should be defined to be equivalent to foo .x ( ) , with lexical magic for `` foo .x = ...'' assignment .
Compilers should be trivially able to inline zero- argument accessor methods to be inline object + offset loads .
That way programmers would n't break every single one of their callers when they happen to change the internal implementation of something from something which happened to be a ``slot '' to something with slightly more complicated behavior .

The notion of methods " belonging " to classes is lame .
Anybody anytime should be allowed to defined new , non-conflicting methods on any class ( without overriding existing methods . )
This causes no abstraction - breakage , since code which cares could n't , by definition , be calling the new , ``externally - defined ' ' methods .
This is just another way of saying that the pseudo - Smalltalk object model loses and that generic functions ( suitably constrained by the no-external - overrides rule ) win .

It comes with hash tables , but not qsort ?

String has length + 24 bytes of overhead over byte [ ] : class String implements java.io.Serializable { private char value [ ] ; // 4 bytes + 12 bytes of array header private int offset ; // 4 bytes private int count ; // 4 bytes }

Despite the ban the skies above Lahore were filled with kites
Enlarge Image
Kite flying is a traditional part of a festival marking the advent of spring in Punjab , but on Thursday the Pakistani authorities introduced a ban .
The prohibition came in after a number of deaths , mostly in Lahore , caused by glass - coated or metal kite - strings .
Families of the seven victims protested last week , demanding that a Supreme Court uphold a ban on the sport .
Similar bans have been imposed in previous years .
Threat to bikers
The spring festival known as Basant is hugely popular across Punjab , with even President Pervez Musharraf often flying down to Lahore to participate .
Many of the hundreds detained were young boys

Kite flyers compete to keep their kites in the air , whilst downing those of others .
But they often resort to using wire or glass - coated strings to cut the strings of rival kites .
When the strings fall across roads , however , they pose a danger to people passing on motor - bikes .
Metal kites can also cause short - circuits in overhead power cables , leading to heavy losses for electricity utilities .
The court had relaxed its kite ban in February this year , but on the condition that it would automatically be reinforced in the event of any more deaths .
Over the years , the Basant festival has drawn thousands of revellers to Lahore from all over the world .
Even Indian movie stars had started participating in the festival which peaks with an all - night flood - lit kite flying marathon on the eve of the festival .
In 2001 Cambridge University Press published Bjrn Lomborg 's book , which I thought was a perfect debate topic for the Skeptics Society public lecture series at the California Institute of Technology .
The problem was that all the top environmental organizations refused to participate .
" There is no debate , " one spokesperson told me .
" We do n't want to dignify that book , " another said .
One leading environmentalist warned me that my reputation would be irreparably harmed if I went through with it .
So of course I did .
My experience is symptomatic of deep problems that have long plagued the environmental movement .
Activists who vandalize Hummer dealerships and destroy logging equipment are criminal ecoterrorists .
Environmental groups who cry doom and gloom to keep donations flowing only hurt their credibility .
As an undergraduate in the 1970s , I learned ( and believed ) that by the 1990s overpopulation would lead to worldwide starvation and the exhaustion of key minerals , metals and oil , predictions that failed utterly .
Politics polluted the science and made me an environmental skeptic .
Nevertheless , data trump politics , and a convergence of evidence from numerous sources has led me to make a cognitive switch on the subject of anthropogenic global warming .
My attention was piqued on February 8 when 86 leading evangelical Christians -- the last cohort I expected to get on the environmental bandwagon -- issued the Evangelical Climate Initiative calling for " national legislation requiring sufficient economy - wide reductions " in carbon emissions .
Then I attended the TED ( Technology , Entertainment , Design ) conference in Monterey , Calif. , where former vice president Al Gore delivered the single finest summation of the evidence for global warming I have ever heard , based on the recent documentary film about his work in this area , An Inconvenient Truth .
The striking before - and - after photographs showing the disappearance of glaciers around the world shocked me out of my doubting stance .

Four books eventually brought me to the flipping point .
Archaeologist Brian Fagan's The Long Summer ( Basic , 2004 ) explicates how civilization is the gift of a temporary period of mild climate .
Geographer Jared Diamond 's Collapse ( Penguin Group , 2005 ) demonstrates how natural and human - caused environmental catastrophes led to the collapse of civilizations .
Journalist Elizabeth Kolbert 's Field Notes from a Catastrophe ( Bloomsbury Publishing , 2006 ) is a page - turning account of her journeys around the world with environmental scientists who are documenting species extinction and climate change unmistakably linked to human action .
And biologist Tim Flannery 's The Weather Makers ( Atlantic Monthly Press , 2006 ) reveals how he went from being a skeptical environmentalist to a believing activist as incontrovertible data linking the increase of carbon dioxide to global warming accumulated in the past decade .
It is a matter of the Goldilocks phenomenon .
In the last ice age , CO 2 levels were 180 parts per million ( ppm ) - - too cold .
Between the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution , levels rose to 280 ppm -- just right .
Today levels are at 380 ppm and are projected to reach 450 to 550 by the end of the century - - too warm .
Like a kettle of water that transforms from liquid to steam when it changes from 99 to 100 degrees Celsius , the environment itself is about to make a CO 2 - driven flip .
According to Flannery , even if we reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 70 percent by 2050 , average global temperatures will increase between two and nine degrees by 2100 .
This rise could lead to the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet , which the March 24 issue of Science reports is already shrinking at a rate of 224 41 cubic kilometers a year , double the rate measured in 1996 ( Los Angeles uses one cubic kilometer of water a year ) .
If it and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt , sea levels will rise five to 10 meters , displacing half a billion inhabitants .
Because of the complexity of the problem , environmental skepticism was once tenable .
No longer .
It is time to flip from skepticism to activism .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
In an assessment for a military journal , a U.S. Army officer who advised Iraqi troops concludes the goal of having Iraq control its security " will exceed " the new army 's capability " for some time to come . "
In an article for Military Review , Lt. Col. Carl D. Grunow wrote that " without steadfast American support , these officers and soldiers will likely give up and consider the entire effort a lost cause . "
Grunow recounted his experience of 12 months as the senior adviser to an Iraqi army armored brigade in Taji , north of Baghdad .
His stint ended in June .
The article in the July - August issue of Military Review is titled " Advising Iraqis : Building the Iraqi Army . "
Grunow found and grappled with several problems during his experience .
One was what he called the Iraqi " death blossom , " in which any enemy attack on the soldiers " provokes the average Iraqi soldier to empty his 30 - round magazine and fire whatever belt of ammunition happens to be in his machine gun . "
" Ninety percent of the time , there is no target , and the soldiers always agree that this is extremely dangerous , in addition to being a grievous waste of ammunition .
But they continue to do it . "
Grunow also found that Iraqi soldiers were using techniques and tactics from the Iran - Iraq war , when there were " clear battle lines fought with mass military formations , and one in which civilians on the battlefield were a nuisance , not the center of gravity . "
He contrasted the new Iraqi army with the one under ousted ruler Saddam Hussein .
" Iron discipline was the norm under Saddam .
The lowliest lieutenant could expect instant obedience and extreme deference from his soldiers , " Grunow wrote .
" Today 's army is very different .
Unlike Saddam's , the new army serves the cause of freedom , and officers and soldiers alike are a bit confused about what this means . "
Iraqis , he said , are " horrendous at keeping track of their soldiers .
There are no routine accountability formations , and units typically have to wait until payday to get a semi-accurate picture of who is assigned to the unit .
Because Iraqi status reports are almost always wrong , American advisers have taken to counting soldiers at checkpoints to get a sense of where combat power is distributed . "
Grunow praised the Iraqi skill in dealing with a tough environment .
He said that " economic sanctions and austerity have made the Iraqis outstanding improvisers " and they " display great ingenuity with maintenance operations . "
One trait of Iraqis is that they are " fatalistic , surrendering their future to the will of Allah .
This explains how they can continue to function despite daily car bombings , atrocities and murders that have touched nearly every family . "
He wrote the " most frustrating aspect " of this viewpoint is that " it translates into a lack of diligence and detailed planning . "
" To their credit , the Iraqis almost always made mission , but it was typically not to the standard that Americans expect . "
Cultural differences and friction are " inevitable , " Grunow wrote , and command relationships involving U.S. and Iraqi forces presented some misunderstandings .
" Another problem plaguing the strategy is that it 's unnatural for U.S. soldiers to step back and allow their Iraqi partners to take the lead when the soldiers think they can do it more efficiently and quickly . "
Despite deep disparities , the 2nd Armored Brigade , the unit he assisted , now takes the lead on operations " within its AO [ area of operations ] , suffering casualties and fighting the enemy alongside its American partners . "
Uh , oh !
A new study reveals that fears that the deadly strain of bird flu would move through Africa and Europe in flocks of wild birds have so far proven unfounded ….
That means one less fear that the feds can use to frighten grown - up American men and women as an excuse for more federal power - grabbing .
Fear , of course , has been the coin of the realm for oppressive and dictatorial governments throughout history .
Frighten the citizenry and they ’ll practically beg you to take away their freedom .
That ’s in fact how Hitler convinced the German parliament to give him temporary dictatorial powers after terrorists firebombed the German parliament building .
When Soviet communism , which had been used for decades to justify ever - increasing budgets for the Pentagon , the CIA , and the State Department , expired with the fall of the Berlin Wall , new official fears had to be found .
And fast !
Federal power and federal budgets depended on it .
There were , for example , the drug lords , who were coming to get us and put us on drugs .
My favorite though was — an unsafe world ,  which was enough to scare anyone to death .
Along came Saddam , who had been a good friend and ally of U.S. officials .
His invasion of Kuwait provided them with more than a decade of fear - mongering ( and ever - growing budgets ) , ultimately culminating in the deep ( and baseless ) fear that this new Hitler was about to unleash an imminent WMD attack on the United States .
No one can deny that 9/11 has been the biggest power - grabbing bonanza for power - loving federal politicians and bureaucrats since the Civil War .
The terrorists , who are reacting to the power - grabbers ’ own foreign policies , are coming to get us !
Do n’t even read the USA PATRIOT
Act — just enact it !
Turn those airports over to the feds — fast !
There was also an endless array of other new Hitlers and dangerous regimes for Americans to be scared of — Osama ( another former friend and ally of U.S. officials ) , Chavez , Zarqawi , Muqtada al - Sadr , Iran , North Korea , Syria , Russia , and China .
Fear .
Fear .
Fear .
Is n’t it ironic that we have the most powerful empire in history , whose very own policies have often produced the things we ’re supposed be afraid of , and yet , at the same time , the most frightened grownups in the world ?
Is n’t that grand ?
Just implement the policies that produce the problem , which creates the crisis , which engenders the fear , which causes grown - ups to quiver and quake and beg the government to protect them by taking away their freedoms .
Is it really surprising that 63 percent of Americans support the government ’s illegal and unconstitutional monitoring of people ’s telephone records ?
The sheeplings are bleating to the power - grabbing wolves ,  Please , do whatever is necessary to protect me from the big bad terrorists .
Take away my freedoms if you have to because I am so scared .
I love you and I trust you . 

Gilad Bracha asks Will Continuations Continue ? in an excellent essay about whether the JVM needs continuations .
Personally I have never found them idiomatic so I have no quarrel with Gilad ’s reluctance , but I entirely disagree with the line of argument he uses to back it up .
He points out that Web frameworks like Seaside make excellent use of continuations , but argues that that ’s a red herring because the current style of Web - human interaction is a temporary anomaly and “ the future of Web apps will be different ” , with AJAX signposting the way .
This notion , that the Web GUI is insufficiently interactive and we need something richer , is widely held among developers and almost never among actual users of computers , and it ’s entirely wrong .
I can remember when people were forced to use compiled Windows and X11 applications , and most of them were extremely bad because it ’s really hard to design a good interactive UI ; when the Web came along , more or less everyone abandoned those UIs in favor of the Web , almost instantly and with shrieks of glee .
Yes , Web UIs are drastically constrained , offer a paucity of controls , and enforce a brutally linear control flow ; and these are good things .
I remember , in the early days , people saying “ Once you know how to use one Windows app , you know how to use them all ” .
Ha ha ha .

Although element 118 is too unstable to detect directly , the presence of daughter elements resulting from the decay of element 118 gave clues to its fleeting existence .
Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory previously reported the synthesis of element 118 in 1999 , and later retracted their results when subsequent experiments failed to confirm their discovery .
It was alleged that researcher Victor Ninov fabricated the experimental data that indicated the formation of element 118 atoms .
The ( re ) discovery was reported in the American Physical Society journal Physical Review C on October 9 , 2006 .

One cool technique that I learnt while going through the Django code was using python decorators to implement guards .
Take a look at this bit of pseudo - codeThis is a common pattern where you do something provided condition1 and condition2 are false .
The problem with this code is that it is difficult to seperate out the core logic of the function contained in {do_something} and the error handling code in the rest of the function .
Another disadvantage is that the condition is at the top of the function , while the failure action is at the bottom .
This makes it difficult to correlate the condition with the failure action .
The solution is to refactor the code to use guards Guards are the conditions at the top of the function .
They act like security guards —
If the condition passes you go through , otherwise you leave the function .
It is now a lot easier to see the conditions and the failure actions , and you can easily identify the code logic block by just skipping past the guards .
Python has a decorator feature that allows you to modify the function that it is applied to .
Here is an example : What we have is a function myfunction that prints the string " in function " .
To this , we apply the decorator ' decorate ' ( denoted by the @ symbol ) .
decorate is itself a function that takes one function as a parameter and returns another function .
In this case , it takes fn as a parameter and returns _decorate .
Everytime myfunction is called , it will actually call the returned function , in this case _decorate .
_decorate prints " before calling " , then it calls the original function , then prints " after calling " .
Here is the outputWe can now see how guards can be implemented using decorators .
Let me take a real example that I 've encountered — my admin page .
My tool has an admin page .
In order to access this page , you must be logged in , and you must be an admin .
If you are not logged in , you need to be redirected to the login page .
If you are not an admin , an error message should be displayed .
This is how the code would normally have looked
Here is a version using decorators
This is how it works .
We first have the admin function .
All it does is implement the admin code .
We decorate it with the admin_required and login_required decorators .
When the admin function is called , it first enters the login_required decorator function which checks for login .
If the user is not logged in , it redirects to the login page , else it calls the function .
The function passed to login_required is the admin_required decorated function .
So if login passes , it calls the admin_required decorator , checks for admin .
If the user is not an admin , it displays an error message , else calls the function , which in this case is the original admin function .
See how neatly the guards are separated from the core logic .
The admin function contains only the core logic , while the list of guards is neatly arranged as decorators .
This method also has another advantage — it is easy to apply the same guards to other functions .
Take a look at thisNow each function only implements the core logic , while all the guard logic is taken care of by the decorators .
It is easy to see the core logic and easy to see the guard conditions applied for the function .
If I want some other function to have a guard , I can just add a decorator to it without touching the core logic .
Best of all , the code is self descriptive and very easy to read .

The deeper we sail into the new online world of communications , the sadder I get about its future .
I 'm OK with criticism , I 'm fine with disagreement , I 'm perfectly capable of handling angry mail .
That 's not the issue here ( although my teenage correspondent above was , in fact , wrong about every single one of his points ) .
I 've even accepted personal attacks as part of the job .
I 'm a columnist ; the heat comes with the kitchen .
When an administration is in trouble right before an election , it sometimes resorts to an " October surprise " designed to build support .
Certainly this administration has trouble on a number of fronts , including the Abramoff scandal , congressional corruption , and a Republican representative who sent sexually oriented instant messages to congressional pages .
The mother of all issues , however , remains the war , which is not going well .
The military is becoming more outspoken about its unhappiness with the situation ; the intelligence services are saying that the conflict in Iraq is producing more terrorists , not fewer ; and the budget and personnel costs are rising , causing disquiet even in Republican districts .
As an economist , I am often asked , especially by new acquaintances , " What is the market going to do ? "
" Is the economy going to continue to grow strongly ? "
My answer is usually to refer them to the local psychic , fortuneteller , or palm - reader .
When I was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration , I was frequently asked to forecast future economic trends .
I was uncomfortable but asked our staff to stir the entrails of the computer and produce a " forecast " that we hoped would be sufficiently ambiguous that , when the future became the past , we had a fig leaf to stand behind .
( Alan Greenspan was a master at this . )
Therefore , it is with some trepidation that I put forward a conjecture about what George W. Bush may do in the next month .
Let me add that I believe these possible initiatives by the president would be disastrous , but they are hardly implausible given his record .
This president makes a fetish of looking strong and aggressive .
Thus , if he is to change course in Iraq , which looks increasingly like his only option , he will want to offset that change with a new and aggressive move .
My scenario starts with James Baker , who with Lee Hamilton heads a bipartisan study group on Iraq , telling the president that he is in a hole and had better stop digging .
Baker may suggest that the U.S. force the Iraqi government to step up to the plate by announcing that we will pull our troops out by a date certain .
The president will make this recommendation public .
He will promise that most of our soldiers will be gone by the end of 2007 or , at the latest , by mid-2008 .
For Republicans , this has the advantage of removing the issue before the next presidential election and , in all probability , from this midterm poll .
To maintain his macho image , however , the president will also announce that the U.S. will bomb Iran ’s nuclear facilities if that country refuses to stop enriching uranium within a week .
He is currently laying the political groundwork for this by asserting that the Democrats would be unwilling to militarily preempt an aggressive state .
The Democrats , he says , will " wait until we ’re attacked again , " implying that he will strike before we are assailed .
Bombing Iran will be couched in terms of eliminating that country ’s ability to attack us with nuclear weapons .
Employing force against Iran will please the pro-Israel lobby and the hawks in and out of the administration .
Vice President Dick Cheney has been urging an attack on Iran and will be outspoken in his support .
George Bush has found being a wartime president rewarding , especially at the start of a fight .
Right now in Iraq and Afghanistan , the violence has gone on too long and our troops are bogged down .
It is quite possible that we will lose these conflicts , so he might think it good politics to start a new war with Iran , a country on his " axis of evil . "
Bush may believe that it will give him a lift for the next few months .
Unfortunately , this tactic might work .
People will see a " strong " president going after the " evil guys . "
Initially the public , which sees most wars  at least until they get bloody  as the World Series or the Super Bowl , only larger , may rally around the flag .
In this case , there will be no messy street fighting or IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) .
The bombing will likely produce few if any casualties .
The public will support the Republicans , and the president will get a servile Congress again .
He will , of course , lose the support of Europeans , not just the " old " ones , but the " new " ones as well .
I doubt seriously that Tony Blair will be able to support him in such a bombing campaign , but then the president has shown that he does n’t care what other nations think .
As long as he holds off on using nuclear weapons during the bombing , Bush can threaten Iran that , if it retaliates , either by sending missiles against Israel or by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz , the U.S. will respond with nuclear weapons .
If everyone hates us already , what do we have to lose by lobbing a few nuclear missiles ?
Thus , he might be able to get away with the bombing without any serious repercussions , at least in the short run .
Although this is a scary scenario , it seems all too possible .
I certainly hope that my forecasts here are no better than my predictions concerning the economy .
Perhaps Bush will simply stay in Iraq and continue to threaten Iran ; but if the threats are to be meaningful , he will feel forced to act .
If so , why not now , when he needs the jolt to get the Congress he wants ?
Should Bush pull something like this , let us hope that the voters will see through his scheme .

In August of 1939 , German forces were amassing along the Polish border in preparation to invade .
Europe was still haunted by memories of the brutality of the first World War , and consequently the governments in the region were loath to challenge the aggressive Nazis with military force .
Most of Europe had looked the other way as the Nazis annexed portions of neighboring countries , but the leaders of France and Britain knew that an outright invasion of Poland must not be ignored .
They pledged to rise to Poland ’s defense if necessary , placing the world a breath away from its second World War .
On the evening of 31 August 1939 , as tensions in Europe approached the breaking point , there was an unusual broadcast from a radio station in Gleiwitz , Germany .
Its broadcasts were momentarily silenced , followed by a hate - filled diatribe by a Polish - speaking man .
He urged all Poles to take up arms , and to strike down any Germans who resist .
When Gestapo officers arrived at the transmitter to investigate , they found the bullet - riddled body one of the alleged Polish attackers .
In the morning there were reports of numerous other incidents of Polish aggression along the border .
In response , Nazi leader Adolf Hitler issued his “ final directive ” to attack Poland , compelling the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany .
Thus began World War 2 .
But it turns out that this incident at Gleiwitz⁠ — blamed as the final provocation for the terrible war that followed ⁠— was not quite what it seemed .
Hitler had long held the untermensch ( “ inferior people ” ) of Poland in contempt , and in the preceding months he had delivered ferocious speeches making claims that Germans living in Poland were the subjects of terrible persecution .
The Nazis were also bitter regarding a slice of land known as the “ Polish Corridor , ” a narrow parcel which physically divided Germany into two parts .
The League of Nations had given the land to Poland following World War 1 in order to grant them access to the sea .
Hitler intended to invade this area as well as the rest of Poland , but he knew that attacking without clear justification would upset the citizens of his country and amplify the repercussions from other nations .
In August 1939 , Nazi forces were already concentrating their soldiers and war - making machines along the Polish border in preparation for an all - out attack .
In order to establish a pretense for invasion , Hitler had enlisted the assistance of Commander Heinrich Himmler of the Nazi SS .
The commander conceptualized and set in motion a collection of deceptions designed to make war appear inevitable , an undertaking code - named Operation Himmler .
But the task of executing the initial subterfuge ultimately fell to another SS officer named Alfred Naujocks .
On 31 August , in the hours before the attack on Gleiwitz radio station , Alfred Naujocks lingered in the shadow of its 380 - foot broadcasting tower with a group of Nazi storm troopers .
The men were awaiting the arrival of canned goods ⁠— a Nazi codeword for expendable convicts .
When the “ goods ” were delivered by SS agents , the unconscious man was hastily changed into Polish clothing and dumped outside the entrance .
A doctor had administered a lethal injection before the prisoner was transported to the site , but it had yet to take full effect when he was riddled with pistol rounds on the ground outside the radio station .
With the more gruesome portion of their task behind them , Naujocks and his operatives entered the Gleiwitz radio station at about 8:00 pm outfitted in Polish uniforms .
The gaggle of men seized control of the equipment , shut down the regular signal , and powered up the emergency transmitter .
The microphone was given to a Polish - speaking operative , who read a prepared speech about three minutes long , urging Poles to rise up and help in the invasion of Germany .
At the end of the transmission , the officers fired their pistols repeatedly for the benefit of anyone who might be listening , and departed .
Image from TIME magazine , 25 September 1939
During the night a handful of other such incidents were executed elsewhere along the border , using other “ canned goods ” from German prisons to create the illusion that Polish soldiers were attacking German troops .
The following day the bodies of the dead prisoners were presented to the press and to police as evidence of the Poles ’ organized aggression against the Nazis .
Hitler addressed the German Army with artificial outrage :
“ The Polish State has refused the peaceful settlement of relations which I desired , and has appealed to arms .
Germans in Poland are persecuted with bloody terror and driven from their houses .
A series of violations of the frontier , intolerable to a great Power , prove that Poland is no longer willing to respect the frontier of the Reich .
” In order to put an end to this lunacy , I have no other choice than to meet force with force from now on .
The German Army will fight the battle for the honour and the vital rights of reborn Germany with hard determination .
I expect that every soldier , mindful of the great traditions of eternal German soldiery , will ever remain conscious that he is a representative of the National - Socialist Greater Germany .
Long live our people and our Reich ! ”
The German military attacked on that very morning , marking the official start of World War 2 .
The Russians also attacked Poland from the east , playing their part in a secret joint plot to conquer and divide Poland between the two Axis powers countries .
Within a week of the attack Germany claimed victory over the Polish Corridor , and the Polish capital of Warsaw was captured in just over a month .
In November 1944 Alfred Naujocks deserted his post and surrendered himself to Allied forces .
He was held as a suspected war criminal , and he spent the remaining few months of the war in detention .
Six years after playing his part in the deceit at Gleiwitz he testified at the Nuremberg trials , where he retold the events of that world - changing evening in 1939 :
“ On or about 10 August 1939 the Chief of the Sipo and SD , Heydrich , personally ordered me to simulate an attack on the radio station near Gleiwitz , near the Polish border , and to make it appear that the attacking force consisted of Poles .
Heydrich said : ‘ Actual proof of these attacks of the Poles is needed for the foreign press , as well as for German propaganda purposes . '” ” Heydrich said , ‘ In order to carry out this attack , report to Muller for “ Canned Goods . ” ‘
I did this and gave Muller instructions to deliver the man near the radio station .
I received this man and had him laid down at the entrance to the station .
He was alive , but he was completely unconscious .
I tried to open his eyes .
I could not recognize by his eyes that he was alive , only by his breathing . ”
“ We seized the radio station as ordered , broadcast a speech of 3 to 4 minutes over an emergency transmitter , fired some pistol shots , and left . ”
Alfred Naujocks testifying at Nuremberg
After the Nuremberg trials were closed , Alfred Naujocks sold his story to the media and became a businessman in Hamburg .
He was later suspected of participating in ODESSA⁠ — an organized effort to smuggle SS officers out of the country to avoid prosecution⁠ — but his guilt was never determined .
He died in the 1960s , though there is some debate regarding the exact year of his death .
The secret history that he exposed to the world was disquieting indeed ; his testimony revealed that the attack on Gleiwitz⁠ — long thought to have triggered the largest armed conflict in history ⁠— was a complete fabrication .
In hindsight the deception is not very surprising , but in 1939 Germany , it was unthinkable that one ’s government might be capable of such a massive and misguided conspiracy .
Because it was by his own hand that this deception was ultimately carried out , Alfred Naujocks has received a particularly grim moniker amongst many historians : he was The Man Who Started the War .
I suspect that some people who talk about MVC in regard to web application design do n't properly understand what it is , how it should be used , what it 's good for and more importantly , what it 's not good for .
In this article I hope to share some thoughts on how I think it fits in .
Traditional MVC is ideally suited to time invariant applications like your typical window - based desktop application .
Your application might have 3 dozen different buttons , sliders , entry fields , window controls , and so on .
Any of these " controls " can be pressed at any one particular time , should signal the application " model " to Do The Right Thing , and then cause one or more display " views " to be updated to reflect the new state of the model .
MVC is designed to solve the problem of simultaneously having multiple control entry points , and multiple display outputs , and it acheives that very elegantly .
But web applications only ever have one entry point and one output point - the request and the response .
You do n't have multiple simultaneous controls or views to worry about , so there 's little point applying traditional MVC to solve this non-existant problem .
Your application , be it a CGI script , mod_perl handler , or even an all - in - one embedded Perl template , receives one and only one request for any one invocation , and it must generate one and only one response .
Flow of control is linear and predicatable .
Desktop MVC applications are typically single - user and the in -memory model persists for a session ( e.g. while the application is running ) .
In contrast , web applications are multi-user , and in most cases , the per-user model is regenerated on each request ( i.e. by restoring a user 's session data from a database on each request ) .
There are other differences : controllers are inputs , not chunks of application code as they are portrayed in many web application frameworks ; presentation elements can safely contain " programming " code , as long as it's presentation programming , not application programming ; the model is the application state , not the application architecture , and so on .

Almost every intellectual claims to have the welfare of humanity , and particularly the welfare of the poor , at heart : but since no mass murder takes place without its perpetrators alleging that they are acting for the good of mankind , philanthropic sentiment can plainly take a multiplicity of forms .
Two great European writers of the nineteenth century , Ivan Turgenev and Karl Marx , illustrate this diversity with vivid clarity .
Both were born in 1818 and died in 1883 , and their lives paralleled each other almost preternaturally in many other respects as well .
They nevertheless came to view human life and suffering in very different , indeed irreconcilable , ways — through different ends of the telescope , as it were .
Turgenev saw human beings as individuals always endowed with consciousness , character , feelings , and moral strengths and weaknesses ;
Marx saw them always as snowflakes in an avalanche , as instances of general forces , as not yet fully human because utterly conditioned by their circumstances .
Where Turgenev saw men , Marx saw classes of men ; where Turgenev saw people , Marx saw the People .
These two ways of looking at the world persist into our own time and profoundly affect , for better or for worse , the solutions we propose to our social problems .
The resemblances between the careers of these men begin with their attendance at Berlin University at overlapping times , where both were deeply affected — even intoxicated — by the prevailing Hegelianism .
As a result , both considered careers as university teachers of philosophy , but neither ever held a university post .
They had many acquaintances in common in Berlin , including Mikhail Bakunin , the Russian aristocrat who later became a revolutionary anarchist , the philosopher Bruno Bauer , and the radical poet Georg Herwegh .
They shared a carelessness with money , perhaps because they were both born into easy circumstances and therefore assumed that money would never be a problem .
Both started their writing careers as romantic poets , though more of Turgenev ’s poetry than Marx ’s was published .
Their literary influences and tastes were similar .
Each read widely in the Greek and Latin classics ; each could quote Shakespeare in the original .
Both learned Spanish in order to read Calderón .
( Turgenev , of course , also learned it to speak the native language of the great , but unsatisfactory , love of his life , the famous prima donna Pauline Viardot . )
The two men were in Brussels at the outbreak of the 1848 revolution against the July monarchy in France , and both left to observe the events elsewhere .
Turgenev ’s closest Russian friend , Pavel Annenkov , to whom he dedicated some of his work , knew Marx well in Brussels — and left an unflattering description of him .
The secret police spied upon both men , and both lived most of their adult lives , and died , in exile .
Each fathered a child by a servant : a youthful indiscretion in Turgenev ’s case , a middle - aged one in Marx ’s .
Unlike Marx , however , Turgenev acknowledged his child and paid for her upbringing .
Both men were known for their sympathy with the downtrodden and oppressed .
But for all their similarities of education and experience , the quality of each man ’s compassion could not have been more different : for while one ’s , rooted in the suffering of individuals , was real , the other ’s , abstract and general , was not .
To see the difference , contrast Turgenev ’s 1852 story " Mumu " with Marx ’s Communist Manifesto , written four years earlier .
Both works , almost exactly equal in length , took shape in difficult circumstances : Marx , expelled from France for revolutionary activity , was residing in Brussels , where he had no wish to be and no income , while Turgenev was under house arrest at Spasskoye , his isolated estate southwest of Moscow , for having written his Sketches from a Hunter ’s Album , an implicitly anti-serfdom — and therefore subversive — book .
The censor who allowed it to be published was dismissed and stripped of his pension .
" Mumu " is set in Moscow in the days of serfdom .
Gerasim is a deaf and dumb serf of enormous stature and strength , whose owner , an old and tyrannical feudal landowner , has had him brought to the city from the countryside .
Unable to express himself in words , Gerasim clumsily woos a peasant girl called Tatyana , also owned by the landowner .
On a whim , however , the landowner , a sour and embittered widow who is never named , decides to marry Tatyana off to another of her serfs , a drunken cobbler called Kapiton , thus dashing Gerasim ’s hopes .
Not long after , Gerasim finds a young puppy drowning in a muddy creek .
He rescues her and looks after her until she is a healthy , full - grown dog .
He calls her Mumu , the nearest he can come to articulating a word , and everyone in the landowner ’s Moscow establishment soon knows the dog by that name .
Gerasim grows passionately fond of the dog , his only true friend , whom he allows to live with him in his little room , and who follows him everywhere .
The dog adores Gerasim .
One day the landowner sees Mumu through the window and asks for the dog to be brought to her .
But Mumu is afraid of the landowner and bares her teeth to her .
The landowner instantly conceives a dislike of the dog and demands that she be gotten rid of .
One of the landowner ’s servants takes the dog away and sells it to a stranger .
Gerasim searches for Mumu frantically but fails to find her .
However , Mumu finds her way back to him , to his overwhelming joy .
Unfortunately , Mumu barks on the following night and wakes the landowner , who believes herself to be sorely tried by this interruption of her sleep .
She demands that the dog , this time , be destroyed .
Her servants go to Gerasim and , by means of signs , pass on her demand .
Gerasim , recognizing the inevitable , promises to destroy the dog himself .
There follow two passages of almost unbearable pathos .
In the first , Gerasim takes Mumu to the local tavern : " In the tavern they knew Gerasim and understood his sign language .
He ordered cabbage soup and meat and sat down with his arms on the table .
Mumu stood beside his chair , looking at him calmly with her intelligent eyes .
Her coat literally shone : clearly she had only recently been combed .
They brought Gerasim his cabbage soup .
He broke some bread into it , cut up the meat into small pieces and set the bowl down on the floor .
Mumu started eating with her customary delicacy , her muzzle hardly touching the food .
Gerasim studied her for a long time ; two heavy tears rolled suddenly out of his eyes : one fell on the dog ’s forehead , the other into the soup .
He covered his face with his hand .
Mumu ate half the bowl and walked away licking herself .
Gerasim stood up , paid for the soup and left . "
He takes Mumu down to the river , picking up a couple of bricks en route .
At the riverbank , he gets into a boat with Mumu and rows out some distance .
" Finally Gerasim sat up straight , hurriedly , with a look of sickly bitterness on his face , tied the bricks together with string , made a noose , placed it round Mumu ’s neck , lifted her over the river , looked at her for the last time .
. . .
Trustingly and without fear she looked at him and slightly wagged her tail .
He turned away , grimaced and let go .
. . .
Gerasim heard nothing , neither the whining of the falling Mumu , nor the heavy splash in the water ; for him the noisiest day was still and soundless , as not even the quietest night can be soundless for us ; and when he again opened his eyes the little waves were as ever hurrying along the river ’s surface , as if racing after each other , as ever they rippled against the sides of the boat , and only far behind one or two broad rings rippled towards the bank . "
We learn that after Mumu ’s death Gerasim runs away back to his village , where he works like a slave in the fields : but never again does he form a close attachment to man or dog .
When the cultivated , aristocratic , revolutionary Russian exile Alexander Herzen read the story , he trembled with rage .
Thomas Carlyle said it was the most emotionally affecting story he had ever read .
John Galsworthy said of it that " no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned . "
And one of Turgenev ’s relatives , to whom the author read " Mumu , " wrote afterward , " What a humane and good man one must be to understand and give expression to the experience and torments of another ’s heart in that way ! "
The story is autobiographical , and the tyrannical , captious , arbitrary , and selfish landowner is the author ’s mother , Varvara Petrovna Turgeneva .
Widowed early , she was an absolute monarch on her estate .
Many stories have come down to us of her cruelty , though not all have been authenticated : for example , that she had two serfs sent to Siberia for having failed to make their obeisances to her as she passed — because they did not see her .
And the model for Gerasim was a deaf and dumb serf belonging to Varvara Petrovna called Andrei .
Clearly " Mumu " is an impassioned protest against the exercise of arbitrary power of one person over another , but it is not politically schematic .
Though it is obviously directed against serfdom , the story does not suggest that cruelty is the prerogative of feudal landowners alone , and that if only serfdom were abolished , no vigilance against such cruelty would be necessary .
If power is a permanent feature of human relationships — and surely only adolescents and certain kinds of intellectuals , Marx included , could imagine that it is not — then " Mumu " is a permanent call to compassion , restraint , and justice in its exercise .
That is why " Mumu " does not lose its power to move 140 years after the abolition of serfdom in Russia ; while it refers to a particular place at a particular time , it is also universal .
In making his general point , Turgenev does not suggest that his characters are anything but individuals , with their own personal characteristics .
He does not see them just as members of a group or class , caused by oppression to act in predetermined ways like trams along their rails : and his careful observation of even the humblest of them is the most powerful testimony possible to his belief in their humanity .
Grand aristocrat that he was , and acquainted with the greatest minds of Europe , he did not disdain to take seriously the humblest peasant , who could not hear or speak .
Turgenev ’s oppressed peasants were fully human beings , endowed with free will and capable of moral choice .
He contrasts Gerasim ’s tenderness toward Mumu with the landowner ’s selfish fractiousness .
" Why should that dumb man have a dog ? " she asks , without the thought entering her head for a moment that " that dumb man " might have interests and feelings of his own .
" Who allowed him to keep a dog out in my yard ? "
Turgenev does not suggest that the landowning widow ’s quasi- absolute power is in any way enviable .
Although religious in a superficial and sententious way , she regards God as a servant , not a master , and she acknowledges no limits , either God ’s or the law ’s , to the exercise of her will .
The result for her is misery , a permanent state of irritation , dissatisfaction , and hypochondria .
The satisfaction of her whims brings no pleasure , precisely because they are whims rather than true desires ; and —used as she is to obedience , and deserving of it as she believes herself to be — she experiences all resistance , even that of time , as intolerable .
For example , when Mumu is brought in , the landowner talks to her in a syrupy , ingratiating manner ; but when the dog fails to respond , she changes her tune .
" Take her away !
A disgusting little dog ! "
Unlike Gerasim , who has nurtured Mumu with tender devotion , the landowner wants the dog to love her immediately , just because she is who she is .
Her power renders her dishonest and incapable of introspection .
When Gerasim disappears after drowning Mumu , " she flew into a temper , shed tears , ordered him to be found no matter what happened , avowed that she ’d never ordered the dog to be destroyed and finally gave [ her steward ] a dressing down . "
Her denial of responsibility is breathtaking .
Power corrupts , Turgenev knows ; and the failure to accept any limitation to one ’s thoughtless wishes makes happiness impossible .
But no set of social arrangements , he understands , will eliminate these dangers altogether .
Nor does Turgenev believe that the people who are subject to the power of the landowner are , by virtue of their oppression , noble .
They are scheming and conniving and sometimes thoughtlessly cruel , too .
Their mockery of Gerasim is limited only by their fear of his physical strength , and they do not sympathize in the least with his predicament .
When Gavrila , the landowner ’s steward , goes at the head of a delegation of serfs to tell Gerasim that he must get rid of Mumu once and for all , he bangs on Gerasim ’s door and shouts " ’ Open up ! ’
There came the sound of smothered barking ; but no answer .
’ I ’m telling you to open up !’ he repeated .
" ’ Gavrila Andreich , ’ remarked Stepan from below , ’he ’s deaf , he does n’t hear . ’
Everyone burst out laughing . "
There is no compassion in their laughter , not then and not at any other time in the story .
Cruelty is not the province only of the landowner , and the heartlessness of the serfs toward Gerasim always reminds me of a scene from my childhood , when I was about 11 years old .
I had gone to line up for tickets to a soccer match — in those days , for reasons I can no longer recapture , I was enthusiastic about the game .
The line was long , and there was at least a two - hour wait .
An old blind man with an accordion passed along the line , singing " The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo , " while a companion held out a cap for alms .
They passed some young working - class men who had a radio , and who turned the volume up to drown out his song .
They laughed loudly at his bewilderment as his companion led him away , reduced to silence .
No one intervened or told the young men how abominably they had behaved ; I was too cowardly to do so .
But in that little scene , I saw man ’s permanent capacity for inhumanity to man , a capacity that transcends social condition , class , or education .
An incident when I practiced medicine many years later on an island in the Pacific Ocean reinforced this lesson .
Next to the small psychiatric hospital , with its yard enclosed by a high wire fence , was the leper colony .
Every afternoon , the lepers would gather at the fence to mock the lunatics as they were let out for their exercise , performing their strange dances and shouting at unseen persecutors .
The victory over cruelty is never final , but , like the maintenance of freedom , requires eternal vigilance .
And it requires , as in " Mumu , " the exercise of the sympathetic imagination .
Turning from Turgenev to Marx ( although the Manifesto appears under the names of both Marx and Engels , it was almost entirely Marx ’s work ) , we enter a world of infinite bile — of rancor , hatred , and contempt — rather than of sorrow or compassion .
It is true that Marx , like Turgenev , is on the side of the underdog , of the man with nothing , but in a wholly disembodied way .
Where Turgenev hopes to lead us to behave humanly , Marx aims to incite us to violence .
Moreover , Marx brooked no competitors in the philanthropic market .
He was notoriously scathing about all would - be practical reformers : if lower class , they lacked the philosophic training necessary to penetrate to the causes of misery ; if upper class , they were hypocritically trying to preserve " the system . "
Only he knew the secret of turning the nightmare into a dream .
In fact , the hecatombs his followers piled up are — to the last million victims — implicit in the Manifesto .
The intolerance and totalitarianism inhere in the beliefs expressed : " The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working - class parties .
They have no interest separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole . "
In other words , there is no need for other parties , let alone individuals with their own personal quirks : indeed , since the Communists so perfectly express the interests of the proletariat , anyone opposed to the Communists must , by definition , be opposed to the interests of the proletariat .
Moreover , since the Communists " openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions , " it follows that Lenin and Stalin were perfectly right in eliminating their opponents by force .
And since , according to Marx , the ideas that people have are determined by their position in the economic structure of society , it is not even necessary for people to declare their enmity : it can be known ex officio , as it were .
The killing of the kulaks was the practical application of Marxist epistemology .
As you read the Manifesto , a ghostly procession of Marxist catastrophes seems to rise up from it , as from the witches ’ brew in Macbeth .
Take for example points 8 and 9 of the Communist program ( interestingly , as in God ’s program published on Mount Sinai , there were ten in all ) : " 8 . Equal liability to work .
Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture .
9 . Combination of agriculture with industry , promotion of the gradual elimination of the contradictions between town and countryside . "
Those who experienced Pol Pot ’s regime , and Ceauüsescu ’s " systematization , " which demolished villages and replaced them with half - completed high - rise apartments in the middle of fields , will have no difficulty in recognizing the provenance of their misfortunes .
The Manifesto makes no mention of individual human life , except to deny its possibility under present conditions .
True , Marx mentions a few authors by name , but only to pour heavily Teutonic scorn and contumely upon them .
For him , there are no individuals , or true humans , at all .
" In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality , while the living person is dependent and has no individuality . "
It is no wonder , then , that Marx speaks only in categories : the bourgeois , the proletarian .
For him , individual men are but clones , their identity with vast numbers of others being caused not by the possession of the same genes , but by that of the same relations to the economic system .
Why study a man , when you know Men ?
Nor is this the only generalization in the Manifesto that reduces the entire population of men to mere ciphers : " On what foundation is the present family , the bourgeois family , based ?
On capital , on private gain .
. . .
But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians , and in public prostitution .
. . .
The bourgeois claptrap about the family and education , about the hallowed co-relation of parent and child , becomes all the more disgusting , the more , by the action of modern industry , all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder , and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labor .
. . .
The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production .
. . .
Our bourgeois , not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal , not to speak of common prostitutes , take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other ’s wives .
Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus , at the most , what the Communists might possibly be reproached with , is that they desire to introduce , in substitution for a hypocritically concealed , an openly legalized community of women . "
There is no mistaking the hatred and rage of these words ; but anger , while a real and powerful emotion , is not necessarily an honest one , nor is it by any means always ungratifying .
There is a permanent temptation , particularly for intellectuals , to suppose that one ’s virtue is proportional to one ’s hatred of vice , and that one ’s hatred of vice is in turn to be measured by one ’s vehemence of denunciation .
But when Marx wrote these words , he must surely have known that they were , at best , a savage caricature , at worst a deliberate distortion calculated to mislead and to destroy .
As a family man , he himself was not an unqualified success .
Although he lived a bourgeois existence , it was a disorderly , bohemian one , flamboyantly squalid .
Two of his daughters , Laura and Eleanor , committed suicide , partly as a result of his interference in their lives .
But not even his worst enemy could claim that he saw in his wife , Jenny von Westphalen , " a mere instrument of production , " a spinning jenny , so to speak .
Half his youthful poems were addressed to her in the most passionate and romantic terms only a few years before he wrote the Manifesto ; and though their relations had later cooled , he was nevertheless deeply affected by her death and did not long survive her .
Even he , whose information about people came mainly from books , must have known that the Manifesto ’s depiction of the relations between men and women was grossly distorted .
His rage was therefore — as is so much modern rage — entirely synthetic , perhaps an attempt to assume a generosity of spirit , or love of mankind , that he knew he did not have but felt he ought to have .
His lack of interest in the individual lives and fates of real human beings — what Mikhail Bakunin once called his lack of sympathy with the human race — shines out in his failure to recognize the often noble attempts by workingmen to maintain a respectable family life in the face of the greatest difficulties .
Was it really true that they had no family ties , and that their children were mere articles of commerce ?
For whom were they mere articles of commerce ?
It is typical of Marx ’s unrigorous mind that he should leave the answer ambiguous , as if commerce could exist independently of the people carrying it on .
Only his outrage , like the grin of the Cheshire cat , is clear .
Marx ’s firm grasp of unreality is also evident in his failure to imagine what would happen when , through the implementation of the ideas of radical intellectuals influenced by his mode of thinking , the bourgeois family really would break down , when " the practical absence of the family " really would become an undeniable social fact .
Surely the increased sexual jealousy , the widespread child neglect and abuse , and the increase in the interpersonal violence ( all in conditions of unprecedented material prosperity ) should have been utterly predictable to anybody with a deeper knowledge than his of the human heart .
Compare Marx ’s crudity with Turgenev ’s subtlety , alluded to by Henry James , who knew Turgenev in Paris and wrote an essay about him a year after his death : " Like all men of a large pattern , he was composed of many different pieces ; and what was always striking in him was the mixture of simplicity with the fruit of the most various observation .
. . . I had [ once ] been moved to say of him that he had the aristocratic temperament : a remark which in the light of further knowledge seemed singularly inane .
He was not subject to any definition of that sort , and to say that he was democratic would be ( though his political ideal was democracy ) to give an equally superficial account of him .
He felt and understood the opposite sides of life ; he was imaginative , speculative , anything but literal .
. . .
Our Anglo - Saxon , Protestant , moralistic , conventional standards were far away from him , and he judged things with a freedom and spontaneity in which I found a perpetual refreshment .
His sense of beauty , his love of truth and right , were the foundation of his nature ; but half the charm of his conversation was that one breathed an air in which cant phrases and arbitrary measurements simply sounded ridiculous . "
I do n’t think anyone could have said this of Marx .
When he wrote that " the workingmen have no country .
We can not take from them what they have not got , " he wrote as a man who , as far as is known , had never taken the trouble to canvass the living views of anyone but himself .
His pronouncement of the death of nationalist feeling was premature , to say the least .
And when he wrote that the bourgeois would lament the cultural loss that the proletarian revolution inevitably entailed , but that " that culture . . . is , for the enormous majority , a mere training to act as a machine , " he failed to acknowledge the profoundly moving attempts of workingmen in Britain to acquire that very culture as a liberating and ennobling agency .
It needs very little effort of the imagination to understand what fortitude it took to work in a Victorian factory by day and read Ruskin and Carlyle , Hume and Adam Smith by night , as so many workingmen did ( volumes from their lending libraries and institutes are still to be found in British secondhand bookshops ) ; but it was an effort that Marx was never prepared to make , because he did not consider it worthwhile to make it .
One might ask whether he has not set a pattern for hordes of cultivated brutes in the academy , who have destroyed for others what they themselves have benefited from .
Very different from all this , the sympathy that Turgenev expressed for the downtrodden was for living , breathing human beings .
Because he understood what Henry James called " the opposite sides of life , " he understood that there was no denouement to history , no inevitable apocalypse , after which all contradictions would be resolved , all conflicts cease , when men would be good because arrangements were perfect , and when political and economic control would turn into mere administration for the benefit of everyone without distinction .
Marx ’s eschatology , lacking all common sense , all knowledge of human nature , rested on abstractions that were to him more real than the actual people around him .
Of course , Turgenev knew the value of generalizations and could criticize institutions such as serfdom , but without any silly utopian illusions : for he knew that Man was a fallen creature , capable of improvement , perhaps , but not of perfection .
There would therefore be no hecatombs associated with Turgenev ’s name .
Marx claimed to know Man , but as for men other than his enemies — he knew them not .
Despite being a Hegelian dialectician , he was not interested in the opposite sides of life .
Neither kindness nor cruelty moved him : men were simply the eggs from which a glorious omelette would one day be made .
And he would be instrumental in making it .
When we look at our social reformers — their language , their concerns , their style , the categories in which they think — do they resemble Marx or Turgenev more ?
Turgenev — who wrote a wonderful essay entitled " Hamlet and Don Quixote , " a title that speaks for itself — would not have been surprised to discover that the Marxist style had triumphed .
By a curious twist of fate , the coldhearted Marxist utopians in Russia found a cynical use for Turgenev ’s story " Mumu , " which they printed in tens of millions of copies , to justify their own murderous ruthlessness in destroying every trace of the former society .
Could any more terrible and preposterous fate have befallen Turgenev ’s tale than that it should have been used to justify mass murder ?
Could there be any more eloquent example of the ability of intellectual abstraction to empty men ’s hearts and minds of a sense of shame and of true feeling for humanity ?
Let us recall , however , one detail of Turgenev ’s and Marx ’s biographical trajectory in which they differed .
When Marx was buried , hardly anyone came to his funeral ( in poetic revenge , perhaps , for his failure to attend the funeral of his father , who adored and sacrificed much for him ) .
When the remains of Turgenev returned to St. Petersburg from France , scores of thousands of people , including the humblest of the humble , turned out to pay their respects — and with very good reason .

THIS fall has brought plenty of bad news about food poisoning .
More than 200 people in 26 states were sickened and three people were killed by spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 .
At least 183 people in 21 states got salmonella from tainted tomatoes served at restaurants .
And more than 160 people in New York , New Jersey and other states were sickened with E. coli after eating at Taco Bell restaurants .
People are always going to get food poisoning .
The idea that every meal can be risk - free , germ - free and sterile is the sort of fantasy Howard Hughes might have entertained .
But our food can be much safer than it is right now .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 76 million Americans are sickened , 325,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 die each year because of something they ate .
Part of the problem is that the government ’s food - safety system is underfinanced , poorly organized and more concerned with serving private interests than with protecting public health .
It is time for the new Democratic Congress to reverse a decades - long weakening of regulations and face up to the food - safety threats of the 21st century .

The idea of Asyncronous Javascript and XML ( Ajax ) has been around in different forms for some time now , but only recently is truly taking off .
If you are n't familiar with what I 'm talking about , feel free to peruse Adaptive Path 's recent article on ajax , but it is not required reading .
In a nutshell , ajax encompasses the idea of using XMLHttpRequest objects in javascript to avoid needlessly refreshing a web page .
Famous uses of it are Google Suggest and Google Maps , as well as many other non-Google websites that I cannot recall offhand .
Possibilities are growing that go beyond what an iframe and DHTML could handle , let alone pure page refreshes .
The Internet is finally truly going stateless , and the challenge posed now by the adaptive path article is as follows : to forget what we think we know about the limitations of the Web , and begin to imagine a wider , richer range of possibilities .
In that regard , I started a project on the weekend that I was n't sure was possible : creating a fully secure " ajax " - powered login system , ideal for blogs , forums , and other similar sites .
I had a barebones secure case working within a few hours , and a few more hours gave the final result that I will share today .
Before we go on , I suggest you check out the demonstration of the login system trying out the username and password combinations " user1 / pass1 " and " user2 / pass2 " .
Once you get a grasp for what is going on , we 'll continue .
So in essence the system does exactly what you just saw , and exactly what I described .
While I will not go through the code , I 'll briefly go over how the system as a whole works :
You signal that you intend to log in by focussing on the username or password text box on the page .
The server then obtains a random number ( " seed " in the code ) for the transaction that will be used only for the current transaction , and once the transaction is complete , the seed is useless .
( Note this means that if data is intercepted , it can not be reconstructed to log in the user that was intercepted . )
Once you enter a username and password , the server md5 hashes your password , and then md5 hashes that hash with the seed , and sends thi to the server for authentication ( along with your username and the id of the transaction ) .
The server compares the hash it recieved with the hash of the password hash stored in the database concatenated with the seed for the transaction given by the id from the client .
If these two hashes match , the user is logged in .
Otherwise , the appropriate error message is sent back to the client .
Notice how I have n't discussed the presentation issues , as in reality they have little to do with the problem .
When I moved from my barebones ugly example to the somewhat more aesthetically pleasing one that I 've linked to today , I did n't change any of the backend , nor the login_controller .js file .
In designing the system this way , it can be applied to any number of applications , such as a blog comment , a forum , etc .
Also notice that this is seemingly more secure than a traditional login system since the password is never transmitted in plain text .
In the example I have given , I did n't provide any allowances for older browsers , however it would be very simple to modify it such that it degrades gracefully .
Finally , I did n't actually use XML anywhere in my implementation .
It simply was n't necessary , plain text served just as well .
In more complicated situations XML might be the answer , but do n't over - complicate the problem .
It is my hope that this application of ajax and XMLHttpRequest gets your creativity going for more applications of the technology , and makes you more aware of just how cool it can be .
The last line of the Adaptive Path article I referenced to at the beginning of this article says " It 's going to be fun . "
So far it 's been great fun for me , and I trust it will be for you too .
Lately I have been trying out a number of distributed version control systems ( VCS or SCM ) .
One of my tests was a real problem : I wanted to track the Linux 2.6.16.x kernel tree , apply the Xen patches to it , and pull only specific patches ( for the qla2xxx driver ) from 2.6.17.x into this local branch .
I wanted also to be able to upgrade to 2.6.17.x later ( once Xen supports it ) and have the version control system properly track which patches I already have .
But before going on , let ’s establish what it means to be an ideal distributed VCS :
1 . The fundamental method of collaboration must be a branch .
A checkout should mean creating a local branch on which a person can commit and work without having to involve the server .
An update from some central server should take the form of a merge from that branch to the local branch .

An update from some central server should take the form of a merge from that branch to the local branch .
2 . Branching should be cheap .
It should be easy to create a local branch , the operation to do so should be fast , and it should n’t take an inordinate amount of space .
It should also be as easy as possible to branch from a remote repository .

It should also be as easy as possible to branch from a remote repository .
3 . Merging between branches is intelligent .
It should be easy to merge another branch with your own .
The VCS should know which changesets from the other branch are already on yours , and should not attempt to merge changesets that you have already merged previously .

4 . Inividial changesets should be mergeable without bringing across the whole history .
You should be able to bring across the minimum number of changesets necessary to effect a specific change .
This corresponds to my test case above .
Future merges from the whole branch should , of course , recognize that these changesets are present already .

5 . Branching preserves full history .
A branch should be a first - class copy of a repository , even if the repository is remote .
It should contain the full history of the branch it was made from , including diffs for each individual changeset and full commit logs , unless otherwise requested by the user .

6 . Merging preserves full history .
A merge from one branch to another should also preserve full history .
Changesets merged to the local branch should retain the individual , distinct diffs and commit logs for each changeset .
There are also some things that we would generally want :
7 . It is possible to commit , branch , merge , and work with history offline .
8 . The program is fast enough for general - purpose use .
Evaluation
Let ’s look at some common VCSs against these criteria .
I ’ll talk about Arch ( tla , baz , etc ) , bzr ( bazaar - ng ) , Darcs , Git , Mercurial ( hg ) , and Subversion ( svn ) for reference .
1 . The fundamental method of collaboration must be a branch
All of the tools pass this test except for svn .
2. Branching should be cheap
Everyone except svn generally does this reasonably well .
The tla interface for Arch had a pretty terrible interface for this , so it took awhile simply due to all the typing involved .
That ’s better these days .
Darcs supports hardlinking of history to other local repositories and will do this automatically by default .
Git also supports that , but defaults to not doing it , or you can store a path to look in for changesets that are n’t in the current repo .
I believe Mercurial also can use hardlinks , though I did n’t personally verify that .
bzr appears to have some features in this area , but not hardlinks , and the features were too complex ( or poorly documented ) to learn about quickly .
svn does not support branching across repositories , so does n’t really pass this test .
Branches within a repository are not directly supported either , but are conventionally simulated by doing a low - cost copy into a specially - named area in the repository .
3 . Merging between branches is intelligent
Arch was one of the early ones to work on this problem .
It works reasonably well in most situations , but breaks in spectacular and unintelligble ways in some other situations .
When asked to merge one branch to another , Darcs will simply merge in any patches from the source branch onto the destination which the destination does n’t already have .
This goes farther than any of the other systems , which generally store a “ head ” pointer for each branch that shows how far you ’ve gone .
( Arch is closer to darcs here , though ironically bzr is more like the other systems )
Merging between branches in svn is really poor , and has no support for recognizing changesets that have been applied both places , resulting in conflicts in many development models .
4. Inividial changesets should be mergeable without bringing across the whole history
Darcs is really the only one that can do this right .
I was really surprised that nobody else could , since it is such a useful and vital feature for me .
Both bzr and git have a cherry - pick mode that simulates this , but really these commands just get a diff from the specific changeset requested , then apply the diff as with patch .
So you really get a different changeset committed , which can really complicate your history later — AND lead to potential conflicts in future merges .
bzr works around some of the conflict problems because on a merge , it will silently ignore patches that attempt to perform an operation that has already occured .
But that leads to even more confusing results , as the merge of the patch is recorded for a commit that did n’t actually merge it .
( That could even be a commit that does n’t modify the source . )
Sounds like a nightmare for later .
Arch has some support for it , but in my experience , actually using this support tends to get it really confused when you do merges later .
Neither Mercurial nor svn have any support for this at all .
5 . Branching preserves full history
git , darcs , and Mercurial get this right .
Making a branch from one of these repos will give you full history , including individual diffs and commit logs for each changeset .
Arch and bzr preserve commit logs but not the individual changesets on a new branch .
I was particularly surprised at this shortcoming with bzr , but sure enough , a standard bzr merge from a remote branch commited three original changesets into one and did not preserve the individual history on the one commit .
svn does n’t support cross -repo branching at all .
6. Merging preserves full history
Again , darcs , git , and Mercurial get this right ( I have n’t tested this in Mercurial , so I ’m not 100 % sure ) .
Arch and bzr have the same problem of preserving commit logs , but not individual changesets .
A merge from one branch to another in Arch or bzr simply commits one big changeset on the target that represents all the changesets pulled in from the source .
So you lose the distinctness of each individual changeset .
This can result in the uncomfortable situation of being unable to re-create full history without access to dozens of repositories on the ‘ net .
Subversion has no support for merging across repositories , and its support for merging across simulated local branches is n’t all that great , either .
7 . It is possible to commit , branch , merge , and work with history offline
Everyone except Subversion does a good job of this .
8 . The program is fast enough for general - purpose use
All tools here are probably fast enough for most people ’s projects .
Subversion can be annoying at times because many more svn commands hit the network than those from others .
In my experience , Arch was the slowest .
Though it was still fine for most work , it really bogged down with the Linux kernel .
bzr was next , somewhere between arch and darcs .
bzr commands “ felt ” sluggish , but I have n’t used it enough to really see how it scales .
Darcs is the next .
It used to be pretty slow , but has been improving rapidly since 1.0.0 was released .
It now scales up to a kernel - sized project very well , and is quite usable and reasonably responsive for such a thing .
The two main things that slow it down are very large files ( 10 MB or above ) and conflicts during a merge .
Mercurial and git appear to be fastest and pretty similar in performance .
All of these tools perform best with periodic manual ( or scheduled cron jobs ) intervention — once a month to once a year , depending on your project ’s size .
Arch users have typically created a new repo each year .
Darcs users periodically tag things ( if things are tagged as part of normal work , no extra work is needed here ) and can create checkpoints to speed checkouts over the net .
git and Mercurial also use a form of checkpoints .
( not sure about bzr )
Subversion works so differently from the others that it ’s hard to compare .
( For one , a checkout does n’t bring down any history . )
Conclusions
I was surprised by a few things .
First , that only one system actually got # 4 ( merging individual changesets ) right .
Second , that if you had to pick losers among VCSs , it seems to be Arch and bzr — the lack of history in branching and merging is a really big issue , and they do n’t seem to have any compelling features that git , darcs , or Mercurial lack .
# 4 was a unique feature to Darcs a few years ago , but I figured it surely would have been cloned by all the other new VCS projects that have popped up since .
It seems that people have realized it is important , and have added token workaround support for it , but not real working support .
On the other hand , it was interesting to see how VCS projects have copied from each other .
Everyone ( except tla ) seems to use a command - line syntax similar to CVS .
The influence of tla Arch is , of course , plainly visible in baz and bzr , but you can also see pieces of it in all the other projects .
I was also interested to see the Darcs notion of patch dependencies was visible ( albeit in a more limited fashion ) in bzr , git , and Mercurial .
So , I will be staying with Darcs .
It seems to really take the idea of distributed VCS and run with it .
Nobody else seems to have quite gotten the merging thing right yet — and if you are going to make it difficult to do anything but merge everything up to point x from someone ’s branch , I just do n’t see how your tool is as useful as Darcs .
But I am glad to see ideas from different projects percolating across and getting reused — this is certainly good for the community .
Updates / Corrections
I got an e-mail explaining how to get the individual patch diffs out of bzr .
This will work only for “ regular ” , non-cherry - picked merges , and requires some manual effort .
You ’ll need to run bzr log , and find the patch IDs ( these are the long hex numbers on the “ merged : ” line ) of the changeset you ’re interested in , plus the changeset immediately before it on the same branch ( which may not be on the same patch and may not be obvious at all on busy projects . )
Then , run bzr diff -r revid : old - revid - string ..new - revid-string .
I think this procedure really stinks , though , since it requires people to manually find previous commits from the same branch in the log .

Esej je bil prvič objavljen februarja 1997 v reviji Communications of the ACM ( letnik 40 , š tevilka 2 ) .( iz “ Pot v Tycho ” , zbirke esejev o predhodnikih Lunarne Revolucije , objavljene v Mestu Luna 2096 )
Za Dana Herberta se je pot do Tychota začela na fakulteti – ko ga je Lissa Lenz prosila , če ji posodi svoj računalnik .
Njen se je pokvaril , in če si ne bo izposodila drugega , bo padla na izpitnem projektu .
Nikogar si ni upala vprašati , razen Dana .
To je Dana postavilo pred dilemo .
Moral bi ji pomagati – a če ji posodi svoj računalnik , bo morda brala njegove knjige .
Razen dejstva , da greš lahko v zapor za mnogo let če komu omogočiš , da bere tvoje knjige , ga je njena prošnja najprej čisto šokirala .
Tako kot vse , so tudi njega od osnovne šole dalje učili da je deljenje knjig grdo in narobe – nekaj , kar počnejo samo pirati .
Poleg tega ni bilo veliko možnosti , da ga SPA – Software Protection Authority ( Agencija za zaščito programske opreme ) ne bi ujela .
Na seminarju o programski opremi se je Dan naučil da ima vsaka knjiga sistem za nadzor spoštovanja avtorskih pravic , ki Centralni Licenčni Agenciji sporoči kdaj , kje in kdo je prebral knjigo .
( To informacijo so uporabljali za lovljenje bralnih piratov , pa tudi za prodajo uporabniških profilov maloprodajnim trgovinam ) .
Naslednjič , ko bo njegov računalnik vključen v omrežje , ga bo Centralna Licenčna Agencija odkrila .
On , kot lastnik računalnika , pa bo prejel najhujšo možno kazen , ker ni preprečil zločina .
Seveda , Lissa morda ni nujno nameravala brati njegovih knjig .
Morda je želela računalnik le za to , da bi napisala svojo seminarsko nalogo .
Toda
Dan je vedel , da Lissa prihaja iz družine iz srednjega razreda in si težko privošči plačevanje šolnine , celo prispeveka za branje .
Branje njegovih knjig bi bil lahko edini način , da bi diplomirala .
Razumel je situacijo : tudi on sam je moral najeti posojilo , da je lahko plačal vse študijsko gradivo in znanstvene članke , ki jih je moral prebrati ( 10 % pristojbin za branje gradiv je šlo raziskovalcem , ki so jih napisali ; ker je Dan načrtoval akademsko kariero , je upal , da mu bodo tudi njegovi članki , če bodo pogosto citirani , prinesli dovolj denarja , da bo odplačal svoj kredit ) .
Kasneje je Dan izvedel , da so bili časi , ko je šel lahko kdorkoli v knjižnico in bral strokovne revije in celo knjige , ne da bi mu bilo potrebno za to plačati .
Obstajali so celo neodvisni raziskovalci , ki so prebrali na tisoče strani brez državnih knjižničnih dovoljenj .
Toda v 1990 - tih so tako komercialni , kot tudi neprofitni izdajatelji strokovnih revij pričeli zaračunavati pristojbine za dostop .
Od leta 2047 so bile knjižnice , ki so ponujale javen dostop do študijskega gradiva le še bled spomin .
Seveda so obstajali načini kako zaobiti SPA in Centralno Licenčno Agencijo .
A že same po sebi so bile nezakonite .
Dan je imel sošolca pri računalništvu , Franka Martuccija , ki si je prodobil prepovedani razhroščevalnik ( programsko orodje , ki omogoča analizo delovanja in popravljanje binarnih računalniških programov , op. prev. ) ter z njim preskočil program za nadzor spoštovanja avtorskih pravic pri branju knjig .
Toda o tem je povedal preveč prijateljem in nekdo ga je v zameno za nagrado izdal SPA ( študente , ki so bili globoko v dolgovih je bilo mogoče hitro premamiti v izdajo ) .
V letu 2047 je bil Frank v zaporu , a ne zaradi piratskega branja knjig , pač pa zaradi posedovanja razhroščevalnika .
Dan je kasneje izvedel , da so bili včasih časi , ko je kdorkoli lahko imel razhroščevalna orodja .
Obstajala so celo brezplačna razhroščevalna orodja na CD - jih ali na internetu .
Toda običajni uporabniki so jih pričeli uporabljati za izogibanje sistemom za nadzor spoštovanja avtorskih pravic in navsezadnje je sodišče razsodilo , da je to postalo njihova glavna uporaba .
To je pomenilo , da so postali nezakoniti , razvijalci razhroščevalnikov pa so bili poslani v zapor .
Programerji so še vedno potrebovali razhroščevalna orodja , toda proizvajalci teh orodij so od leta 2047 prodajali samo označene kopije in še to le licenciranim in uradno zaprise ženim programerjem .
Razhroščevalnik , ki ga je Dan uporabljal pri pouku računalništva je bil zavarovan za posebnim požarnim zidom in ga je bilo mogoče uporabiti le za šolske naloge .
Sisteme za nadzor spoštovanja avtorskih pravic je bilo mogoče zaobiti tudi z namestitvijo prilagojenega jedra operacijskega sistema .
Ščasoma je Dan izvedel da so okrog začetka stoletja obstajala prosta jedra operacijskega sistema ter celo popolnoma prosti operacijski sistemi .
A ne samo , da so bili nezakoniti tako kot razhroščevalniki , celo namestiti jih ni bilo mogoče ne da bi vedel administratorsko geslo svojega računalnika .
In tega vam seveda nista povedala ne FBI , niti Microsoftova tehnična podpora .
Dan je zaključil , da ne more preprosto posoditi Lissi svojega računalnika .
Toda hkrati ji tudi ni mogel odbiti prošnje , saj jo je ljubil .
Vsaka priložnost , da je govoril z njo , ga je navdala z veseljem .
In to , da je za pomoč zaprosila njega je pomenilo , da morda tudi ona ljubi njega .
Dan je dilemo razrešil tako , da je storil nekaj še bolj nezaslišanega – posodil ji je svoj računalnik in ji povedal svoje geslo .
Če bo sedaj Lissa brala njegove knjige , bodo pri Centralni Licenčni Agenciji mislili , da jih je bral on .
To je bil še vedno zločin , a SPA ga ne bo samodejno odkrila .
Odkrili ga bodo samo , če ga bo Lissa prijavila .
Seveda , če bo njegova fakulteta kdaj odkrila , da je Lissi dal svoje lastno geslo bo to končalo študijsko kariero obeh , ne glede na to za kaj bi Lissa geslo uporabila .
Fakultetna politika je bila da je vsakr šno oviranje njihovih sistemov za nadzor študentske uporabe računalnikov disciplinski prekršek .
Vseeno je bilo , če si storil kaj škodljivega – prekršek je bil že poiskus oteževanja nadzora nad teboj .
Predpostavili so , da to pomeni , da počneš nekaj drugega prepovedanega in ni jim bilo potrebno vedeti kaj je to .
Študentje navadno zaradi takšnih prekrškov niso bili izključeni – vsaj ne neposredno .
Namesto tega jim je bil onemogočen dostop do šolskih računalniških sistemov in neizogibno so padli na izpitih .
Kasneje je Dan izvedel , da se je tovrstna univerzitetna politika začela konec 1980 - tih , ko so študentje še množično uporabljali računalnike .
Pred tem so imele univerze drugačen disciplinski pristop ; kaznovale so samo dejavnosti , ki so bile škodljive , ne pa tudi tistih , ki so bile le sumljive .
Lissa Dana ni prijavila SPA .
Njegova odločitev da ji bo pomagal je privedla do njune poroke , pa tudi do izpraševanja kaj so ju učili o piratstvu ko sta bila še otroka .
Par je pričel brati o zgodovini avtorskih pravic , o Sovjetski zvezi in njihovih omejitvah tiskanja in kopiranja ter celo originalno ameriško ustavo .
Preselila sta se v Luno , kjer sta spoznala druge , ki so prav tako zbe žali pred dolgo roko SPA .
Ko se je pričela Vstaja Tycho v letu 2062 , je univerzalna pravica do branja postala eden njihovih glavnih uporniških ciljev .
Avtorjev pripis
Zapis je bil osvežen leta 2002 .
Pravica do branja je bitka , ki se bojuje že danes .
Kljub temu , da bo morda lahko preteklo 50 let do tega , da bo današnji način življenja izginil , je bila večina specifičnih zakonov in praks omenjenih v eseju že predlaganih .
Mnogi predlogi so v ZDA in drugod že uzakonjeni .
V ZDA je leta 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright
Act vspostavil pravno osnovo za omejevanje branja in posojanja elektronskih knjig ( in tudi ostalih podatkov ) .
Podobne omejitve je leta 2001 z Direktivo o avtorski pravici v informacijski družbi predlagala Evropska Unija .
Do predkratkim je veljala le ena izjema : ideja iz eseja , da bi FBI in Microsoft imela administracijska gesla osebnih računalnikov , ki jih ne bi razkrila uporabnikom , se do leta 2002 še ni pojavila .
Danes pa jo že poznamo pod imenom Trusted Computing oz .
Palladium .
V letu 2001 je s strani Disneya sponzorirani senator Fritz Hollings predlagal zakon SSSCA ( Security Systems Standards and Certification Act , op. prev. ) , ki bi zahteval , da je v vsak nov računalnik vgrajena infrastruktura za omejevanje kopiranja , ki je uporabnik ne bi mogel zaobiti .
A ideje o uvedbi Clipper čipa ter ideje ameriške vlade o uvedbi obveznega depozita šifrirnih ključev kažejo dolgoročni trend : uporabniku se jemlje zmožnost nadzora nad računalniškimi sistemi .
Predlog zakona SSSCA se je kasneje preimenoval v CBDTPA ( Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act , op. prev. ) ( razlagajte si kratico kot “ Consume But Do n’t Try Programming Act ” – “ bodi potrošnik a ne poiskušaj programirati ” ) .
Leta 2001 so ZDA pričele na podlagi pogodbe o ameriškem prosto trgovinskem območju ( FTAA – Free Trade Agreement of Americas ) vsiljevati enaka pravila tudi za vse ostale države zahodne poloble .
FTAA je eden od t.im .
“ prosto trgovinskih ” pogodb , ki pa je v resnici ustvarjena zato , da poveča vpliv podjetij nad demokratičnimi vladami .
Vsiljevanje zakonov kakršen je DMCA je popolnoma v tem duhu .
Nevladna organizacija Electronic Frontier Foundation zato prosi ljudi , da razložijo drugim vladam zakaj naj bi nasprotovale takim načrtom .
Vlogo policista SPA , kar je v bistvu kratica za Združenje založnikov programske opreme ( Software Publisher ’s Association ) , je zamenjala BSA ali Business Software Alliance .
Ta še ni , vsaj zaenkrat , uradna policijska enota , neuradno pa se že obnaša tako .
Z uporabljanjem metod , ki spominjajo na nekdanjo Sovjetsko zvezo , poziva ljudi k ovajanju sodelavcev in prijateljev .
Kampanja BSA v Argentini v letu 2001 je namigovala , da bodo uporabniki , ki delijo programsko opremo , v zaporu posiljeni .
V času nastanka tega eseja je SPA grozila majhnim ponudnikom dostopa do interneta , naj jim omogočijo nadzor vseh svojih uporabnikov .
Večina ponudnikov se je ob grožnjah predala , saj si niso mogli privoščiti bitke na sodišču ( vir : Atlanta Journal - Constitution , 1. oktober 1996 , D3 ) .
Vsaj eden od ponudnikov dostopa do interneta , Community ConneXion iz Oaklanda , se je zahtevam uprl in so ga dejansko tožili .
SPA je kasneje to žbo opustila vendar je nato z zakonom DMCA dobila moč , ki si jo je želela .
Univerzitetne varnostne politike opisane v eseju ravno tako niso izmišljene .
Za primer si lahko ogledamo izpis sporočila ob prijavi v računalnik ene od univerz v okolici Chicaga :
“ Ta sistem lahko uporabljajo samo avtorizirani uporabniki .
Aktivnosti posameznikov , ki uporabljajo ta računalnik brez dovoljenja oz .
bodo prekoračili svoje pravice bodo nadzorovane in zabeležene s strani računalniškega osebja .
V času nadzorovanja uporabnikov , ki nedopustno uporabljajo ta sistem ali v času vzdrževanja sistema so lahko nadzorovane tudi aktivnosti legitimnih uporabnikov .
Vsakdo , ki uporablja ta sistem se izrecno strinja s takšnim nadzorovanjem , prav tako pa je opozorjen , da v primeru , da ta nadzor odkrije možne dokaze o nezakoniti dejavnosti ali kršitvi Univezitetnih pravil , računalniško osebje lahko tako zbrane dokaze posreduje vodstvu Univerze in / ali ustreznim državnim organom ”
To je zanimiv pristop h pravici do zasebnosti : večino prisili k vnaprejšnji odpovedi tej pravici .

BellSouth , AT&T added to NSA lawsuit Intelligence committees to be briefed before CIA confirmation President Bush speaks about telephone eavesdropping at the White House on Tuesday .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Security Agency ( NSA ) Verizon Communications BellSouth Corporation Justice and Rights or or Create Your Own NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- BellSouth and AT&T were added to a class - action lawsuit against Verizon Communications that alleges the companies illegally participated in a National Security Agency domestic surveillance program .
The complaint , filed in Manhattan District Court , is asking that the companies pay $ 200 billion in fines to their 200 million subscribers .
Attorneys Carl Mayer and Bruce Afran said that since the lawsuit was filed Friday they have been overwhelmed with calls from people wanting to join the suit .
" They are violating federal law , which mandates a minimum penalty of $ 1,000 for every person whose records have been disclosed , " Afran said , adding that many who have called his office are " outraged " by the government 's and phone companies ' actions .
USA Today last week reported that the three telecommunications giants provided the NSA records from billions of domestic phone calls after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Verizon and BellSouth have denied that they provided such information , leaving AT&T as the only company mentioned in the article that has n't denied the claims .
Verizon and BellSouth also denied that the NSA even asked them for the data .
Qwest Communications has issued a statement saying that it was asked to participate in the program but did n't because the program appeared to violate privacy laws .
USA Today reported that the NSA does n't record or listen to conversations .
Rather , the article said , the agency uses the data -- which include numbers , times and locations -- to find patterns that suggest terrorist activity .
That does n't matter to Afran , who said the disclosure alone of phone records is a flagrant violation of privacy rights , and the phone companies need to be held accountable .
" We intend to make the phone companies understand the financial risks and exposure they have if they do not , No. 1 , end this program and , No. 2 , find a way to settle it , " he said .
President Bush on Tuesday reiterated his assertion that the government is not listening to phone calls to or from ordinary Americans without a court order .
" What I 've told the American people is we 'll protect them against an al Qaeda attack , " Bush said .
" I 've also been clear about the fact that we do not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval and this government will continue to guard the privacy of the American people .
" But if al Qaeda is calling into the United States , we want to know , and we want to know why . "
Allegations that the telecommunications giants gave call records to the government come on the heels of a December story in The New York Times that revealed the government was eavesdropping without a warrant on some international calls made to or by Americans .
The Foreign Intelligence Security
Act requires that the government obtain a court order from a secret FISA court to tap the phones of American citizens inside the country .
On Tuesday , the White House agreed to brief the Senate Intelligence Committee on the domestic wiretap program , the committee 's chairman said .
In a prepared statement , Sen . Pat Roberts , R - Kansas , added that the program will be a " central " topic of discussion in the deliberations over Gen. Michael Hayden 's nomination to be the next CIA chief .
Hayden was NSA director when the surveillance program was authorized by President Bush in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
" It became apparent that in order to have a fully informed confirmation hearing , all members of my committee needed to know the full width and breadth of the president 's program , " Roberts said in a written statement .
" This issue will be central to the committee 's deliberations on Gen .
Hayden 's nomination and there was no way we could fulfill our collective constitutional responsibilities without that knowledge . "
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Peter Hoekstra , R- Michigan , said his committee also will be briefed .
Hoekstra called the program " a critical tool in keeping this country safe " and said he hopes the briefing will " put an end to the politics surrounding this issue . "
Both committees are scheduled to be briefed Wednesday , the day before Hayden 's confirmation hearing is to begin .

Endless hours spent perfecting your golf swing or basketball shot could be a waste of time , according to a new study which shows that practice does not always make perfect .
Mark Churchland and colleagues at Stanford University in California , US , made the discovery after training macaque monkeys to repeat a simple reaching task thousands of times .
“ The nervous system was not designed to do the same thing over and over again , ” says Churchland , whose team investigated the way the brain plans and calculates motion .
The team showed the monkeys a coloured spot and rewarded them for reaching out to touch it at different speeds .
During the exercise , they monitored the promoter cortex of the monkeys ’ brains , which is the region responsible for movement planning , and tracked the speed of the resulting motion .
Advertisement
Over the course of thousands of reaches , the monkeys rarely moved with exactly the same speed .
Small variations in reach speed followed small variations in brain activity during movement planning , the researchers say .
Conventional wisdom
Contrary to conventional wisdom that movement variability is caused by muscle activity , Churchland ’s team found that neural activity accounts for about half the variations .
In other words , training muscles to perform a certain way through practice , such as countless hours teeing off or shooting a basketball , will not produce the same shot every time because the brain ’s behaviour is inconsistent .
After an initial training period , the monkeys ’ reach accuracy did not improve over time , suggesting that lots of practice can only improve movement control so much , says team member Krishna Shenoy .
The researchers speculate that humans and animals evolved with this “ improvisational style ” in response to the predator - prey dynamic where predators never catch and kill prey in exactly the same conditions .
“ Premium athletes ’ quest for consistency is a stark contrast to the way we evolved through history , ” Shenoy says .
The team hopes that understanding the way the brain controls movement may lead to treatments for neurological conditions such as Parkinson ’s disease , which is characterised by tremors .

「 オブジェクト指向プログラムのためのパターン言語の使用」を読み返している。
漠然と感じていたことをあらためて書き出してみる。
アプリケーションプログラマーとフレームワーク（端的にはRails）の関係について。
以下は、上記文章のもじりである。
もし、元のアレクザンダーの考えが正しく、そしてケントベックとウォードカニンガムが考えたようにアレクザンダーが建築に対して用いた考え方がプログラムに適用可能なような普遍性を持つのであれば、以下の言明は真となるはずだ。
Alexander氏は、家やオフィスというものは、実際にそこにいる人たちの手によって設計され、作られるべきだと提案している。氏がこう結論付けたのは、ある構造（a particular structure）への要求を一番よく知っているのは、彼ら自身だからだ。我々はこれに賛同し、フレームワークにも同じ論旨を展開した。つまり、プログラマーは、自分自身のフレームワークを書くべきなのである。この考えはアホみたいに聞こえるかもしれない。建築とプログラムとの規模や複雑性の違い、設計のプロになるためのトレーニング年数などを考えると、その通りだろう。しかし、Alexander氏が説得力のあるシナリオを提供している。そのシナリオは、「パターン言語」と呼ばれるコンセプトを中心に展開されている。
次 にRailsについて考えてみる。Railsは優れたフレームワークとして受け入れられていると考えられる。
上記の2点から、Railsはプログラマーから見たWebアプリケーションフレームワークのパターン言語を設計に適用した結果とみなすことができる。
事実 、Railsを利用していて感じることのひとつに、うまくできているな、という思いがある。何かをしたいときに、それがたいていにおいて用意されているか、少なくてもそれをたやすく実現するための仕組みが用意されている。だいたいにおいて。
誰か他のプログラマーにRailsの良い点を説明する必要が生じたと仮定しよう。
一番簡単なのは、実際に使ってもらうことだ。
しかし、別の方法論もあり得るのではないか？
パターン言語とは、設計過程で発生するあらゆる問題に対し、実際に機能するソリューションを提供することで、設計者を導くというものだ。パターン言語は、一連のちょっとした知識がある一定のスタイルで記述、整列されており、設計者がその時点で最も適した質問を尋ねる（または答える）ことができるようになっている。
（良く考え抜かれ たFAQとはパターン言語のインスタンスか？）
パターン言語を、これから生まれるものを記述するために利用するのではなく、すでに存在するものを記述するために利用する。そのような利用方法が効果的かどうかを試す。
練習問題 ：Rubyはプログラマーを幸福にするプログラミング言語と利用者から考えられているようである。もし、そのように感じているのであれば、プログラマーの立場からプログラミング言語Rubyをパターン言語で記述せよ。

Stephen has been involved with the development of the Linux kernel since its early days .
His work has been primarily on the filesystem and virtual memory code , with miscellaneous contributions all over the kernel .
However he never goes near the network code .
His recent and current projects include several high - end features such as raw I/O , fast zero -copy filesystem I/O and high availability .
Transcript
We had an overview this morning about all the different filesystems in Linux and roughly what different options there are about these days .
I 'm going to just be talking purely about the EXT3 filesystem in general .
I 'll also talk a little bit about some of the specific things that we 've been working on in the virtual memory system that particularly affect journaling filesystems and the work that we 've been doing .
For example , things like allowing filesystems to reserve memory in clean , deadlock - safe ways .
But really the bulk of the talk will be about this EXT3 filesystem and also about some of the ( really about the ) implementation details ; how the internals of the filesystem abstract out the journaling from the actual filesystem operations .
[ 00 m , 54s ]
And why have we done all of this EXT3 stuff anyway ?
Well , really there are several motivations .
First of all , people still like EXT2 ; they still trust EXT2 .
EXT2 is a fairly well proven filesystem .
It does n't have all the bells and whistles of some of the newer filesystems .
It does n't have the small file efficiency of reiserfs .
It does n't have the directory scalability of XFS , but it is a proven workhorse for Linux .
And most importantly , there are a rather lot of users out there who have got existing EXT2 filesystems .
And more every day . [ 01 m , 40s ]
And some of these EXT2 filesystems are getting really rather big .
Even 24 months ago , there were people building 500 gigabyte EXT2 filesystems .
They take a long time to fsck .
I mean , really .
These are filesystems that can take three or four hours just to mkfs .
Doing a consistency check on them is a serious down time .
So the real objective in EXT3 was this simple thing : availability .
When something goes down in EXT3 , we do n't want to have to go through a fsck .
We want to be able to reboot the machine instantly and have everything nice and consistent . [ 02 m , 23s ]
And that 's all it does .
It 's a minimal extension to the existing EXT2 filesystem to add journaling .
And it 's really important , EXT2 is the workhorse filesystem .
It 's the standard stable filesystem .
We do n't want to turn EXT2 into an experimental filesystem .
For one thing , users expect to have EXT2 there as a demonstration of how to code filesystems for Linux .
It 's a small , easily understood filesystem which demonstrates how to do all of the talking to the page cache , which has changed in 2.4 , all of the locking in the directory handling , which has changed in 2.4 .
All of these changes in the VFS interface and the VM interface that filesystems have to deal with are showcased in EXT2 .
So there are multiple reasons why we really do not want to start making EXT2 into an experimental filesystem , adding all sorts of new destabilizing features .
And so the real goal for EXT3 was to provide the minimal changes necessary to provide a complete journaling solution . [ 03 m , 26s ]
So it provides scaling of the disk filesystem size and it allows you to make larger and larger filesystems without the fsck penalty , but it 's not designed to add things like very , very fast , scalable directories ( to Linux ) to EXT2 .
It 's not designed to provide extremely efficient support for extremely large files and extent - mapped files and this type of thing that people have been talking about for EXT2 .
But really the goal is to provide that one piece of functionality alone . [ 03 m , 55s ]
And one of the most important goals for the whole project was to provide absolute , total , complete backwards and forwards compatibility between EXT2 and EXT3 .
You can take an existing EXT2 filesystem , throw a journal file onto it , and mount it as EXT3 .
There , you have a journalled filesystem .
This laptop , I installed Red Hat 6.2 on it , it formats all of these partitions as EXT2 .
I 've added a couple of journal files and now it 's all running EXT3 . [ 04 m , 28s ]
Better yet , if you unmount an EXT3 filesystem , then it marks that filesystem as having been cleanly unmounted .
The journal does n't need to be recovered after a clean remount , so all these extra data structures you get for journaling , for dealing with reboots , are not relevant if the filesystem has been unmounted cleanly .
If you do a clean unmount of an EXT3 filesystem , you can then mount it again as EXT2 and EXT2 just does n't care .
It 's completely compatible in both directions . [ 05 m , 02s ]
If you have an EXT3 filesystem that after a crash , for example , and there 's a journal on there which is active and needs to be replayed onto the filesystem , then in that particular case you need to have recovery .
You can not mount it as EXT2 , because to do so , you would get an inconsistent filesystem .
You would corrupt all of the information that 's in the journal .
So EXT2 has for some time had a set of compatibility bits in the superblock which let you say , for example : what features are in the filesystem ?
So that versions of the kernel which do n't understand a particular feature will not try to mount a filesystem that it can't understand .
So if you 've got an active EXT3 filesystem , the flag set in that superblock which says : do n't you dare mount this as EXT2 ; it 's not compatible .
And EXT2 will cleanly , will be quite careful ; I do n't understand that bit , I 'll refuse to mount it .
But as soon as you 've unmounted it , that bit gets cleared .
[ 05 m , 56s ]
Question ?
You answered it .
Okay .
And similarly the fsprogs , e2fsck can use those bits to work out exactly whether or not this perfectly normal - looking EXT2 filesystem actually has an EXT3 journal and whether or not that journal needs recovery . [ 06 m , 14s ]
So we have complete compatibility , both in terms of the on - disk format , so that an unmounted EXT3 filesystem does look exactly like EXT2 , but also in terms of the functionality .
So all of the existing things that we have in EXT2 ... things like the persistent inode attributes , you can set on an inode .
For example in EXT2 , you can set a directory inode to be synchronous , so that all of the updates on that filesystem have synchronous metadata updates . [ 06 m , 41s ]
And you can set that attribute on a mail spool to get DSD synchronous update compatible behavior for your mail files .
Things like sendmail can make assumptions about consistency after a reboot .
And if you need that kind of consistency , you can do that in EXT2 .
All those attributes are all exactly there in EXT3 , because the EXT3 source code started off by me taking a copy of the entire EXT2 directory and copying it into the directory called ext3 and then doing a global search - and - replace for all occurrences of ext2 and replacing that string with ext3 . [ 07 m , 13s ]
It 's exactly the same source base it started off from .
The only reason it was made into a separate source tree was so that I could have test boxes that run EXT3 development code on my test partition without having to run that same development code on my root filesystem , which kind of made me a little bit nervous .
I did n't want to do that . [ 07 m , 31s ]
So we have EXT3 as a separate filesystem simply for that reason , to isolate the new code from the old , stable code .
But apart from that , I mean it 's exactly the same source base that 's been used for the two .
There 's no loss of existing functionality .
And in particular , the guarantee about journaling consistency covers all of the existing functionality . [ 07 m , 51s ]
So even things like quotas are guaranteed to be consistent after a reboot with journaling .
So if you update a file , write to or extend a file , or truncate a file , the quota operations that go on along side that operation are guaranteed to be consistent with the contents of the quota file .
You never have to run a quota check after a reboot on EXT3 , just as you never have to run a fsck . [ 08 m , 16s ]
There are another couple of subtle issues around recovery which are really not at all handled in any way whatsoever by existing filesystems .
The main one of these is orphaned files .
Orphaned files is this concept that the GFS people were talking about earlier as being a nasty case .
That you can have files which are deleted from the filesystem , but which are still open by processes .
And the semantics are that when that process dies , you want to close and you want to delete the file , remove it from disk , return all the space to the filesystem . [ 08 m , 53s ]
Well , that 's all well and good .
The trouble is that , that filesystem state that has the file ( closed , sorry ) deleted but still open -- that 's a completely consistent state for the filesystem .
So in the first versions of EXT3 , if you have a filesystem in that state , it 's perfectly consistent .
The unlink of that file is a single transaction on the disk .
That transaction did not reclaim the disk space because it did n't need to , the file 's still open .
So we 've got this completely consistent on - disk state in which there is a file which exists on the disk but is n't in the directory structure anywhere .
[ 09 m , 27s ]
Now obviously after a reboot , you can be pretty sure that the reboot also kills a process that had that file open and so we need to preserve the semantics that killing the process deletes the file .
So we have to have some way of dealing with these orphaned files and that 's new functionality that we just do n't have to deal with in EXT2 , because EXT2 assumes that there 's always a filesystem check there to clean up these things after a reboot .
So there are a few things like that in EXT3 that we need to deal with after a reboot to make sure that consistency is complete .
And so , really , this is the goal : absolute consistency of the filesystem in every respect after a reboot , with no loss of existing functionality .
[ 10 m , 08s ]
So how 's it actually implemented internally ?
What does this source look like ?
Well you see the first thing we did is just take the EXT2 filesystem and turn it into EXT3 .
That 's not the only new filesystem subdirectory that the EXT3 patches provide .
EXT3 also provides a new ( subdirectory and ) filesystem directory under the Linux source tree called JFS . [ 10 m , 35s ]
That 's the journaling layer for EXT3 ; and that 's entirely independent of the EXT3 filesystem itself .
It 's a completely abstract journaling layer which allows you to make arbitrary block device modifications in the buffer cache and have those obey transactional semantics .
So that you can make arbitrary transactions on arbitrary block devices and filesystem transactions are just one example of things you can do with that .
[ 10 m , 59s ]
It was explicitly written so that , for example , if you had a logical volume manager which wants to make a number of changes over a number of different block devices and make those changes completely atomic , with respect to reboot .
So that , for example , you are adding a whole pile of logical volumes or you 're deleting a pile of logical volumes and you 're updating it across multiple block devices for a stripe set . [ 11 m , 21s ]
The JFS layer that we added for this is perfectly capable of being used for something like that as well ; it 's not restricted to the EXT3 filesystem .
And in particular the EXT3 filesystem does not know anything about journaling .
Journaling is separate .
EXT3 does n't have the journaling ; all it knows is transactions .
It says : here is the beginning of a set of block device modifications ; I 'm going to modify this block device which contains my filesystem and I 'm going to tell you that these five block device updates form a single transaction .
And it tells that to the journaling layer and the journaling layer is responsible for making sure those five updates either all appear in the block device after a reboot , or none of them appear .
And the journaling is done inside that .
EXT3 does not know about journaling .
[ 12 m , 13s ]
The only places where EXT3 has to interact with the journaling layer are to tell it where these transactions start and stop and which updates belong to which transaction .
And also , to manage the disk space which is used by the inode which contains the journal .
And the journal in the JFS layer can be on any inode in any filesystem or it can be on an arbitrary sub-range , set of contiguous blocks on any block device .
It does n't even have to be on the same device that your filesystem is on .
And you can have multiple filesystems sharing the same journal , if you want .
The JFS layer will cope with all of that .
[ 12 m , 49s ]
The only other thing ... so the only things we have to do is manage the transactions and manage the journal inode .
And one of the things involved in that , is that the filesystem is responsible for asking the journal layer to do journal recovery after an unclean reboot .
And as I said earlier , once you 've done all that , once you 've unmounted the thing , the EXT3 filesystem tells the journaling to close down , clean up the journal and mark everything as consistent .
And once it 's done that and the journaling layer has said : find all of your updates are consistent , and this , the journal has been emptied out ,
The filesystem can then just set a flag in the filesystem that says : okay , we no longer need to recover anything ; do n't worry about the journal and just feel free to mount it as EXT2 .
So that 's basically what we have in the design .
It 's two completely different sets of code ; one that 's the abstract journaling layer and one , a simple set of modifications to EXT3 to add transactions .
[ 13 m , 48s ]
So if we look at this layer that 's adding journaling , what does it look like ?
What does it provide ?
Well what it does is , it exports an API which allows you add transactions onto any block device .
So just as EXT3 does n't understand the first thing about journaling , it does n't need to , the JFS layer does n't understand the first thing about filesystems , it does n't need to .
All of the filesystem properties are dealt with in EXT3 . [ 14 m , 16s ]
All of the journaling is done within the JFS layer .
It provides an abstract concept of a log ; it allows you to register a journal with the JFS layer .
And when you register that journal , you 've got two choices , you can either say : here 's some inode on some filesystem ; please use the contents of this inode as a journal .
That must be a block device filesystem because the JFS layer assumes that it can always do a mapping between an arbitrary block inside that inode and the block on disk . [ 14 m , 50s ]
So it says : create one of these journals , either in an inode on a block device .
It does n't care which you use and you do n't even have to have the journal on the same device that you 're going to be doing the updates on .
So you can have a filesystem over here and journal it to a separate spool disk over there , if you want to .
The JFS layer will be quite happy with that .
In fact , you can even have more than one block device journaling to the same disk , if you want .
The JFS layer is quite happy about that .
[ 15 m , 20s ]
It provides write ordering guarantees .
All the way through the I/O layers in the kernel .
So it makes all these guarantees that , if you have a transaction which is in progress , but has not yet been committed , the JFS layer provides a guarantee that not one update of that particular transaction will hit the main disk until you 've done the commit .
It provides all that guarantee , but it does n't necessarily tell you when the updates will hit the disk .
The JFS ' updates are still write - behind . [ 15 m , 57s ]
So in other words , you 're not doing transactions synchronously ; you 're not saying : well I 'll do all of these updates and that results in the creation of a new directory on the disk .
And then all of the updates I 've made to the disk are committed into the journal and I return . [ 16 m , 12s ]
The JFS layer maintains , in cache , a list of all of the updates which form any particular transaction and it will do , in its own sweet time , the normal write - behind that the buffer layer is already doing on this .
It 'll just write behind in some future time ; we 'll make sure all of those future updates hit the disk .
But it will make guarantees about the ordering , so that when they do hit disk , the transaction is either all there , or not there at all . [ 16 m , 37s ]
Now journaling in many cases is very similar to databases . [ 16 m , 45s ]
[ The speaker calls on an audience member for a question . ]
Does the journaling layer provide an ordering guarantee between transactions ?
Can transaction 47 be ... when you recover , can transaction 47 exist in the recovered state when transaction 46 does not ? [ 17 m , 08s ]
The question is : is there an ordering guarantees in the JFS layer ?
Yes and no .
This is actually a reasonably complicated design issue .
And it 's something which in particular makes a huge amount of difference whether you 're running on a single node filesystem or a shared disk .
It 's one of the reasons that GFS implements things very differently , internally , to EXT3 .
The JFS layer in EXT3 ... its API does not make any guarantees about transaction ordering .
If you have a transaction which updates blocks one , two and three on the disk and another one which updates blocks five , six and seven , the API does n't give you any ordering guarantee between those . [ 18 m , 00s ]
Now on something like GFS , if it 's doing journaling , that 's really important that there 's no ordering guarantee because in GFS , you 've got to be able to release a disk block back to disk as quickly as possible in order to relinquish a lock , which is required by some other node .
On this local disk filesystem , you do n't have that .
So on a local disk filesystem , it 's quite legitimate to batch all these updates off into very large transactions and just send them all out at once .
That works really efficiently . [ 18:36 ]
The only place it breaks down on a local disk is if you 've got synchronous updates .
If you do , for example , an fsync ( ) on a file , or if you open a file as O_SYNC , and in that case if you have absolute write ordering guarantees , then in order to flush this one little file out to disk , say it 's a mail spool , and you 're doing a fsync ( ) for some file that 's just arrived off the network ; in order to sync that to disk , if you 've got write ordering guarantees , then you 've got to sync all previous transactions and commit them to disk as well .
And that 's expensive , because that hurts the latency of those syncs .
It does not change your bandwidth ; it 's actually more efficient in terms of disk bandwidth and throughput to batch your transactions off in large chunks . [ 19 m , 18s ]
So the API that JFS exports does not make any guarantees about write ordering consistency .
Internally , it batches ( all of the transactions ) all of the updates which are made by the filesystem ... it just batches them up sequentially into big , compound transactions and puts them out to disk as a single unit .
So the implementation makes ... does actually happen to preserve write ordering in all cases . [ 19 m , 45s ]
That is not guaranteed by the API , and one of the things that we need to do once the core is out there and being used ... once everything is up and running , including all of the performance stuff that 's still a work in progress , is to do profiling to find out whether or not there are applications which really do need to have fine - grained committing of transactions , so that when you fsync ( ) , you just ... you know you 've got transactions three , four , five , six and seven , and transaction six suddenly becomes related to an fsync ( ) , so you have to commit that one .
Does it actually make a difference to performance to be able to commit transaction six without having to commit transactions three to five ?
If that turns out to be the case , then I will be able to do that in the future without changing the API .
The API does n't make that guarantee ; it 's just an optimization internally .
[ 20 m , 36s ]
But apart from that whole , the right ordering guarantees are made and how it does this is fairly simple .
Journaling filesystems are , in most cases , very closely related to database journaling .
But with some very , very special cases .
In databases , typically a locking database is characterized by the steps it has to go through to recover the state of the database after a crash .
And it 's characterized by whether you have to do undo's or redo's . [ 21 m , 19s ]
So in the case of an undo logging , that means that what you do is that you put into the journal all of the old state of the buffers that you 're modifying and then you can write the new state to the disk .
And if you crash before the transaction is committed , then you can undo the modifications you made on disk by copying the old contents from the log .
So that the log contains the information necessary to undo incomplete transactions . [ 21 m , 46s ]
Or you can do redo logging , which is that the new data is written into the log and you leave the original data on the disk , in its main location .
And then after a crash , any transactions which are incomplete , the original copy is still on disk , so you do n't have to do anything .
And it 's only complete transactions which exist in the log and you have to replay those into the main filesystem . [ 22 m , 08s ]
In almost all cases , journaling filesystems just use simple case of doing redo logging .
So basically every single modification that 's made to the filesystem will be written to the log first .
And only once it 's committed to the log , not just written in the log , but committed to the log , are we allowed to update the main copy on disk .
And that 's ( what EXT2 does ) what EXT3 does , so all of those write ordering guarantees are provided by the JFS layer . [ 22 m , 36s ]
So that JFS layer controls these various , different things .
It controls transaction commit and the commit of a transaction involves writing all of the things which that transaction modified to the journal , and then writing a commit record .
It 's not sufficient just to write the thing to the journal , because there 's got to be some mark in the journal which says : well , ( has this journal record actually ) does this journal record actually represent a complete consistency to the disk ?
And the way you do that is by having some atomic operation which marks that transaction as being complete on disk . [ 23 m , 14s ]
Now , disks these days actually make these guarantees .
If you start a write operation to a disk , then even if the power fails in the middle of that sector write , the disk has enough power available , and it can actually steal power from the rotational energy of the spindle ; it has enough power to complete the write of the sector that 's being written right now .
In all cases , the disks make that guarantee . [ 23 m , 41s ]
So the fundamental thing about transactions are : at the end of writing the new contents of the transaction to the log , we write a single 512 - byte sector to the disk , which contains whatever magic numbers to identify as it as a particular type of block ; so say this is a commit block and it will contain a sequence number that matches all of the transactions that have gone previously , so that it does n't get confused between that , what you 've been writing there , and the old contents of the log , previously . [ 24 m , 14s ]
That single write of that one sector on disk marks the entire transaction as being complete .
And so all of that write ordering , the write ordering within the journal , that says that the journal has to be written and complete on disk before you have to write the commit record ... that 's all handled by JFS .
The write ordering that says : you have to write the commit record before you write any of the blocks back to the main filesystem .
That 's all handled by the JFS . [ 24 m , 38s ]
Obviously there 's only a limited amount of space in that log .
So the old transaction checkpointing ...
Checkpointing is the process of flushing all the contents of the log out to the main disk .
That 's handled by the JFS layer and that 's actually really important , because if you think about it , the transaction is committed on disk as soon as we 've written that commit record in the log .
But once that commit record has been written to the log , the only copy of the data that the transaction has just written is in the log ; the main copy on disk still has the old version , so we cannot throw away that data in the log until we have written it , copied it back , onto disk .
And that 's called checkpointing .
[ 25 m , 19s ]
That 's what allows us to re-use bits of the log .
We take the contents of the log , make sure the copies on disk are all up - to - date , and at that point , we can trim the tail of the log .
All of that is handled by the JFS layer .
All of the write - behind is handled by the JFS layer .
It has its own set of timeouts and links itself into the buffer cache write - behind layers and so all of that is handled completely transparently to the filesystem .
And also , the JFS layer , for performance reasons , tries to make everything go as asynchronously as possible .
It never stalls things ; it never tries to do more copies than it needs to .
[ 25 m , 55s ]
So , for example , when we 're doing journaling , the filesystem may say : take some buffer that 's in memory and I 'm going to write this to disk for that application there and journal it .
And the journaling code has to make sure that block gets written to the journal first , and then , after the commit , it goes to its main location on disk .
And the journaling layer will do zero - copy from that ; it will actually create a new I / O request that points to the old disk buffer location and use that to journal the data to the journal file , without copying the data block .
Now all that kind of thing is handled by the JFS layer . [ 26 m , 33s ]
[ The speaker calls on an audience member for a question . ]
The question is : does it make sense under extreme memory pressure to throw away data that 's been written to the journal , but has n't yet been written to disk .
Absolutely not , because if it 's written into the journal and you want to throw it away , it 's much , much more efficient to just write it to disk than doing anything else .
Actually on the next slides , I 'll talk about reservations , which are the way that you limit the amount of outstanding data that 's being used by the transaction layer at any point in time .
And that reservation system is sufficient to reduce the memory pressure . [ 27 m , 21s ]
[ The speaker calls on an audience member for a question . ]
So the two questions : first of all , the sector size that the disks guarantee to be atomic is smaller than ( the sector size ) the block size the filesystem uses .
Yes , but for the commit block , I only ever care about the first 512 bytes of that block .
If the commit block 's first 512 bytes are up - to - date on disk , then that 's assumed to mean ( the sector , sorry ) the entire transaction is committed .
And you have to be very , very careful not to have critical commit information that spans a 512 - byte sector boundary .
As for write ordering , absolutely .
We need to make sure that even when we submit multiple async I/O requests to the disk , the disk does n't allow us the write to reorder things in such a way as that the commit block hits the disk before the other transaction blocks .
And I will come back to that point , because it 's actually a really nasty point for performance .
( I 'll come back to that , yes . ) [ 28 m , 36s ]
One other thing that I 'll say about this in terms of asynchronous behavior is that the journaling layer is really careful ...
( Ah , come back . )
The journaling layer is really careful to make sure that things do n't stall unnecessarily .
So that means that when we start committing a transaction , ( we do n't stop ) we do n't stall the filesystem itself .
And committing a transaction means that we take , okay , I 'm going to take a snapshot of the entire filesystem state at this point in time and I 'll start committing that state to disk .
But the filesystem is still allowed to make new copies of the data .
The filesystem is still allowed to modify the virtual block device in the buffer cache .
While it does that , we have to keep the old contents of that snapshot present in memory , so that we can commit it to disk . [ 29 m , 41s ]
And so in that particular case , the JFS layer provides a copy - on - write mechanism so that if a new filesystem request comes along , that wants to modify a block that we are in the process of committing but have n't finished committing , then we make a copy of that before the filesystem is allowed to modify the buffer .
And that means that the disk I/O for committing a previous transaction can go on in parallel with the filesystem operations for the new transaction .
That is one of the things we do in the JFS layer to make sure that the concurrency of the system is as high as possible .
There are no synchronous transactions in the JFS layer , at all .
The only way you can get something synchronous is if you say : well I actually want the application to wait until this thing is on disk because the application has done something like an fsync ( ) . [ 30 m , 28s ]
So JFS provides all this functionality and it provides it to the user , where in this case the user is something like the LVM layer or in this case , the EXT3 layer .
And it has a nice abstract API for exporting this functionality .
Everything is expressed in terms , not of transactions , but of handles and to make this distinction clear , a handle represents one single operation that marks a consistent set of updates on the disk . [ 30 m , 59s ]
So a handle might be something like a create and the create has to go through a directory , add a directory entry to that directory , modify the timestamp on that directory , modify the size of the directory ; it has to allocate a new inode , and it then has to modify the inode table for that ; it has to modify the superblock to change the number of inodes in that group in the superblock ; and it has to mark the inode bitmap as being changed .
And all of these operations for a single , consistent operation update in the filesystem are done with a single handle . [ 31 m , 37s ]
But a handle is not necessarily the same thing as the journaling transaction on disk , because the journaling layer will allow multiple updates like this to be batched into a single transaction .
So , to make this distinction quite clear , the transaction on the disk is not necessarily the same as ( the handles ) the updates the filesystem is doing .
And that means that because we are doing write - behind , we may be making only one filesystem commit every five seconds , and you can have hundreds and hundreds of filesystem operations proceeding in that time scale .
So everything can be batched up very efficiently using these handles . [ 32 m , 16s ]
Now the API has a journal start and a journal stop pair .
A journal start gives you a handle .
A journal stop tells the system that handle is finished with .
It provides nested transactions , so if you do a journal start and then another journal start , that all gets batched into the same transaction .
And the handle is not marked as complete until you 've gone through two journal stops in that case . [ 32 m , 42s ]
When you do that journal start , you have to tell the JFS layer how many blocks you expect might be modified by this update .
That 's really , really important .
This is absolutely critical , to avoid deadlocking in the journal .
The JFS layer has to know ( before it starts committing your transaction , sorry ) before it starts processing your transaction that there is enough space left in the journal to write out all of the blocks which might become part of your transaction . [ 33 m , 14s ]
And if it turns out there 's not enough log space left , well it might be that your transaction includes blocks from previous transactions in the journal .
And because these blocks are now being pinned as part of a new transaction , we can't flush them to disk .
And because we can't flush them to disk , we can't checkpoint the log to remove one of the old transactions from the log .
And because we 've run out of space , we 're just deadlocked completely . [ 33 m , 36s ]
So we have to make these kind of reservations to make sure the transaction does not start until all of the space that it might use is guaranteed present in the log .
So the journal start / journal stop provide boundaries to make that sort of reservation guarantees . [ 33 m , 50s ]
There 's a question at the back .
[ The speaker calls on an audience member for a question . ]
The question is : what happens if there 's not enough space physically in the journal for the transaction ?
Transactions are very limited in size ; they 're never more than a few dozen blocks .
The only two cases where a transaction can grow without bounds are for write system calls , because writes can actually ... an application can quite legitimately write a half gigabyte of memory to a file in one syscall . [ 34 m , 22s ]
That 's okay because EXT3 does not guarantee that write is atomic .
That 'll be broken up into multiple , smaller transactions .
And the only other case is truncate , because you might have a ten gigabyte file that you 're deleting and you really want that delete to be an atomic operation , but that delete can touch arbitrary amounts of disk space .
Potentially you have one separate bitmap block ; in the most fragmented case in the filesystem , you 'd have a separate bitmap block being updated on the disk for every single block that you free from that file .
So truncates are special case which I 'll come to later , because we have to deal with that in a nasty manner . [ 35 m , 00s ]
Actually , ask any of the journaling filesystem people in the audience : what 's the hideous part of the entire system .
And it 's deleting files .
Everything to do with delete is hairy .
Everything to do with delete ... you have nightmares around what happens if blocks get deleted and then reallocated . [ 35 m , 22s ]
What happens if they get reallocated with a different type of data ?
What happens if you reallocate them and then take a crash and have to undo the reallocation and undo the delete operation ?
And they really get nasty . [ 35 m , 33s ]
So most of the problems in EXT3 , most of the hairy parts of the design , as in most journaling filesystems , in fact , come from deletes .
All of the block updates that the filesystem makes after this time go through a pair of ( system calls , sorry ) journaling calls exported by the JFS .
You can ask the journal to give you write access to a block and remember I said earlier that to ensure efficiency in the system , we do copy - on - write .
If there 's a block ( being journalled , sorry ) being scheduled for commit , then we do n't mind the filesystem continuing to modify that block as long as we have a chance to copy it out and make sure that the old snapshot that we 're committing is still consistent . [ 36 m , 14s ]
And to achieve that copy - on - write , we have to know what the filesystem is going to modify before it modifies it .
So you have to go through a process of getting permission to write a block , just to make sure that copy - on - write can happen .
And then at the end of it , we can say : okay , that block has now been finished , it 's now been dirtied ; it can now be written to a journal or whatever . [ 36 m , 33s ]
This API provides the reservation , it provides ... the handles you get back from this journaling , you can mark individual handles as being synchronous before the journal stop .
And when the final journal stop happens and that transaction ( is committed to the disk , sorry ) is bundled up for the current transaction on disk , it will immediately submit that commit to the disk , and will synchronously wait for that commit to finish on disk before returning .
So you can get synchronous operation on a per-handle basis . [ 37 m , 03s ]
And it also provides various ... the JFS layer provides various kind of management functions for creating a journal , doing recovery of a journal , marking a journal as being complete , flushing a journal out to disk , things like that .
You need that inside EXT3 .
For example , if an EXT3 filesystem that 's read - write gets mounted read - only .
If you remount it read - only , you want to make sure that , beyond that point , no more updates happen to the filesystem .
You want to make sure that nothing else happens in the journal .
You also want to make sure that there 's no recovery necessary on that filesystem .
If you take a reboot while the filesystem is marked read - only .
So all of the consistency functions necessary to flush everything out and stop further writes when you get one of these remounts .
All of these kinds of functions are exported by the JFS layer . [ 37 m , 52s ]
The important thing about this API is that all of the updates that we 're making are expressed in terms of : here is a block , here is the new contents of that buffer on disk .
We 're doing physical journaling .
Now there 's some filesystems that do journaling which do logical journaling and that means that , for example , if they allocate a particular disk block to a particular file , they 'll write an entry in the journal that says : this disk block ( is marked free , sorry ) is marked in use .
And this file has a mapping pointer pointing to that disk block .
And that description for that allocation might only be a few bytes long .
EXT3 will journal the entire copy of the blocks that have been modified , all 1 K , 4 K , whatever , of the blocks . [ 38 m , 43s ]
But it does n't do any copy when it 's doing that , so the CPU overhead is minimal and in particular , if you have got a lot of operations that touch the same blocks , that block only gets journalled once .
And that means that this is a very , very simple mechanism which gives you completely free compression of multiple events .
So , for example , you almost never get a disk block allocated in a single commit operation .
If the commits are going every five seconds , then if you only had one block allocated within that five second boundary , then it 's no big deal to write out 4 K ; to mark that block in use .
But , as is more likely , you 've got hundreds and hundreds of allocations going in rapid succession . [ 39 m , 24s ]
All of the bitmap blocks , all of the bits in the bitmaps which are being updated only result in one copy of the new block being sent to disk .
So it 's actually a fairly efficient way of compressing these kind of multiple operations ... multiple directory operations or multiple allocations within a single block group ; they can all be compressed fairly efficiently down to the disk .
There are different types of buffer that you can pass through into the JFS layer .
Now this is getting into the issue about : are we journaling every operation on the disk , or are we only journaling metadata ?
Right now , the current version of EXT3 that 's in public release : EXT3 is ( journaling all metadata , sorry ) journaling metadata and data .
So every file that you write is being written twice ; it 's being written once to the log and once to the main disk .
The design goal is obviously not to do that . [ 40 m , 19s ]
So the design is that you can have metadata being journalled , but the data itself just gets written back to the disk any old way .
Now if you do that , a whole pile of new ordering constraints come in .
And guess what ... they all have to do with delete .
Except for one . [ 40 m , 43s ]
The only one that does n't have to do with delete is : what happens if you allocate a whole pile of data , write it to disk , and then take a crash ?
Well , if you take a crash and then recover the state of that journal and replay all of the allocations to disk , but the data has not yet been written to disk , then the user can read those disk locks and get old , stale contents of what was previously there on the disk .
And that might be an old copy of /etc / passwd or some other file you do n't really want the user poking around in . [ 41 m , 11s ]
So for security , you really want to make sure that newly - allocated data blocks ( will get committed , sorry ) will get flushed to the disk before the transaction which allocates them is allowed to commit .
So we have this concept of data blocks and that write ordering guarantee for data blocks is preserved by the JFS layer . [ 41 m , 30s ]
Then there are a whole pile of other things that can go wrong .
Well , I can have a directory which is deleted ; I can delete a directory and that is a perfectly legitimate operation in EXT2 .
And I can do that and I can commit that delete to disk and then I can have a new transaction which reallocates those same data blocks , which are now free , and puts them into a file .
And I can commit that .
And everything is now consistent . [ 41 m , 58s ]
Except what happens if I take a reboot ?
Well what happens is that we do a reboot and the log gets replayed and we go through the journal , replay all the metadata blocks that are in that log .
Well , actually , this directory that we deleted a few transactions back , we made a new entry in that directory and there 's a metadata block for that directory entry on the journal , but we do n't journal data .
So that the new contents of that data block , which are on the main disk , are n't in the journal .
And so we take a crash and we replay and we overwrite that data block with the old contents of the directory block , because that 's all that 's in the journal .
This is generally considered bad behavior .
[ The audience laughs . ] [ 42 m , 40s ]
So we need to have ways of dealing with that , so we need to be able to have revoke records .
There are various different ways of dealing with this ; you can deal with it by making certain delete operations synchronous , you can do it by making sure that you do n't reuse disk blocks until you 've checkpointed that old record out of the journal .
The way we 're doing that in EXT3 is that deleting metadata can cause a revoke record to be written into the journal .
And when you do the replay of the journal , the very first pass of the journal recovery , we look for all of the revoke records and make sure that any data that 's been revoked is never , ever replayed .
And so that deals with that particular case . [ 43 m , 20s ]
There are much worse things that could happen in journaling with deletes .
For example , what happens if you have a piece of metadata that 's in your directory and you 've deleted that and you 've reallocated that as data ?
And because you 're reallocating it as data , well we have this property that we flush all the data to the disk before we commit the transaction .
So we flush this data to the disk and then before we 've committed this transaction , we take a power failure .
And we have to reboot .
And we do log recovery .
And guess what ?
The operation which deleted that directory was n't committed , so we 've revoked that delete , so we 've basically undeleted that directory . [ 44:06 ]
Unfortunately , actually we had thought we were going to reallocate that directory as data , we 've already flushed the data to disk and overwritten the directory that we 've actually just had to undelete .
Whoops .
So we have to make sure that we avoid that kind of thing .
And there are , again , various ways of doing that .
The way that this works in EXT3 , is that the journaling layer provides the filesystem with the ability to record the last committed state of the bitmap block .
And the filesystem can then use that to make sure that , when it is allocating data , it never , ever reuses the data block that has been freed in the bitmaps but that freeing has n't yet been committed . [ 44 m , 49s ]
So there are all these little tricky things that happen around delete .
And all of the write ordering constraints the JFS layer has enough infrastructure in there to support to the filesystem for getting this thing right .
But the JFS layer does n't understand anything about the difference between these different types of data , it just has ordering guarantees which the filesystem can use to make sure that metadata - only journaling does actually work right .
That is actually all implemented , but the current EXT3 does n't use it .
It 's not enabled for the simple reason that these write ordering constraints are really tricky to get right .
And the priority has been to make sure that the core , rest of the EXT3 code is rock solid , before we start introducing all of these weird and wonderful new bits and pieces . [ 45 m , 28s ]
A few other things that we have in the JFS layer , there .
It supports nested transactions .
Now this is what we were saying earlier , that if you have journal start and you get another operation which does a journal start , well you can do that quite happily .
The nested transactions allow you ...
This was really implemented for quota files . [ 45 m , 50s ]
Now if anyone 's familiar with the Linux VFS there , they 'll realize the quota system that EXT2 uses is not inside the EXT2 filesystem , it 's actually a generic quota utility layer in the Linux VFS .
And the Linux VFS ( has ) exports functions that the filesystems can use , so the filesystem can say : okay , I 've allocated a disk block ; please update this quota record accordingly .
And the Linux VFS will say : okay , fine , there 's enough quota left for you to do that ; that 's quite legal ; please go ahead with that and I 'll make sure that the appropriate quota record on some arbitrary file is updated .
And as far as the VFS layer 's concerned , the quota is just a regular file .
And it makes write calls to the filesystem to update the quota file . [ 46 m , 38s ]
Now if you want to make quota updates consistent with the rest of the transactions , you actually need those write calls that VFS is making to be part of the same transaction that the allocation on disk was part of .
You have to make sure they 're consistent ; you have to make sure that the quota file update is always part of the same transaction as the allocation that 's ( doing that ) modifying it .
And by using nested transactions , this comes as free . [ 47 m , 03s ]
The write system call starts the transaction .
It calls the quota layer ; the quota layer does another write .
That new write for the quota file starts a transaction , but it gets a nested transaction inside the first one , modifies the quota file , completes the transaction .
And only when the whole operation is finished do we mark that as being a complete transaction on the disk .
So this quota file stuff , it just came for free .
And it turns out that this is actually quite useful .
There are applications out there that want to be able to use nested transactions in the filesystem . [ 47 m , 31s ]
And one in particular that 's already using this is the InterMezzo filesystem that Ted talked about earlier .
It 's a distributed filesystem that has a local disk cache for caching files on the hard disk locally .
And there 's a coherency protocol that the various different nodes in this InterMezzo network use to communicate with each other to say : okay , I have an updated ...
I 've got a newer copy of this particular file ; I 'll propagate it to all the other servers ; I 'm about to modify this copy of the file , so I 'm going to invalidate the servers ' copies ; and all that type of thing .
InterMezzo supports disconnected operation . [ 48 m , 07s ]
If I have populated my local disk cache with copies of the main server 's in InterMezzo , then I can put that on my laptop and take it away , go to this conference , have all of my e-mail on that ; have all of my other stuff on that ; and then I get back home , I can plug it into the network and everything gets replayed .
And the disconnected operation is really powerful . [ 48 m , 29s ]
But that means that the local disk cache ... there has to be a way of recording what has changed in the local disk cache so that when we do reconnect to the rest of the network , we can replay what 's changed .
And InterMezzo actually uses EXT3 for this , to get very , very high performance in the local disk cache .
Because it creates a nested transaction and say I 'm running a disconnected operation and I 'm making a new file on my filesystem .
InterMezzo will create that new file in its disk cache and will update a journal file that InterMezzo maintains to say : this inode over here has been created in the InterMezzo filesystem with such - and - such a filename and it belongs to this particular place in the cache . [ 49 m , 13s ]
And InterMezzo really wants to make sure that the contents of its log , of its replay log , match what 's actually on the filesystem cache .
And it can use EXT3 for that ; it can use a nested transaction .
It will start a nested transaction , create the file , write an update record to its replay log stating that file has been created .
And it gets normal write - behind so there 's no synchronous updates on disk .
It 's fully asynchronous write - behind performance to that local disk cache but after a crash , it guarantees that that replay log is exactly consistent with the actual state of the disk cache .
So InterMezzo is using these nested transactions ; it 's proven very , very useful for them . [ 49 m , 52s ]
Now we get to some of these other awkward little things .
Orphaned files , as I said earlier , if we have a file which has been unlinked on disk , but is still open , then on the reboot , we need to make sure that file is deleted .
EXT3 adds a new data structure on the disk .
It has an entry in the superblock which points to a linked list of inodes on disk which need to be deleted on reboot .
And whenever you unlink an open file , it gets added on to that list .
And when you finally close that file , the delete operation which happens as a result of that close will remove the inode from that list . [ 50 m , 37s ]
I said earlier that truncate operations also can have unbounded transaction sizes .
Well that 's okay ; if you get a truncate operation which exhausts the size of the journal , then that truncate will be split up into more than one transaction .
But we still guarantee that that 's atomic over a reboot , because if we have to split up one of these truncates over multiple transactions , we put it on exactly the same orphaned file list .
And so in recovery , you can do all the cleanup .
It basically means that when you do recovery , we look at the number of links , the number of hard links for that file in the inode list , and if the number of links is zero , we know it 's a file that 's just been deleted and we delete it .
We finish doing the delete .
if the number of links is greater than zero , we know it must have been in the middle of a truncate , and so we complete the truncate operation .
So all of that kind of gets done at the EXT3 level ; that can not be done inside the journaling level . [ 51 m , 33s ]
VM reservations ... journaling has this unfortunate property that if you have a transaction that 's in progress , you cannot free the memory that transaction is occupying without first allowing that transaction to complete .
Because unlike databases , most filesystems do not implement transaction aborts .
It 's just not something which is normally needed in a filesystem .
And if you 're not going to be able to abort a transaction , then you have to let the transactions run to completion .
And if we 're going to let the transactions run to completion , you have to have enough memory to do that .
And if the VM system is saying : well I can't give you any more memory right now until you give me back some ; then you can deadlock very , very rapidly . [ 52 m , 18s ]
So we need to have a way of doing VM , virtual memory , ( transaction reservations , sorry ) page reservations , so that the filesystem does n't use more memory than the VM layer is able to give back independently .
And it turns out that this is a relatively trivial thing to add to the EXT3 filesystem , because journaling filesystems already do the same kind of reservation in the log .
So one of the things that the VM developers and the journaling filesystem developers have been talking about recently , is how to add an API to the virtual memory layer which allows the filesystems to tell the VM about the reservations it 's making and to make sure that we never run into these deadlock situations . [ 52 m , 57s ]
There are also some tricky corners about write pressure .
For example , if you 've filled too much memory with dirty data , and it 's proving impossible to clear stuff out of memory , because all of the pages in memory are dirty and need to be written to disk first , then we need to , at that point , stop making more dirty data .
We also need to start cleaning the existing dirty pages back to disk .
Now the filesystem has its own write ordering constraints .
It can not let the VM arbitrarily decide to write these things back to disk . [ 53 m , 33s ]
But the VM is the only part of the system that knows when this write pressure is getting excessive .
So we have to have callbacks into the journaling filesystem which let the VM say : well , hey , you 've got all these dirty pages , I want to start writing them back .
But the filesystem has got to be able to say : well , actually these dirty pages are pinned in memory because of transactions , but I 've got pages over here that I can free .
So we want to have callbacks from the virtual memory system into the filesystem .
Purely advisory callbacks , so that the VM can say : I have found all these dirty pages which I want you to get rid of , but if you can't do it , I do n't care as long as you find something to get rid of . [ 54 m , 10s ]
And once you 've got that kind of advisory callback , dumb naive filesystems like FAT or EXT2 can say to the VM : okay , you told me to write this page back and I 'll do it .
Where advanced filesystems that do journaling can use that as an indication that we need to do some write pressure and can choose the most appropriate pages to get rid of , because they know what the write ordering constraints are .
So all of these little tricks that we need to do between the VM and the VFS ... hopefully we 'll get a lot of that in before 2.4 is released .
And that will allow the clean merging of a whole class of different journalled filesystems that have exactly the same ordering constraints that the VM is n't aware of right now . [ 54 m , 43s ]
And then finally , we 've got this write ordering constraint at the SCSI level .
Which our man in front was talking about .
Right now , the only way that we can do commits safely , is by waiting for the disk to tell us that the entire transaction has hit disk .
And only then will you give the commit block to the disk . [ 55 m , 08s ]
[ There is a comment from the audience . ]
That 's on media ; not just on disk , because there 's lots of media .
Yes , on media .
Well if a disk has got write - behind battery - backed cache , then that 's fine ; we do n't care what kind of media ... as long as it's made persistent .
As long as the log updates can be made persistent , then we can allow the commit block to go to disk .
It turns out that SCSI has a very nice feature called tagged command queueing .
You can have a whole pile of disk operations , disk writes , outstanding on the disk at once , and the disk can do them in any order it cares .
And it will just tell you that it 's finished in whatever order it happens to choose . [ 55 m , 47s ]
There is a bit in the SCSI command called ordered tag .
You can actually set an ordered tag bit in the tagged command queue and that is a write barrier to the SCSI layer .
The SCSI layer will guarantee , the SCSI disk will guarantee , that no writes that you submitted before that ordered operation will overtake it .
And that no writes submitted after it will be sent to disk before that operation .
And if we have , in the block device I/O layer , if we have a way of specifying that barrier operation , saying : this is a commit block , do n't reorder this block ; reorder anything inside of it , but do n't reorder this one ... if we can set that in the block device layer so that the Linux internal device reordering queues and the disk 's reordering queues all observe and honor that barrier operation , then we can keep the pipeline going to the disk , streaming the data to the disk at full speed , without waiting synchronously for the completion of these transactions . [ 56 m , 59s ]
And that becomes really important for a few special cases .
That becomes really important if you 're synchronously committing a lot of fast transactions to disk .
And there are cases where that really happens .
Mail spools and NFS servers ... the two canonical examples .
Mail spools are constantly updating lots of small files and they want to do an fsync ( ) after each one to make sure they do n't tell the sender that the mail has been received until the disk has recorded the fact that it 's safe on disk . [ 57 m , 25s ]
And in the case of NFS , NFSv2 or NFSv1 servers are expected not to acknowledge the write to disk until it 's safe on disk .
Because the whole point of NFS recovery is that , if the server crashes , the client will replay any of the commands that were n't acknowledged by the server .
But anything that was acknowledged by the server is assumed to be safe on disk .
And therefore , the server ... if that 's to work over a server crash , the server can't acknowledge the NFS commands until it 's safe on disk , which means that the NFS server is typically doing large numbers of very small data writes , synchronously . [ 58 m , 00s ]
And in EXT3 , we want to be able to have those writes spooling sequentially to a separate disk , which is the journal disk .
Remember that the journal will not necessarily have to be in the same disk as the filesystem .
So we want to just be able to spool this stuff sequentially onto the journal disk at full speed and having to wait for all of the log to be written before you submit the commit request , the commit I/O , typically means that you 're wasting a whole rotational latency in the disk , whenever you 're doing a commit .
If we can get these write barriers right through the Linux I/O layers , that really , really improves the performance of these streaming synchronous I / Os .
That 's one thing that 's on the cards , it will probably not get into 2.4 , but the I/O layers in Linux will hopefully have this in 2.5 . [ 58 m , 46s ]
[ The speaker calls on an audience member ] .
Another question here ?
Well actually , it 's a comment .
You 're assuming that the write ordering implementation in the firmware on the disk actually is functional .
I 'm assuming that the write ordering on the firmware of the disk is functional , correct .
I assume that when the disk says that it 's written something ...
[ Someone comments in background . ]
Oh yes , I know ...
We have got , we will only enable this with either a white list or a black listed set of drives .
We 've already got drive blacklists in the kernel for things that lie hideously ...
Absolutely , that will not be a default behavior ; we have to be very careful about that . [ 59 m , 27s ]
So the status on this .
The core of EXT3 is ... the one I 'm running on the laptop here is absolutely robust ; there are no known problems in that .
Some of the kind of user interface issues are not quite 100 % .
If you delete the journal or you give it an invalid journal inode or things like that , then the actual setup of the journaling can sometimes get a bit confused , but those are management issues surrounding the user level tools which are being used to manage that .
[ 59 m , 56s ]
The user level tools is the main thing that we 're working on right now .
And the metadata - only journaling .
The actual core filesystem is rock solid .
It 's being used in production web / FTP servers for multiple tens - of - gigabyte filesystems ; I trust it absolutely with the laptop here and given the status of some of the device drivers that have been running on this laptop recently , it 's rather convenient to have the ability to reboot very , very quickly .
[ The audience laughs . ] [ 60 m , 25s ]
The e2fsprogs has at the minute ... it has minimal support for EXT3 , but it is there .
It will understand the presence of the recovery bits in the journal bits and will do appropriate things , at least in as much as it will not touch a filesystem that it does n't know how to touch .
And it will not complain about the existence of a journal if the journal happens to be there , but does not need recovery . [ 60 m , 51s ]
So there is ongoing work for things like the metadata - only journaling .
The infrastructure in the JFS for that is all implemented except for the revoke records ; the current superblock format , the journal format , does not have revoke records .
That 's the only thing that needs to be added before I can enable all of that support . [ 61 m , 13s ]
The quota stuff is in there .
It has not been fully tested .
I know there are people using it , but it's not tested as much as the rest of the code , so I need to have more testing done on that before I recommend it as being stable . [ 61 m , 27s ]
e 2fsprogs , e2fsck , we already have prototype code in e2fsprogs , e2fsck , in the development branch for doing log replay .
The one thing that 's missing from that right now is the replay of the orphan lists .
Once that 's all done , we will have a fully functioning e2fsck , which wo n't require any kernel support . [ 61 m , 48s ]
And there are a couple other things which are being worked on .
For example , I 'm going to be moving the journal from being a regular file to being a reserved file and have a tune2 fs function which will allow you to add an arbitrarily sized journal inode to an existing EXT2 filesystem , without it appearing in the filesystem namespace and therefore ( without it polluting , sorry ) without it tempting people to delete it and nasty things like that . [ 62 m , 14s ]
So that 's basically where we 're at right now .
The current core EXT3 is stable ; it does journal data and therefore it has poor write performance for write - intensive operations .
But it is reliable , and it will run ... it can be added transparently to any existing EXT2 filesystem .
That will be maintained as a stable branch while I 'm merging in the metadata - only journaling .
So there will be a development branch .
This is all 2.2 ; the 2.4 port will only happen once all this is stable because it's not possible to achieve a sufficiently high level of reliability if you 're changing too many things at one time .
It just makes it so much harder to maintain and debug . [ 63 m , 00s ]
There are some things which I 'm leaving until after the first complete stable release .
And that is , in particular , although the JFS layer understands off - disk journaling and understands multiple block devices sharing the same journal , there are a number of really nasty management issues in terms of administration of that kind of environment . [ 63 m , 23s ]
Like , what happens if you 've got ten filesystems sharing the same off - disk journal and on reboot , one of those filesystems dies ?
Well you can't actually start reusing the contents of your journal until you 've done all of the recovery .
And you can't do all of the recovery until you 've got all of the filesystems mounted or at least finished ... at least until you 've found all of the filesystems that use that journal .
And if one of those filesystems has disappeared , you can't do recovery onto that filesystem , so therefore you can't start re-using the journal . [ 63 m , 52s ]
Therefore all of the other filesystems which are sharing the same journal go south .
So it 's a little problem .
We have to do things like making sure that the recovery code has the ability to untangle the different bits of a journal into a separate file and store that in the temp directory somewhere , so that when that missing filesystem gets found later on , we can do the recovery then . [ 64 m , 17s ]
There are all sorts of little things like that that we have to deal with when you 've got off - disk journals and shared journals ; which just do n't ever come into the picture if you 're journaling on the same device the filesystem is on .
So that will probably be a post 1.0 issue and one other thing that I want to do is to actually export the nested transaction API into userspace .
You have to be very , very careful about that because it 's not possible to guarantee proper database semantics .
You can't have unbounded , large transactions .
You have to have some way in which the user application can get in advance some idea of how many disk blocks it 's going to need to modify for the operation , because it 's going to call various things like that which are not entirely straight forward ; it 's not quite as simple as people would hope .
But it 's sufficiently useful that that will be exported to userspace at some point . [ 65 m , 07s ]
That 's all to solve for EXT3 .
EXT3 is not the only thing that 's going on with EXT2 .
There are other things that are happening in the EXT2 filesystem space as separate development branches ; much like EXT3 is a development branch off of EXT2 .
And it 's likely that some number of these will be merged into a single , new EXT2 variant sometime in the future .
There are people increasingly hammering for security support .
Access control lists , mandatory access control labels , capabilities ... all that type of thing .
There are people who really want that in Linux . [ 65 m , 40s ]
There are proposals from the US Department of Defense that will forbid them from purchasing any operating system which does not have ( these facilities ) these capabilities .
And they have been trying to persuade the US Government to adopt the same rules .
Although they are resisting that . [ 66 m , 00s ]
There 's B - Tree support .
B - Trees are fairly complicated on - disk structures .
There are people who want to have B - Tree support ( in Linux ) in EXT2 , for scalable directory performance .
But B - Trees can go really horribly haywire if you interrupt them in the middle of a tree balancing operation .
And so making them consistent over a reboot either requires that you 're very , very careful and do lots of extra I/O in the disk structure to make sure that it can be recovered sanely , or you do journaling . [ 66 m , 26s ]
In fact , there 's a whole section of code inside reiserfs which was dealing with exactly this issue .
Which has basically been eliminated from the filesystem now that they 've got journaling , because journaling deals with all that for them .
Putting B - Trees into EXT3 really requires JFS as a prerequisite . [ 66 m , 47s ]
Online resize is being done for EXT2 .
And there are a number of other minimally intrusive extensions that ... EXT2 has this advantage of being a very nice , simple filesystem .
And you can do B - Tree extent maps inside your files as a very efficient way of encoding large files on your disk .
Now you do n't actually have to use B - Trees for that .
If you do n't use B - Trees , you can just have a very simple extent map structure on the disk , which maps entire contiguous extents of on - disk blocks for a single file in just a few bytes in the directory structures in the inode . [ 67 m , 23s ]
That is all well and good until you start doing things like having holes in the files and then wanting to write into the middle of those holes .
Once you do that , then you 're having to shuffle around all of your extent maps and so on .
And that gets really complicated ; that 's normally why people want B - Trees for extent maps .
If you 're willing to forego with the ability to write into holes into your filesystem , you do n't need B - Trees for your extent maps . [ 67 m , 48s ]
So that 's something that we could do in EXT2 as an experiment to say : what 's the minimal necessary modification to this filesystem to provide all of the benefits of extent maps , except for this facility with holes ; which are going to be used by a vanishingly small fraction of users .
We do n't need to do B - Tree directories ; we can maybe do hashing of the directories ; a very much simpler extension to the filesystem , which can give us many of the performance improvements of B - Tree directories , but without the implementation costs .
So really there are lots of these things that people are looking at with EXT2 . [ 68 m , 24s ]
So EXT3 will be supported as a fully functional filesystem ; it 's not clear whether it will be a set ever merged into the official EXT2 source tree .
I guess not , actually .
But it 's certainly not the only extension to EXT2 that 's being talked about right now . [ 68 m , 40s ]
Any questions ?
You 've got two - and - a - half minutes ... two minutes .
[ The audience laughs . ]
One at the back .
[ There is an unintelligible question from an audience member . ]
... In progress , user reserved inodes for the journal . [ 69 m , 13s ]
[ The audience member continues . ]
Second part is , usually when you create a journal , we do a dd ...
No , I 've told you there 's going to be a tune2 fs options which does all of that for you and puts it into a reserved inode ; that 'll all be invisible . [ 69 m , 31s ]
[ There is an additional question about having to disk seek to the journal every time you do a write ; a problem similar to those with FAT filesystems that need to write to the FAT for every disk write . ]
[ There is a comment from another audience member on the subject . ]
You can get around it by putting it on a different disk .
Yeah .
There are actually a number of different issues there . [ 70 m , 06s ]
The first issue is that the journal writes are batched up into commits every five or ten seconds .
And they 're sequential , so there 's only one seek to the journal and one seek from the journal for that operation .
And the second thing is that , because you are doing those updates into the journal , things like hot data ... things like inodes which are being constantly updated or directories which are being constantly updated , are always hot in the journal and they never have to be written back to disk .
So you can actually eliminate the random seeks all over your main filesystem data , because all of the data is currently in the journal .
So you 're reducing the number of seeks in that case .
And you can also put your journal on a separate disk entirely , if you want to .
So our experience with journaling filesystems suggests that this is not the problem that you think it will be .
Obviously , it depends on the workload . [ 71 m , 04s ]
[ The speaker calls on a different audience member for a question . ]
Beyond the write boundary , do you anticipate other changes to the block driver interface ?
Do I anticipate other changes to the block driver interface ?
Not right now .
There are other changes going on , but they 're not related to EXT3 .
In particular , there 's work going on to replace the buffer head interface to the block device layer with a kiobuf - based implementation .
And that 's going to be enormously more efficient ; it will allow us to cleanly access high memory pages on large memory Intel boxes ; it will allow us , if we get it right , to finally make the break and allow addressing of block devices larger than two terabytes .
So yes , all of that 's going on , but it 's not related to EXT3 work . [ 71 m , 54s ]
[ The speaker calls on another audience member for a question . ]
What about crash during recovery ?
It does n't matter .
Recovery just consists of going through the log and writing what 's in the log back to disk .
And writing it back to disk twice is just as good as writing it once .
So if you crash during the recovery and you 've written half of the log , well the next recovery goes along and just does all the same set of writes , plus a few more .
And only when the recovery is completed , do we make the modification to the journal which marks recovery as being done .
There are no modifications to the journal while recovery is in progress .
So it just works .
There 's no problems there . [ 72 m , 32s ]
[ There is another question from the audience . ]
Does this at the moment work with software RAID ?
It will work with hardware RAID ; it will work with software RAID once the 2.4 port is done , because a bug in software RAID has been fixed in 2.4 .
It will not work with software RAID in 2.2 .
The reason for that is that software RAID when it does RAID recovery after a crash works by doing a buffer cache read , stripe - by - stripe , through the whole disk , writing those stripes back .
And when it writes those stripes back , it updates the disks which were not consistent at the time of the crash .
Unfortunately , when it 's doing that , it 's causing the contents of the buffer cache to be written to disk without the filesystem 's say - so .
And therefore is violating the write ordering requirements of the journaling filesystem .
And EXT3 adds a whole pile of debugging code to the block device layer to detect violations in the write ordering requirements , because that 's really good for debugging .
You do n't want these things to happen silently .
[ 73 m , 32s ]
Write ordering violations are really , really hard to detect , because the only way you 'll detect them normally is by crashing and finding that something does n't work right when you recover the filesystem .
You 've got absolutely no idea what went wrong .
So having those debugging entries in the EXT3 code is really , really important , to make sure that we detect write ordering violations when they happen .
And the RAID devices violate ordering and recovery ... not in 2.4 .
So it 'll be fine in 2.4 .
There 's a question over here somewhere ?
... Nope ...
Thank you very much , then .
[ The audience applauds . ]
[ The presentation ends . ] [ 74 m , 17s ]
The power split device is the heart of the Toyota Prius .
This is a clever gearbox that hooks the gasoline engine , generator and electric motor together .
It allows the car to operate like a parallel hybrid -- the electric motor can power the car by itself , the gas engine can power the car by itself or they can power the car together .
The power split device also allows the car to operate like a series hybrid -- the gasoline engine can operate independently of the vehicle speed , charging the batteries or providing power to the wheels as needed .
It also acts as a continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) , eliminating the need for a manual or automatic transmission .
Finally , because the power split device allows the generator to start the engine , the car does not need a starter .
The power split device is a planetary gear set ( below ) .
The electric motor is connected to the ring gear of the gear set .
It is also directly connected to the differential , which drives the wheels .
So , whatever speed the electric motor and ring gear spin at determines the speed of the car .
The Prius planetary gear set
The generator is connected to the sun gear of the gear set , and the engine is connected to the planet carrier .
The speed of the ring gear depends on all three components , so they all have to work together at all times to control the output speed .
When you accelerate , initially the electric motor and batteries provide all of the power .
The ring gear of the power split device is connected to the electric motor , so it starts to spin with the motor .
The planet carrier , which is connected to the engine , is stationary because the engine is not running .
Since the ring gear is spinning , the planets have to spin , which causes the sun gear and generator to spin .
As the car accelerates , the generator spins at whatever speed it needs to in order for the engine to remain off .
You can see all of this below :
­ ­­­­
Watch the Prius ' power split device
as the car accelerates from 0 to 30 mph .
Once you reach about 40 mph ( 64 kph ) , the gasoline engine will turn on .
The generator suddenly changes speed , causing the planet carrier to turn and start the engine .
Once the engine is running , it settles into a constant speed while the generator varies its speed to match the output speed with the electric motor .
If you are really accelerating hard , the motor will draw extra power from the batteries .
Once you are up to freeway speed , the car will move under a combination of gas and electric power , with all of the electricity coming from the generator .
Like the Insight , the Prius never needs to be recharged ; the onboard generator automatically maintains the proper level of charge in the batteries .
Both the Honda and the Toyota have long warranties on their hybrid components .
The Insight has an eight - year / 80,000 - mile warranty on most of the powertrain , including batteries , and the Prius has an eight - year / 100,000 - mile warranty on the battery and hybrid systems .
The motors and batteries in these cars typically do n't require any maintenance over the life of the vehicle ( however , if you do have to replace the batteries after the warranty expires , it will likely cost you several thousand dollars ) .
The engine does n't require any more maintenance than the one in any other car , and because both hybrids have regenerative braking , the brake pads may even last a little longer than those in most cars .
Achieving hybrid power is certainly more complex than using straight gasoline power or straight electric power .
In the next section , we 'll examine why hybrid technology is so desirable , both for consumers and for car makers .

CHRONOLOGY ….
Here ’s a timeline that outlines the fate of both FEMA and flood control projects in New Orleans under the Bush administration .
Read it and weep :
January 2001 : Bush appoints Joe Allbaugh , a crony from Texas , as head of FEMA .
Allbaugh has no previous experience in disaster management .
April 2001 : Budget Director Mitch Daniels announces the Bush administration ’s goal of privatizing much of FEMA ’s work .
In May , Allbaugh confirms that FEMA will be downsized : “ Many are concerned that federal disaster assistance may have evolved into both an oversized entitlement program … . ” he said .
“ Expectations of when the federal government should be involved and the degree of involvement may have ballooned beyond what is an appropriate level . ”
2001 : FEMA designates a major hurricane hitting New Orleans as one of the three “ likeliest , most catastrophic disasters facing this country . ”
December 2002 : After less than two years at FEMA , Allbaugh announces he is leaving to start up a consulting firm that advises companies seeking to do business in Iraq .
He is succeeded by his deputy and former college friend , Michael Brown , who has no previous experience in disaster management and was fired from his previous job for mismanagement .
March 2003 : FEMA is downgraded from a cabinet level position and folded into the Department of Homeland Security .
Its mission is refocused on fighting acts of terrorism .
2003 : Under its new organization chart within DHS , FEMA ’s preparation and planning functions are reassigned to a new Office of Preparedness and Response .
FEMA will henceforth focus only on response and recovery .
Summer 2004 : FEMA denies Louisiana ’s pre-disaster mitigation funding requests .
Says Jefferson Parish flood zone manager Tom Rodrigue : “ You would think we would get maximum consideration … .
This is what the grant program called for .
We were more than qualified for it . ”
June 2004 : The Army Corps of Engineers budget for levee construction in New Orleans is slashed .
Jefferson Parish emergency management chiefs Walter Maestri comments :
“ It appears that the money has been moved in the president ’s budget to handle homeland security and the war in Iraq , and I suppose that ’s the price we pay . ”
June 2005 : Funding for the New Orleans district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is cut by a record $ 71.2 million .
One of the hardest - hit areas is the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project , which was created after the May 1995 flood to improve drainage in Jefferson , Orleans and St. Tammany parishes .
August 2005 : While New Orleans is undergoing a slow motion catastrophe , Bush mugs for the cameras , cuts a cake for John McCain , plays the guitar for Mark Wills , delivers an address about V - J day , and continues with his vacation .
When he finally gets around to acknowledging the scope of the unfolding disaster , he delivers only a photo op on Air Force One and a flat , defensive , laundry list speech in the Rose Garden .
So : A crony with no relevant experience was installed as head of FEMA .
Mitigation budgets for New Orleans were slashed even though it was known to be one of the top three risks in the country .
FEMA was deliberately downsized as part of the Bush administration ’s conservative agenda to reduce the role of government .
After DHS was created , FEMA ’s preparation and planning functions were taken away .
Actions have consequences .
No one could predict that a hurricane the size of Katrina would hit this year , but the slow federal response when it did happen was no accident .
It was the result of four years of deliberate Republican policy and budget choices that favor ideology and partisan loyalty at the expense of operational competence .
It ’s the Bush administration in a nutshell .
SCOTUS to Gilmore : Petition for Cert Denied
John Gilmore is disappointed that the Supreme Court refused to act on the danger posed by the unconstitutional position of the TSA , and its refusal to release the text of the law that it uses to require travelers to show identification .
In his Petition for Certiorari , John asked the Court to decide whether the government may keep secret a law that affects millions of Americans every month , when the government has acknowledged what it claims are the contents of the law , and despite the fact that the government has never enunciated any reasonable basis for maintaining secrecy .
This country has a remarkable history of publishing its laws , to give the public notice of the behavior the government demands of them .
John has pursued this effort because , as he said on www.papersplease.org, " [ u ] ntil Americans have the ability to know the contents of the laws being applied to them , our Republic is in danger . "
John hoped that the Supreme Court would intervene , and make clear that the government cannot deprive the public of the text of the laws that bind them .
This issue now is left to the political process .
We must insist that our elected representatives control the TSA , and hold it accountable for its actions by , first , demanding that it make public this and any other laws it promulgates to bind the public .
John thanks the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , the American Society of Newspaper Editors , the Electronic Privacy Information Center , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the American Association of Law Libraries , the American Library Association , the Association of Research Libraries , the Center for Democracy and Technology , the National Security Archive , the Project on Government Secrecy of the Federation of American Scientists , and the Special Libraries Association , who submitted compelling amicus briefs supporting his Petition for Certiorari .
Get the facts ...
Machine copies itself like DNA
A device that combines air hockey and DNA marks at least the third time this year the nascent field of self - replicating machines has seen a significant advance .
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have built a system that replicates strings of simple electronic devices from random parts floating on a cushion of air .
The system works much like DNA , with a few rules and a few types of components working to make copies of an initial example for as long as the supply of parts lasts .
The electromechanical parts move around at random and attach or detatch from each other according to simple communications between neighboring parts .
When a new part latches onto a part that has become part of a copy of the initial example string , the part in the string checks for a match .
The research could lead to self - replicating machines that build , repair , and -- reminiscent of childrens transformer toys -- reconfigure themselves for different tasks or changes in circumstances .
The MIT work is similar to a self - replicating machine developed at Cornell University , though the Cornell system uses carefully positioned rather than random parts .
The MIT system is also similar to a simulation developed by researchers at the Canadian National Research Council and the University of Waterloo in Canada .
( Self - Replication from Random Parts , Nature , September 29 , 2005 )
Thoughts wander in VR
Devices that allow for direct brain - computer communications are advancing on two fronts : devices implanted in the brain , and external electrodes that pick up the brain 's electrical signals .
In general the external devices are safer and cheaper , but the implants provide more control .
Typically , users are able to control their brain waves in a way that moves a cursor up and down and side to side on a computer screen .
Researchers from Graz University of Technology in Austria , University College of London in England , Guger Technologies OEG in Austria and the University of Graz in Austria have expanded the amount of control available via external electrodes with a means of detecting changes in brain signals when users imagine moving their feet and translating the effect into walking motion within a virtual reality environment .
The system is distinguishes brain signals produced by thinking about different types of movements , including right hand , left hand , foot and tongue , and converts the information to control signals .
Three test subjects were able to move forward through an immersive virtual street scene by imagining walking .
This type of interface promises to enable those who are disabled , and could eventually give and people whose hands and voices are otherwise occupied another way to assess computers .
( Walking from Thoughts : Not the Muscles Are Crucial , but the Brain Waves ! , Presence 2005 , London , September 21 - 23 , 2005 )
In a related development , members of the same research team have developed a portable brain - computer interface for use in virtual environments .
The battery - powered interface , which includes a diskless Pocket PC , makes it possible for people to physically move while using brain signal control .
( Integration of a Brain - Computer Interface into Virtual Environments , Presence 2005 , London , September 21 - 23 , 2005 )
DNA computing gets chipped
DNA computers can simultaneously check many possible answers to large problems like determining the best possible traveling salesman 's route .
There are billions of possible routes that include just 15 cities , and there are no mathematical shortcuts for solving this type of problem , which means they easily overwhelm ordinary computers .
Scientists are increasingly using chip - size devices that control the flow of DNA suspended in small amounts of fluids to carry out DNA computing ; this is a key requirement for moving DNA computers from the chemistry lab to the computer science lab and eventually the data center .
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley have built a prototype DNA microfluidic computer processor that brings DNA computing a step closer to practical use .
The processor contains DNA strands attached to magnetic beads that are suspended within the device by a magnetic field .
Loose DNA strands that encode every possible answer to a particular problem circulate through the device , and complementary strands are captured by the suspended strands .
Unattached strands are then rinsed away , and the cycle is repeated until only strands encoding the correct answer remain .
( An Integrated Microfluidic Processor for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism - Based DNA Computing , Lab on a Chip , October 2005 )
We like people like us -- even fakes
Social science researchers have known for decades that we view people who mimic our body language more favorably than those who do n't .
It turns out that this effect holds true for our interactions with artificial people as well .
Stanford University researchers tested subjects who interacted with an artificial man or woman in an immersive virtual reality computer simulation .
The agents either mimicked the subtle head movements of the test subject after a four second delay or displayed head movements recorded from a previous session with another subject .
The subjects rated the artificial agents that mimicked their own head movements as more persuasive and likable than the agents that did not .
Subjects were also more likely to keep agents who mimic their head moments in view .
( Eight out of 69 participants were judged to have consciously detected the mimicry , and their results were discounted . )
The work could be used to improve characters and avatars in video games and online environments .
( Digital Chameleons : Automatic Assimilation of Nonverbal Gestures in the Immersive Virtual Environments , Psychological Science , October 2005 )
Bits and pieces : magnetic logic , finding the flu , mapping electrons
A logic scheme brings fast , cheap , low - power magnetic computer chips closer to reality ( also see previous advance ) ; a biochip that moves and heats fluids identifies a strain of flu virus ; scientists map out how electrons move through individual molecules .

WE’VE MOVED !
This post , the conversation , and research have shifted to GlassyEyes.com .
Join us for in - depth recommendations and horror stories .
It seems that quite a few people are looking for alternatives to over - priced eyewear .
— — –
I ’ve stepped into my last eyeglasses store .
I ’ve been wearing glasses since junior high , and the prices have gotten outrageous .
The last pair I bought at LensCrafters , in 2004 , set me back about $ 300 and never fit properly — even after multiple trips back .
They broke the last week of October .
I ’ve had my eye on , and nearly purchased a pair of Silhouettes a few months back .
They were the titanium hingeless variety .
I priced them out at a couple of stores and with AR ( anti- reflective ) lenses with scratch - resistant coating , I was looking at about $ 500 .
I do n’t claim to be the smartest guy in the room very often , but no way in hell was I going to buy into that .
The best deal I could find in a store for a pair ( in a non-welfare frame ) approached $ 270 — without AR lenses .
That would not do either .
There had to be a better alternative .
I decided I was going to find the Silhouettes online .
I already knew what I wanted and they ’d have to be much less online .
I googled — and found them — for $ 410ish .
Not good enough .
I went back to my search results .
You know how google has the ads on the right side ( of course you do ) ?
I ignore them almost all the time .
For some reason ( my empty wallet ? )
I decided to click a link to Zenni Optical ( a.k.a. , and I kid you not — 19dollareyeglasses.com ) .
Zenni had a couple of titanium , hingeless frames .
I priced them out .
I decked them out with AR coating ( $ 4.95 compared to $ 50 + in the stores ) , a clip - on sunshade ( $ 3.95 versus $ 70 in the store ) and went to the optional higher - index ( thinner ) lenses .
Total ?
$ 81 .
The downside ?
A couple of things … they might take a month to arrive and I really had no idea on the quality .
I tend to be an overly cautious buyer .
I ’ll buy , but not before I research the hell out the options and alternatives .
Put another way , I ’m an informed shopper .
The markup on eyeglasses frames can routinely be 1000 % !
Yes that was one - thousand percent .
Screw that noise .
For $ 81 , I could risk it , but not before an hour perusing the most - excellent ( if not sparse ) , EyeglassRetailersReview.com .
Zenni got decent reviews , so I ordered on October 26th .
They arrived on Thursday , November 9th and they appear to be perfect .
The lens quality and fit is excellent .
Was I done ?
Nope .
A whole new world had been opened up to me .
I decided I needed to hedge my bets .
I ordered an even cheaper pair from Goggles4u.com also .
This was a cheaper , very different , style frame .
With lenses ( they do n’t offer an especially high - index lens ) , they came to $ 25 ( and that includes AR , UV , and anti-scratch coatings ! ) .
I decided to up the ante a bit and add the photochromic treatment ( Transistions — darken in the sun , clear indoors ) , after all I ’m testing this out and $ 61 is hardly excessive for a pair of glasses .
These arrived on Wednesday , November 8 ( 12 days ) .
For the price , I could n’t be happier .
They look great and the lenses are perfect .
The fit and finish is not of the same quality , but they ’re really nice just the same .
Without question , I ’ll order from each of these places in the future .
The prescriptions are tack sharp , the selections are better than the stores and the prices are incredible .
Eyeglasses for less than a pair of shoes ?
Yes , please .
UPDATE : I got a comment from an optician — and responded to it here .
UPDATE TWO :
Thanks for all of the kind words and thoughtful responses !
I ca n’t believe the nerve this has touched .
Want to share your experiences ?
I ’ve started an aggregator site ( http://www.glassyeyes.com), that will hopefully evolve into both a place to rate the shoppes and discuss this topic further .
I really feel like the can of worms may be open now .
Let me know what you think !

" Dignity is deadly . " - Paul Graham
What goes away when a company moves past the start - up phase ?
Living only on take - out and caffeine .
Working in a [ small ] living room .
Crazy , stupid , unprofessional behavior .
Wearing nothing but shorts and ripped t- shirts .
Is this a good thing ?
Hacker - turned - start - up - investor Paul Graham does n't think so .
In his keynote at the internal Amazon developer 's conference in Seattle ( that I was speaking at last week ) , he had a list of 40 bullet points of things Big Companies could learn from start - ups .
He does n't have an essay up for this , but he has a wonderful , somewhat related essay that I 'm hoping you 've all read by this time on What Business Can Learn From Open Source .
( If you 're new to Paul Graham , he can be an " acquired taste " .
Very smart , often controversial , rarely politically correct .
Almost always thought provoking -- or at least hurl - your - mouse - across - the - room provoking . )
My head was already spinning by bullet point six , but the one simple thing that stuck in my head was " dignity is deadly . "
Specifically this thought ( I'm paraphrasing ) :
When you evolve out of start - up mode and start worrying about being professional and dignified , you only lose capabilities .
You do n't add anything ... you only take away .
Dignity is deadly .
At one point , Sun was n't much more than creative genuis Bill Joy ( " Oh , I think I 'll just whip up BSD Unix on my own ... " ) , and troublemaker Scott McNealy .
Yet by the time I got to Sun , using the word " cool " in a customer training document was enough to warrant an entry in your annual performance eval .
And not in a good way .
I cannot count the times I heard the word " professionalism " used as justification for why we could n't do something .
But I can count the few times I heard the word " passion " used in a meeting where the goal was to get developers to adopt our newest Java technologies .
What changed ?
More importantly , was it a positive change ?
Was it a completely necessary change ?
Why do we go from the business equivalent of the unruly - but - creative teenager to a stuffy parent ?
Ca n't we be something in - between ?
Why not the motivated , fun , creative 30 - year old ?
( I 'm not being ageist here -- this is a metaphor ) .
If we 're forced into becoming the " parent " , why ca n't we at least be the cool parent from down the street ?
And by " cool " , I mean the truly cool , not cool simply because they supplied the beer .
( The 37 Signals folks always have a lot to say on this " stay small and act like a start - up " approach as well )
Some argue that by maintaining strict professionalism , we can get the more conservative , professional clients and thus grow the business .
Is this true ?
Do we really need these clients ?
Is n't it possible that we might even grow more if we became braver ?
Seth Godin cautions that today , " Safe is risky , and risky is safe . "
I 'm somewhere in the middle of this .
I 'll use the word " ass " as in " kick-ass " .
But when I use the " F - word " , well , there you have it .
It 's the " F - word " , not the actual spelled - out word .
hugh macleod , on the other hand , has a take - no - prisoners view .
He 'll do whatever the hell he pleases , always being 100 % true to who he is , and when someone warned him that if he did n't cut back he'd never get the Big Clients , his response was : " Do you honestly think I 'd have a good working relationship with clients who are offended that I used the word ' penis ' in a cartoon ? "
He does n't want those clients , and apparently ... he has n't done too badly recently finding clients who like him just the way he is -- pure authentic hugh - - thank - you .
Yes there is a " Business Case " for maintaining certain levels of professionalism , dignity , and political correctness .
And that 's cool ... as long as we 're all recognizing at every turn that in some ways we are losing the tools we have available to us .
That this need to meet professional expectations restricts us ... perhaps even more than it enables a higher level of ... what ?
Profits ?
Business ?
Clients ?
Respect ?
The Head First book series was an attempt to use virtually everything brain - friendly that we were not allowed to do at Sun .
And when Head First Java first came out , it immediately became the number one selling Java book , and still is today , just over two years later .
I 'm not at all suggesting that some of what 's in Head First would have been appropriate for an official Sun course document , but could they have incorporated 20 % without sacrificing dignity ?
Maybe .
By the time we ran things through the deadly professionalism filters , the life , passion , joy , and in this case - - brain - friendliness - - had been sucked out .
When " we just ca n't DO that here " takes away more than it adds , we should reconsider .
But , people scream , " we ca n't afford to say f*** 'em to some of our biggest potential clients ! "
And I wonder ... can we afford not to ?

I 'm the motivated , fun , creative 30 - year old at my job , where I 'm a young adult librarian .
I 'm grateful that I get to work with teenagers , the most creative , random , passionate , right - brained people on the planet .
Other than the teens , I do not see " passion " at my job , only professionalism .
And the other day , when I asked if we could reserve a wall in the new teen meeting room " just for drawing on " I was told , " No .
You just do n't do that .
I mean , you just do n't draw on walls . "
And that was that .
I fantasize about what my library could learn from a start - up .
Thanks for the post .

Brilliant .
You 've just inspired me for at least a few hours ;-)
I work at a small , innovative , company that 's just over 3 1/2 years old .
We used to feel like a startup .
We had all the attitude and balls of a startup .
But as we 've got bigger , we 've had to get more organised and more serious ( a bit ) .
But not for ' our ' reasons , but for our clients reasons .
From the inside I can totally see how and why ' the change ' occurs , but at the same time it 's a completely ludicrous thing to do .
The reason why we have grown , why our clients are still with us , is because we think and act like a startup .
And by becoming what we think they need us to be we 're going to turn them off and lose them .
Well , I guess there 's a balance in there somewhere .
Thanks again , great stuff , always !
Posted by : iain tait | Sep 27 , 2005 12:38:10 AM
Being professional is not bad .
It 's a good thing .
It also has a number of positive meanings attached to it .
Eg : reliability , acting in the client 's best interest , keeping negative personal feelings out of the job , always keeping up with the latest knowledge , etc . .
What we want is a Passionate Professional .
Can we think of any character that fits the role here ?

Kathy ,
Good post again …
Officially , I ’m a fan .
Sorry about the length of this comment but it is a subject I am PASSIONATE about .
First , I ’ll make the claim that professionalism is not the same as policy - driven constraints that kill creativity , innovation , and interest .
But the two are so often equated due to misunderstanding that it is difficult to see .
I view professionalism as simply being effective at providing the product or service you are charged with providing .
Certainly , you might have policy directives in place to control aspects of what you do .
But the policy must be driven by a purpose and not in spite of the purpose .
===========================
Anecdote :
My family moved into a house that had a satellite dish and receiver .
We called the company to activate the service and were told we needed a card for the receiver .
We ordered the card , paid $ 20 , and it was delivered .
Unfortunately , the dish or receiver did not work .
I traced the cable and tested it but could not get it working .
We were in contact with customer service numerous times to solve the problem .
Finally , my wife pointed to a “ free installation ” coupon for the same satellite company we were trying to get running .
I called and said , let ’s start over .
I would like to get the free installation .
The customer service rep – reading , I am sure from their “ professional ” script said , “ The free installation is for new customers only .
You do n’t qualify . ”
“ I am a new customer .
We ’ve never had service . ”
“ You purchased a dish receiver card a month ago , ” was her reply , “ you are in the system as a customer . ”
My first response was to look for the hidden cameras .
I spoke with her supervisor ( the person next to her I assume ) and was told the same thing .
It actually took a call to their corporate offices where I spoke to an assistant to the Director of Marketing .
She laughed when I told her my story – not at me , in shock .
We ended up with a few months free and an additional receiver .
===========================
This is a great example of “ professionalism ” gone awry .
Sacrificing who you are for a mythical professional persona occurs in careers as well .
Nothing says that you must suddenly give up your person to be taken seriously in the professional world .
In fact , becoming overly concerned with others perception and creating this “ never - the - twain - shall - meet ” segmentation of personal life , interest , and passions , with your professional life is unhealthy and leads to burnout .
There is something to be said for professional decorum , making yourself presentable , and adopting some of the corporate culture .
However , on the flip - side , you are a part of that corporate culture and should provide some of the color and interest .
I recently blogged the topic on being yourself and its career impact .
http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/pm/career/archives/005926.asp
I infuse a lot of humor into what I do .
It is how I am as a person .
This means it is part of who I am as a husband , father , writer , consultant , etc .
I refuse to make a distinction .
Companies and individuals need to determine whether their professionalism is mask that does not fit .
If the mask is creating pain or causing innovation and effective work to be sacrificed , they need to remove the mask .
It is the professional thing to do .

Years ago I read someone who claimed that a major problem with society is that " solemn " is mistaken for " serious " .
" Narrow - minded and humorless " is often mistaken for " mature " ....
Posted by : Michael Turyn | Sep 27 , 2005 1:52:46 PM
Completely agree .
Passion in the service of conviction should never be bridled .
As a friend once told me , " I swear because I care "
That said , using extreme language left and right is a little twisted .

" What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul ? "

1 . As a startup , you have nothing to lose .
Once established , you have everything to lose .
Settling for being corporate is simply a result of fear .
( Do n't rock the boat .
Preserve what you have . )
It 's natural , but it 's the kind of shift that stunts growth and robs you of the magic that made you successful in the first place .
2. Everyone has their own style and their own interests .
If you 're naturally dignified and conservative and you forced yourself to be more daring during the startup phase , then by all means revert to your natural style once your firm picks up momentum .
However , if you 're a daring and undignified kind of person and you force yourself to act dignified and conservative to " play it safe " once you 're doing well , then you 're cheating your clients out of a good chunk of your talent .
It 's best to just be comfortable and do what you love to do .
Jeans or suit , backpack or briefcase , Vespa or Mercedes ... it 's about what works for you .
( Okay , it 's a cliche , but it 's true . )
Posted by : Olivier Blanchard | Sep 28 , 2005 7:20:01 PM
Ideally , it would be nice to be the same person , the same company you started out to be , but Olivier above me said exactly what was on my mind " As a startup , you have nothing to lose .
Once established , you have everything to lose . "
Very few industries have the flexibility of having free personality as they need to appeal to the largest croud .
Just my opinion .

This post reminds me of working at Electronic Arts as a tester .
On my first " tour " , about six months in the last half of ' 04 , the QA department was an awesome place to work .
We routinely put in 80 hours a week , but you barely noticed it because the atmosphere was still just like a startup , complete with wicked humor , a fun , casual atmosphere and dress code , and web - surfing to sites that would make most corporate system administrators ' heads explode .
It was a * fun* place to work .
You actually looked forward to going there .
Cut to the latter half of ' 05 , when I went back for a second tour .
I do n't know exactly what went down during those six months in between , but when I returned the place had gone corporate -- regimented breaks , a more " professional " atmosphere , no internet access at all for testers , etc .
Tester engagement , fun , productivity , and morale were all way down .
I guess EA does n't need my advice on how to make money or run a company , but it was sad to see such a vibrant , high - morale workplace so radically transformed , on its way to becoming a typical corporate drone hive .

A corporation 's " professionalism " is like the equivalent of magnolia painted walls in a house that is about to be sold .
Sure it does n't have character but when you want as much interest as possible you can't take chances on the " character " offending anyone .
Posted by : Hex | Jan 6 , 2007 11:02:56 PM
" Professional " does not mean " loss of creativity or innovation " .
My last job was software consulting and our main clients were intellectual property lawyers .
" Professional " means getting the job done no matter what it takes yet behaving appropriately .
In fact , the greatest employee is someone who can think and learn fast , yet knows how to adapt his or her behaviour to the situation .
That does not mean you stop innovating .
We were professional yet we came up with creative ideas all the time .
Posted by : Ramesh Rajaduray | Mar 5 , 2007 9:00:28 PM
It is all about adaptation .
Be " professional to those external groups that value it " .
Be " daring " , " revolutionary " , etc with your internal team .
I own a going on 6 year old " startup " tech consulting firm and our group understands the culture we have within our four walls may vary greatly from what our customers and potential customers see .
If you truely KNOW your customers , it is so easy to extend the culture of " revolutionism " to the outside .

Pixar , a company that revolutionized the feature film industry , had an obscure origin .
A group of researchers from the most elite research institutions in the US eventually gathered at a former diploma mill and later defected to Lucasfilm .
Their division was purchased by Steve Jobs and became Pixar , which created Toy Story and is now owned by Disney .
Origin of SuperPaint
Dick Shoup , who would later pioneer digital video , had a PhD from Carnegie Mellon and worked at the Berkley Computer Corporation ( BCC ) .
One of the early players in the timesharing market , BCC went belly up , and Shoup emigrated to Xerox ’s Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) , where he got a reputation for being eccentric .
In order to make the most use of his time , he developed a technique for riding his bike from his house to the desk without dismounting once .
On April 10 , 1973 , while many of his colleagues were at the debut of the Xerox Alto prototype hardware displaying a picture of Sesame Street ’s Cookie Monster , Shoup was obsessing over digital video .
A floor below the other engineers , Shoup was seated in front of a black & white video camera hooked to one of the lab ’s minicomputers recording the first ever digital video .
He had created a simple frame buffer , revolutionary in its day and indispensable today .
The early systems that he used had hundreds of thousands of dollars of memory , making the machine much more expensive than any of the workstations in the Alto family .
Xerox did n’t exercise much discipline at PARC , so even though Xerox would never release digital video equipment , Shoup still received his funding .
From there , he expanded the frame buffer so it could handle color and grab footage from any video source , such as LaserDiscs or videotapes .
Once the computer had the video in memory , he could modify it as though it were a standard image .
As Shoup added more and more editing features to the frame buffer , he named his program SuperPaint .
The head of the computer scientists at PARC , Bob Taylor , wanted to make the Alto into an integrated office system , something that Xerox would be able to market to its existing customers .
He envisioned entire offices running on ethernet networks of Altos , laser printers , and file / email servers .
SuperPaint did n’t fit into this system .
Even though it did have a market ( video production and design ) , it did n’t fit into the market that Xerox wanted to focus on .
Alvy Ray Smith
A year later , Shoup was making progress in optimizing SuperPaint , but he had little support for the project until Alvy Ray Smith arrived at his house .
Smith was a brilliant mathematician and economist who wrote his PhD thesis on automata theory .
He became an associate professor at New York University , but he lost interest in teaching after a serious skiing accident left him immobilized for a few months .
After he recovered , Smith started traveling the country in his Ford Torino and ended up in southern California , where he eventually got a teaching job at Berkeley .
The Berkeley library did n’t have a book he needed , so he went to Stanford for the weekend , where he bunked with his old friend , Dick Shoup , who gave him a tour of PARC .
He saw the first workstations in history , the Xerox Altos running SuperPaint .
Smith was floored by SuperPaint .
He was an amateur artist and was immediately enamored with his newfound ability to create full color images with a computer , something that was impossible ( to his knowledge ) outside of PARC .
“ I realized this is what I had come to California for ” ( Dealers of Lightning , 234 ) , Smith said of SuperPaint .
Shoup was enamored with Smith .
Not only would he have a companion in the graphics lab , he would have a tester ( with a fresh pair of eyes ) and an advocate for SuperPaint .
PARC ’s personnel department refused to hire a resident artist like Smith , so Shoup got a purchase order , as though Smith were equipment , to make sure that he was paid for his efforts .
Shoup was able to construct incredible video sequences that were impossible to create in any other medium .
He took an image of his girlfriend ’s face and transformed it into a kaleidoscope of colors that was still very organic in nature .
He created a gecko’s hide that cycled through colors and modified Star Trek episodes with new psychedelic effects .
A small subculture developed around SuperPaint as Smith invited his friends to come and watch his more and more abstract video clips .
After Smith and Shoup submitted their work to local PBS affiliate , KCET , as a segment to a program called Supervision , Taylor lost it .
He demanded that Shoup delete every frame that referenced Xerox in any way , which took hours on end .
Days later , Smith was dismissed and SuperPaint was dismantled .
PARC would focus squarely on black and white .
However Shoup had the last laugh – in 1983 he was awarded an Emmy for his work with SuperPaint .
Without SuperPaint , Smith started looking for another outlet for his creative energy .
He heard from one of his former associates at Berkley that the University of Utah had recently acquired a frame buffer , the core component of SuperPaint .
When Smith arrived in Utah , he was dismayed to find out that he was too late .
A millionaire from New York , Alex Schure , had already bought every computer graphics component and tape .
The NYIT Connection
Schure made his fortune at the New York Institute of Technology ( NYIT ) , a rumored diploma mill he created to take advantage of the wave of GI Bill students after World War II .
NYIT eventually became an accredited school and occupied a building near Lincoln Center in Manhattan .
The school still did n’t have much of a reputation , though , and the college ’s bookstore stocked car parts instead of textbooks .
Word of Smith ’s arrival in Utah found its way back to Schure , who invited Smith to come to New York to help him with his computer research .
When Smith walked into Schure ’s garage ( the computer research group operated independently of NYIT ) , he was greeted by Ed Catmull , who had a PhD in physics .
In his teens , Catmull had created the first computer generated film , a rotating model of his hand , and he was recruited by Schure shortly after he bought the University of Utah ’s equipment .
Catmull explained that Schure wanted to create the first computer generated feature film and was willing to spend as much money as it took .
The researchers thrived in Schure ’s environment and made huge leaps in the field .
There were fewer than a dozen people in the group , but they were already able to create very complex computer generated shapes , especially compared to what Smith had been able to do at PARC .
Schure ’s researchers were pretty much given free reign over the work they chose to do .
Some began work on a system that would accelerate the creation of conventional , hand - drawn animated films by digitally tracing the lines and then filling them in with virtual paint .
The system would eventually turn into Disney ’s CAPS .
The rest of the researchers worked on a vague project called “ The Works ” .
With no outside help or guidance , the researchers accomplished little .
Most of their efforts were directed towards creating sample animations to define the characteristics of the characters .
It was unclear to many of the researchers if there was even a script for the project .
At the same time the researchers were working to create animation for decades in the future , Schure was financing a group of conventional animators to create his own animated feature , Tubby the Tuba .
Schure fancied himself as the next Walt Disney , but he lacked the taste to create films like Disney did ; Tubby was filled with technical flaws and an incomprehensible story line .
George Lucas
The researchers were aghast at Schure ’s effort and decided that they would have to find another sponsor for their work , someone who could bring their ideas to fruition .
Almost by accident , the members received calls from George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola .
Francis Ford Coppola was at the zenith of his career .
He had been awarded academy awards for The Godfather , The Godfather Part II , and Apocalypse Now , and he had produced American Graffiti , which was directed by George Lucas .
Coppola wanted to start integrating computer generated effects and computer based video editing ( which required frame buffers to display frames ) into films produced by American Zoetrope , his company .
Catmull traveled to San Francisco for a number of meetings with the director , but he thought that Coppola ’s profuse drug use would impede any progress the researchers would be able to make .
The researchers had all played hooky from NYIT on 1977.05.25 to watch Star Wars , and they were thrilled with the film .
The special effects were not spectacular ( though the compositing required for space dogfights was impressive ) but the story was great .
They believed that George Lucas would be receptive to adopting computer generated effects to eliminate the tedious work of drawing in light saber blades and moving flotillas of spaceships .
Production of the dogfights was very labor intensive .
Each model of ship had to be built with meticulous detail , since 70 mm film would catch any imperfections .
The models were placed on tracks and would make a single motion .
The process would be repeated for every shot and every ship , and then they would all be composited ( cut and pasted ) on top of a background shot .
The process could take weeks or months for a few minutes of footage , though the results were very good .
Catmull was correct .
That year Lucas contracted with a computer company , Triple - I , but he decided to use conventional methods instead .
The company succeeded in producing a digital model of an X - Wing fighter , which made its way to the cover of an influential computer magazine .
Carmull and Smith were incredulous however .
The model had jaggies ( pixelated , edges ) that made it look unrealistic .
Even though the effects never made it into the movie , Triple - I proved to Lucas that computers could be useful in film production .
Smith was tapped to go to Lucas ’ home town of Modesto , California , to make the pitch to Lucas ’ real estate developer , who was receptive to the group .
All of the researchers were invited to come to Lucas and start a brand new computer division that would work on digital video and digital models .
In order to avoid angering Schure by a sudden exodus to a possible competitor , the researchers slowly migrated to the computer division after several months at temporary jobs .
Catmull was the first to arrive at the computer division and was given control of the team .
By 1980 , the rest of team was reassembled and helped produce the special effects for Return of the Jedi .
Not all of the projects the computer division embarked on were as widely seen as the Death Star map .
The computer division ’s most significant contribution was actually project management software that ran off their minicomputer , named Dagobah .
The software helped automate the intricate process of shooting scenes in space .
Beyond Star Wars
Other than the light sabers and space ships , the team did very little until Paramount Pictures came to ILM ( Industrial Light and Magic , the new name for the computer division ) and requested that it create a scene for Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan .
Meyer wanted to create a scene that depicted the destruction and reintegration of a planet called Genesis ( named for the weapon used to destroy the planet ) .
ILM assigned Catmull ’s team of computer researchers to generate the sequence using computers .
Genesis was simplistic by today ’s standards .
The space ship that destroys the planet looks like a sperm cell , and the planet is little more than a plain mountainous rock ( not coincidentally , those two effects were particular strengths of the researchers ) .
The interesting part was the camera work , which would have been impossible with conventional filming techniques .
Genesis was one of the most popular parts of the entire film and made an excellent impression with George Lucas , who began utilizing the team for other special effects .
Disney also took note of Genesis .
Michael Eisner , who had recently been hired from Paramount to rebuild Disney ’s struggling animation studio , asked that Catmull develop a system that would trace and color each animation cel and replace the team of women who did the boring process by hand .
Catmull ’s team enthusiastically embraced the idea and developed the Computer Animation Production System ( CAPS ) for Disney , though the company would not admit that it used computers for almost a decade .
CAPS was not a trivial development .
Not only did the researcher ’s have to create a SuperPaint - like interface to allow the animators to fill in the hand drawn cels , but over a hundred thousand high resolution images would have to be stored for a single feature film , impossible on all but the most powerful computers of the day .
Disney paid millions of dollars for the storage system itself in addition to the researchers ’ painting program .
The system used for CAPS was the precursor to the Pixar Image Computer , which until 1987 was the primary breadwinner for the computer division .
The PIC would n’t be formally released until later ; it essentially acted as a large frame buffer that was capable of handling film resolution images ( roughly 2000 x 3000 pixels ) and rendering simple models .
Each PIC cost over $ 100,000 and was dependent on a Unix workstation .
RenderMan
Even without the outside attention , Genesis was a huge accomplishment for the researchers .
RenderMan , the software that turned the simple models the animators worked with into high resolution images , was written by Loren Carpenter and was originally named Motion Doctor .
RenderMan would form the basis for every project that the researchers would undertake for the next two decades and allowed traditional animators to begin working with computer animation with relatively little training .
Another key element to the researcher ’s future materialized in 1984 .
John Lasseter , who had worked on Disney ’s Tron ( a film with almost 30 minutes of computer generated animations ) and a failed project to create a computer animated version of the storybook Where the Wild Things Are , joined Lucasfilm at Catmull ’s urging to experiment with computer animation for at least a few months .
Lasseter immediately dived into creating a computer generated short film for his son , titled The Adventures of Wally and Andre B .
The plot centered around a toddler who is stalked by a bee in a large forest and eventually stung .
The forms were fairly complex for computer animation .
The human face was capable of conveying simple emotions , and Andre had complex movements .
The real advance in the film was its backdrop , which featured a great deal of detail .
The programmers had created a program that randomly generated the movement of every leaf , blade of grass , and branch in the film , eliminating the need for animators to define every element in the film .
Though the completed film terrified his son , The Adventures of Wally and Andre B was a boon .
The film garnered much recognition for the computer researchers and would rekindle Disney ’s interest in computer animation after the failure of Tron and the early death of Where the Wild Things Are .
Pixar
Catmull ’s researchers would have been satisfied to stay at ILM creating special effects until the technology required to create a computer generated feature film became affordable , but Lucas was hard up for money .
He was in the midst of a divorce , and by California law he and his wife held all property jointly , so the couple would have to split the family ’s net worth evenly .
Instead of giving her any of his lucrative movie companies , Lucas decided to give her cash .
The researchers seemed to be decades away from being profitable .
Outside of Disney and small video clips , there seemed to be no market for its expensive products .
As news of Lucas ’ pending divestment of the research division got out , buyers started stepping forward .
A consortium consisting of the Ross Perot - founded and GM - owned EDS and Phillips got as far as drafting the contracts , but Ross Perot was pushed out and the deal died .
Luckily , a wealthy investor had heard about the researchers and was interested .
Enter Steve Jobs
Alan Kay had maintained a relationship with Steve Jobs after he and his entourage from Apple had toured PARC .
In 1984 , Kay had told Jobs about Lucas ’ band of researchers , but Jobs was uninterested .
He was still Apple ’s chairman and head of the Macintosh team , and he had no plans to leave – especially after the successful LaserWriter launch .
Despite his disinterest in acquiring ILM , he decided to take a tour and see what was going on – and he was blown away .
He saw the most sophisticated computer graphics in the world , stuff that put the Genesis sequence to shame .
Unfortunately for Jobs , Macintosh sales were only a fraction of what he had predicted , and he was forced out in 1985 after his failed coup attempt against John Sculley ( see The NeXT Years : Steve Jobs before His Triumphant Return to Apple ) .
Jobs sold all of his Apple stock almost immediately after leaving and started a company to create computers for higher education , NeXT Computer Inc .
With loads of cash left to burn , Jobs was contacted by Catmull and Alvy about taking a second look at acquiring the division .
They had a meeting at his Spartan mansion in the exclusive neighborhood of Woodside , and Jobs immediately agreed to buy the division , which he spontaneously named Pixar .
Lucas had originally hoped to get upwards of $ 100 million for the division and associated intellectual property , but Jobs played hardball and got the price down to $ 10 million .
Around 5 % of the company would be given to Catmull and Smith , but Jobs would maintain the lion ’s share of the company , though he would have limited control .
The biggest issue was geography .
Modesto was almost two hours away from Jobs ’ home outside Palo Alto , and he was unwilling to drive down unless he had to ( in fact , he visited Pixar ’s headquarters fewer than six times before 1994 ) .
Secondly , he was in way over his head with computer graphics .
He was no engineer , although he had a decent understanding of the inner workings of the Macintosh , he knew next to nothing compared to the PhDs at Pixar .
The first product that Pixar shipped was the Pixar Image Computer , which was essentially the storage system of CAPS .
The device worked as a peripheral to an SGI ( which was being run by Schure alumnus Jim Clark ) or Sun workstation and allowed images to be stored and displayed on a computer screen .
Priced at $ 135,000 , the device was incredibly expensive and seemed to have limited appeal .
Pixar decided to push the device outside of computer animation , to doctors who needed to review high resolution copies of x-rays and MRI scans , and opened sales offices across the nation .
Unfortunately for Pixar , only about a hundred of the devices were sold .
Most of them went to Disney and the NSA , with a few going to large hospitals in the Northeast .
Luxo Jr
At the end of 1986 , Pixar ’s future appeared bleak , but it was about to improve tremendously .
Lasseter had created another short film , this one meant to demonstrate the merits of the Pixar Image Computer .
Titled Luxo
Jr , the film featured a pair of anthropomorphic Luxo brand lamps .
The larger was an exasperated parent watching the smaller lamp play with and eventually pop a toy ball .
Lasseter chose the lamps for two reasons .
The first was that they were convenient .
His small team of animators all had desks outfitted with the inexpensive lamps , and they were relatively simple to animate .
The second was the fact that the form demonstrated the strengths of computer animation .
The simple lamps were able to convey complex emotions without having to create the enormously complex human face .
Luxo
Jr was incredibly popular .
Not only did it impress computer scientists , the film industry was impressed , too .
The short was nominated for Best Short Animated Film at the 1986 Academy Awards .
Pixar now had clout in the film industry and would use it to its advantage .
RenderMan Released
With an Academy Award nomination under its belt , Pixar released its second product , RenderMan .
Based on the work of Loren Carpenter while Pixar was still part of Lucasfilm , RenderMan was a moderate success in the marketplace .
Jobs hoped that products like RenderMan would spark a consumer revolution , empowering untrained people to create computer animation on their home computer , the same way the Macintosh allowed untrained people to create professional - appearing documents like newsletters and flyers .
Unfortunately for Jobs , that revolution did n’t occur .
Other companies created animation packages based on RenderMan , like PixelPutty for the Macintosh , but none were designed for consumers to use .
Pixar sold slightly more than 100,000 RenderMan licenses – phenomenal for a product with such limited consumer appeal .
RenderMan won itself wide publicity and respect when James Cameron became a loyal user with his films , The Abyss and Terminator 2 .
Revenues from RenderMan and the Pixar Image Computer alone would not be enough to make Pixar profitable , so Pixar began producing commercials and eventually a television show .
Its most popular ads were for Life Savers candy and Listerine .
Pixar was still far from profitable , especially after the company began acquiring the workstations and servers required to making a television special .
Pixar was so hard up for money that animators were reduced to begging for secondhand computers from their friends at Sun and SGI .
With a questionable financial future , Pixar pushed through the end of 1989 .
Lasseter ’s third short film , Tin Toy , was released and was awarded an Oscar for Best Short Animated Film .
Tin
Toy centered around a group of toys in an infant ’s room and was much more advanced than earlier productions .
James Cameron also released The Abyss , which featured a RenderMan rendered character .
The Disney Connection
Disney was doing much better in the late 80s .
The Little Mermaid was incredibly popular , the biggest release for Disney to date .
To top that , a portion of the film was produced using CAPS .
Lasseter maintained contact with Disney , and contacted Jeffrey Katzenberg , the head of Disney ’s film division , about creating a Christmas television special .
Katzenberg was so enamored with Pixar ’s shorts and software that he responded by offering to produce three films .
The staff at Pixar were floored .
Catmull and Smith predicted that computer generated feature films would not be feasible until the mid 90s .
Pixar was almost four years ahead of the curve .
Even better than that , they had a deal with Disney , the undisputed king of animation .
Because of the changed focus of the company , there was a massive reorganization .
All of the sales offices around the nation were shut down , and the Pixar Image Computer was discontinued .
The remaining sales staff would focus squarely on licensing Pixar ’s RenderMan to other software makers .
The bulk of the company ’s resources were devoted to the creative division headed by Lasseter .
Before that , there were fewer than a dozen animators working with Lasseter ; that number doubled and then tripled during the production of the first film , Toy Story .
The bigger staff and investments in equipment made it necessary for Toy Story to succeed if Pixar expected to survive .
The company had lost $ 60 million of Jobs ’ money at a time when Jobs was at an emotional low .
NeXT was dying , with its loyal customers jumping ship to Windows NT and Sun workstations .
It seemed that if Pixar was unable to turn a profit soon , Jobs would sell it to a company like Microsoft ( Alvy had become a fellow at Microsoft after leaving Pixar ) .
Steve Jobs flew to Anaheim to join Smith and Catmull during negotiations with Katzenberg to finalize the three film deal .
Jobs had gotten into a heated argument with Katzenberg during a sales call months before , when he was trying to sell Disney a lab of his NeXTstations for the animators , so Catmull and Smith were nervous how the two would get along .
Negotiations with Disney
The initial deal gave Pixar a small percentage of box office sales in addition to compensation for the production of the film .
Jobs demanded a bigger percentage on box office sales , a percentage of video sales , and unlimited software rights .
Katzenberg was offended , and the two sparred for the better part of an hour .
Katzenberg eventually gave Pixar a bigger cut of box office sale ( 10 - 15 % depending on how successful the film was ) and rights to the software .
Disney retained the rights to the films , which meant it could create sequels without Pixar .
Disney also retained its hold on video sales .
The biggest boon for Disney was Pixar ’s production compensation .
Katzenberg told Jobs that he never paid more than $ 15 million for an animated film , and it would be no different for Pixar .
Jobs acquiesced and accepted the amount .
( Katzenberg had lied – Beauty and the Beast had cost over $ 32 million to produce .
It was only later that the Pixar executives found out that they had been snookered , but by then Katzenberg had left Disney for his own startup , the Paul Allen financed Dreamworks SKG . )
The employees at Pixar were optimistic about the future as Lasseter began writing the screenplay for Toy Story , but that would soon change .
Jobs had never gotten along with Smith , and the relationship grew even worse during the negotiations with Disney .
Smith was terrified that Katzenberg would walk out on the abrasive Jobs .
After Jobs snapped at Smith and yelled at him during a meeting at the Deer Park NeXT headquarters , Smith resigned from Pixar and started a brand new company , Altimira , which produced computer animation software .
Altimira was eventually bought by Microsoft , and its technology was used in Microsoft ’s line of multimedia CD - ROMs .
Work on Toy Story was slow .
Lasseter had no experience in writing screenplays for feature films and was struggling to create endearing characters .
The story centered around a toy cowboy , Woody , and his conflict with a new space doll , Lunar Larry .
Lasseter eventually put together a 30 second trailer to show off the characters and the animation technique .
When Lasseter showed it to Disney executives , they were stunned .
The footage was unlike anything they had produced .
Even the critics in Disney ’s animation division , the ones who had the most to lose if Pixar succeeded , were enamored with the technique , if not the story line .
Disney approved the script , and real production began on 1993.01.19 .
The animators began work immediately , creating the models that they would manipulate in the other scenes .
Woody had over 723 motion controls to animate his actions .
In his mouth alone , there were 58 such controls .
That type of detail required an incredible amount of computing power .
It took hours for 117 Sun and SGI servers to render each frame , and the film had hundreds of thousands of frames .
To accelerate the process , the animators turned their high powered workstations over to the renderfarm at night to accelerate the process .
Toy Story ’s voice talent was phenomenal .
The untested firm had no trouble signing Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for little more than union voice actors after they were shown the short trailer .
For the soundtrack , Lasseter personally courted the popular Randy Newman to write and perform the songs .
Everything seemed to be going well .
Even Jobs , the absentee owner who continued to devote his attention to the flagging NeXT , took an interest in the film ’s progress .
He wanted to be kept abreast of Toy Story ’s production , so Lasseter and producer Ralph Guggenheim made a biweekly trip to NeXT ’s headquarters ( which had recently moved from the lavish Deer Park offices to lower cost space nearby ) where they would show him clips and pretend to accept his advice .
Ten months after production moved forward , disaster struck Pixar .
The Disney executives stopped production and threatened to cancel the deal if Lasseter did n’t fix the script .
The problem was that Woody came across as caustic and mean compared to the renamed Buzz Lightyear .
That day , November 19 , became known as Black Friday at Pixar .
The employees were scared that the halt meant Disney was reneging on its agreement , but executive producer Bonnie Arnold knew better .
She was an industry veteran and knew that distributors like Disney were likely to shut down production for the smallest problem .
She enrolled Lasseter in a screenwriting class , and , in the interim , devoted some of Pixar ’s 110 employees to commercial projects .
By April 1994 , Lasseter had reworked the script to make Woody more endearing .
Lasseter added scenes to the film before Buzz Lightyear arrived that showed Woody as a sympathetic , paternal leader of the toys .
Katzenberg started production again , and Pixar started working towards a Thanksgiving 1995 release date .
The finished film filled over 1,000 CD - ROMs with 110,000 individually rendered frames .
Each frame had taken hours to prepare and render , but the film was still less expensive than Disney ’s other big animated film that year , Pocahontas .
What ’s more , Pixar had only 27 animators on staff for the entire company , including Toy Story and commercials .
Comparably long traditional animated films required at least 75 animators .
Jobs still was n’t terribly interested in what was happening at Pixar , but as November 22 neared , he perked up .
At a Disney gala in New York , hosted by Rudy Giuliani , Jobs was witness to the dramatic reactions to Pixar ’s stunning work .
He soaked up praise as the night wore on .
Several weeks later , Jobs took the title of president from Catmull .
Catmull had never been interested in being president , and it signaled Jobs ’ emergence at Pixar .
Disney spent $ 100 million on promoting Toy Story .
Buzz Lightyear cutouts were in every Burger King , and trailers littered television and preview reels around the nation .
The staff at Pixar was nervous of the amount of cash Disney was sinking into the project , fearing that it might flop .
They had little reason to worry .
On opening weekend , Toy Story earned $ 39.1 million , enough to recoup the production costs .
By the end of its theatrical release , the film had netted over $ 200 million in box office receipts , an incredible number for an animated feature .
Pixar became a household name and had proved that computer generated films were n’t just possible , but profitable .
One week after opening day , Pixar went public with a stock price set at $ 22 .
The price soared to $ 50 on the first day of trading , turning Jobs into a billionaire .
Pixar went on to renegotiate its contract with Disney and released six blockbuster films that made well over $ 1 billion .
In 2004 , Pixar declined to renew its contract with Disney and appears to be poised to distribute its films on its own .
On 2006.01.24 , Disney announced that it was acquiring Pixar for roughly $ 7.4 billion in Disney stock .
This made Jobs Disney ’s largest shareholder and turned Pixar into a wholly owned subsidiary of Disney .
