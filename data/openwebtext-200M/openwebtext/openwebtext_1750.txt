Sticker Price vs. Your Cost to Attend
One big variable in calculating best college values in monetary terms is the cost to attend .
Unfortunately , it can be fairly difficult to discern what your true net cost might be .
The stated " sticker price ” that colleges report to the Department of Education is often not representative of what a majority of students will pay .
In a Washington Post article , author and higher ed pundit Jeffrey Selingo wrote “ If colleges continue to maintain that so few people actually pay the sticker price , then maybe it ’s time for them to stop advertising it and develop a new pricing approach that is more realistic and transparent for more of their students . "
Colleges will often reduce a student ’s cost , by supplying financial aid assistance , based on family income and academic success in high school .
Schools are required to provide access to net price calculators so that students can estimate their true cost to attend , but not all students are even aware these calculators exist .
" This information gap matters , " stated a November 2014 report titled Transparency in College Costs from the Brookings Institution .
" Research suggests that providing more information to prospective students regarding what it would actually cost to attend will have a substantive impact on their higher - education decision making . "
An important milestone that should compel allÃ‚Â social networks to be much more diligent about preservingÃ‚Â privacy and providing robust security was established by federal regulators today .
The Federal Trade Commission barred Twitter from misleading consumers about privacy at any point in the nextÃ ‚Â 20 years .
The FTC also ordered the company to establish a comprehensiveÃ‚Â security program , subject to government monitoring for the next 10 years .
Twitter agreed to those terms in exchange for the FTC not pursuing a civil lawsuit against the company .
It was the agency ’ sÃ‚Â first - ever privacy enforcement action against a social network .
“ When a company promises consumers that their personal information is secure , it must live up to that promise , ” says David Vladeck , head of the FTCÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Bureau of Consumer Protection .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Likewise , a company that allows consumers to designate their information as private must use reasonable security to uphold such designations .
“ Patrons of social networking sites may choose to share some information with others , but they still have a right to expect that their personal information will be kept private and secure , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â  he says .
Global regulatory scrutiny rising
The FTC ’s bold step comes at a time when regulatory scrutiny of social networks is on the rise globally :
Privacy regulators in Canada , Germany , Britain , France and several other nations are investigating Google ’s past practice of collecting citizens ’ data transmitted over open Wi -Fi systems .
The FTC is reviewing a complaint accusing Facebook of sending personal information to online advertising companies without its usersÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ consent .
The FBI is investigating the breach of 114,000 e-mail addresses from AT&T subscribers to Apple iPad wireless accounts , including many high profile celebrities , athletes and politicos .
“ To have the U.S. government make this strong of an opinion about a privacy breach is a huge wake up call for American - based companies in this space , ” says Sophos security analyst Chet Wisniewski .
Invigorated FTC
The enforcement action “ is part of a newly reinvigorated FTC under Obama that is beginning to tackle cutting edge privacy and digital marketing issues , ” says Jeffrey Chester , executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy .
“ It signals that the FTC is examining privacy threats from social media and other under - the - radar online consumer protection concerns . ”
Chester anticipates that the FTC will also begin to “ rein in abusive digital marketing practices that place privacy at risk–or treat consumers unfairly . ”
A young Frenchman , Francois Cousteix , 23 , aka Hacker - Croll , has been arrested and tried in connection with a January 2009 caper in which a hacker gained access to the Twitter account of then - President - elect Barack Obama , using Obama ’s legit account to Tweet bogus offers for $ 500 in free gasoline to more than 150,000 of his followers .
Then in April 2009 , a hacker compromised a Twitter employeeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s personal e-mail and gained access to private user information and Tweets for any Twitter user .
For the FTC ’s official , detailed descriptions of how comparatively easy it was to pull off these hacks click here .
Holding social networks accountable
Twitter spokesman Alexander Macgillivray said in a blog post that the company has already implemented many security upgrades called for by the FTC .
At the time of the breaches , Twitter employed fewer than 50 people and was dealing with “ unprecedented user growth , ” he says .
Security and legal experts said the enforcement action signals that FTC will hold social websites strictly accountable for preserving privacyÃ‚Â and delivering secure online services .
“ It ’s a warning to any player in social networking that the FTC is taking its enforcement powers seriously and will be scrutinizing them , ” says former USDOJ prosecutor Alexander Southwell , who is now a partner at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher .
“ You now have a regulatory body looking over your shoulder whenever you ’re dealing with customers personal information and private communications .
It constrains , to some degree , what these companies can do . ”
Hopefully , the threat of hands - on government oversight will stir the top social networks to do what they should have done at the start : lock down security , says Tom Kellermann , vice president of security awareness at Core Securities Technologies .
By creating an all - comers communications medium and promoting it as secure , when it really is n’t , Twitter essentially created a “ hot zone ” ripe for spreading viralÃ‚Â attacks , says Kellermann .
He adds :
When people clicked on links they implicitly trusted Twitter ’s communications systems , but the company did not actually build the security into the system , so they put the community at large at risk .
The mentality that if - you - build - it , they - will - come is the problem .
These wonderful online meeting places we ’ve created do n’t attract only the righteous .
Miscreants and predators also congregate in these new online civilizations , Ã‚Â same as they did in ancient civilizations .

Bynamite , Mr. Acquisti said , is “ simply trying to make these kinds of transactions explicit , more transparent to the user . ”
Last week , Bynamite introduced an early , or beta , version of its software , a downloadable plug - in for browsers .
That software and its
Web service monitor what ad networks and e-commerce sites collect and assume to know about a user .
A user ’s interests are then assembled on a Web page , grouped by categories like “ news and current events , ” “ general health , ” “ travel , ” “ technology ” and “ shopping . ”
The categories are weighted by how often you visit different categories of sites or make purchases at some online merchants .
The information tracked by Bynamite is steadily updated , and , at least for me last week , a small pop-up alert at the bottom of my computer screen appeared every day , informing me of new information about me from ad networks .
Mr. Yoon calls the product ’s early version mainly a “ mirror , ” showing users how the commercial Internet sees them .
Users can change that mirror to represent their interests more accurately .
For example , I do n’t own a car , but my “ automotive ” folder soon had several entries , saying I was interested in Mercedes - Benz and other brands , presumably because middle - age men who visit the Web sites I do are typically attractive targets for car ads .
I deleted the auto interests , suggesting to advertisers that I ’m not necessarily a good prospect .
Still , I saw a few car ads on sites I later visited .
Bynamite is by no means anti-advertising .
It does not block ads .
Its Web site recommends free tools , like AdBlock and NoScript , for people who want ads blocked .
In essence , the company has a libertarian , free - market ethos .
If consumers have more power and control , it says , personal information should flow more efficiently to the benefit of both consumers and advertisers , who will be able to more accurately aim their ads .
Like most start - ups , Bynamite faces long odds .
To succeed , it must be easy to use , and users must trust it as a reliable middleman handling their data .
It has no business model yet , though it could offer product recommendations , based on interests , and collect fees on resulting sales from merchants .
It has n’t ruled out accepting ads itself .
To start , its free plug - in software works only on Mozilla and Chrome browsers .
( CNN ) --
In crime labs across the country , law enforcement officials say more and more suspects are attempting to conceal their identity through fingerprint mutilation -- defacing the skin of their fingertips .
Earlier this month , federal prosecutors in Massachusetts charged three men in a conspiracy to " help illegal aliens evade detection through the mutilation or surgical removal of their fingerprints , " according to a release from the U.S. attorney 's office .
One of the accused , Jose Elias Zaiter - Pou , a doctor originally from the Dominican Republic , allegedly performed the procedure on patients for a fee $ 4,500 .
According to Stephen G. Fischer Jr. , a spokesman for the FBI 's Criminal Justice Information Services , whose department receives approximately 200,000 fingerprints daily , methods of fingerprint mutilation can vary depending on the circumstance and the criminal .
" It can go from people chewing on fingers , using a knife , burning acid or cigarettes , " Fischer said .
" Or if you have a career criminal or someone who is a little more affluent , they might go to a surgeon . "
While no hard data on fingerprint mutilations exist , Fischer says the FBI 's forensics examiners have noticed the uptick over the last few years , though the reason is unclear .
But advancements in forensics technology have made fingerprint mutilation increasingly difficult to pull off , as even severely damaged fingers will provide investigators with clues .
" We can identify prints that we could n't 10 or 15 years ago , " Fischer said .
" Basically , they 're going through all this pain and expense for no reason . "
Massachusetts State Police Detective Lt. Kenneth Martin said he believes there 's a misconception among criminals that fingerprint mutilation will pay off .
" These are people that when [ authorities ] do find out who they are , they 're usually wanted on some serious crime , " he said .
Fingerprint mutilation is hardly a new concept .
Notorious 1930s bank robber John Dillinger attempted to evade identification by using acid to burn his fingertips , according to the National Museum of Crime and Punishment in the District of Columbia .
According Joe Polski , chief operations officer of the International Association for Identification , an organization with 7,000 members , fingerprint mutilation is still a rare occurrence .
And while it forces forensics experts to dig deeper to identify a suspect , Polski says the fact that the fingers have been adulterated is usually pretty obvious .
" Anybody who looks at those prints knows there 's something wrong , " he said .
" Nature just does n't make them like that . "
With each oily wave hitting marshes and beaches from the Gulf oil spill , desperation grows along the already stained Gulf Coast .
In part , the magnitude of the spill has simply overwhelmed the ability of the White House and BP to completely contain it .
But it is clear that bureaucratic red tape – echoing the post - Katrina federal response five years ago – has bogged down clean - up efforts as a host of agencies – OSHA , EPA , Coast Guard , Army Corps of Engineers and others – weigh in on most decisions .
Meanwhile , as November elections approach , the oil spill has a political dimension as both parties begin to use the massive oil slick from the Deepwater Horizon accident to bolster their prospects .
Democrats will point out Republican ties to Big Oil , and Republicans will chide what they 'll call a lackadaiscal response by the White House .
IN PICTURES : The Gulf oil spill 's impact on nature
If the Macondo well is capped , oil cleanup is ramped up , and no hurricanes hit the slick , the oil spill crisis is likely to eventually abate .
But the impression many Gulf Coast residents have so far is of a Keystone Kops response , where mundane regulations and misplaced priorities stand in the way of protecting local livelihoods and the Gulf 's natural environment .
" The cleanup effort is drowning in the proverbial sea of red tape , " writes Gulf Coast native Winston Groom , the author of " Forrest Gump , " in the Weekly Standard .
Here are the top five bottlenecks impeding the Gulf oil spill cleanup so far :
Enough life vests ?
The Coast Guard has not eased any of its safety regulations and will likely continue to refuse to do so .
A Louisiana effort involving 16 oil - sucking barges was shut down for nearly a day on June 18 by the Coast Guard , which wanted to make sure there were enough life vests and fire extinguishers on board .
" The Coast Guard is not going to compromise safety ... that 's our No. 1 priority , " Coast Guard spokesman Robert Brassel told The Daily Caller .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called it " frustrating . "
The Jones Act .
It 's unclear to what extent the Jones Act , a 1920 protectionist law that mandates only US vessels and crews operate within the US three - mile maritime border , has really affected the ability to move foreign oil skimmers into the spill theater .
At issue in the law is both availability and proximity of US based skimming vessels .
Several nations have said their offers of help have been rebuffed at least in part by US officials citing the Jones Act .
This week , Obama sent out a call for more nations to join the clean - up response , but the President has not publicly addressed the legal and practical issues around US law and the foreign fleets ready to help .
" We want all the skimming vessels in the world deployed , " Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser tells the Times - Picayune newspaper in New Orleans .
( Factcheck.org says , " In reality , the Jones Act has yet to be an issue in the response efforts ....
So far , offers from six foreign countries or entities have been accepted and only one offer has been rejected .
Fifteen foreign - flag vessels are working on the cleanup , and none required a waiver . " )
EPA says no , then yes .
Three days after the accident , the Dutch government offered advanced skimming equipment capable of sucking up oiled water , separating out most of the oil , and returning the cleaner water to the Gulf .
But citing discharge regulations that demand that 99.9985 percent of the returned water is oil - free , the EPA initially turned down the offer .
A month into the crisis , the EPA backed off those regulations , and the Dutch equipment was airlifted to the Gulf .
' Ever hear of Radio Shack ? '
In a recent fly - over of a spill area near Perdido Bay , BP official Doug Suttles expressed amazement that spotter plane pilots could n't communicate directly with skimming boats on the surface to direct them to oil patches .
" We need to get the skimmers to the oil , " Suttles said .
Local officials in Escambia County , Fla. , have been asking for weeks for plane - to - ship communications , to little avail .
" Have n't they ever heard of Radio Shack ? " writes Mr. Groom .
Who 's in charge here ?
President Obama has said " the buck stops " with him .
But the actual incident response command structure is a Gordian Knot for local officials requesting help and resources .
Frustrated by red tape , some officials have been warned they 'll be arrested if they take matters into their own hands .
The lack of a clear command structure has hampered the ability to move resources like booms and skimmers quickly , especially in a still - growing spill that 's at the whim of the Gulf 's ever - changing tides , currents and winds .
While most of the criticism has been heaped on federal agencies and the Obama administration , questions are being raised about the extent to which the four Gulf state governors ( all Republicans ) are responding too – specifically , on deployment of National Guard troops under their command .
In a recent investigative report , CBS News found that Louisiana 's Gov. Jindal had deployed just 1,053 of the 6,000 troops available to him .
" Alabama has deployed 432 troops of 3,000 available , " according to CBS .
" Even fewer have been deployed in Florida - 97 troops out of 2,500 - and Mississippi - 58 troops out of 6,000 . "
Jindal told CBS that the White House had instructed state officials that " Coast Guard and BP had to authorize individual tasks " for National Guard units .
But Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the national incident commander in charge of the government 's response to the spill , disputed that .
" There is nothing standing in the governor 's way from utilizing more National Guard troops , " Allen told CBS .
" Whether it 's simple confusion or the infusion of politics into the spill , the fact remains thousands of helping hands remain waiting to be used , " concluded CBS .

After Gulf swimmers report illness , questions about opening a beach
After some theoretical experiments on hash tables , I implemented a prototype for 2 - left hash tables with large buckets ( 16 entries ) to see how it ’d work in the real world .
It worked pretty well , but the way its performance scaled with table size sometimes baffled me .
Playing with the layout ( despite not fully understanding the initial prototype ’s behaviour ) helped , but the results were still confounding .
The obvious solution was to run microbenchmarks and update my mental performance model for accesses to memory !
( The full set of results are at the end , but I ’ll copy the relevant bits inline . )
1 The microbenchmark
The microbenchmark consists of ten million independent repetitions of a small loop that executes an access pattern on 16 independent cache lines .
The addresses are generated with a Galois LFSR to minimise the number of uninteresting memory accesses while foiling any prefetch logic .
There are four access patterns .
The first pattern , “ 0 ” , reads the first word in the line ; “ 0 - 3 ” reads the first and fourth words ; “ 0 - 3 - 7 ” reads the first , fourth and eighth ( last ) words ; finally , “ 0 - 3 - 7 - 8 ” reads the first , fourth and eighth words of the cache line and the first of the next cache line .
It would be interesting to test “ 0 - 8 ” , but it ’s not that relevant to my application .
The working sets are allocated in regular pages ( 4 K bytes ) or in huge pages ( 2 M bytes ) to investigate the effect of the TLB ( Translation Lookaside Buffer ) when appropriate .
A wide number of working set sizes are tested , from 16 KB to 1 GB .
Finally , “ Cache miss ” measures the number of cache misses ( that is , accesses that hit main memory ) across the execution of the program , in millions ( including a small amount of noise , e.g. to record timings ) ; “ TLB miss ” measures the number of TLB misses ( the TLB caches mappings from logical to physical address ) , again in millions ; and “ Cycle / pattern ” is the median number of cycles required to execute the access pattern once , computed as the average of 16 independent pattern executions ( without compensating for timing or looping overhead , which should be on the order of 20 - 30 cycles for all 16 executions ) .
2 Mistake number one : Use the whole cache line , it ’s free
CPUs deal with memory one cache line at a time .
Barring non-temporal accesses , reading even a single byte results in reading the whole corresponding cache line ( 64 bytes on current x86oids ) .
Thus , the theory goes , we ’re always going to pay for loading the whole cache line from memory and it should n’t be any slower to read it all than to access only a single word .
My initial prototype had buckets ( of 16 entries ) split in two vectors , one for the hash values ( four byte each , so one cache line per bucket of hash values ) , and another for the key - value pairs ( more than a cache line per bucket , but the odds of two different keys hashing identically are low enough that it should n’t be an issue ) .
Having the hashes in a vector of their own should have improved locality and definitely simplified the use of SSE to compare four hash values at a time .
The in - cache performance was as expected .
Reads had a pretty much constant overhead , with some of it hidden by out of order and superscalar execution .
In my microbenchmark , that ’s represented by the test cases with working set size from 16KB to 256KB ( which all fit in L1 or L2 caches ) .
All the misses are noise ( 5 million misses for 160 million pattern execution is negligible ) , and we observe a slow increase for “ Cycle / pattern ” as the size of the working set and the number of accesses go up .
+--------------------------------+ | 4 K pages | | 0 0- 3 0-3-7 0-3-7-8| +--------------------------------+
Size 16KB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 3.89 3.85 3.88 3.88 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.50 0.51 0.50 0.58 | Cycle / pattern | 4.50 6.25 6.50 6.50 | | | +--------------------------------+
Size 32 KB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 3.79 3.87 3.86 3.88 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.52 0.51 0.50 0.50 | Cycle / pattern | 4.75 6.25 6.25 6.50 | | | +--------------------------------+
Size 128KB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 3.80 3.67 3.84 3.66 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.52 0.36 0.50 0.39 | Cycle / pattern | 5.25 6.25 6.50 7.25 | | | +--------------------------------+
Size 256KB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 5.03 5.07 5.07 4.06 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.51 0.50 0.51 0.47 | Cycle / pattern | 5.25 6.50 7.25 7.25 | | | +--------------------------------+
Once we leave cache , for instance at 128 MB , things get weirder :
+--------------------------------+ | 4 K pages | | 0 0- 3 0-3-7 0-3-7-8 | +--------------------------------+
Size 128MB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 153.21 153.35 296.01 299.06 | TLB miss ( M ) | 158.00 158.07 158.10 160.58 | Cycle / pattern | 30.50 34.50 41.00 44.00 | | | +--------------------------------+
According to my theory , the cost for accessing additional words in the same cache line should be negligible compared to loading it from memory .
Yet , “ Cycle / pattern ” increases slowly but regularly .
I believe that the reason for that is that memory controllers do n’t read a full cache line at a time .
When an uncached address is accessed , the CPU does load the whole line into cache , but only in multiple steps .
The first step also executes much slower than the others because of the way memory is addressed in RAM : addresses are sent in two halves , first the “ column ” , and then the “ row ” .
To read an arbitrary address , both halves must be sent , one after the other .
Reading an address close to the previous one , however , only updates the row .
It ’s also interesting to note that both patterns “ 0 - 3 - 7 ” and “ 0 - 3 - 7 - 8 ” trigger about twice as many cache misses as “ 0 ” and “ 0 - 3 ” .
Yet , “ 0 - 3 - 7 ” only reads from one cache line , while “ 0 - 3 - 7 - 8 ” reads from two .
I believe that ’s because of prefetching .
We ’ll come back to the issue of multiple reads from out - of - cache memory later .
So , while it is true that it ’s better to fully use a cache line ( because it ’ll be completely read regardless ) , reading more words still incurs additional latency , and it ’s only slightly cheaper than hitting an adjacent cache line .
3 Mistake number two : Cache misses dominate everything else
In response to my better understanding of memory , I changed the layouts of my buckets to minimise the expected number of reads .
In the end , I decided to pack each bucket ’s hash values in a header of 128 bit ( the size of an XMM register ) .
With 16 bytes used for the hash values , I could append 15 key - value pairs to have a round size of 256 bytes per bucket , and execute only adjacent accesses on successful lookups .
The extra 16th hash value stored the number of entries in the bucket .
So , instead of having one vector of hash buckets and one of value buckets per subtable ( and two subtables per hash table ) :
struct entry { u64 key , val ; } ; struct hash_bucket { u32 hashes [ 16 ] ; } ; struct value_bucket { struct entry entries [ 16 ] ; } ;
I had :
struct bucket { union { vu8 pack ; // SSE vector of u8 u8 vec [ 16 ] ; } hash ; struct entry entries [ 15 ] ; } ;
The new layout meant that I only had one byte of hash value for each entry .
It was n’t such an issue , since I was already computing two independent hash values per key ( for the two subtables ) .
When working with the right subtable , I could simply store the hash value from the left subtable ( but still index buckets with the right subtable ’s hash value ) , and vice versa .
Since the hashes are independent , the odds of false positives are on the order of 5 % .
According to my new - found knowledge , this should perform really well : only one access to scan the hash values , and then , when the hash values match , the key - value pairs are at adjacent addresses .
The histogram of timings for inserts and lookups did improve and even showed nice , steep peaks ( depending on whether one or two subtables were probed ) .
Yet , there was still something really hard to explain : I seemed to run out cache much earlier than expected .
I have 256KB of L2 cache , and 12MB of L3 on my machine ... but , in my microbenchmark , we observe drastic changes in timings even between working sets of 2MB and 8MB :
+--------------------------------+ | 4 K pages | | 0 0- 3 0-3-7 0-3-7-8 | +--------------------------------+
Size 2MB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 5.06 5.10 5.11 5.14 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.67 0.85 0.88 0.90 | Cycle / pattern | 6.50 7.25 8.75 10.75 | | | +--------------------------------+
Size 8MB | | Cache miss ( M ) | 7.29 7.28 8.67 8.68 | TLB miss ( M ) | 120.45 120.55 120.63 122.52 | Cycle / pattern | 11.00 13.00 15.50 17.25 | | | +--------------------------------+
The access times nearly double , for working sets that both are much larger than L2 but do fit in L3 ( as evidenced by the very low number of cache misses ) .
This is where the “ TLB miss ” row is interesting : the number of TLB misses goes from negligible to nearly one miss per access ( each access to memory triggers a TLB lookup to map from logical to physical address ) .
The L2 TLB on my machine holds 512 pages , at 4 K each , for a total of 2MB ; a working set not fitting in TLB has as much of an impact as not fitting in cache !
I should have thought of that : people who ought to know like kernel developers or Kazushige Goto ( of GotoBLAS and libflame fame ) have been writing about the effect of TLB misses since at least 2005 .
So , I used huge pages ( 2MB instead of 4KB ) and observed a return to sanity .
On my microbenchmark , this shows up as :
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+ | 4 K pages : 2 M pages | | 0 0- 3 0-3-7 0-3-7-8 : 0 0-3 0-3-7 0-3-7-8 | +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Size 2MB | : | Cache miss ( M ) | 5.06 5.10 5.11 5.14 : 5.03 5.01 5.02 5.05 | TLB miss ( M ) | 0.67 0.85 0.88 0.90 : 0.23 0.27 0.23 0.24 | Cycle / pattern | 6.50 7.25 8.75 10.75 : 5.25 6.75 7.75 9.75 | | : | +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Size 8MB | : | Cache miss ( M ) | 7.29 7.28 8.67 8.68 : 5.21 5.22 5.22 5.25 | TLB miss ( M ) | 120.45 120.55 120.63 122.52 : 0.23 0.30 0.27 0.25 | Cycle / pattern | 11.00 13.00 15.50 17.25 : 5.00 6.75 7.75 10.00 | | : | +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Using huge pages cuts the times by almost 50 % on the microbenchmark ; that ’s on par the difference between L3 and L1 ( only ≈ 33 % , but timing overhead is much more significative for L1 ) .
More importantly , the timings are the same for two working sets that fit in L3 but largely spill out of L2 .
Improvements are almost as good when hitting main memory :

The access times are much better ( on the order of 30 % fewer cycles ) , but they also make a lot more sense : the difference in execution time between working sets that do n’t fit in last level cache ( L3 ) is a lot smaller with huge pages .
Moreover , now that TLB misses are out of the picture , accesses to two cache lines ( “ 0 - 3 - 7 - 8 ” ) are almost exactly twice as expensive as an access to one cache line ( “ 0 ” ) .
My test machine has a 32 entry TLB for 2 M pages ( and another 32 for 4 M pages , but my kernel does n’t seem to support multiple huge page sizes ) .
That ’s enough for 64 MB of address space .
Indeed , we observe TLB misses with larger working sets :

However , even with a working set of 1GB , with nearly as many TLB misses for huge as for regular pages , we see a reduction in timing by 30 - 40 % .
I think that ’s simply because the page table fits better in cache and is quicker to search .
1GB of address space uses 256 K pages ( at 4 KB each ) .
If each page descriptor uses only 16 bytes ( one quad word for the logical address and another for the physical address ) , that ’s still 4MB for the page table !
4 TL;DR
Multiple accesses to the same cache line still incur a latency overhead over only one access ( but not in memory throughput , since the cache line will be fully read anyway ) .
Use huge pages if you can .
Otherwise , you ’ll run out of TLB space at about the same time as you ’ll leave L2 ( or even earlier ) ... and TLB misses are more expensive than L2 misses , almost as bad as hitting main memory .
Prefer accessing contiguous cache lines .
If you ca n’t use huge pages or if your working set is very large , only one TLB miss is incurred for accesses to lines in the same page .
You might also benefit from automatic prefetching .
This is why cache - oblivious algorithms are so interesting : they manage to take advantage of all those levels of caching ( L1 , L2 , TLB , L3 ) without any explicit tuning , or even considering multiple levels of caches .
The test code can be found at http://discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/cache-test.c .
I could have tried to tweak the layout of my 2 - left hash table some more in reaction to my new cost model .
However , it seems that it ’s simply faster to hit multiple contiguous cache lines ( e.g. like linear or quadratic probing ) than to access a few uncorrelated cache lines ( 2 - left or cuckoo hashing ) .
I ’m not done playing with tuning hash tables for caches , though !
I ’m currently testing a new idea that seems to have both awesome utilisation and very cheap lookups , but somewhat heavier inserts .
More on that soon ( ish ) .

Figure 3 : Working sets exceed L3 , but still fit in huge TLB
Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk criticised English referee Howard Webb after his side were beaten 1 - 0 by Spain in the World Cup final .
The match was marred by constant foul play which led Webb to book 13 players including the dismissal of Dutchman Johnny Heitinga for two yellow cards .
" I do n't think the referee controlled the match well , " said Van Marwijk .
" Both sides committed fouls .
That may be regrettable for a final .
But the best team won the match . "
Webb , 38 , was booed by the Dutch supporters as he and his assistants went to collect their medals at the end of what was an extremely challenging match for the official , in which he produced a new record number of bookings for a World Cup final and was forced to deal with a series of major incidents .
You can referee wrong , make a mistake , but what you cannot do is create your own sense of justice and , even worse , invent a very personal application of the rules
Johan Cruyff
Nine of the bookings went to players from the Netherlands , who were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men in the first half when midfielder Nigel de Jong landed a boot in the chest of Xabi Alonso and in many cases
Webb was left with little choice but to caution players for overly - aggressive challenges .
In the book : Full list of cards
With the teams facing a penalty shoot - out as the game was drawing to a close , Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta smashed in a half - volley - which ultimately won the game for Spain - leaving the Dutch incensed after Webb had failed to award their side a corner moments earlier when a Wesley Sneijder free - kick took a deflection off Cesc Fabregas .
Dutch defender Joris Mathijsen was booked for protesting the goal and afterwards goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg continued the condemnation of Webb , saying : " You blame the referee .
Everybody outside the stadium can see it was a corner but he did n't and the assistant also . "
Arjen Robben had missed the Netherlands ' two best chances of the match , which both came from one - on - ones with goalkeeper Iker Casillas .
The second of these produced another contentious incident , when Robben was pulled back by Spain defender Carles Puyol outside the area but stayed on his feet before the ball bobbled to Casillas .
Robben was incensed with Webb for his failure to award a free - kick - which could have earned Puyol a second yellow card - and chased the official , earning himself a booking in the process .
" It is very clear , " said Robben .
" He has to send him off and he has to give a free - kick .
In the end there was no advantage .
It cost us because I did n't go down .
" We were 10 minutes before the end of the game .
If we score a goal there we can win the game .
But I could n't score because the goalkeeper was too close . "
Van Marwijk added : " We made a real game out of it and we had two great chances through Arjen .
" I 'm not someone to look back on what the referee did .
I think the best team usually wins the match .
" But if you look at the second chance of Robben , the referee should give Puyol a second yellow card , which would have meant him being sent off .
" It was a crucial moment just before the end of the 90 minutes .
It is very bitter , but that is sport .
It is harsh .
And as I said , Spain were the better team . "
The Netherlands were extremely physical in their attempts to break up Spain 's passing game - an approach that proved effective for much of the match but which earned them nine yellow cards as a result , including Heitinga 's second .
But the Dutch coach defended his side , saying : " It was still our intention to play beautiful football , but we were facing a very good opponent .
" Spain are the best footballing country in the past few years , so we needed to have a top day to beat them .
" We did a good job tactically on them .
We got into good positions at times .
It 's not our style , but you play a match to win .
" It 's a World Cup final , and there 's a lot of emotion out there .
You saw that with both teams .
I would have loved to have won that match , even with not so beautiful football . "
And while admitting that Spain are " a terrific side " , former Chelsea star Robben felt Webb 's performance was not up to the required standard .
Paul Fletcher blog
The Netherlands were obviously intent on stopping Spain , although Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk insisted his players stayed within the law
" It was a World Cup final , " said Robben .
" You are talking about two aggressive teams who want to win .
It was for the referee to control the game .
" It is wrong when you sit in the dressing room together and you are only talking about the referee and his very bad points .
" There were some strange decisions and for me , honestly , if you play a World Cup final , you need a world class referee .
I do n't know whether that was a world - class performance from the referee . "
Dutch legend Johan Cruyff was critical of the Netherlands ' aggressive style of play in the final but also had harsh words for Webb .
" When we say , often , that we do not like talking about referees , it is true , " he told Spanish paper El Periodico .
" Above all , because only refereeing like that last night by the English Howard Webb can create in us a state of such indignation that then yes , it is necessary to comment .
" Because you can referee wrong , make a mistake , but what you can not do is create your own sense of justice and , even worse , invent a very personal application of the rules .
" Not only did he not send off two Dutchmen but he also looked the other way at times when he should have involved himself .
" A World Cup final deserves great refereeing and , above all , deserves a referee who dares to do everything it means to be a judge . "
Speaking on BBC Match of the Day , former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen condemned the Dutch approach and defended Webb , who is one of the few full - time referees in world football .
" If the Dutch had triumphed , it would have been bad for the game because there is no place for the way they approached the match , " stated Hansen .
" It 's one thing to have a game plan , be organised and get men behind the ball , but the cynical way in which they operated for the first 45 minutes was a total and utter disgrace .
Van Marwijk ( left ) remonstrated angrily with Webb after the final whistle
"
" Howard Webb tried to make the game flow but on this occasion he was left with no choice . "
Former England manager and BBC 5 Live summariser Graham Taylor was similarly critical of the Dutch , saying : " You have to play within the laws of the game and one has to say that on two or three occasions they did n't .
The tackle by De Jong into the chest of Alonso , Howard Webb must have missed that because that is a red card , you do n't tackle people like that . "
Webb was awarded control of the World Cup final - the first Englishman since Jack Taylor in 1974 to be bestowed the honour - following his impressive handling of his three previous games , in which he showed 17 yellow cards .
The Yorkshireman was widely praised for his player - management skills during a tense match in Group F earlier in the competition , which saw Slovakia eliminate 2006 World Cup winners Italy courtesy of a 3 - 2 victory .
He and his assistants Darren Carr and Mike Mullarkey became the first officials to have refereed a Champions League final and World Cup final in the same year .
Webb has emerged as the Premier League 's top referee following the retirement of Graham Poll , who came in for criticism himself during the 2006 World Cup after he showed three yellow cards to Croatia 's Josep Simunic during their match with Australia .
Despite the criticism of his side 's display , Van Marwijk was quick to heap praise on his players after they reached the third World Cup final in the nation 's history .
" No one expected us to be here , in the final .
We even came even very close to a penalty shoot - out .
We could even have scored through Robben , " added Van Marwijk .
" Whether we would have deserved that , I do n't know .
But it 's a final .
It 's very disappointing .
You want to win it , and we might have done .
I think we performed really , really well to get this far .
" The team that scored the first goal was going to win that match .
Those chances for Robben could have meant victory for us .
But , unfortunately , we were n't so lucky . "

I was sitting on a young woman 's bed when two men burst in and slammed hard into my shoulder , sending us all sprawling in a heap of arms and legs .
I was watching two near - naked men caressing each other , and a football , when a gunman ordered me out amid a cacophony of howls and screams .
I was perched on a hotel toilet when a golden - robed transvestite lying in the bath extracted a swab of my saliva and fragment of my fingernail .
But perhaps more unusual than any of these , I was white , middle - class and walking around Hillbrow in inner-city Johannesburg and Kliptown in Soweto .
The reason was X Homes Johannesburg , a weird and wonderful public art project co-produced by the Goethe Institut in South Africa and Christopher Gurk of the Hebbel Am Ufer Theatre in Berlin .
It involved a walking tour of two to three hours , stopping at private houses , flats , hotels and other nooks and crannies to watch oddball performances by local and international artists , some of which were highly interactive .
Hillbrow has seen better days and now has a notoriety reminiscent of the Bronx in 1970s New York .
Louis Theroux , clad in body armour , shot a documentary there that portrayed a dystopia of drug lords , vigilantism and the hijacking of entire buildings .
I 've met people in Johannesburg who would sooner visit Kabul or Mogadishu .
The mission of X Homes , however , was " to change the perception of urban spaces , which many inhabitants of Johannesburg know only from rumours in the media , and to produce images beyond the projection of violence and fear ever present in this country " .
That did n't prevent us from having to sign a responsibility waiver form before the tour began .
In a group of four we were led into a grim and grimy block of flats with graffiti and shattered windows .
Inside one of them an actress spoke a lament for Hillbrow 's golden age , recalling the clubs , the jazz , the arthouse cinemas showing films like Paris , Texas and The Last Picture Show .
A member of the group mentioned that she used to live here and walk the streets until two in the morning .
She pointed to the once beautiful Chelsea Hotel and said it 's now a Nigerian drugs den .
I gazed around at the shells of elegant art deco buildings that now reminded me of decaying shipwrecks on the ocean floor .
We carried on to performance after performance , up nine floors of stairs in decrepit buildings where the lifts had long ceased to work , on to roofs where baby clothes hung on washing lines , down past sparring boxers to the basement of a gym .
Here , with a TV blaring and red candles glowing from the floor , a man paraded in high heels , his face and torso obscured by a huge cluster of balloons .
Later we shuffled through body - height turnstiles and squeezed into a lift that struggled upwards with noises that suggested the rumbling belly of a beast .
We walked along a corridor similar to tower blocks in Britain 's sink estates .
Through a doorway , a woman in World Cup regalia greeted us while others blew vuvuzelas .
We were ushered into the living room where a television showed clips of football — interspersed , occasionally , with snatches of explicit gay porn .
Then two men , one black , one white , stripped and began a strange sexual dance with a football pressed between their bare flesh .
Eventually they leaped into bed and began to heave and groan .
But we were taken to the window , the curtain lowered behind us , and told to watch everyday Hillbrow life take its course in the park below .
Then we were chased away by intruders waving pistols .
This sketch was the work of Bruce LaBruce , a " Canadian avant - garde gay porn filmmaker " .
" This is so hardcore , " he said of the X Homes project in an interview with South Africa 's Mail and Guardian .
" It 's not for sissies .
And it 's not politically correct .
It 's not tiptoeing around race and culture issues .
" On those terms there 's nothing bleeding - heart liberal about it .
It 's not about outreach , you know , trying to improve the lives of these poor , underprivileged people .
It 's nothing like that at all . "
In another Hillbrow flat a woman recounted her experience at the hands of a gang who threatened to shoot her .
On the table , the photograph of her bruised face suggested this story was real .
As we walked among the traffic and street markets there were some curious glances in our direction but nothing more .
" I have n't felt threatened once , " one of our group said .
But it 's facile to say that crime in Hillbrow is purely a mythical demon conjured by middle - class dinner parties in the northern suburbs .
It 's real and I 've met some of the victims .
But yes , it is hyped and exaggerated too .
Soweto was no less surreal .
In a brick house around the corner from the Soweto country club I sat on a sofa watching a man peel off innumerable T - shirts while humming Mozart and dancing like a puppet .
In Kliptown I was filmed enacting a single line from Quentin Tarantino 's movie Jackie Brown to a man in a woman 's wig .
I was led on a walk over some railway lines to a settlement of shacks and dirt tracks , more District 9 than sanitised township tour .
A young woman hurled rubbish over a fence , a child with a squint wandered aimlessly and a solitary water tap leaked into the mud .
One deserted building looked like a ruin from a warzone , but most of the houses were small structures improvised from chunks of corrugated metal .
This desperate setting was a stage too .
A woman studied me nervously from behind her front door , then demanded what I wanted , then thrust a leg , and a bottom , and a breast at me before slamming it shut .
Nearby , amid pockmarked walls and peeling paint , a poet told the story of a devil 's daughter , accompanied by a stirring drumbeat and a woman 's soulful songs .
It is said that the World Cup helped force middle - class South Africans out of their cars , and their customary security bubbles , into public transport and public spaces where they rarely venture .
X Homes took the process one step further .
It was imaginative , irreverent and at times rather insane , with several candidates for pseuds ' corner .
I hope it comes back .
" Verrückte an der Macht " Thomas Pany
Der Wirtschaftsnobelpreisträger Paul Krugman hält die Sparprogramme in Europa für eine " sehr große Dummheit " .
Der renommierte Ökonom Paul Krugman nimmt kein Blatt mehr vor den Mund und geißelt den europäischen Sparkurs .
Doch man muss kein Wirtschaftsnobelpreisträger sein , um die Sparpolitik , die derzeit in Europa zum Dogma erhoben wird , als Rezept für ein Desaster zu bezeichnen .
Europa spart sich zu Tode und könnte sich in die nächste Rezession sparen .
Dass das Spardogma nun auch von den G - 20 - Staaten übernommen wurde , hat Krugman dazu gebracht , die Herrschenden als " Verrückte an der Macht " zu bezeichnen .
So jedenfalls titelt er in seinem Blog .
Er hält es für " sehr große Dummheit " , gerade jetzt die Staatsausgaben herunterzufahren .
Die wirtschaftliche
Lage sei noch zu labil , weshalb das Bremsen der Gesamtnachfrage mit den Sparplänen die Erholung belaste .
" Es ist unglaublich , dass das passiert , obwohl die Arbeitslosigkeit in den Euroländern weiter zunimmt und sich auch in den USA kaum zurückbildet . "
Tatsächlich hatte gerade die Europäische Statistikbehörde ( Eurostat ) gemeldet , dass die Arbeitslosigkeit in der Eurozone im April weiter auf 10,1 % angestiegen ist .
Auch neueste Daten vom Arbeitsmarkt in den USA hatten zuletzt neue Sorgen um die Konjunkturentwicklung geschürt .
Falscher Zeitpunkt für Sparprogramme
Doch auch Krugman geht davon aus , dass die Staatsschulden vieler Staaten zu hoch sind .
Aber er meint , jetzt sei der falsche Zeitpunkt für Sparprogramme .
Jetzt zu sparen sei " vollkommen wirkungslos , um die künftigen Schulden zu reduzieren " .
Krugman meint , dass die Sparanstrengungen dazu führten , dass auch die Einnahmen der Staaten weiter zurückgehen werden .
Wegen steigender Arbeitslosigkeit würden auch Transferleistungen steigen , weshalb die Sparanstrengungen wirkungslos verpufften und letztlich die Staaten " sehr teuer " zu stehen kämen .
Er verweist auf Daten des Internationalen Währungsfonds ( IWF ) .
Demnach rühre gut die Hälfte der Neuverschuldung der Staaten aus geringeren Einnahmen .
18 % gehen auf Stützungsmassnahmen zurück und nur 11 Prozent seien höheren Finanzierungskosten zuzuordnen .
Spanien : Gefahr für den Euro
Vor allem dürfte Krugman Länder wie Spanien im Blick haben .
Dort ist die Arbeitslosigkeit überdurchschnittlich hoch und die Staatsverschuldung unterdurchschnittlich niedrig .
Deshalb hätte das Land noch Spielraum für einen anderen Kurs .
Doch am Scheideweg haben sich die Sozialdemokraten dem Sparzwang der EU gebeugt , der dem Land mit dem Rettungspaket aufgezwungen wurde .
Doch , so warnt Krugman schon seit längerem , geht von Spanien eine große Gefahr für den Euro aus .
Sogar die Ratingagentur Fitch sieht im Sparkurs eine Belastung für die Konjunktur und stufte deshalb Spaniens Kreditwürdigkeit herab , was die Finanzierungskosten steigen lässt .
Der harte und unausgewogene Kurs sorgt dort nun auch für Streiks und der Generalstreik ist offenbar nicht mehr abzuwenden , nachdem am frühen Morgen nach zehn Stunden die Sozialpaktgespräche über die auch von Brüssel geforderte Arbeitsmarktreform gescheitert sind .
Doch diese Konflikte werden die wirtschaftliche Erholung weiter erschweren .
Auswirkungen auf Deutschland
Tatsächlich gibt es schon Anzeichen , dass der allgemeine Sparkurs sich auch schon auf Deutschland auswirkt .
Noch im März waren die deutschen Exporte auf ein Rekordniveau gestiegen .
Damit ist der Aufwärtstrend gebrochen .
Im April lieferten deutsche Firmen schon wieder 5,9 % weniger Güter und Dienstleistungen ins Ausland .
Die Importe gingen sogar um 7,3 % zurück , meldete das Statistische Bundesamt am Dienstag .
In einer vernetzten Welt , so Krugman , würde sich der Sparkurs auch bald negativ auf die Entwicklung in den USA auswirken , wo derzeit , anders als in der EU , ein hohes Wachstum verzeichnet wird .

( CNN ) -- Former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will pursue a lawsuit against conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart .
Breitbart posted an edited video clip of Sherrod appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance .
The clip showed her addressing a chapter of the NAACP .
" I will definitely do it , " she said when asked whether she was considering legal action .
Sherrod made her remarks during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in San Diego , California .
Breitbart " had to know that he was targeting me , " Sherrod said .
" At this point , he has n't apologized .
I do n't want it at this point , and he 'll definitely hear from me . "
Breitbart did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
He has said he released the Sherrod video because he believes it shows the NAACP itself tolerates racist behavior within its ranks -- an accusation that came after the civil rights group made a similar charge against the conservative Tea Party movement .
" This was not about Shirley Sherrod , " Breitbart told CNN's John King .
Brent Bozell , head of the conservative Media Research Center , said Thursday Sherrod was the one who needed to apologize .
" Andrew Breitbart is going to be fine .
He 's done nothing wrong , " Bozell said .
" I wonder if Ms. Sherrod , who is such a champion of transparency , will publicly disclose who is putting her up to this .
And I also hope this champion of honesty will stop lying about Fox News , " which has been accused of pushing the story before full details emerged , he said .
" I 'm also waiting for Ms. Sherrod to publicly apologize for accusing anyone opposed to nationalized healthcare of being racist , " Bozell said .
" Last time I checked , that was more than half the country . "
The controversy surrounding the clip led to a rush to judgment and Sherrod 's forced resignation .
However , it was later determined that her speech , unedited , focused on how the incident changed her outlook and made her realize people should move beyond race .
The incident occurred 24 years ago , before Sherrod began working for the USDA .
She received an official apology from the USDA and a phone call from President Barack Obama once the full text of her remarks came to light .
Sherrod has since been offered another position at the Agriculture Department .
Obama said earlier Thursday that Sherrod " deserves better than what happened last week . "
Speaking at a National Urban League conference in Washington , Obama called the claim of racism against her " bogus . "
" Many are to blame " for the reaction that followed , he said , " including my own administration . "
Her whole story , Obama said he told Sherrod , " is exactly the kind of story we need to hear in America ( because ) we all have our biases . "

Lara Cory :
There are recurring images in your paintings , art prints , drawings , and posters .
We see telephone poles and wires , silhouettes of forests at night , skeletons beneath flower bushes , dotted winter landscapes , bare trees against solid color backgrounds , and houses with the lights left on in the dead of night .
What interests you about these specific images , running through your body of work ?
Night Air – 5 color screen print ( glows in the dark )
Dan McCarthy :
Well , I was first attracted to telephone wires and poles because I liked the idea of drawing attention to something that was generally overlooked or ignored .
Also , the variety of intersecting lines are a lot of fun to draw .
I use skeletons in my works to represent death .
Much of my art explores the concept of death and rebirth .
O is for Orchid , oil on linen , 15 x 15
Dan McCarthy : Death is something I think about often .
It ’s something I fear .
But I ’m also curious about it .
The forests , night skies , and lighted windows are part of my surroundings ; I see them all the time .
And I feel them .
I ’ll just stand outside at night and feel inspired to create a piece of art from the feeling I get from standing underneath the stars .
Gloaming , Poughkeepsie , ( 2007 ) 48 ″ x 36 ″ , acrylic on canvas
LC : I love how you ’ve established a body of work in a variety of mediums .
What types of methods or techniques do you use in your paintings , prints and posters ?
Dan McCarthy : Thank you .
My posters and prints are screen printed .
I start with a pen and ink drawing , and then I scan the drawing into Photoshop and add the color on different layers .
From Photoshop , I print out films of each color layer and expose each layer onto a screen .
After that , I begin the printing process .
All of my paintings share a similar , dominant style .
This comes from the careful layering of each color and not using use more than 4 or 5 colors .
You could say my painting style is more graphic than painterly .

LC : Here ’s a question you probably get all the time . . .
But where do these skills and talents come from ?
How did you develop into the artist you are today –with a distinct , not to mention extremely popular , line of art prints ?
Dan McCarthy : Ha , ha . . .
I studied art in Boston ( The School of the Museum of Fine Arts ) .
And there , I just took all sorts of classes : drawing , painting , animation , etching , lithography , screen printing .
Screen printing really caught my interest .
I loved doing it and started making posters for a band I played in , and then I made posters for my friends ’ bands and so on . . .
Lately I ’ve been more focused on creating art prints and paintings .
I occasionally do an album cover or two and I ’ve illustrated a few book covers .
3 color screen print 15 x 24
LC : Rock posters for Wilco and Andrew Bird .
That ’s impressive .
Dan McCarthy : Well , it did n’t begin that way .
Since I graduated in 1999 , I continued printing posters and making art and then I took a graphic design job for a small company .
In 2004 , I left the company and started working on my own .
I became an freelance graphic designer and made screen - printing posters for independent clients .
Around that time , I also launched the Print Club , a project in which I design and print an art print every month of the year — which has continued to this day .
Rousseau ’s Transmission ( for ABC’S LOST ) ( 2010 ) , 6 color screen print , 18″x30 ″ ( 2010 )
LC : Tell us about your widely - popular LOST poster . . . and are there any other projects in the works ?
Dan McCarthy :
You know , I loved making the LOST poster .
I ’m a huge fan of the show and I was extremely excited when at an exhibition of mine in San Francisco , a guy came up to me and asked if I would be interested in being part of the project .
These are the details if you ’re interested in knowing what it was all about :
In celebration of LOST ’s final season and as a project of fan appreciation , 16 top designers and artists , who are also fans of the show , were commissioned to create artwork celebrating one of the series ’ most memorable , and unforgettable , “ water cooler ” moments .
This ultimate “ fan art ” was then turned into labor intensive , hand - pulled screen prints , limited to an edition of just 300 , with less than 200 available to the public through our websites .
Each beautiful poster tells its own different story , allowing the fan to relive memorable and influential moments in an artistic manner , as the show ’s storied run comes to a close .
Once this limited edition print has sold out , they will never be printed again .
Celebrate the fandom , community and family created by one of televisions ’ greatest shows by hanging a little part of it ’s history , inspiration and influence on your wall .
( from LOST blog )
I was really happy to do it .
There are a couple other projects I ’m working on . . . but unfortunately I can’t discuss them here .
Sketching : The Animal Kingdom , ( 2009 ) 4 color screen print – 25″x19 ″
LC : Non-disclosure agreement , got it !
On another topic , do your favourite artists influence your work ?
And in what ways ?
Dan McCarthy : I am definitely influenced by early Japanese print makers like Hokusia and Hiroshige .
I love the simplicity of color and line work .
As for subject matter , I feel I am influenced by nearly everything .
For example , last night I was watching an episode from the series “ Through the Wormhole ” .
It ’s on the Science Channel , and hosted by Morgan Freeman .
Just watching it , I was flooded with all sorts of new ideas for my art .
Also , I collect Time and Life science books from the 70’s and regularly use the illustrations and photos as inspiration .
We ’ll all float on ( 2008 ) , 2 color screenprint
LC : Well , I just want to thank you for speaking with me .
I ’ve learned a lot about the growth and development of your career and life as an artist .
Dan McCarthy : My pleasure .
Thanks for inviting me to share . . .

Linux Mint 9 Isadora -
You betrayed me , dear !
Updated : June 30 , 2010
Linux Mint is a very popular , Ubuntu - based Linux distribution .
It 's Ubuntu with extra polish and more features for new and less experienced people , making it friendly and usable out of the box .
For me , the general sentiment has always run true .
Mint has shown good behavior and never fell short of the expectations .
Funny though , for an unknown , cosmic reason , I have always tested the even - numbered Mint releases , Daryna , Felicia , Helena .
Today , I 'll break the rule and have a go at Mint 9 , codename Isadora .
Linux Mint 9 is a very important , very critical release .
Why , you ask ?
Well , first , it is based on Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx , a Long Term Support ( LTS ) release , which will offer updates and patches till mid 2013 ; this is a good thing for people who do not fancy upgrading every six months .
Second , Isadora has a daring task of being better than its parent .
That 's the rule ; Linux Mint comes out a month after Ubuntu , pimped up with all the little details and features that are not included in Ubuntu by default .
Now , if Ubuntu 10.04 were a bad release , this would be an easy task .
However , as it turns out , Lucid Lynx is the best Ubuntu release yet .
Let 's take a look .
Two laptops : T60 p , with ATI card , 32 - bit dual core , 2GB RAM , RD510 , with Nvidia 9600GS , 64 - bit dual core , 4GB RAM .
On the menu : live CD session , Wireless , Bluetooth , Samba sharing , web camera , multimedia , installation , applications , package manager , Compiz , performance , memory usage , suspend & hibernate , problems , and more .
Live session - Green and somewhat rusty
Booting into the live session was a fairly uneventful affair .
You 're greeted by the traditional Mint desktop , all fresh , minty and green .
The desktop theme in Isadora is very similar to the one used in the last release , Helena .
You get the same layout , the same set of icons , plus the omnipotent , highly useful and practical Menu , which is very similar to the one in openSUSE .
Wireless and Bluetooth worked without any problems .
Samba sharing worked , too .
On RD510 , the web camera worked well and the Nvidia drivers were there , too .
Some small trouble arriveth
Unfortunately , a few problems cropped in that soured the deal , mostly on T60 p , which I believe mostly have to do with the unholy pair of ATI graphic card and the new open - source drivers built - in into the kernel .
But not only .
Touchpad mouse
For a weird reason , on T60 p , the touchpad mouse did not work while the tracker mouser worked fine .
The USB mouse also had no problems .
After logging out and logging back in , things were back to normal .
On RD510 , there were no such issues .
Visual inconsistencies
True for both laptops :
When you connect to Wireless , you get the standard Ubuntu notification , high up and to the right .
This does not work well in Ubuntu , either , as it leaves too much of a gap between the top panel and the notification itself .
In Mint , this is completely out of place , since the system menu is at the bottom of the screen .
Not really important , but could be polished a little .
The notification just does not sit well - the offset is just wrong .
There 's also the Restricted Drivers notification .
This is strictly related to Ubuntu , but it remains in Mint .
Normal people do not equate restricted with proprietary ; the word restricted has a negative connotation , as in lacking features .
Since Linux
Mint improves the Ubuntu baseline , this notification could go away .
Another bit I noticed was the arrangement of icons in the system area , including the spacing of elements .
When the system boots , you get icons with a fairly decent spacing between them , although the Wireless button could go left a little more .
But when you launch a few applications that place icons in the system area , the harmony is disturbed .
The Wireless icon goes further left and is displaced by a media player icon .
To make things worse , another icon encroaches from the left and introduces a non-even spacing , creating a small nightmare for OCD - blessed people .
And another example , with the package manager icon ; simply too close together for comfort .
This is the Feng Shui of desktops .
If you measure the space between sound , battery , Bluetooth , Wireless , and package manager icons , you have 25 px , 25 px , 16 px , 2 px .
Comparing to Ubuntu Lucid , I must admit that Ubuntu does a much better job .
First , the order of icons , then , even when new icons are added , the harmony is maintained .
The bottom panel lacks applets
Again , only T60 p ; RD510 behaved well .
This was the one big problem I encountered .
The bottom panel lacked several important applets , including the workspace switcher and the window list .
This meant that any minimized application simply vanished from the view .
Furthermore , Alt +
Tab did not work either .
Here 's an example ; there 's no Firefox windows button anywhere :
I had to manually add the applets to be able to work normally .
I tested five times , rebooting into live session .
The problem has occurred only once and has not haunted me since , but it did leave its nasty , stinging first impression on my proverbial cheek .
We could blame the laptop , but it works fine , had no issues with other distros tested and passes the memtest with flying colors .
We could blame the user , me .
With no clear indication what went wrong , it 's quite possible you will never see this occur , but you should be aware that it might .
Multimedia
Loving Mint , I decided to keep going and see how well things fared elsewhere .
Multimedia out of the box , that 's one of the promises .
Indeed , things worked as expected , no issues .
Compiz
Well , it did not really work in the live session .
On T60 p , with the somewhat inferior card , activating Compiz brought things to a crawl .
How much ?
Well , trying to rotate the cube took more than 30 seconds to get the first frame to display , after which I gave up .
We 'll examine this later on , after the installation .
However , considering that Compiz blazed even on T42 , with an even older and more inferior card , in PCLinuxOS and Mandriva , this makes for a very bad first impression .
Worse yet , there were no proprietary ( restricted ) drivers available .
ATI drivers started being an issue in Jaunty , where legacy support for very old cards was removed from the repository , bringing about a slowdown in performance using the alternative open - source drivers .
There 's a way around this , but it 's not the most elegant solution .
Then , with Ubuntu Lucid , things took a new spin , with Nouveau , kernel mode settings and whatnot .
Linux
Mint managed to evade the graphics problems quite elegantly , offering very decent results until Isadora .
In fact , Helena outperformed Karmic .
Now , though , the competitive edge has been lost .
On RD510 , enabling Compiz required the install of hardware drivers , so I could not test until after the installation .
Time to install and see what gives .
Installation
The installation went fairly smoothly overall .
But there were a few , small visual glitches to spoil the perfection .
The user menu was too small and the home folder setup options were cropped .
The inset frame is also a bit out of place , with two shades of gray and not enough padding for the elements , creating a cheap , non-professional effect .
During the installation , you have a slideshow telling you about Mint features .
Truth to be told , one of the slides tells you that you need no special system maintenance tools , like a registry cleaner .
Indeed , Janitor , which is included in Ubuntu , is not available in Mint .
I find this a very smart move .
The download of language packs was very slow and it took almost 40 minutes to complete .
Skipping it seemed like the best idea , but I did not want to do this .
Mint sits nicely with other operating systems , including combos with GRUB legacy and GRUB 2 bootloaders .
On RD510 , I had Mint installed on an external USB disk , the same one already hosting two flavors of Ubuntu and soon a home to Fedora 13 .
With Isadora in place , this makes for the seventh boot entry , alongside the four resident ones on the local disk .
We 'll have the ten - boot system fairly soon .
Now , into the desktop .
Gamboling with the Irish pixie
The second boot into the desktop on T60 p got stuck , with a flickering screen .
After rebooting , things were fine .
Still , a hint of doubt did creep into my heart .
I have not encountered any signs of instability or code bugs with Lucid .
RD510 , no issues .
Welcome screen
I like the welcome screen .
It 's the closest thing to an interactive tour .
The screen explains briefly the highlights of the distribution and points the user to documentation , help , as well as additional , useful bits of information .
Panel issues , gone
No problem with the panel applets .
The desktop behaved normally and displayed the minimized windows as expected .
Alt +
Tab worked .
Compiz again
After the installation , Compiz behaved on T60p .
Even when loading the system with a handful of applications and triggering several effects at once , there was no slowdown or jitter .
Effects transition was smooth and clean .
In fact , Mint was back to its familiar good graphic performance .
This makes the ordeal all the more weird .
On RD510 , there were no issues , but then , there never were with proper Nvidia drivers .
Performance & memory usage
Mint has an exceptionally good performance on older hardware .
On T60 p , the memory footprint was extremely low , at around 180 - 190 MB , less than most distributions .
On RD510 , the usage was similar to most other Linux flavors , with around 400 MB of RAM taken .
Isadora is a very green release , both color - wise and when it comes to power consumption and utilization , which translates into extended battery life .
While most contemporary distros offer slightly less than three hours on the T60 p 6 - cell battery , Isadora offers close to four hours .
Suspend & hibernate
Worked great , including when installed to an external USB disk .
Boot performance
I used bootchart to time the machine startup with Mint installed over Lucid .
Compared to its parent , Mint is about 5 seconds slower on T60 p , if you recall my article on boot times from just a few days ago .
Twenty seconds is still quite impressive , but this makes for a 25 % decrease .
Must be the extra drivers that Mint loads .
I did not time the performance on the external disk , as it cannot be directly compared with installations on a local disk .
Appearance
Linux Mint 9 has a very soft , very smart theme .
But if you do n't like it , you can switch to a number of other themes , including stuff used in previous versions , which makes for a breeze of nostalgia .
Lightning and Wild Mint look quite lovely .
Applications
Isadora packs a very decent and varied arsenal that tops that of Lucid , with GIMP included and Pidgin as the default instant messenger .
There 's Firefox , Thunderbird , OpenOffice , Rhythmbox , Gnome player , Gwibber , Brasero , and more .
You also get a handful of useful system tools , like Giver , upload manager , backup software , remastering software , USB writer , firewall GUI , and the wrapper for Windows Wireless drivers .
Last but not the least , you have the smart , level - oriented Update Manager .
And that would be all , I guess .
Conclusion
Isadora is unto Helena what Karmic was unto Jaunty .
Karmic was not a revolution .
Unfortunately , neither is Isadora .
Overall , the operating system is all good and well , but the extra edge of wow that was always there is gone .
Comparing Lucid and Isadora head to head , Isadora does bring a handful of improvements , which should not be sneezed at .
You get multimedia out of the box .
Compiz is there , too , and it works fairly well on older hardware with inferior cards , although not perfectly .
You have GIMP and Pidgin .
On the other hand , Isadora introduces a few glitches and problems that even out the advantages .
While the live session is a one - time affair , you cannot neglect the first impression .
Failing to boot once or twice can also ruin a man 's day .
Slight visual inconsistencies do make a difference , a bad one .
Compiz could have worked better , especially considering what Mandriva and PCLinuxOS manage on the same hardware .
Isadora gave a spotless performance on the newer hardware , save for the generic problems , which mainly revolve around the visual glitches .
On the older machine , there were troubles and I guess I should blame the built - in open - source graphics drivers as they did cause issues with Lucid here and there .
It is entirely likely that I 'm befouling Isadora because of something completely unrelated , but I cannot ignore the facts or the weird symptoms .
It could all be the evil manifestation of things called DMS and KMS or whatever , modules sitting atop the 25 - year old implementation of X Windows , but it did spoil things a bit .
Overall , at the end of the day , Isadora is a very good distribution .
But it lacks the extra edge that always made Mint super - shine .
Given the choice between Ubuntu and Mint , this time , it 's a tie , which means Linux Mint lost .
It also speaks highly of what Ubuntu managed to achieve with their LTS .
If you like Mint , Isadora is a good choice .
If you are looking for a breathtaking experience , this time , I 'm afraid it 's not going to happen .
Which reminds me - stick with Mint autumn releases .
Cheers .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Oil company BP BP , - 2.19 % BP , - 1.18 % said Monday that the cost of the response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has reached around $ 3.5 billion .
The group also said that the installation of a new sealing cap that is intended to capture more of the leaking oil is proceeding as planned .
BP is developing further containment systems that should be able to capture between 60,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day and the group said it expects these projects to begin operations towards the end of July .
On Saturday , a total of 15,200 barrels of oil were collected or flared and 35.2 million cubic feet of gas were flared .
The company said it has so far received 105,000 claims and has made payments on roughly 52,000 of them .
Players complaining about the new ball :
It 's one of the traditions that returned like clockwork with this World Cup , along with egregious diving , English misery , and American fans perking up when the team performs and then swearing off soccer for another four years when USA crashes out .
But while equipment discontent typically fades as the tournament enters its final stages , anger toward World Cup 2010 's Jabulani ball wo n't subside .
So Caltech scientists decided to find out for themselves :
They took the ball into their lab 's wind tunnel to see if it 's really so bad .
If you 've spent any time kicking around a soccer ball , you 'll remember that it is n't a perfect sphere , but rather is made of geometric panels with grooves in between .
But while a traditional ball contains 32 panels , the Jabulani contains only 8 , which made the team led by Beverly McKeon suspect there could be something to the complaints about its erratic behavior .
Consider the history of the golf ball , which was smooth back in the mid-1800s .
" The Scots learned the hard way , " McKeon said .
The addition of dimples made for a rougher surface but a narrower wake and less drag , which contributed to straighter , longer trajectories .
To some degree , the Jabulani represents a shift in the opposite direction , even with tiny ridges covering its skin .
Caltech 's study suggests that it starts with a smooth — or laminar — airflow , shifts to something more turbulent , then shifts back again [ Los Angeles Times ] .
The scientists say those shifts they saw in the lab ( see video here
) could be responsible for the odd reactions we 've seen from goalkeepers in this World Cup , like English ' keeper Robert Green 's notorious misplay
against the United States .
" So as the goalkeeper sees the ball coming , it suddenly seems to change its trajectory , " McKeon said .
" It 's like putting the brakes on , but putting them on unevenly " [ Los Angeles Times ] .
Altitude also could be adding to the Jabulani 's misbehavior .
That 's the defense coming from Erik Van Leeuwen of Adidas , the ball 's manufacturer .
Six of the 10 World Cup stadiums are above 1,200 meters ( 3,937 feet ) , where the air is thinner .
That may be affecting the Jabulani ’s movement , Van Leeuwen said .
A ball kicked at altitude travels 5 percent faster than one kicked in Durban , which is at sea level , he said [ Bloomberg ] .
FIFA , soccer 's governing body , says it 's aware of the concerns about Jabulani .
But for at least the rest of this tournament , players are going to have to get used to it — or blame the ball if they lose .

Female foeticide tells on sex ratio in India : Official
ERR -RTF
The Bank of England governor , Mervyn King , disclosed today that he gave no fresh information to Nick Clegg that could have led the Liberal Democrat leader to call for a faster deficit reduction programme than the one outlined by his party during the election campaign .
In perhaps the single biggest policy volte - face of the coalition negotiations , the Lib Dems abandoned their policy of maintaining the government 's economic stimulus through this financial year and backed the tougher Tory plan instead .
Clegg , the deputy prime minister , has frequently cited calls with King as critical to this decision .
But King told the Treasury select committee today that he had said nothing to Clegg during a call on 15 May that he had not already said in public , most notably at a press conference three days earlier .
He said he spoke to Clegg at the request of the new government , five days after Clegg announced he was forming a coalition government with David Cameron in which a faster programme of deficit reduction was agreed .
King also confirmed that it was at the request of the new government that he had set out his views on the dangers facing the economy from the potential sovereign debt crisis in Europe at the press conference .
It is a grey area whether the governor of the Bank of England , responsible for monetary policy , should comment in public on fiscal policy .
In an Observer interview on 6 June , Clegg described his conversation with King .
" He could n't have been more emphatic .
He said : ' If you do n't do this , then because of the deterioration of market conditions it will be even more painful to do it later . ' "
But King said today : " I said nothing that was not already in the public domain .
In the telephone conversation I basically repeated what I had said at the press conference " .
Asked by the Labour backbench MP , Chuka Umunna , whether he felt comfortable being drawn into politically sensitive matters , King replied : " I do not think central bankers ever feel comfortable when they are drawn into comments made by politicians .
But on this occasion the government has asked openly in writing for me to express my views which I did at the inflation report press conference , and I was asked if I would accept a telephone call by the deputy prime minister on the Saturday morning .
I think it would have been unreasonable not to have accepted that telephone call .
I did so and I had a private conversation " .
He added he did not feel used by the politicians saying : " There was nothing I said in that conversation that was different from what I had said in public .
When I am needed to give advice I try to make sure the advice I give is full square in private and in public " .
At the Wednesday press conference King said : " I think we 've seen in the last two weeks , particularly , but in the case of Greece , over the last three months , that it does n't make sense to run the risk of an adverse market reaction , but to get ahead of that and to demonstrate – markets have been waiting for the UK election ; that is now over .
" They would expect a new government to take decisive action .
And the agreement that I 've been informed about , that was reached between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats is a very strong and powerful agreement to reduce that deficit and to take more action than was embodied in the budget in the spring . "
The outline coalition agreement published on 12 May agreed " a significantly accelerated reduction in the structural deficit over the course of a parliament , with the main burden of deficit reduction borne by reduced spending rather than increased taxes .
It also said : " The parties agree that modest cuts of £ 6bn to non-frontline services can be made within the financial year 2010 - 11 , subject to advice from the Treasury and the Bank of England on their feasibility and advisability " .
The fuller coalition agreement produced after the King – Clegg call made no substantial changes to the agreement on deficit reduction .
Umunna claimed yesterday : " The information which the governor has provided today is hugely significant , raising questions about Nick Clegg 's reasons for changing his economic outlook so dramatically .
" The public deserve answers on the reasons for his Damascene conversion after his party had fought the election opposing the Conservatives ' plans for rapid deficit reduction , given the very painful measures he is now imposing with his coalition partners .
" If he is unable to provide this information , it will simply lend credence to those who claim the Liberal Democrats have swapped their principles for ministerial red boxes and the chance to ride in ministerial cars . "
In a recent Guardian interview Clegg again cited the call with the governor but in less emphatic terms saying : " It is unbelievably important when you are facing a fiscal firestorm like this that you assert sovereignty and control over the situation , that you show very quickly that you are going to deal with it on your own terms .
" The alternative because of what happened during the general election campaign – let us remember the Spanish crisis only blew up after the third leadership debate , this all came very late – it was really obvious , and this was confirmed to me by a conversation I had with the governor of the Bank of England and other people , that if we did n't assert control very quickly you would have something immeasurably worse than what we are doing now .
Instead of having a government that was accountable to the people taking difficult decisions you'd have even more unpleasant decisions being taken by people who are not accountable at all . "

Terry Bangen is coming back to Kamloops .
The Daily News learned Tuesday that Bangen , the assistant general manager and director of player personnel for the WHL's Tri-City Americans , is retiring and will be relocating , along with his wife , Margaret , to Kamloops .
A source told The Daily News that the Americans are expected to make Bangen 's retirement official some time this week .
Bangen joined the Blazers as an assistant coach in 1989 and was on the coaching staff for five seasons , winning three Memorial Cup titles while he was here .
He went on to coach for a season at McGill University in Montreal before spending time on the coaching staff of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks .
Bangen first joined the Americans in 1998 as an assistant coach under former Blazers head coach Don Hay .
Bangen spent two seasons there before moving to Hockey Canada , where he was from 2000 - 05 .
Bangen also spent 19 years as an assistant athletic director at the University College of the Cariboo ( now Thompson Rivers University ) in Kamloops .
He had two stints as the school 's hockey coach ( 1976 - 79 and 1981 - 89 ) and got to five Canadian College Athletic Association finals .
For the last five seasons , Bangen has worked alongside Americans general manager Bob Tory .
Bangen will continue to help
Tory as a special advisor and consultant .
A native of Grande Prairie , Alta. , Bangen was inducted into that city 's Hockey Hall of Fame in 2008 .
Tory , meanwhile , is believed to have already begun interviewing candidates to replace Bangen .
It 's believed that the list of candidates includes Dave O'Brien , a former head scout with the Prince Albert Raiders ; Barclay Parnata , a veteran scout who was recently released by the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes ; and , Chad Kletzel , a former WHLer who played for Tory with the Kootenay Ice .

Willie Desjardins has left the Medicine Hat Tigers and signed on with the NHL's Dallas Stars as an associate coach .
Desjardins had been with the Tigers for eight seasons , winning WHL championships in 2003 - 04 and 2006 - 07 .
Desjardins was the longest - serving head coach in franchise history and holds club records for games coached ( 559 ) and victories ( 323 ) .
The Tigers held a news conference Tuesday to announce Desjardins ' departure .
They did n't name any replacements at the time .
However , Brad McEwen , the Tigers ' head scout and a former GM / head coach with the Swift Current Broncos , is expected to be the next general manager , while associate coach Shaun Clouston will be promoted to head coach .
p p p
The Moose Jaw Warriors announced Tuesday that Jeff Truitt is leaving after one season as their director of hockey operations .
Truitt , a former head coach of the Kelowna Rockets , will join the San Antonio Rampage , the AHL affiliate of the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes , as an assistant coach .
Truitt left Kelowna to join the AHL's Springfield Falcons , who then were affiliated with the NHL's Edmonton Oilers .
When that did n't work out , he was able to hook on with the Warriors .
p p p
The Edmonton Oil Kings have added Steve Hamilton to their staff as an assistant coach .
He will work alongside head coach Derek Laxdal , who was signed last month to replace Steve Pleau , who was fired after three seasons .
Hamilton 's father , Al , is a former Oil Kings defenceman .
He captained the 1966 team that won the Memorial Cup , before going on to play for the Oilers in the WHL and the NHL .

For Carren Strock , the revelation came when she was 44 .
She had met her husband – " a terrific guy , very sweet " – at high school when she was 16 , had been married to him for 25 years , had two dearly loved children , and what she describes as a " white - picket - fence existence " in New York .
Then , one day , sitting opposite her best friend , she realised : " Oh my God .
I 'm in love with this woman . "
The notion that she might be a lesbian had never occurred to her before .
" If you 'd asked me the previous year , " she says , " I would have replied : ' I know exactly who and what I am – I am not a lesbian , nor could I ever be one . ' "
From that moment Strock 's understanding of her sexuality changed completely .
She felt compelled to tell her friend , but her attraction was n't reciprocated ; at first she was n't sure whether she had feelings for women in general , or just this one in particular .
But she gradually came to realise , and accept , that she was a lesbian .
She also started to realise that her experience was n't unusual .
Strock decided to interview other married women who had fallen in love with women , " putting up fliers in theatres and bookstores .
Women started contacting me from across the country – everyone knew someone who knew someone in this situation . "
The interviews became a book , Married Women Who Love Women , and when it came to writing the second edition , Strock turned to the internet for interviewees .
" Within days , " she says , " more women had contacted me than I could ever actually speak to . "
Late - blooming lesbians – women who discover or declare same - sex feelings in their 30s and beyond – have attracted increasing attention over the last few years , partly due to the clutch of glamorous , high - profile women who have come out after heterosexual relationships .
Cynthia Nixon , for instance , who plays Miranda in Sex and the City , was in a heterosexual relationship for 15 years , and had two children , before falling for her current partner , Christine Marinoni , in 2004 .
Last year , it was reported that the British singer Alison Goldfrapp , who is in her mid-40s , had started a relationship with film editor Lisa Gunning .
The actor Portia de Rossi was married to a man before coming out and falling in love with the comedian and talkshow host , Ellen DeGeneres , whom she married in 2008 .
And then there 's the British retail adviser and television star , Mary Portas , who was married to a man for 13 years , and had two children , before getting together with Melanie Rickey , the fashion - editor - at - large of Grazia magazine .
At their civil partnership earlier this year the pair beamed for the cameras in beautiful , custom - made Antonio Berardi dresses .
The subject has now begun attracting academic attention .
Next month at the American Psychological Association 's annual convention in San Diego , a session entitled Sexual Fluidity and Late - Blooming Lesbians is due to showcase a range of research , including a study by Christan Moran , who decided to look at the lives of women who had experienced a same - sex attraction when they were over 30 and married to a man .
Moran is a researcher at Southern Connecticut University , and her study was prompted in part by an anguished comment she found on an online message board for married lesbians , written by someone who styled herself " Crazy " .
" I do n't understand why I can't do the right thing , " she wrote .
" I do n't understand why I can't make myself stop thinking about this other woman . "
Moran wanted to survey a range of women in this situation , " to help Crazy , and others like her , see that they are not abnormal , or wrong to find themselves attracted to other women later in life " .
She also wanted to explore the notion , she writes , that " a heterosexual woman might make a full transition to a singular lesbian identity . . .
In other words , they might actually change their sexual orientation . "
As Moran notes in her study , this possibility is often ignored ; when a person comes out in later life , the accepted wisdom tends to be that they must always have been gay or bisexual , but just hid or repressed their feelings .
Increasingly researchers are questioning this , and investigating whether sexuality is more fluid and shifting than is often suspected .
Sarah Spelling , a former teacher , says she can well understand how " you can slide or slip or move into another identity " .
After growing up in a family of seven children in Birmingham , Spelling met her first serious partner , a man , when she was at university .
They were together for 12 years , in which time they were " fully on , sexually , " she says , although she adds that she has never had an orgasm with a man through penetrative sex .
Spelling is a keen feminist and sportsperson , and met lesbian friends through both of these interests .
" I did n't associate myself with their [ sexuality ] – I did n't see myself as a lesbian , but very clearly as a heterosexual in a longstanding relationship . "
When a friend on her hockey team made it clear she fancied her , " and thought I would fancy her too , I was like ' No !
That 's not me !'
That just was n't on my compass . "
Then , aged 34 , having split up with her long - term partner , and in another relationship with a man , she found herself falling in love with her housemate – a woman .
After " lots of talking together , over a year or so , " they formed a relationship .
" It was a meeting of minds , " says Spelling , " a meeting of interests .
She 's a keen walker .
So am I .
She runs .
So do I .
We had lots in common , and eventually I realised I did n't have that with men . "
While having sex with a man had never felt uncomfortable or wrong , it was n't as pleasurable as having sex with a woman , she says .
From the start of the relationship , she felt completely at ease , although she did n't immediately define herself as a lesbian .
" I did n't define myself as heterosexual either – I quite clearly was n't that .
And I would n't define myself as bisexual . "
After a while she fully embraced a lesbian identity .
" We 've been together for 23 years , " she says , " so it 's pretty clear that that was a defining change . "
Dr Lisa Diamond , associate professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah , has been following a group of 79 women for 15 years , tracking the shifts in their sexual identity .
The women she chose at the start of the study had all experienced some same - sex attraction – although in some cases only fleetingly – and every two years or so she has recorded how they describe themselves : straight , lesbian , bisexual , or another category of their own choosing .
In every two - year wave , 20 - 30 % of the sample have changed their identity label , and over the course of the study , about 70 % have changed how they described themselves at their initial interview .
What 's interesting , says Diamond , is that transitions in sexual identity are n't " confined to adolescence .
People appear equally likely to undergo these sorts of transitions in middle adulthood and late adulthood . "
And while , in some cases , women arrive at a lesbian identity they 've been repressing , " that does n't account for all of the variables . . .
In my study , what I often found was that women who may have always thought that other women were beautiful and attractive would , at some point later in life , actually fall in love with a woman , and that experience vaulted those attractions from something minor to something hugely significant .
It was n't that they 'd been repressing their true selves before ; it was that without the context of an actual relationship , the little glimmers of occasional fantasies or feelings just were n't that significant . "
Diamond has a hunch that the possibility of moving across sexual boundaries increases as people age .
" What we know about adult development , " she says , " suggests that people become more expansive in a number of ways as they get older . . .
I think a lot of women , late in life , when they 're no longer worried about raising the kids , and when they 're looking back on their marriage and how satisfying it is , find an opportunity to take a second look at what they want and feel like . "
This does n't mean that women are choosing whether to be gay or straight , she clarifies .
( Diamond 's work has sometimes been distorted by rightwing factions in the US , who have suggested it shows homosexuality is optional . )
" Every one of the women I studied who underwent a transition experienced it as being out of her control .
It was not a conscious choice . . .
I think the culture tends to lump together change and choice , as if they 're the same phenomenon , but they 're not .
Puberty involves a heck of a lot of change , but you do n't choose it .
There are life - course transitions that are beyond our control . "
This was certainly true for Laura Manning , a lawyer from London , who is now in her late 40s .
She had always had a vague inkling she might have feelings for women , but met a man at university , " a really gentle man , Jeff , and I fell in love with him , and for a long time that was enough to balance my feelings " .
She married him in her late 20s , had two children in her early 30s , " and once I 'd got that maternal part of my life out of the way , I suddenly started thinking about me again .
I started to feel more and more uncomfortable about the image that I was presenting , because I felt like it was n't true . "
In her late 30s , she began going out clubbing , " coming back on the bus at four in the morning , and then getting up and going to work .
I was still living with Jeff , and I just started shutting down our relationship .
He knew I was pushing him away . "
The marriage ended , and Manning moved out .
She has since had two long - term relationships with women , and says she 's much happier since she came out , but suspects that her biological urge to have children , and her genuine feelings for Jeff , made her marriage inevitable on some level .
" The thought of sex with a man repels me now , but at the time , when I was in my marriage , I did n't feel that , and I did n't feel I was repressing anything .
The intensity of feeling in my relationship with Jeff overcame and blanketed my desires for women . "
Sexual fluidity occurs in both men and women , but it has been suggested that women are potentially more open and malleable in this regard .
Richard Lippa , professor of psychology at California State University , Fullerton , has carried out a variety of studies that have led him to the conclusion that , " while most men tend to have what I call a preferred sex and a non-preferred sex . . . with women there are more shades of grey , and so I tend to talk about them having a more preferred sex , and a less preferred sex .
I have definitely heard some women say , ' It was the person I fell in love with , it was n't the person 's gender , ' and I think that that is much more of a female experience than a male experience .
" I 've never had a straight man say to me , at age 45 , I just met this really neat guy and I fell in love with him and I do n't like men in general , but God , this guy 's so great that I 'm going to be in a relationship with him for the next 15 years . "
In Diamond 's study , around a quarter of the women have reported that gender is largely irrelevant in their choice of sexual partners .
" Deep down , " said one woman , " it 's just a matter of who I meet and fall in love with , and it 's not their body , it 's something behind the eyes . "
When Tina Humphrys , 70 , first fell in love with a woman , she did n't define herself as a lesbian , " I just thought : ' It 's her . ' "
Humphrys was in her mid-30s , had two children , and was coming out of a horrible second marriage .
" I hated my life , " she says .
" The four bedrooms , the children – well , I did n't hate them , they just bored me to tears .
I used to lie on the couch and my eyes would fill with tears as they had their naps . "
She had found women attractive in the past , " but I think women do , do n't they ?
You look and you think – that dress looks fabulous , or is n't she looking slim , or does n't she look pretty .
But you do n't necessarily put sexual feelings on it . "
Then she went to university as a mature student , joined a women 's group , and started to fall for one of the other members .
" It was a bit of a shock to find that I was attracted sexually to this woman , but then it was also a decision to leave men .
It was a decision to leave a particularly oppressive and restrictive way of living and try to live differently . "
She moved into a " commune - type place " , and had non-monogamous relationships with women for a while , before settling down with her current partner of more than 30 years .
While she had had " a very active sex life with men " , she enjoyed sex with women much more .
" I was once doing a workshop with a woman who used to tear hideous things that had been said about women out of the paper , and she had a piece about this blonde model who had romped with a lesbian – because they always romp , do n't they ?
– and she said : ' It was n't proper sex , it was just a load of orgasms . ' "
Humphrys laughs uproariously .
" I think that just about sums it up , does n't it ? "
Beyond the sex , Humphrys found a connection that was more intense " on every level " than any she had found with a man .
Strock echoes this view .
" I 've run workshops with straight women , and I 've asked them , did you ever feel those sky rockets go off , or hear the music playing , when you fell in love with that significant other ?
And very few raise their hands .
And then I went to a gay women 's group , and I said , how many of you have ever felt the same ?
And almost all the hands went up .
So connections with women are very different to connections between women and men . "
The psychotherapist and writer , Susie Orbach , spent more than 30 years with the writer Joseph Schwartz , and had two children with him , before the partnership ended , and she subsequently formed a happy , ongoing relationship with the novelist Jeanette Winterson .
Orbach says that the initial love connection between mother and daughter makes lesbian feelings in later life unsurprising .
" If you think about it , " she says , " whose arms are you first in , whose smells do you first absorb , where 's that body - to - body imprint ?
I mean , we 're still not really father - raised , are we , so it 's a very big journey for women to get to heterosexuality . . .
What happens is that you layer heterosexuality on top of that bond .
You do n't suddenly switch away from it .
You do n't give up that very intimate attachment to a woman . "
Of course , the notion that your sexuality might shift entirely is n't welcomed by everyone ; as Diamond says , " Even though there 's more cultural acceptance than there was 20 years ago , same - sex sexuality is still very stigmatised , and the notion that you might not know everything there is to know about something that 's so personal and intimate can terrify individuals .
It 's really hard for people to accept . "
That 's why the writing and research in this area is so important .
When the first edition of Strock 's book was published , " a woman came up to me at one of my early speaking engagements , clutching the book and sobbing , " she says .
" She thought she was the only married woman ever to have fallen in love with another woman , and had no one to talk to , did n't know where to turn .
And she had decided that the best thing was to kill herself on a night when she knew her husband and children were going to be out late .
She 'd planned her suicide .
She was coming home from work for what she thought would be the last time , and she passed a bookstore , and they were putting my book in the window , and when she realised that she was n't the only one , she chose to live " .
The late - blooming lesbians I spoke to had all found happiness on their different paths .
Strock is still a lesbian – and also still married to her husband , who knows about her sexuality .
" He would never throw me away , and I would never throw him away , " she says , " so we 've re-defined our relationship .
I 'm a lesbian , but we share a house , we have separate rooms , we have two grandchildren now , and our situation is not unique . "
Most of the other women I spoke to were in happy , long - term relationships with women , and had found a contentment that they 'd never experienced in their previous relationships .
" While some people find change threatening , " Diamond says , " others find it exciting and liberating , and I definitely think that for women in middle adulthood and late life , they might be the most likely to find sexual shifts empowering .
We 're an anti-ageing society .
We like people to be young , nubile and attractive .
And I think the notion that your sexuality can undergo these really exciting , expansive possibilities at a stage when most people assume that women are no longer sexually interesting and are just shutting down , is potentially a really liberating notion for women .
Your sexual future might actually be pretty dynamic and exciting – and whatever went on in your past might not be the best predictor at all of what your future has in store . "
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Pressured by an aging population and the need to rein in budget deficits , Canada ’s provinces are taking tough measures to curb healthcare costs , a trend that could erode the principles of the popular state - funded system .

Ontario , Canada ’s most populous province , kicked off a fierce battle with drug companies and pharmacies when it said earlier this year it would halve generic drug prices and eliminate “ incentive fees ” to generic drug manufacturers .
British Columbia is replacing block grants to hospitals with fee - for - procedure payments and Quebec has a new flat health tax and a proposal for payments on each medical visit -- an idea that critics say is an illegal user fee .
And a few provinces are also experimenting with private funding for procedures such as hip , knee and cataract surgery .
It ’s likely just a start as the provinces , responsible for delivering healthcare , cope with the demands of a retiring baby - boom generation .
Official figures show that senior citizens will make up 25 percent of the population by 2036 .
“ There ’s got to be some change to the status quo whether it happens in three years or 10 years , ” said Derek Burleton , senior economist at Toronto - Dominion Bank .
“ We ca n’t continually see health spending growing above and beyond the growth rate in the economy because , at some point , it means crowding out of all the other government services .
“ At some stage we ’re going to hit a breaking point . ”
MIRROR IMAGE DEBATE
In some ways the Canadian debate is the mirror image of discussions going on in the United States .
Canada , fretting over budget strains , wants to prune its system , while the United States , worrying about an army of uninsured , aims to create a state - backed safety net .
Healthcare in Canada is delivered through a publicly funded system , which covers all “ medically necessary ” hospital and physician care and curbs the role of private medicine .
It ate up about 40 percent of provincial budgets , or some C$ 183 billion ( $ 174 billion ) last year .
Spending has been rising 6 percent a year under a deal that added C$ 41.3 billion of federal funding over 10 years .
But that deal ends in 2013 , and the federal government is unlikely to be as generous in future , especially for one - off projects .
“ As Ottawa looks to repair its budget balance ... one could see these one - time allocations to specific health projects might be curtailed , ” said Mary Webb , senior economist at Scotia Capital .
Brian Golden , a professor at University of Toronto ’s Rotman School of Business , said provinces are weighing new sources of funding , including “ means - testing ” and moving toward evidence - based and pay - for - performance models .
“ Why are we paying more or the same for cataract surgery when it costs substantially less today than it did 10 years ago ?
There ’s going to be a finer look at what we ’re paying for and , more importantly , what we ’re getting for it , ” he said .
Other problems include trying to control independently set salaries for top hospital executives and doctors and rein in spiraling costs for new medical technologies and drugs .
Ontario says healthcare could eat up 70 percent of its budget in 12 years , if all these costs are left unchecked .
“ Our objective is to preserve the quality healthcare system we have and indeed to enhance it .
But there are difficult decisions ahead and we will continue to make them , ” Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan told Reuters .
The province has introduced legislation that ties hospital chief executive pay with the quality of patient care and says it wants to put more physicians on salary to save money .
In a report released last week , TD Bank said Ontario should consider other proposals to help cut costs , including scaling back drug coverage for affluent seniors and paying doctors according to quality and efficiency of care .
WINNERS AND LOSERS
The losers could be drug companies and pharmacies , both of which are getting increasingly nervous .
“ Many of the advances in healthcare and life expectancy are due to the pharmaceutical industry so we should never demonize them , ” said U of T’s Golden .
“ We need to ensure that they maintain a profitable business but our ability to make it very very profitable is constrained right now . ”
Scotia Capital ’s Webb said one cost - saving idea may be to make patients aware of how much it costs each time they visit a healthcare professional .
“ ( The public ) will use the services more wisely if they know how much it ’s costing , ” she said .
“ If it ’s absolutely free with no information on the cost and the information of an alternative that would be have been more practical , then how can we expect the public to wisely use the service ? ”
But change may come slowly .
Universal healthcare is central to Canada ’s national identity , and decisions are made as much on politics as economics .
“ It ’s an area that Canadians do n’t want to see touched , ” said TD ’s Burleton .
“ Essentially it boils down the wishes of the population .
But I think , from an economist ’s standpoint , we point to the fact that sometimes Canadians in the short term may not realize the cost . ”

I spend a fair bit of time ( probably too much ) browsing Reddit .
And I always have to laugh when a Perl - related post is made to the Programming sub -Reddit .
Although the post will often get up - voted , the majority of the comments are usually negative about Perl , not to mention completely un-related to the original article .
Masak ’s recent post about Perl 6’s birthday ( and the ensuing post on Reddit ) was a good example .
Although the post itself got a lot of up - votes , and although most of the negative comments eventually got down - voted , there were still a lot of them , and for quite a while they were ranked highly .
Many people felt the need to voice their opinions on how much they hated Perl , how it has n’t been relevant in 10 years , how it ’s unreadable , how the OO sucks , etc. etc .
It ’s hard not to respond to such criticisms .
I know I did , along with several others from the Perl community .
There were also a couple of responses I made but ( fortunately ) did n’t post , which I seem to be getting quite good at doing in my old age .
Whether or not you frequent Reddit , I ’m sure you ’re familiar with this scenario .
Whenever someone posts something Perl - related anywhere on the internet , but outside of the Perl community itself , you can be sure to find haters .
I ’m sure all popular languages have this problem to some degree , but Perl ( maybe along with PHP ) seems to have it worst than most .
And it ’s our natural reaction to leap to the defense of Perl .
Not just because it ’s dear to our heart , and we ’d love more people to use it , but also because we hate to see people so badly misinformed about anything .
But it ’s important to remember the kinds of people who make these posts .
Some of them have been so badly burnt by terrible Perl code , that they will never come back .
Some of them simply do n’t like Perl , for their own , legitimate reasons .
Some of them have a vested interest in seeing Perl fade , even if it ’s just that they see Perl as competition for their favourite language .
And of course , some of them are genuine trolls , simply fishing for a reaction ( although probably not as many as you might think ) .
These people are Darth Vader , and we are Luke Skywalker ; desperate to turn them to the “ good ” side , even though it ’ll never happen , until the very end of the movie at least ( oops , spoilers ) .
The point is , as much as we want to correct these people who ( to us ) are clearly wrong , we ’re fighting an unwinnable battle , and wasting time and energy .
More importantly , to neutral onlookers ( who may be future Perl users ) , we might come off looking bad .
So I ’ve decided on a new policy .
I do n’t want to stop reading ( or even posting )
Perl related stuff outside the Perl community .
The echo chamber is comfortable , but it ’s important to get out once in a while .
But I will simply ignore anyone who posts negative responses , unless they do so in a constructive way , or make a reasonable argument .
I hope that not only will I save time and energy , but I ’ll begin to worry about these people a lot less ( yes , I ’m sorry to say that I do worry about them ) .
And maybe if we all started doing the same thing , and continue to make Perl awesome , these people would begin to disappear .
And we could all make Perl posts to r/programming without fear of retribution ….
… well , maybe not … but it ’s OK to dream , right ?
Ten of the greatest : Maths puzzles
By CLIFF PICKOVER , Author of The Math Book
From Archimedes ' Stomachion to the Tower of Hanoi to the rope around the earth puzzle , here Cliff Pickover chooses his favourite mathematical conundrums
1. ARCHIMEDES ' STOMACHION , c250 BC
In 1941 , mathematician GH Hardy wrote , ' Archimedes will be remembered when ( playwright ) Aeschylus is forgotten , because languages die and mathematical ideas do not . '
Indeed , the ancient Greek geometer is often regarded as the greatest scientist of antiquity .
In 2002 , maths historian Reviel Netz gained a new insight into a treatise by Archimedes concerning a puzzle called the Stomachion .
Examining an ancient parchment , he discovered the puzzle involved combinatorics - a field of maths dealing with the number of ways a given problem can be solved .
The goal of the Stomachion is to determine in how many ways 14 pieces can be put together to make a square .
In 2003 , mathematicians determined that the number is 17,152 .
2. WHEAT ON A CHESSBOARD , 1256
The problem of Sissa 's Chessboard , discussed by the Arabic scholar Ibn Khallikan in 1256 , has been used for centuries to demonstrate the nature of geometric growth , and is one of the earliest puzzles involving chess .
According to legend , King Shirham agreed to give a reward consisting of a grain of wheat on the first square of a chessboard , two grains of wheat on the second square , four grains on the third , and so on for the 64 squares .
However , he did n't realise how many grains would be awarded .
One way to determine the total is to compute the sum of the first 64 terms of a geometrical progression , 1 + 2 + 2 <2 > + ... + 2<63 > , or 2<64 > - 1 , which is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains of wheat .
This would fill a train reaching 1,000 times around the Earth .
3. TOWER OF HANOI , 1883
Invented by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883 , the Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle featuring several discs that slide onto any of three pegs .
The discs are initially stacked on one peg in order of size , with the smallest at the top .
The goal is to move the entire starting stack to another peg .
You can only move one disc at a time , removing the top disc in any stack and placing it at the top of another .
A disc can not be placed on top of a smaller disc .
The smallest number of moves turns out to be 2 < n > - 1 , where n is the number of discs .
This means that if 64 discs were used and moved at a rate of one per second , finishing the puzzle would take roughly 585 billion years .
4. ROPE AROUND THE EARTH PUZZLE , 1702
This gem from 1702 shows how simple intuition may fail us .
Imagine you 're given a rope that tightly encircles the equator of a basketball .
How much longer would you have to make it for it to be one foot from the surface at all points ?
Next , imagine we have the rope around the equator of an Earth - sized sphere - making it around 25,000 miles long .
How much longer would you now have to make it for it to be one foot off the ground all the way around the equator ?
The surprising answer is 2 pi ( or approximately 6.28 ) feet for both the basketball and the Earth .
If r is the radius of the Earth , and 1 + r is the radius in feet of the enlarged circle , we can compare the rope circumference before ( 2 pir ) and after ( 2 pi ( 1 + r ) ) .
5. KONIGSBERG BRIDGES , 1736
Graph theory is an area of mathematics that concerns how objects are connected , and often represents problems as dots connected by lines .
One of the oldest problems in graph theory involves the bridges of Königsberg in Prussia ( now Kaliningrad ) , linking both sides of a river and two islands .
In the early 1700s , people wondered if you could walk across all seven bridges without crossing any bridge more than once , and return to the starting location .
In 1736 , Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler proved this was impossible .
Today , graph theory is used in the studies of chemical pathways , traffic flow and the social networks of internet users .
Prince Rupert asked : what is the largest wooden cube that can pass through another cube with one - inch sides ?
6. PRINCE RUPERT'S PROBLEM , 1816
In the 1600s , Prince Rupert of the Rhine asked a famous geometrical question : what is the largest wooden cube that can pass through another cube with one - inch sides ?
Perhaps surprisingly , a hole can in fact be made in one of two equal cubes that 's sufficiently large for the other cube to slide through - without the cube with the hole falling apart .
Today , we know that a cube with a side length of 1.060660 ... inches ( or smaller ) can pass through a cube with one - inch sides .
This solution was found by mathematician Pieter Nieuwland and published in 1816 .
If you hold a cube so that one corner points towards you , you 'll see a regular hexagon .
The largest square that will squeeze through a cube has a face that can be contained within this hexagon .
7. FIFTEEN PUZZLE , 1874
The Fifteen puzzle caused a real stir in the 19th century .
Today , you can purchase a variant of the puzzle with 15 squares ( tiles ) and one vacant spot in a 4 × 4 frame .
At the start , the squares show the numbers 1 through 15 in sequence and then a gap .
In a version of the puzzle in Sam Loyd 's 1914 Cyclopedia , the starting configuration had the 14 and 15 reversed .
The goal was to slide the squares up , down , right and left to return them to the correct order .
In his Cyclopedia , Loyd claims a prize of $ 1,000 was offered for a solution ; alas , it 's impossible to solve the puzzle from this starting position .
The original game was developed in 1874 by New York postmaster Noyes Palmer Chapman .
8. THIRTY - SIX OFFICERS PROBLEM , 1779
Consider six army regiments , each consisting of six officers of different ranks .
In 1779 , Leonhard Euler asked if it was possible to arrange these 36 officers in a 6 × 6 square so that no row or column duplicates a rank or regiment .
Euler conjectured that there was no solution , and French mathematician Gaston Tarry proved this in 1901 .
The problem has led to significant work in combinatorics ( see 1 ) .
Euler also conjectured that this kind of problem could have no solution for an n × n array if n = 4 k + 2 , where k is a positive integer .
This was n't settled until 1959 , when mathematicians found a solution for a 22 × 22 array .
9. RUBIK'S CUBE , 1974
The Rubik 's cube was invented by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernö Rubik in 1974 .
By 1982 , ten million cubes had been sold in Hungary , more than the population of the country .
It 's estimated that over 350 million have now been sold worldwide .
The cube is a 3 × 3 × 3 array of smaller cubes that are coloured in such a way that the six faces of the large cube have six distinct colours .
The 26 external sub-cubes are internally hinged so that these six faces can be rotated .
The goal of the puzzle is to return a scrambled cube to a state in which each side has a single colour .
In total there are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different arrangements of the small cubes .
If you had a cube for every one of these ' legal ' positions , then you could cover the surface of the Earth ( including the oceans ) about 250 times .
10 . BARBER PARADOX , 1901
In 1901 , the British philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell uncovered a possible paradox that necessitated a modification to set theory .
One version of Russell 's Paradox involves a town with one male barber who , every day , shaves every man who does n't shave himself , and no one else .
Does the barber shave himself ?
The scenario seems to demand that the barber shave himself if and only if he does n't shave himself !
Russell realised he had to alter set theory so as to avoid such confusion .
One way to refute the Barber Paradox might be to simply say that such a barber does not exist .
Nevertheless , mathematicians Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing found Russell 's work useful when studying various branches of mathematics and computation .

ON MARCH 30 , 2006 , at 11.58 pm , 15 - year - old Patrick Waring was in bed in his Perth home when the door to his room was pushed open .
He might have been expecting it to be his parents - but they were 400 kilometres away on holiday .
Assuming it to be his older brother , Michael , Patrick looked up to find instead several plain - clothes policemen standing in the doorway .
Ordered from bed , Patrick was advised that he was being arrested for the rape of a teenage girl that had occurred earlier that day .
Though he denied ever having met the girl , Patrick , accompanied by Michael , was taken to a nearby police station .
Frantic calls were made to the boys ' parents , who immediately started driving back to Perth .
By the time they arrived at the station , it was all over .
Patrick had been charged with rape and remanded , with a bail hearing set for the following Monday .
'' We were disappointed that Patrick was n't able to be released to us over the weekend , '' father Terry Waring says in Every Family 's Nightmare . '' [ But ] we felt that it was just a process and that we would be able to get him back on the Monday . ''

You need Flash to see the Feature Video
Personal pledges and national campaigns to stop texting , talking and emailing while driving are laudable ; the reality is that we are so ' dialed ' in to communicating and multi- tasking constantly , unless the phone is left at home , it 's going to be used while driving
It 's not that I do n't trust my daughter but the temptation to text while driving is just too great
I wanted something that turned the car into a ' No Phone Zone ' so no matter what , my daughter CAN 'T text , talk or email while she 's driving .
I tried the phone app but it was just too easy to remove , not to mention the monthly fee .
I bought TxTStopper™ and had it installed in my son's car and have no worries about him texting or talking while he 's driving .
Atlanta , GA ( Vocus / PRWEB ) June 28 , 2010 -- America 's teenage drivers are dying on its roads at an alarming rate and all signs point to one common denominator – Texting While Driving .
Recent statistics provide sobering evidence of this growing epidemic but perhaps none more so than this : motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 16 - 20 year olds .
TxTStopper™ , a new accident avoidance technology leads a national effort to save the lives of the highest at - risk driving group – America 's teens .

The problem is so acute that one more state , Georgia , has joined 27 other states , the District of Columbia and Guam enacting legislation banning teenage drivers from any cell phone use while driving .
The new Georgia law , which goes into effect July 1 , 2010 , is the latest in a national effort to create ' No Phone Zones , ' an initiative recently launched by Media Mogul and Mega Philanthropist Oprah Winfrey .
TxTStopper™ has taken the ' No Phone Zone ' a step further by introducing a patent - pending , accident avoidance technology that turns any vehicle into a ' No Phone Zone ' .
" Personal pledges and national campaigns to stop texting , talking and emailing while driving are laudable ; the reality is that we are so ' dialed ' in to communicating and multi- tasking constantly , unless the phone is left at home , it 's going to be used while driving , " says a TxTStopper™ spokesperson .
Statistically , teenagers and young drivers are the most vulnerable ; each year over 6,000 teens ages 16 to 20 die due to fatal injuries caused by car accidents and about 400,000 drivers age 16 to 20 will be seriously injured in car accidents ; unfortunately , when it comes to the dangers of texting , talking or emailing while driving , teen drivers also are the toughest to convince .
" It 's not that I do n't trust my daughter but the temptation to text while driving is just too great , " concurs an Atlanta mom .
" I wanted something that turned the car into a ' No Phone Zone ' so no matter what , my daughter CAN'T text , talk or email while she 's driving . "
That 's just what TxTStopper™ does !
TxTStopper™ is a seamless , stand - alone , in - vehicle , mobile electronic device that completely prevents texting , talking and emailing functions while the car is in drive mode .

( CNN ) --
The mayor of Ocean Springs , Mississippi , appearing Monday evening on CNN's " Campbell Brown , " criticized the response to the oil spill disaster by both federal and state officials .
Part of Connie Moran 's frustration comes from a tour she took this weekend off Horn Island , where she had heard reports of large oil streaks .
" Sure enough , about a 10 - to - 15 - foot - wide strip of orange oil ( was visible ) , " explained Moran .
" We followed it for five miles long , as far as the eye could see , " she told CNN 's Brown .
" What we found so outrageous is that we were promised by the Unified Command ( for the oil spill ) that a situated mobile ( unit ) would have skimmers and vessels to meet this at the pass .
First they would fight it in the Gulf and then they would meet it at the pass to prevent it from coming into the Sound and there was no boat there , " said Moran .
In the last week , a wide band of oil has been detected moving toward the Mississippi coast .
Until recently , the oil appeared to be heading toward the Florida Panhandle , according to National Incident Commander Adm .
Thad Allen .
Moran , a Democrat , also criticized Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , telling Brown , " I would have liked to have seen him have a greater sense of urgency right from the beginning . "
" Of course , we do n't want to scare our citizens or drive off our tourism industry , " said Moran .
" ( But ) all of our elected officials along the Mississippi Gulf Coast went through ( Hurricane ) Katrina .
We know what to do for hurricanes .
( An ) oil spill , this is new for us .
We do n't like sitting on our hands and doing nothing . "
Moran also discussed her tour around the shoreline of her city , Ocean Springs , with a CNN crew Monday .
Moran reported to Brown .
" What we 're seeing actually is minimal tar balls anywhere from a penny to half - a - dollar size .
They are tacky . "
A notification about the new version of Yelp just popped up on my EVO , and without thinking much about it , I gave it a whirl .
Ohh , version 2.0 - it must be bringing new features , I thought .
Indeed , it was .
And I 'm in love with them .
New In Yelp 2.0
Here 's the list of the most interesting stuff :
Mobile check-ins
" Monocle "
Review drafting ( though not posting )
Adding photos , tips , and bookmarks
A brand new look
A bunch of force closes , which I hope would be fixed soon .
As you can see the last part mentions force closes which happened to me when I did n't have a GPS signal , but once you see the new features , I 'm sure you will forgive Yelp developers for the time being , until they roll out some fixes .
So let 's explore some of these new features in more detail .
" Monocle "
I had a hunch of what this new " Monocle " feature was going to be but my heart skipped a beat once I confirmed my suspicion .
What we have here , ladies and gentlemen , is Yelp 's version of augmented reality ( apologies for slightly jerky pictures - no screenshot taking software is good enough to take in so much data so fast when the screen is shaky due to both GPS signal and my hands after a beer ) .
You may have seen Layar or Google Goggles , but Yelp really brings it to a whole new level .
Let me point out 3 things :
A radar at the top showing businesses Yelp recognizes around you .
Pan around and the radar will turn with you
Businesses with on - screen information that includes the name , Yelp rating , distance , number of reviews , and whether it 's open or closed
This one deserves to be repeated : OPEN or CLOSED STATUS .
To me , this is the first augmented reality application that is finally worthy of permanently occupying space on my phone .
Click on a business and it brings you to a revamped Business Info page .
" Monocle " is exactly what the doctor prescribed .
New Look For Business Info Pages And All Around
The whole application has been given a facelift , including the main menu .
Additional buttons that I will expand on below were added .
I like the new look .
How about you ?
Mobile Check - Ins
In order to compete with FourSquare and Gowalla , Yelp recently introduced mobile check - ins .
As of today , you can check in from within the Android app .
Posting Reviews
When Yelp launched the Android application , it did n't have a way to log into your account and view your own favorites , post reviews , etc .
2 weeks later , they added an ability to log in which allowed viewing favorites , but still did n't provide any reviewing capabilities .
Well , with v2.0 , I am here to tell you that you can now post reviews .
Well , kind of .
You can post drafts , which need to be saved to be posted live later from yelp.com .
I 'm guessing there was a good reason Yelp did it this way for now , and I 'm sure the next update will bring full posting functionality .
Tips and Review Highlights
Want a fast way to see if the place you 're checking out is a downer or makes the best soufflé ?
You can view review highlights and quick tips from other users at a glance using the new interface ( at least I do n't remember seeing this before ) .
Bugs
This release also brought a whole bag of bugs , though I suspect they only show up when you do n't have GPS signal .
Yelp , you 're planning to fix these , right ?
Conclusion
Overall , this is a very solid release for Yelp .
" Monocle " will probably change the way I find food ( Layar and Goggles just did n't do it well enough ) , and being able to finally record reviews will mean that I use the Yelp app a lot more frequently .
What did you think about v2.0 ?
Drop your 2 cents in the comment box below .
Speaking of food , dinner is waiting .
Time to fire up the Yelp app and find me a Korean barbeque .
Fox News personality Glenn Beck believes the Jews murdered the biblical messiah Jesus Christ , and Gosh Darn
It , if the Christian savior had been more like Barack Obama he ’d have “ come back and made the Jews pay for what they did . ”
That ’s just the tip of a bizarre rant recently aired by News Corporation , which featured the chalkboard - handy host once again assailing Christian social justice efforts , which many faithful see as core to their sacrament .
In the process , however , Beck revealed what one prominent reverend called a fundamental “ misunderstanding ” of scripture , as well as an apparent detachment from the English language when it comes to the word “ victim . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
First of all , as the story goes , Jews did not kill Jesus .
The Roman empire had him executed after Jewish religious leaders became worked into a frenzy over his ideas – or so the New Testament claims .
Armed Roman guards allegedly beat and lashed him , then hung him on a cross until death .
Indeed , claiming as fact that Jews killed Jesus would seem to indicate that Beck has adopted a meme otherwise endemic to antisemitic thought and literature .
The implication that Romans were stalwarts of law and reason who merely appeased the bloodthirsty Jewish mob was a vital component of Nazi propaganda .
Beck also suggests that calling Jesus the “ victim ” of a violent and oppressive system is “ an abomination . ”
Jesus , he insists , was really a “ conqueror ” who chose death at the hands of his own people in order to overcome the wages of sin for all humanity .
While an advanced theological argument could potentially be rendered to support this statement , all traces of logic seem missing .
By its principle definition , what Beck is describing is victimhood .
The word “ victim ” literally means a living being that is scarified to a deity .
A nearly universal cornerstone of Christian theology holds that Christ ’s death washed away man ’s sin in God ’s eyes , therefore his sacrifice is a key moment in their religious rite .
Logically , it would follow that without the fundamental construction of the Christian God , who measures ill - deeds against humanity and threatens impure souls with eternal punishment , there would be no such thing as “ sin ” — meaning the sacrifice chosen by Christ was to satisfy a deity .
Such is the first definition of the word “ victim , ” according to Merriam - Webster ’s dictionary .
ADVERTISEMENT
The alternate definition of “ victim ” also contradicts Beck ’s application of the word .
Webster further defines “ victim ” as “ one that is acted on and usually adversely affected by a force or agent ” .
In this understanding of the word , the conservative opinion host would seem to be suggesting that being beaten and murdered by armed thugs is not a force or agent acting on an individual in an adverse manner .
Instead , the juxtaposition of victim and conqueror is convenient for Beck in that he ’s trying to refute the intrinsic nature of many Christians ’ beliefs that the poor and needy should be comforted .
Instead , the television talker opines that “ redistribution of wealth ” is nowhere to be found in the religious tome .
But even this rings hollow .
The first generation of Christians , spoken of in the book of Acts , took it upon themselves to sell all their possessions and bring the proceeds to Christ ’s apostles so they might redistribute the wealth to all believers .
ADVERTISEMENT
Acts 2:44 - 45 says , “ All that believed were together , and had all things in common ;
And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need . ”
The notion is multiplied by Acts 4:34 - 37 , which adds : “ There was not a needy person among them , for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold .
They laid it at the apostles ’ feet , and it was distributed to each as any had need .
There was a Levite , a native of Cyprus , Joseph , to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas ( which means ‘ son of encouragement ’ ) .
He sold a field that belonged to him , then brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ’ feet . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In the spirit of the one they called a messiah , the first Christian church willingly shared their wealth with fellow believers .
In this same vein , legendary author Kurt Vonnegut once opined , “ ‘ Socialism ’ is no more an evil word than ‘ Christianity . ’
Socialism no more prescribed Joseph Stalin and his secret police and shuttered churches than Christianity prescribed the Spanish Inquisition .
Christianity and socialism alike , in fact , prescribe a society dedicated to the proposition that all men , women and children are created equal , and shalt not starve . ”
Facts of language and scripture considered , Beck ’s unusual claims about Christian theology seem to be , at best , misplaced .
In a recent piece charging Beck with “ heresy , ” Time ‘s Elizabeth Dias explained :
ADVERTISEMENT
A core Biblical command is to follow Jesus ’ example of humility , not of conquering , and to show compassion for the least of those in our midst .
A different commentator , the Apostle Paul , quickly sets straight Beck ’s account of Christian service : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus , who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped , but made himself nothing , taking the very nature of a servant , being made in human likeness .
And being found in appearance as a man , he humbled himself and became obedient to deathÃ¢â‚¬â € even death on a cross .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â People may not disagree with Beck , as he said last night , because he is Mormon .
But many Christians will disagree with him because he insinuates Christianity is nothing but a pull - yourself - up - from - your - bootstraps spirituality and ignores the church ’s long tradition of working for the plight of the powerless .
It ’s certainly not the first time Beck has crossed the line with Christians , many of whom are core to the conservative political movements that make up a vast cross-section of Beck ’s audience .
In March , after the Fox News personality claimed that “ social justice ” is code for Nazi authoritarianism , many religious groups took him to task , lashing back in defense of their efforts to aid the poor .
Ready with a retort was Rev. Jim Wallis , a Christian leader in Washington , D.C. who spoke with ABC News .
“ Brother Glenn , let ’s dispense with personal attacks , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know you .
I have no reason to attack you .
But you made a statement here that needs a serious conversation . …
I know you ’re used to monologues , but when you say things like this , you invite a dialogue .
What do you say about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , what do you say about Desmond Tutu , about Mother Teresa , what do you say to the reverends and rabbis who gave their lives to social justice because that is their faith ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking with the New York Times , Wallis added : “ What he has said attacks the very heart of our Christian faith , and Christians should no longer watch his show . [ … ]
His show should now be in the same category as Howard Stern . ”
Rev. Canon Peg Chemberlin , who presides over the National Council of Churches of Christ USA , further told ABC that Beck ’s charges seem “ ridiculous ” and reveal a fundamental “ misunderstanding ” of scripture .
“ He ’s speaking on behalf of his political views and trying to take out of the biblical text the things that are going to oppose his political views , ” she said .
“ This is primarily a political motivation . …
It ’s not that Christians have n’t been Nazis and socialists , but we ’re not talking about political parties here .
We ’re talking about 2,000 - year - old gospel . ”
Ultimately , these silly claims boil down to Beck ’s apparent goal of convincing his viewers that Obama is a secret harbinger of “ liberation theology ” ; that the president of the United States is a covert Nazi who has come to redistribute all your wealth .
ADVERTISEMENT
Richard Lawson over at Gawker offered perhaps the most cutting response to Beck ’s latest assault on Christianity ’s core tenets , suggesting the host has just gone “ insaner and insaner ” as the Obama administration progresses .
“ Can you believe that there is someone on national television talking about this stuff , in this manner , every day and lots of people watch it in 2010 ? ” he asked .
“ It ’s like a Terry Gilliam movie .
Only darker . ”
Beck ’s rant on Christianity begins at the 6:00 minute mark , in this video broadcast by Fox News on July 13 , 2010 .
Struggling with your chip shot ?
Constant drills with your wedge may not help much , but mixing in longer drives will , and a new study shows why .
Previous studies have shown that variable practice improves the brain 's memory of most skills better than practice focused on a single task .
Cognitive neuroscientists at USC and UCLA describe the neural basis for this paradox in a new study in Nature Neuroscience .
The researchers split 59 volunteers into six groups : three groups were asked to practice a challenging arm movement , while the other three groups practiced the movement and related tasks in a variable practice structure .
Volunteers in the variable practice group showed better retention of the skill .
The process of consolidating memory of the skill engaged a part of the brain -- the prefrontal cortex -- associated with higher level planning .
The group assigned to constant practice of the arm movement retained the skill to a lesser degree through consolidation that engaged a part of the brain -- the primary motor cortex -- associated with simple motor learning .
" In the variable practice structure condition , you 're basically solving the motor problem anew each time .
If I 'm just repeating the same thing over and over again as in the constant practice condition , I do n't have to process it very deeply , " said study senior author Carolee Winstein , professor of biokinesiology and physical therapy at Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry at USC .

" We gravitate toward a simple , rote practice structure because we 're basically lazy , and we do n't want to work hard .
But it turns out that memory is enhanced when we engage in practice that is more challenging and requires us to reconstruct the activity , " Winstein said .
Winstein 's team , led by Shailesh Kantak , a graduate student in biokinesiology at the time of the study , verified the neural circuits involved through harmless magnetic interference applied immediately after practice .
Volunteers in the variable practice group who received magnetic stimulation in the prefrontal cortex failed to retain or " consolidate " the arm movement as well as those in the same group who did not receive magnetic stimulation .
This implied that the prefrontal cortex was necessary for consolidating the memory .
Likewise , constant practice volunteers who received magnetic stimulation in the primary motor cortex failed to retain the arm movement as well as volunteers in the same group who did not receive magnetic stimulation .

" While it may be harder during practice to switch between tasks … you end up remembering the tasks better later than you do if you engage in this drill - like practice , " Winstein said .
" In motor skills training they know this , in educational programs where they 're teaching the kids cursive hand writing , they know this . "
Winstein described the study as " the linking of motor neuroscience to behavioral movement science to better understand the neural substrates that mediate motor learning through optimal practice structures .
No one had done this before in this way . "
The magnetic interference tests also helped define the time window for the brain to consolidate skills .
For volunteers chosen to receive interference four hours after practice , the procedure had no effect on learning .
This suggested the brain already had done its consolidation .
Winstein 's team included first author Kantak , a recent USC Ph.D. graduate on his way to a postdoctoral position at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago ; fellow biokinesiology faculty Katherine Sullivan ( primary adviser to Kantak ) and Beth Fisher , director of the Neuroplasticity and Imaging Laboratory where the study was conducted ; and Barbara Knowlton , professor of behavioral neuroscience at UCLA .
The study was funded by a grant from the North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity and an Oakley Fellowship from the Graduate School of USC to Kantak .
Kyrgyzstan ’s government appealed to Russia on Saturday to send troops to the former Soviet republic in a desperate attempt to stop the ethnic riots that have rocked a southern city and left 77 people dead .
Interim President Roza Otunbayeva said she had sent an official letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and discussed with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin the deteriorating situation in Osh , where residents described a city out of control .
“ We are waiting for news from the Russian Federation now , ” Otunbayeva said in televised remarks after the phone conversation with Putin .
“ We think that the required measures will certainly be taken . ”
But Russia quickly said it had no plans to send troops to Kyrgyzstan .
“ It is an internal conflict , and so far Russia does n’t see conditions for participating in its resolution , ” Russian presidential press secretary Natalia Timakova said Saturday .
The violence began Thursday evening as several hundred Kyrgyz and Uzbek youths clashed in Osh , the country ’s second - largest city .
At first they battled with fists , sticks and metal rods , but soon the numbers grew to several thousand , and they were fighting across the city center using automatic rifles , shotguns and other weapons , a witness said .
On Friday , the interim government declared a state of emergency in the south .
The the number of wounded has risen to 1,000 , Echo of Moscow radio station reported Saturday .
The violence has spread to another large city , Jalal - Abad , where residents report that rioters burned down a university and captured a military unit and seized its weapons , the radio station reported .
The rioting comes as the interim government is struggling to consolidate control .
There have been occasional outbreaks of violence since a coup in April drove President Kurmanbek Bakiyev from power and into exile .
The ethnic riots appeared to be the worst in Kyrgyzstan since 1990 , when several hundred people died in clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks .
The Uzbek minority , at 14 % of the population , is the second - largest ethnic group in the country after the Kyrgyz , at 70 % .
But the population in Osh is evenly divided between the two groups .
In Osh , residents spoke of a city on fire .
“ I do n’t know what the army is doing , but they seem to be only making the situation worse , ” said Kokhramon Madaminov , 26 , an ethnic Uzbek who had gone with his wife to visit his parents in Osh a week ago and was stranded .
“ The troops are driving in tanks and armored vehicles along the city street and shoot from cannons and large - caliber machine guns at every opportunity , and naturally they hit residential houses and destroy them . ”
Madaminov , whose family lives in a southern suburb of Osh , said he could see thick smoke rising throughout the city .
“ It looks as if the whole city is ablaze , ” he said .
He said the people in Osh were running out of food and supplies .
Shops were either closed , their wares sold or looted , or had been burned .
He said thousands of people had left town by car , truck , donkey and on foot , heading for the Uzbekistan border .
“ If , before the conflict , there were at least as many Uzbeks in town as Kyrgyz , now most of them have already fled , ” Madaminov said .
“ We do n’t have guns , and we are shot at by Kyrgyz hoodlums who roam the city in groups of 20 to 30 men wearing masks and armed with Kalashnikovs .
“ Even troops will randomly shoot at you if they see you crossing the street , ” Madaminov said .
“ It is complete havoc . ”
In Moscow , before the Kremlin response to Otunbayeva ’s appeal , some officials had expressed skepticism about the prospect of Russia dispatching troops .
Lawmaker Konstantin Zatulin said in an interview with The Times that sending troops to Kyrgyzstan would be an extremely risky enterprise .
“ The Soviet Union once deployed its troops in Afghanistan at the invitation of that country , and that resulted in a long and most damaging war , ” Zatulin said .
“ We closely watch the events in Iraq and Afghanistan now , and we do n’t want to make mistakes . ”

Murray N. Rothbard 's great treatise Man , Economy , and State and its complementary text Power and Market , are here combined into a single edition as they were written to be .
It provides a sweeping presentation of Austrian economic theory , a reconstruction of many aspects of that theory , a rigorous criticism of alternative schools , and an inspiring look at a science of liberty that concerns nearly everything and should concern everyone .
From Rothbard , we learn that economics is the science that deals with the rise and fall of civilization , the advancement and retrenchment of human development , the feeding and healing of the multitudes , and the question of whether human affairs are dominated by cooperation or violence .
Economics in Rothbard 's wonderful book emerges as the beautiful logic of that underlies human action in a world of scarcity , the lens on how exchange makes it possible for people to cooperate toward their mutual betterment .
We see how money facilitates this , and allows for calculation over time that permits capital to expand and investment to take place .
We see how entrepreneurship , based on real judgments and risk taking , is the driving force of the market .
REVIEWS
As the result of many years of sagacious and discerning meditation , [ Rothbard ] joins the ranks of the eminent economists by publishing a voluminous work , a systematic treatise on economics ....
An epochal contribution to the general science of human action , praxeology , and its practically most important and up - to - now best elaborated part , economics .
Henceforth all essential studies in in these branches of knowledge will have to take full account of the theories and criticisms expounded by Dr. Rothbard .
— Ludwig von Mises
It is in fact the most important general treatise on economic principles since Ludwig von Mises 's Human Action in 1949 ….

Could you handle a DS game where the second screen was n't a mere map or inventory monitor , but an entirely separate adventure ?
This trailer for upcoming DS puzzle platformer / shooter Fractured Soul looks pretty bland and dull ... for about fifteen seconds or so .
Then it shows the other screen , and my mind begins to hurt .
Many DS games merely use the system 's second screen as a convenient menu / map / inventory .
Some actively make both screens part of the game - one screen controls what 's going on , the other screen displays the action .
Fractured Soul takes it a step further by having both screens involved in the action , only it 's different action .
From what I can tell from the trailer , Fractured Soul bends the Nintendo standard Light - World - Dark - World concept ( or , the Ikaruga Principle , if you would ) into rapid - fire time .
You can only interact with items and be hurt in the screen of the game that is currently active , but your doppelganger on the other screen repeats all of your actions .
The only trouble is that the two screens feature entirely different levels , and you 'll need to be keeping track of both to know if you 're switching into safety or just digging yourself a bigger hole .
Ow , my brain .

What is this ?
Frogatto is an action - adventure “ platformer ” game starring a certain green dude .
We could get a bit loquacious describing the game here , but you ’re better off looking at some pictures ; they ought to give you a sense of what it ’s all about .
Although frogatto is finished and fully - playable , we ’re planning some major additions to the game over the next few years .
Do n’t hesitate to download it now , but keep an eye on this site , because we ’ll be posting some exciting new stuff over time .
What does it run on ?
Frogatto was written for computers ( windows , mac , and linux ) , and mobile phones ( iPhone , BB10 ) .
You do n’t need a really fast computer , but you will need decent OpenGL support and at least 512 mb of ram .
People have suggested ports to various platforms ( like PSP , DS , Dreamcast , etc ) .
We ourselves are completely incapable of doing this – we know nothing about programming for these , we do n’t own these devices ourselves , and we ca n’t afford to pay someone else to do it .
If you can do a port , we ’d be happy to do business with you ( including potential freeware releases , such as for the Pandora / GP2 x ) .
But asking our current team to do it is useless .
How much does it cost ?
About $ 5 - 10 , depending if it ’s on sale .
Do you have a level editor ?
Why , yes , we do .
Can I help out ?
Sure !
We ’re open to almost anything – especially level designs , and translations to new languages .
We ’d love to have your help .
Join us on irc.freenode .
net in # frogatto , or pop on our forums .
We ’re also open to mods of all kinds ; if you want to change the game to make a fan - game version or something , knock yourself out – we ’d love to see it .
What ’s “ Open Source ” ?
Open source means you can see ( and reuse ) the code we built the game from .
This makes frogatto infinitely moddable ( and fixable , and maintainable , unlike closed - source ‘ moddable ’ games which leave you permanently stuck with engine bugs or future incompatibilities with , say , the next generation of operating systems or whatnot ) .
Even more importantly , this means you could take frogatto’s code ( the “ Anura ” engine ) , and build your own 2d game out of it .
We can help with advice on that – we ’d love to see that happen .
When Canonical unveiled Ubuntu 's branding overhaul and new desktop theme earlier this year , the company also revealed that it had commissioned well - known type foundry Dalton Maag to design a new font specifically for Ubuntu .
The font will likely be used by default in Ubuntu 10.10 , which is scheduled for release in October .
Today Canonical launched a closed beta for the new font , making it available to testers and Ubuntu contributors .
I tested it on my desktop computer , running Ubuntu 10.04 .
After installing the package , I enabled it in the GNOME appearance preference dialog .
It matches the new Ubuntu logo font , but it 's designed for optimal screen readability .
It looks very smooth on my LCD monitors and is very easy on the eyes .
I think it 's a big improvement over Bitstream Vera Sans , the font that currently ships by default in Ubuntu .
The quality of user interface typography on Linux is often criticized as one of the platform 's weak areas .
Some key software methods that are needed to achieve high - quality TrueType font rendering are encumbered by patents , which means that open source implementations such as FreeType have to rely on technical workarounds that are n't quite as effective .
Sadly , some Linux distros compound the problem by using poor default settings for subpixel smoothing .
Another major problem is the general lack of availability of high - quality freely redistributable fonts .
Canonical 's new Ubuntu font will ensure that Ubuntu users have great typography out of the box without having to install an alternate default font .
The current version that is available through the beta is still incomplete .
The bold weight is still being designed and is n't available yet .
When the font is complete and ready for widespread use , Canonical intends to distribute it under an open license so that it can be modified and redistributed .
They do n’t look like balls exactly .
The small ones look like dried out rabbit turds or kernels of a not particularly appetizing breakfast cereal .
The larger ones are maps of rust brown countries .
They could be jigsaw puzzle pieces — a rusty black red–and are sometimes the size of cow patties .
Someone — me ?—needs to write a natural history of tarballs .
I will say this , if I were walking down this beach without any sort of knowledge of the oil spill I might not notice them , or I might think they were a natural part of the ecosystem .
But I do know and I do notice .
And on this formerly pristine beach , ( see before and after pictures below ) jutting out into the Gulf of Mexico , they are everywhere .
That and the fact that the tide has left a bath ring , an orangish coating that reminds me of the red color that the Cat and the Hat and Things One and Two spread all over the poor kids ’ house .
If the tarballs are the creepiest thing about this beach , the second creepiest are the dozens and dozens of workers who I watch through the mist and wind , a half mile down the beach .
They are a ghostly prison crew in flurescent vests , sweeping the sands , though sweeping seems a far too energetic word for the timid picking they do with their shovels .
At various stops along this island stretch of beach , I ’ve seen a couple hundred of these men , many formerly unemployed and now paid 15 bucks an hour by BP to pick at the sand .
The second level of command , the sergeants , are muscular but overweight men who bark orders and drive around in 4 - wheel drive ATVS and amped up golf carts .
You might think that they would enjoy their little taste of authority , but they never smile .
No one seems to be having a good time .
“ Do n’t ask them any questions , ” the girl at the beer store told me .
“ BP wo n’t let them talk to civilians . ”
Her wording may sound strange at first but not when you see the workers spread over the beach : they in fact look like a sluggish corporate army .
It is an odd and truly startling fact : the same douchebags who caused this are now in charge of cleaning it up , which essentially puts them in charge of the beaches .
( An aside here for Bill : I like Obama , I really do , but why is it that I ca n’t imagine Teddy Roosevelt putting a corporation in charge of cleaning up a national park ? )
But despite the tar balls , and despite the ghostly clean up crews , this is still a beach , a beach like those I ’ve known on Cape Cod and Carolina and California .
A tern flies upwind with a sliver of minnow in its mouth .
Directly upland from the tarballs is a sea turtle nest where a young Kemp ’s Ridley incubates , soon to emerge and begin its crawl down to the oily sea .
An osprey sits in a hurricane - deadened tree , tearing apart a fish .
I did n’t really have much of a plan when I came down here , but now , on my first afternoon , I have at least the beginnings of a plan .
It is n’t very sexy or reporter - like , but I think one thing I ’m going to do is camp out here in my tent for a few days .
Get to know this beach like I ’ve gotten to know other beaches , and take field notes on both the terns and the tarballs .
It may sound odd to say , on a beach with hundreds of men with shovels , but as I walked back to the dunes , and cracked my first beer , I felt a little of that sense of solitude , and euphoria , that has always drawn me to beaches .
I thought I ’d gotten to a place where I was relatively alone but then I noticed the woman who walked down to the water and then back to a single hummock and bowed her head as if in prayer .
I was going to say hello but then I saw she was placing flowers on the sand and realized that she had been spreading the ashes of a loved one .
I gave her another mile of space before setting up my own little camp .
I took out my journal , my binoculars , another beer .
This was my first look at the Gulf of Mexico , white - capped and wind - blown , and of course just looking at the water was not enough .
I dove in and swam out a ways , despite the oil .
Earlier , when I asked the Rangers — friendly , generous , though obviously in mourning for their beach — if I could swim , they repeated BP ’s party line : “ If it looks clean you can go in . ”
As if anyone , even the diving tern , with vision so much better than my own , would truly be able to see the quality of the water it was diving into , would be able to see not just the oil but the chemical dispersants that may prove to be so much more deadly to the ecosystem than the oil itself .
As if the tern could see that the sliver of fish it held in its mouth carried BP ’s gift of those chemicals , chemicals already doing their ugly work inside the fish and soon enough , the bird .
As if the bird could discern that once again human beings could somehow not comprehend the simplest of notions , one it knew deep in its hollow bones , that everything in the world is connected , and that when you soil one thing you soil us all .
Unlike the bird , I had some idea what I was getting into .
But I swam anyway .
What the fuck .
We are all part of it .
The water might have been poisoned , but for the moment it felt good .
( I will not be using specfic beach names–or people names , for now –to protect the innocent {and me} )
The beach , before and after .
Prince William experienced the piercing din of a vuvuzela at close range during the latest stop on his African tour .
The 27 - year - old was visiting the Coaching for Conservation project in the town of Maun , in Botswana , when he was handed one of the plastic horns .
After failing to make a sound , William was forced to block his ear when he was out - blown by an 11 - year - old boy .
World Cup teams have complained about the vuvuzelas which are blown by fans throughout the games in South Africa .
The horns , which first appeared at sporting events in the early 1990s , have been found to be louder than a drum and a chainsaw when played close to the ear .
' Embarrassed myself '
When William was handed the horn by Rebaone Badubi , the prince said : " I can't blow it ...
OK , I will give it a go . "
Then , after barely making a sound , William said : " There you go - embarrassed myself again - it 's all good . "
Image caption Goalie William saw most of the children 's shots hit the back of the net
Rebaone then showed him how it should be done .
William and brother Harry are on a six - day tour - their first joint overseas royal trip - and will spend time visiting a number of charities they support in Botswana , Lesotho and South Africa .
On Wednesday , William saw youngsters taking part in Coaching for Conservation ( C4C ) , a project which combines football training and wildlife protection .
Children were divided into groups named after animals known to work well in teams , such as wild dogs and hyenas .
Also on hand to witness the skills practice was retired South African footballer Lucas Radebe .
Prince ' upstaged '
Speaking at the event , William said : " Sport gives us a sense of purpose and belonging through being part of a team .
" These qualities are shared by the extraordinary creatures around us , particularly here in Botswana .
" The wild dogs who work as a team and can run rings round even the best organised defence in the World Cup - even Germany's .
" The slowest cheetah that ever lived can beat Ronaldo to the ball .
The impala 's awareness and agility makes even Lucas Radebe 's awesome dribbling skills look , well , rather like mine . "
Image caption Prince William met US singer Joe Jonas , of the Jonas Brothers
William volunteered to go in goal and try to save penalties taken by some of the children - most sailed past him into the net .
But the prince was almost upstaged by US singer Joe Jonas , part of the Jonas Brothers group , who was also visiting charity .
He gave a brief performance - to screams from local teenage girls - and one , Megan Butler , 16 , admitted afterwards : " I like Prince William as well , but I was more excited about seeing Joe . "
William was later shown around the Laboratory for Wildlife Chemistry , run by the Botswana Predator Conservation Trust , where he was told how chemicals gathered from animals were being analysed to understand more about their behaviour .
The two princes will link up again in Lesotho before heading to Cape Town to watch England 's World Cup match against Algeria on Friday .
Football Association president Prince William will also be promoting England 's bid to host the tournament in 2018 .

ATLANTA — Patrons of Valentine 's Tavern were visibly crestfallen Tuesday when their pleasant evening of drinking and conversing with friends was suddenly derailed by the sight of a few people plugging in instruments .
" Ah , Christ , " bar - goer Nick Manikat said as a stand - up bass was rolled onto the stage .
" They have live music here ? "
According to patrons who had just ordered a round and did not have time to finish their drinks before the band 's set began , they were going to be stuck there for at least 15 or 20 fucking minutes .

Got $ 18,874 lying around that you could afford to blow in one day ?
Then you can afford the average wedding .
That 's how much the standard nuptials cost these days , according to Bride 's magazine .
That 's more than the cost of a four - year degree at an average - priced state college .
That 's almost as much as the average price of a new car .
And it 's definitely more than what my wife and I could afford to pay for our wedding almost four years ago .
You 've heard that necessity is the mother of invention .
( No one knows who the father was , since DNA testing was n't around when that cliche was born . )
In our case , however , it could be said that penury was the mother of un-convention .
There was no way we could pay for a catered , sit - down meal in a hotel ballroom with a live band .
What we could pay for was a cookout in a barn with a square - dance caller .
And it was a blast .
It was the best wedding I have ever been to , and I 'm not just saying that because I left with all the gifts .
Lots of people -- even the sober ones -- have told my wife and me that our wedding was one of the most fun they had ever attended .
It was a great wedding .
Now , do n't get me wrong -- I love traditional weddings .
But " traditional " also means " popular , " and something that 's " popular " can also be " ridiculously expensive . "
So , if you want to cut your conjugation bill , think non-traditional ... think memorable ... think laser tag .
Here 's how .
It 's all who you know , and who they know
We relied on a lot of help from family and friends for our big day .
The barn belonged to my wife 's sister .
The fellow who served as bartender was her friend .
My mom ( who used to be a florist ) took care of all the flowers , with some help from my sisters and an aunt .
My cousin , a restaurateur , took charge of the cooking .
The wine came from another cousin 's vineyard .
A college friend lent us his convertible Mercedes for the " Just Married " drive .
You get the idea .
As you plan your wedding , think of all the talented and stuff - owning people you know .
Would they mind lending their creativity , expertise , raw materials , culinary skills , expensive cars , yachts , hotels , or Port - o - Potties ( for those of you who want to hold your reception in a forest ) ?
But do n't stop there .
Perhaps the people you know know some people .
You 'll find that most folks like to help out friends of friends .
Expand your locations
You do n't have to rent a pricey hotel ballroom for your reception ( or your wedding ceremony , if you 're not church - inclined ) .
Tables and chairs can be set up in all kinds of places .
When contemplating where you 'll have your celebration , think of places that are important to you , perhaps a park , beach , restaurant , zoo , museum , roadside attraction , or tattoo parlor ( think of the wedding favors ! ) .
They might not advertise themselves as wedding locations , but it wo n't hurt to ask .
You might find that the owner of the old 1920s theater house -- the one where you and your betrothed had your first date -- would be honored to host your reception .
Another strategy is to think of places you and your friends and family have access to .
Does someone you know own ( or have connections to someone who owns ) a hotel , restaurant , country home , farm , high - rise rooftop , waterfront property , country club , warehouse , or Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) theme park ?
Actually , you do n't have to know the owner -- just someone who can get you in the door ( so to speak ) .
You can rent a lot of cool stuff
We rented the tent , tables , chairs , and giant grill for our reception .
But we also came very close to renting a moonbounce .
Which just shows that there 's a lot of fun out there , waiting to be temporarily under your control .
We 're talking popcorn machines , cotton candy makers , lighting , dance floors , town facades , painted backdrops , Elvis impersonators , karaoke machines , Velcro walls , mechanical bulls , hot - air balloons , and most congresspersons .
OK , so not everyone wants their wedding to be a carnival ( so forget the congresspersons ) .
But if you 're worried that the location of your ceremony or reception lacks a little flair , or color , or ambience , or plumbing , chances are you can rent some -- especially if you 're saving a huge chunk of change by choosing your employer 's spacious meeting room .
Other tips
We found many other ways to save on the wedding bill .
Here are a few of them :
Buy in bulk from one of the deep discounters such as Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) or Wal - Mart 's ( NYSE : WMT ) Sam's Club .
These places sell everything a do - it - yourself wedding planner would need : beer , food , soda , decorations , booze , vegetables the size of lawn tools , tents , lighting , liquor , gifts , desserts , hooch , snack trays , bridesmaids , disposable cameras , and much , much more -- in large quantities and at low prices .
We also had luck at Big Lots ( NYSE : BIG ) , where we bought all our tablecloths ( much cheaper than renting , and we 'll have them for years ) .

We also had luck at ( NYSE : BIG ) , where we bought all our tablecloths ( much cheaper than renting , and we 'll have them for years ) .
Rather than pay for a $ 500 wedding cake , we set up a dessert table , featuring a multi- layer cheesecake ( made by my wife 's sister ) and a variety of treats from a local bakery .
We saved a bunch of money , and received many favorable comments ( especially from kids and people who do n't like cake ) .
We hired an amateur photographer , and put friends in charge of the videorecording .
Some people will say that this is n't a place to cut costs since you 'll have these images forever , and to some extent , we agree .
But professional services are very expensive .
If you go the amateur route , just make sure you get samples and references , and choose friends who really know what they 're doing .
With the sophistication and affordability of desktop publishing software -- and the ability to have the product emailed and printed by your local FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) Kinko's -- it 's easy to produce your own invitations and programs .
( NYSE : FDX ) Kinko's -- it 's easy to produce your own invitations and programs .
We held our rehearsal dinner in the cafeteria of the elementary school where my wife and I met ( as teachers -- we are n't first - grade sweethearts ) .
A tasteful friend did the decorating , and each table was covered in pictures of everyone at the dinner .
The good time everyone had while sharing old photos was only matched by the trans - classroom laser tag that followed .
The " I do " do - se -do
Perhaps the best decision we made about our wedding was hiring a square - dance caller .
My wife and I had n't square - danced since grade school , and I 'm not quite sure where the idea came from .
But a wedding squeezes a whole bunch of people who do n't know one another into a small space .
Square dancing was a great way to get these strangers to bow to their partner , bow to their corner , and promenade .
Butch Adams , our professional caller , did a fantastic job of teaching everyone the moves , and he was much cheaper than a band that could play " The Electric Slide " and " The Macarena . "
So , in the end , it was n't the food or the decorations or the booze that made our wedding so memorable .
It was what people did , and how much fun they had with each other .
That 's something to keep in mind as you plan your own big day .

Not a single guest complained .
This week on the site , we want to celebrate some of the heroes of the PC gaming community .
People who 've devoted huge amounts of their free time to making something awesome for the rest of us to enjoy .
Today we 're talking to Markus ' Notch ' Persson , creator of the awesome indie building game Minecraft - which , it turns out , most of Valve seem to be playing .
PC Gamer :
When I first heard of Minecraft , it was still mainly a sandbox building game , with a handful of blocks and no multiplayer of any kind .
How long have you known that you wanted Minecraft to be the kind of co-op wilderness survival game it 's shaping up to be these days ?
Notch : I knew what kind of game I wanted to do pretty much from day one , actually .
When I started what would later evolve into Minecraft , the main inspiration was to do something that was a mixture of Dwart Fortress , Rollercoaster Tycoon and Dungeon Keeper , with a big emphasis on keeping the game accessible .
I was toying around with a first person mode similar to the Possess spell in Dungeon Keeper when I saw Infiniminer , and that 's when the game turned into the first person , hands on type of game it is today .
PC Gamer : You worked with Rolf Jansson on Wurm Online before you started work on Minecraft .
Although wildly different , they both have some strong fundamental similarities - the terrain grid , spiders being bastards , player - created strongholds - who rubbed off on who ?
Notch : Originally , Rolf wanted to make a Western MMO with people finding their own destinies and really being in control of the economics and politics in the game .
I wanted to do something a fully modifiable fantasy world with huge forests .
We decided that a gritty down - to - earth type of fantasy game with real consequences and player driven politics would be a great compromise .
Over time , I got more responsible for the representation and technology of the game , while he took charge of the economy part .
As for the spiders ..
I suffer from mild arachnophobia and remember the giant spiders in Eye of the Beholder as being one of the scariest enemies in a role playing game .
I 'm not sure why I keep exposing myself to them as enemies in my games ..
PC Gamer :
When did you first realise you could make Minecraft as your day job ?
What did that feel like ?
Notch : Just a couple of months after opening up alpha sales , I realized that people really liked the game , and that it really had potential to become something big , so I dropped down to working 40 % part time .
Thankfully , the people who run the place I worked at ( Jalbum.net ) come from a background of driving small hobby projects into proper companies , so they were very understanding .
It took me another six months to finally dare taking the leap and going proper full time .
I gave three months notice , and by the time I left , it already was quite obvious I had made the right decision , with Minecraft sales steadily climbing up .
PC Gamer : Being a one man development team , you 're filling a lot of roles that a large studio would parcel off to specialists .
Is there anything you do n't like doing , or any part of the process you look forward to ?
Notch : I really used to hate doing art , but after years of doing it all on my own , I 've actually started to enjoy it .
Once you get to know it , doing pixel graphics really is less of a magic artform than you 'd think .
With patience and a critical eye you can get decent results even if you have no artistic talent , like me .
Another side I keep procrastinating or straight out ignoring is all the business type work , like setting up a proper limited corporation , getting started on doing Creeper Plushies , or getting in contact with potential distribution partners .
PC Gamer : Multiplayer Survival is probably the aspect of Minecraft that excites me most .
What was your most fun experience of the recent private testing ?
Did anything let you down , aside from bugs ?
Notch :
The second time I ran the test , the password for the server got leaked and ended up on 4 chan , meaning the server started getting flooded with connection requests , so I gave in and published the password on my twitter .
As a result the server got over three connection attempts per second for almost seven hours straight .
The most surprising and awesome part was that the server actually HELD .
It was disappointing to see the password leak so fast , but then again , the internet is the internet , and it really was inevitable .
Besides , I got some great testing out of it .
The most fun I had with the actual tests was when I ran the server in debug mode so I could replace code while it was still running , meaning I could cause all sorts of havoc .
I made one player turn water into ice and put snow on all blocks near him , another player turn snow into fire , and a third one turn fire into TNT .
TNT and fire meant explosions .
It was also fun to make random players spawn slime ball items constantly , mainly because the drop animation made it look like they were constantly throwing up green slime .
PC Gamer :
Of all the elements at play in Minecraft , the way that water and lava works seems to have gone through the most radical changes .
How would you like them to behave ideally , and what sorts of things prevent you from making that happen ?
Notch : Ideally , they 'd behave more like their real life counter - parts .
I used to have a model which would search through the level for the highest connected water block and drain water from there when water flowed , but I had to stop using that .
Not only was it very slow , it also was incompatible with the infinite level rewrite where only a limited area of the map is loaded into memory at any given time .
The current model is a purely local one with blocks only knowing about their immediate surroundings , meaning it 's much faster and compatible with the memory model .
It does produce weird results sometimes , but I 've decided to stop working on water until the rest of the game is in place .
PC Gamer :
Do you know in advance what you 're doing for the Friday updates ?
How long does it usually take the community to discover everything you 've slipped in there ?
Notch : The Friday updates serve two purposes .
For one , they let me let off some steam and just do what I think is the most fun with game development ; adding radical new features .
And secondly , they work great as a regular weekly thing to keep the game feeling fresh .
Since I use them as a way to just goof around a bit , I try not to overthink them in advance , and usually decide what to do on the Thursday just before getting started working on it .
It does n't stay a secret for long , though .
People look in the game binaries and compare files with the previous version , if there 's new item art , there probably is a new item .
Secrets generally only last for like twenty minutes before I see them posted in the comments on my blog .
It 's pretty entertaining .
PC Gamer :
You 've said that Minecraft will be done when you 've finished up Survival mode , and that you 'll expand it with a more traps - themed content release afterwards .
Is that still the plan ?
What 's next for Minecraft , after that ?
Notch : When Minecraft has working survival mode multiplayer , it will have all the features I originally wanted , so I will declare that to be the finished version .
Then I will keep working on the game for as long as people play and buy it , adding large and small features and releasing them as free updates to the game .
I have many more games I want to do , but there 's so much potential in Minecraft that I can see myself working on it for a long time .
Once the game stops selling and I 've moved on to something else , I will release most of the game as open source ( excluding the parts I am not the original author , such as the sounds ) , so that other people can keep expanding the game .
PC Gamer : Will Minecraft go up to full price when you 're done with Multiplayer Survival then ?
Are you going to make a big thing of the release ?
Notch :
When the game hits beta , the price will go up to 14.95 euro , with the final price being 19.95 euro once beta is over .
I have NO idea how long beta will be , as it really depends on how much polish there is to do .
Hopefully less than I 'd fear .
Beta is coming this summer some time , not too long after SMP testing is out .
I want to make a big deal out of going beta , then again when going to full release , but I 'm not quite sure exactly what to do .
I 'd love for you guys to mention it . :D
PC Gamer :
There are tons of things you could add to Minecraft , and certainly an avalanche of requests from the community ( pulping wood to make papyrus and grinding flowers to make ink was one of my favourite examples ) .
Do you have a self - imposed limit on the sheer volume of crafting recipes and interlocking mechanisms you 'll put in the game , for accessibility 's sake ?
Notch :
There are a few technical limitations , such as there being a maximum of 256 different block types ( about 70 are in use at the moment ) , and 36000 different items .
From a game design level , I try to focus on adding things that add a new dimension to the game rather than to just add several similar versions of the same thing .
I do think it would be great to have more farming options , or different types of arrows , but generally I try to go with the more radical stuff .
The idea is that if I add enough things that can interact in unexpected ways , they will .
I guess I 'm aiming for emergent gameplay .
PC Gamer : How has the PC platform affected your success with Minecraft ?
What would alternate - universe - Markus have had to do to make a living with Minecraft for consoles ?
Notch : PC has the great benefit of having a fully unrestricted access to the internet , with the ability for anyone to install anything they choose , making it very easy to get people to try what you have made .
You can play Minecraft directly in your web browser within minutes of hearing about it , which is something that 's very hard to do on consoles .
Console manufacturers are starting to open up to community content , but it really is quite limited , and probably will remain so out of fear of piracy .
To get your game featured , it needs to be a finished game , and you need to know the right people and how to market yourself , meaning there 's a MUCH larger initial cost than when doing a PC game which you can get out to the market within weeks with absolutely no budget .
If the PC game flops , you can respond to feedback and move on , or you can scrap it and start on something else .
If the console game flops , you 've lots heaps of money and probably upset a couple of suits in the process .
Minecraft would never had stood a chance if I designed it for consoles from the start .
I would 've had to find a publisher or investor who was willing to invest in a frankly rather strange game idea , then I would 've had to either get it out in stores and compete with 60 euro titles , or have it be featured as a mini game on XBLA or PSN .
I do n't think that 's very likely .
That said , it would be very interesting to port the game to a few consoles ( perhaps the Pandora ? ) later on .
I know doing a very limited Android version would n't be impossible at all .
Notch , put in a mace that you can hold to charge up and let go to swing , and have it so you can put dynamite on the end , and ... hello ?
Editor 's Note : Because Android is moving at a rapid pace , so we 've updated this guide with the latest information on more recent versions of Android .
You can find the new version here .
There is a clear difference in how Android and the iPhone handle your personal data .
With the iPhone , you connect the phone to a PC with a USB cable , and use iTunes to manage content .
It might seem increasingly archaic these days to rely on a PC to use a smartphone , but there is a practical upshot to it .
Apple has built in a simple , fast backup solution for the iPhone into iTunes .
If you end up getting a new phone for whatever reason , you can just restore the backup to the new handset .
On Android , the picture is n't as clear .
Android takes the cloud - based approach .
At first , the platform was n't really showing off its cloud - connected potential .
It really felt unfinished in that way .
But it is becoming increasingly clear where Google is going with Android , and how that relates to data backup and security .
As it stands right now , you just can't do a complete backup of an Android phone without rooting the device and voiding the warranty .
Let 's go over what you can backup , what you do n't need to backup , and what you can look forward to in Android backup .
Contacts , SMS , and Call Logs
First off , we suggest you do n't use a third party app to backup your contacts .
This is one piece of the puzzle Google has handled well from the start .
The contact database on the phone is completely integrated with Google Contacts .
This is a service that any Gmail user is taking advantage of whether or not they know it .
When you log into an Android phone it will sync the contacts associated with that account .
For many , this might only include email addresses .
But adding in your phone numbers ( which you can do on either the phone or the PC ) will ensure your address book will remain safe and sound in the cloud , ready to be synced to any Android device you want .
You will find innumerable apps on the Market that will offer to backup your contacts , SMS , and call log .
We 've already talked about contacts , but having a record of calls and texts is important to some .
For the most part , these apps just create a file on the SD card that can be restored later .
But what if you lose your phone ?
Having data on the SD card is n't going to help much .
Some apps have online backup to add a little peace of mind .
We use Sprite Mobile Backup because it has options for saving data to Dropbox and Box.net .
It works well , but the file it outputs is a single block of data that you 'll need Sprite to restore .
Sprite can also backup some of the stock Google app settings .
Similarly , you can backup SMS to your Gmail with an app called SMS Backup .
The only problem is this is a one way process .
You can not pull this data back onto a phone .
There is a really interesting way to keep your call log backed up that actually provides additional functionality .
CallTrack adds an entry to your Google Calendar for each call you receive , make , or miss .
Each of these categories can be turned off , so if you only need to keep track of your missed calls , for instance , you can do so .
This , like SMS Backup , is n't traditional backup as there 's no way to import the data back into a phone , but we feel it fulfills the spirit of a backup by making the data available even if the phone is lost .
Also , it 's just an awesome app .
Apps
The situation with apps is a strange one .
Most apps save all their data on the internal memory , though some do you a favor and create a folder on the SD card for easy backup .
If everything is on the internal memory , you can't save the app 's state without rooting .
However , if the app is not copy protected , you can backup the package so you can install it later .
Our favorite app for doing this is Astro , since it's a great file manager , it 's always on our phones anyway .
In the tools menu , you can select the Application Manager .
There you can pick the apps you want to backup .
The protected apps are not selectable here .
The apps will show up as APK files on your SD card .
These can be loaded on an Android phone without the Market .
About the Market , though - - restoring apps with this method cuts you off from updates through the Android Market .
If you just install an application via an APK file , the Android Market on the phone has no idea you 've got it installed .
So that means you wo n't get updates the usual way .
You 're better off just installing apps from the Market if possible .
The Market will keep a list of all paid apps associated with your account .
The APK backup method only makes sense if you need an older version of an app , or if the app is no longer available .
Google has made some strides that make this process less necessary .
Starting in Android 2.0 , Google began doing cloud - based backups of the apps associated with a particular Google account .
Logging into a new 2.0 + phone will cause the previously installed apps to be restored .
Well , sometimes they 're restored .
It 's often like a form of black magic to get everything to go smoothly .
In our experience , if you log into the phone and do not launch the Android Market , your apps should be restored .
In fact , it 's best to just set the phone aside for a few minutes .
If your apps do n't seem to be coming back , you can try hard resetting the phone to try again .
To activate this functionality , you have to make sure ' Back up my settings " is checked in the Privacy settings before you switch devices .
The restored apps wo n't have any of their associated data , though .
So your progress in games and in - app settings are lost .
Do not despair though , Google is working on this .
At the recent Google I / O conference we got some excellent app backup news .
Google will be allowing developers to use a new data backup API in Android 2.2 ( Froyo ) .
Combined with the existing app syncing introduced in Android 2.0 , your apps should be able to sync down to a new phone and exist just as they did before .
The only caveat is that developers have to actually take advantage of the data backup feature in their apps .
It wo n't just happen automatically like the syncing of the apps themselves .
They did n't discuss it , but we 're really hoping they clean up the process of syncing apps so it 's easier to see what 's going on .
For Google 's brief explanation of app cloud backup , and the new data backup API , check out this video from I/O ( might not load properly in HTML5 player ) .
System Settings
This is an easy one .
If you 're on an Android 2.0 + phone , you do n't have to worry about most of your system settings .
Just logging into a phone and waiting a few minutes will get your settings back to normal .
This is controlled by the same privacy checkbox as the app restore functionality .
The data you can expect to magically reappear includes Wi -Fi networks , privacy settings , accessibility options , wallpaper and search settings .
This will not save any third - party account sync settings like Facebook , Exchange , or Twitter ( in Froyo ) .
For us , the only big category missing is the custom dictionary .
We 've never seen that sync properly .
Might be worth using a third - party app for this is you 've added a lot of words .
Unfortunately , this too sometimes just fails to work .
We 've had instances where everything is back , and others where only bits and pieces seem to be restored .
Since the phone has no data on it at this point , a quick hard reset lets you try the sync again .
This is what we 've seen so far with Android phones .
It is possible the final version of Froyo could have more robust syncing abilities .
If you do n't want to trust this admittedly sketchy process , Sprite Backup can backup your system settings as well .
The backup situation on Android is far from perfect .
We can see where Google is going now , we just wish they 'd get there faster .
The idea of having everything important to our phone in the cloud is comforting in a way an iTunes backup can never be .
If you choose to root your Android phone there are apps like Nandroid and Titanium Backup that can make full backup images of your phone .
But this just is n't the answer for most consumers .
Google is making progress , and we 're encouraged .
For the time being though , it 's a bit of a hodgepodge to keep your Android phone backed up .
Do you backup anything on your Android phone ?
Let us know how you do it .

Good green things come in extremely small packages .
Marque Cornblatt on Gomi Style , a do - it - yourself blog , posted some wonderful wee gardens planted in recycled Altoid and other tiny candy tins :
“ These tiny succulent cuttings and small herbs seem to be thriving in organic potting soil .
I water them a few times a day . ”
Among the diminutive delicacies : A single cutting in organic soil covered with black stones and a tiny bonsai in a promotional CD case .
“ They will likely stay small with such a small volume of soil , ” comments the mini-horticulturist .
“ They should be misted a few times a day but do n’t overwater .
A light covering of stones will help keep the soil moist .
Perfect for the office . ”
Cornblatt contends he really knows very little about plants .
“ However , ” he says , demonstrating he knows a little , “ all of these small succulents are native to northern California and are very hearty .
I plucked them out of my yard like weeds .
They require minimal care and watering .
The Bonsai were chosen based on small size .
I have one that is a Pine , and a few others I do n’t know .
I also grew cat grass and other sprouting seeds .
The only plant that did n’t last long were the herbs , because they need to grow –the succulents and Bonsai are content to remain small . ”
The benevolent gardens of tin .

Carrying the teeny theme further , Toonen gathered some smooth stones and felted them with mossy green wool after which she incorporated some cladonia specimens into the fiber :

I just put the finishing touches on a tiny little interpreter project : Jasic .
Jasic is a dialect of the original BASIC programming language .
It lacks functions and scope , but it ’s a usable language .
Even on an old Apple IIe , it was powerful enough to get me hooked on coding for life .
Also , you can draw a Mandelbrot set with it .
I wanted to see if I could fit a complete interpreter in a single readable Java file .
It worked out better than expected , so I went ahead and cleaned up the code and commented the hell out of it .
If you ’ve always wanted to learn more about interpreters , now you ’ve got a little primer .
Here ’s a little code to give you a flavor of the language :
' initialize the loop counter count = 10 ' stop looping if we 're done top : if count = 0 then end print " Hello , world ! " ' decrement and restart the loop count = count - 1 goto top end :
Old school !
All of the code is right here in Jasic.

What are you waiting for ?
The White House chief of staff is believed to be among 114,000 iPad owners , including chief executives and military officials , whose personal details have been exposed through a breach of the website of the US phone network AT&T .
AT&T acknowledged the leak but said the risk was limited to the subscriber 's email address and that the issue had been " escalated to the highest levels of the company " .
UK customers are not thought to have been affected or to be vulnerable to the same attack .
The names and email addresses of those involved apparently includes Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , members of the US Senate and House of Representatives , staff at Nasa and the department of homeland security , the New York Times , Viacom , Time Warner , bankers and venture capitalists .
It will be an embarrassment to Apple , which has sold more than 2 m of the tablet computers since they went on sale in the US at the start of April , and late last month internationally .
The iPad comes in two main versions , one with 3G and one without .
The news that the 3G version could have been liable to hacking could depress sales of the more profitable version .
It will also increase friction between Apple and AT&T , which has had the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone since 2007 , and now the 3G - enabled iPad in the US .
The exclusivity is believed to be a five - year deal but many Apple fans have accused AT&T 's network of being unable to support their growing demand for bandwidth .
The Gawker website , which says it has seen details of the email addresses – provided in a foot - high printout – suggests that the flaw makes any of those people vulnerable to spam marketing and malicious hacking .
The breach was demonstrated by a team of hackers calling themselves Goatse Security , who have previously pointed to weaknesses in web browsers .
They were able to use a flaw in the AT&T website to get the email address of any AT&T subscriber by providing a piece of data called an ICC - IDS , used to identify the SIM card belonging to that subscriber .
The team sent data to the site pretending to be each of a huge sequence of ICC - IDS devices , and requested the email address .
They say they also shared the knowledge of the hack with others , until AT&T closed the breach a few days ago .
An AT&T spokesman said : " AT&T was informed by a business customer on Monday of the potential exposure of their iPad ICC - IDS .
The only information that can be derived from the ICC - IDS is the e-mail address attached to that device .
This issue was escalated to the highest levels of the company and was corrected by Tuesday ; and we have essentially turned off the feature [ on the website ] that provided the e-mail addresses .
" The person or group who discovered this gap did not contact AT&T .
We are continuing to investigate and will inform all customers whose e-mail addresses and ICC - IDS may have been obtained . "
" We take customer privacy very seriously and while we have fixed this problem , we apologise to our customers who were impacted . "
Apple did not have any statement .
If the hackers have discovered a flaw that was widespread in AT&T 's handling of the ICC - ID system , then it is possible that every owner in the US with an iPhone 3GS or a 3G iPad may have had their email address lifted by the group , and possibly others .
Only iPads which use 3G networking would be vulnerable to the hack , and although any device which uses a SIM will have an ICC - ID , it is not known whether the British networks which provide connectivity for the iPad would have the same flaw as AT&T 's website .

European police to spy on Britons : Now ministers hand over Big Brother powers to foreign officers
New powers : Police officers from European countries could soon be able to spy on and arrest Britons in the UK
Ministers are ready to hand sweeping Big Brother powers to EU states so they can spy on British citizens .
Foreign police will be able to travel to the UK and take part in the arrest of Britons .
They will be able to place them under surveillance , bug telephone conversations , monitor bank accounts and demand fingerprints , DNA or blood samples .
Anyone who refuses to comply with a formal request for co-operation by a foreign - based force is likely to be arrested by UK officers .
The move will spark a damaging row with backbench Tory MPs opposed to giving such draconian powers to Brussels .
The Tories were opposed to the directive in opposition , saying it showed a ‘ relish for surveillance and disdain for civil liberties ’ .
But ministers have made a dramatic U - turn since joining the pro-EU Lib Dems in government , and the wide - ranging powers are due to be approved later this week .
According to the campaign group Fair Trials International , under the new rules it would be possible , for example , for Spanish police investigating a murder in a nightclub to demand the ID of every British citizen who flew to the country in the month the offence took place .
They could also force the UK to search its DNA database – which contains nearly one million innocent people – and send samples belonging to anybody who was in Spain at the time .
This could leave an entirely innocent person facing an agonising battle to establish his or her innocence .
Tory MP Dominic Raab , who has campaigned against the power grab , said : ‘ This sweeping directive would put serious operational strains on hard - pressed UK police forces .
‘ There are scant safeguards to protect the personal information of law - abiding British citizens .
These serious issues should be properly debated in Parliament before the UK decides to opt in . ’
The new powers are known as the European Investigation Order ( EIO ) , which is intended as a partner to the highly controversial European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
One of the major concerns about the EAW , to which Britain is signed up , is that it has been used to investigate the most minor misdemeanours , such as the ‘ theft of a dessert ’ in a Polish restaurant .
Now member states want to make it easier to gather evidence on another ’s soil .
The proposal requires an ‘ opt in ’ , which means Britain could sit back and play no part in the new regime .
But Whitehall insiders say ministers have been persuaded it has many benefits .
In particular , police say they will gain from the fact that the arrangements will be reciprocal , making it easier for them to track suspects overseas .
However the powers in the directive are available to prosecutors only .
Britons under suspicion will not have any right to demand information from overseas police which could prove their innocence .
Benefits : Whitehall insiders say ministers in Britain have been persuaded by the foreign police plan
The countries demanding the new powers include ex-Eastern Bloc states Bulgaria , Estonia and Slovenia , as well as Belgium , Spain , Luxembourg and Austria .
Other nations , including Denmark , are believed to be ready to say no .
Fair Trials International has been leading demands for Britain to stay out of the EIO .
The group fears miscarriages of justice and civil liberties abuses and is also concerned about UK police being obliged to investigate matters which are not even crimes here , such as the Portuguese offence of criminal defamation .
Whitehall officials say UK police would be allowed to refuse these requests .
It is the first time the coalition has had to consider a controversial EU directive .
Poll Should Britain opt out of the European Investigation Order ?
Yes No Should Britain opt out of the European Investigation Order ?
Yes 5336 votes
No 856 votes
Now share your opinion
The fact that ministers are actively opting in will cause great concern on the Tory benches .
MPs point out that since the signing of the Lisbon Treaty , justice and Home Office matters are among the few areas over which we retain control of our own affairs .
A Home Office spokesman said : ‘ The Government is considering whether or not we should opt in to the European Investigation Order .
‘ As we pledged in the coalition document , the Government will approach legislation in the area of criminal justice on a case - by - case basis , with a view to maximising our country ’s security , protecting civil liberties and preserving the integrity of our criminal justice system . ’
' British FBI ' and elected police chiefs to aid war against crime
Police shake - up : Theresa
May is to announce new reforms to tackle serious crime
Plans for directly elected police commissioners and a new FBI - style agency to tackle serious crime will be unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May today .
Voters will be allowed to elect powerful officials who will control multi-million - pound force budgets and can order chief constables to carry out their policies – or face the sack .
Mrs May hopes the reforms will free police from bureaucracy , making them ‘ crime - fighters , not form - writers ’ .
But she faces fierce opposition from the Association of Chief Police Officers , whose president , Sir Hugh Orde , has previously warned that the new jobs could attract ‘ retired coppers or lunatics ’ .
The idea will be to have the first elections as soon as possible .
The commissioners will replace the current chairmen of local police authorities , who are simply appointed .
Mrs May will also announce radical plans to scrap the discredited Serious Organised Crime Agency and replace it with the National Crime Agency , a force to crack down on organised crime , drug - smuggling and people - trafficking .
Soca was launched four years ago but faced fierce criticism , amid revelations it had clawed back only £ 78 million from crime bosses despite costing the taxpayer a staggering £ 1.2 billion .
A Whitehall source said last night the NCA , which is expected to have a team of between 3,000 and 8,000 ‘ agents ’ , had ‘ been approved and has been designed specifically to become Britain ’s very own FBI ’ .
The proposals , forming part of Lib - Con coalition ’s Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill , are set out in an internal document entitled Policing In The 21st Century .
Mrs May will also outline a major shake - up to ensure forces do not prevent police officers from carrying out their public duties , for instance jumping into a pond to rescue a drowning child , for fear of breaching health and safety regulations .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration wants to boost the staggering U.S. economy by boosting exports and offering small - business tax credits , but the prospects for additional stimulus spending are weak , the president 's top political adviser conceded Sunday .
" Everybody agrees we have to do more , " David Axelrod told CNN 's " State of the Union . "
He said the administration has boosted the economy with its first stimulus package , which it pushed through Congress shortly after taking office in 2009 , and Obama has pledged to double U.S. exports in five years , but , " We have to accelerate that . "
But with members of Congress expressing increasing concern about the budget deficit , which already tops $ 1 trillion for a budget year that ends in September , Axelrod admitted there 's " not a great desire " for additional government spending .
" Even though there 's some argument for additional spending in the short run to continue to generate economic activity , there 's not a great appetite for it , " he told ABC's " This Week . "
Axelrod said the administration still can push for tax relief and expanded lending for small businesses , which he called " an engine of economic growth , " and said Congress " ought to extend undemployment insurance " for the long - term jobless .
" We 're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that , " he said .
The Republican minority in the Senate has so far blocked an extension of weekly jobless checks to an estimated 2.1 million people , demanding that the money should be offset by other cuts .
And they are arguing that the Bush administration 's entire slate of tax cuts be kept in place beyond the end of the year , when they are set to expire .
" How are going to you invest if you 're an investor when you think your capital gains taxes are going to go up and your dividends are going to go up ?
And if you 're a small business owner , you 're going to get hit with a tax increase , too .
No wonder the economy is stagnant , " former Bush administration adviser Ed Gillespie told NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
But critics like Paul Krugman , a Nobel Prize - winning economist and New York Times columnist , argue that a seemingly faltering economic recovery needs more short - term government spending to stay afloat -- particularly since states are facing significant cutbacks and layoffs .
And President Barack Obama has jumped into the fray with both feet as the November election nears , mocking Republican leaders who saw budget deficits return and grow rapidly while they controlled Congress and the White House .
" It 's a little odd getting lectures on sobriety from folks who spent like drunken sailors for the last decade , " Obama said Thursday during an appearance in Kansas City , Missouri .
Axelrod told CNN that voters in going to the polls in November will have a choice " between two economic theories : the one that got us into this disaster in the first place , and the one that is getting us out . "
" There is no doubt that the Republican strategy has basically been to say ' no ' to everything and to try and turn the clock back in order to win an election and restore the policies that got us into this mess in the first place , " he said .
" And that 's something we can't abide and that 's something we can't accept . "
( CNN ) -- City council members in the small California town of Bell -- where outrage over high salaries forced three officials to resign last week -- voted Monday night to slash their pay .
And the mayor , who last week defended the salaries , said he would forgo a salary altogether and would not seek reelection .
But the move was not enough to appease angry residents who demanded that the council members step down .
" You all need to go to jail , " a self - described underpaid teacher said at a contentious meeting Monday night .
" Shame on you .
All of you . "
When Councilwoman Teresa Jacobo said she will slash her salary but hold on to office , the crowd booed loudly and repeatedly .
" If you do n't want to resign , we 'll recall you , " said one man .
The city council voted to reduce its pay to that of what one councilman , Lorenzo Veles , was being paid : $ 8,076 a year .
Most of the other council members made nearly 10 times as much .
The Bell salaries have provoked statewide anger at a time when California is grappling with a near $ 20 billion budget deficit .
The median annual income of Bell -- which counted about 36,000 residents in the 2000 census -- is less than $ 35,000 .
Like Mayor Oscar Hernandez , another councilman George Mirabal said he will not seek reelection .
Said the mayor in a statement : " We must restore Bell 's pride in our city and that requires a full , transparent , and deliberate review of the city 's actions . "
Last week , the city council accepted the resignations of City Manager Robert Rizzo , Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia , and Police Chief Randy Adams , who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $ 1.6 million .
Also on Monday , California Attorney General Jerry Brown , who is running for governor , said he subpoenaed hundreds of records from Bell as part of an investigation to determine whether civil or criminal action should be taken against any city leaders .
Brown said most city council members are paid some $ 100,000 for their part - time positions , citing the Los Angeles Times -- which initially reported on the salaries .
" These outrageous pay practices are an insult to the hard - working people of Bell and have provoked righteous indignation in California and even across the country , " said Brown .
He added his office will review salaries in other jurisdictions around the state to see whether similar abuses might be happening elsewhere .
Matthew Yglesias and Ryan McNealy : Niall Ferguson Debates
Himself : I ’ve been known to remark on the conservative movement ’s strong adherence to Keynesian arguments as a justification for tax cuts in the wake of the mild 2001 recession , adherence that seems puzzling in light of their contrary rhetoric in the wake of the cataclysmic 2008 - 2009 downturn .
Brad DeLong observes that one particularly hilarious example of this is historian - turned - pundit Niall Ferguson who wrote a December 12 , 2003 article on the Bush administration that ’s in considerable with his contemporary take on things .
DeLong requests a Ferguson v Ferguson debate , and with assistance from Ryan McNeely I ’m prepared to unveil one .
2003 Ferguson is in boldface , 2010 Ferguson is in italics :
Certainly .
Long before Keynes was even born , weak governments in countries from Argentina to Venezuela used to experiment with large peace - time deficits to see if there were ways of avoiding hard choices .
The experiments invariably ended in one of two ways .
Either the foreign lenders got fleeced through default , or the domestic lenders got fleeced through inflation .
But the United States has broken the guns or butter rule before .
Under President Ronald Reagan , substantial increases in military spending coincided with comparable increases , relative to gross domestic product , in personal consumption — that proportion of G.D.P. that the public , as opposed to the government , spends .
The crucial point , of course , is that in the short term at least , fiscal policy is not a zero -sum game .
But this does n’t respond to long run inflationary fears .
When economies were growing sluggishly , that could be slow in coming .
But there invariably came a point when money creation by the central bank triggered an upsurge in inflationary expectations .
But , as Keynes remarked , in the long run we are all dead !
Are n’t these “ inflationary expectations ” priced into the markets ?
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , who likens confidence to an imaginary “ fairy ” have failed to learn from decades of economic research on expectations .
All it takes is one piece of bad news – a credit rating downgrade , for example – to trigger a sell - off .
But this will not be the kind of inflation experienced in the 1970 ’s and 1980’s .
So powerful are the deflationary forces today ( notably in the second and third biggest economies , Japan and Germany ) that Washington can splurge on its military and social services with only a modest impact on expectations of inflation .
But it is not just inflation that bond investors fear .
Foreign holders of US debt – and they account for 47 per cent of the federal debt in public hands – worry about some kind of future default .
But the United States has a unique advantage over all other sovereign borrowers : central banks and other institutions around the world need to hold dollars as the currency most frequently used in international transactions .
While this is true , America can count on selling large amounts of dollar assets , like 10 - year Treasury bonds , to foreigners — very large amounts .
But for how long ?
The evidence is very clear from surveys on both sides of the Atlantic .
People are nervous of world war - sized deficits when there is n’t a war to justify them .
According to a recent poll published in the FT , 45 per cent of Americans “ think it likely that their government will be unable to meet its financial commitments within 10 years ” .
Surveys of business and consumer confidence paint a similar picture of mounting anxiety .
The only imminent danger is that the dollar could slide sharply against Asian currencies , as it has against the euro .
But the chief losers then would be the Asians .
And those who panicked about the debt under President Reagan failed to see how manageable it was .
It ’s even more manageable today .
Hogwash .
It was said of the Bourbons that they forgot nothing and learned nothing .
The same could easily be said of some of today ’s latter - day Keynesians !
Californians , those wacky folks , will be voting in November on a referendum to legalize recreational marijuana .
Not medical marijuana , recreational marijuana .
And they 've got a Houstonian -- and his 80 - year - old mother , who still lives here -- to thank .
Richard Lee was a bit of a hemp activist during his years here but , according to a story in today 's San Francisco Chronicle , he became a pot warrior only after being dissed by Houston police .
Lee was a lighting technician for Aerosmith when an accident left him in a wheelchair .
The Chronicle reports :
Medicinal pot - which was illegal then - was the only thing , he said , that dampened back spasms as he sat in his wheelchair .
When he was carjacked in Houston a year into his disabled life and waited nearly an hour for uninterested cops to show up , he found his cause .
He figured police were probably off wasting their time making marijuana busts instead of chasing the people who had stolen his car .
" I felt like , here was this wonderful medicine of cannabis that had helped me so much , and why were the cops going after people using and selling it instead of the psychos and sociopaths who are out there robbing people ? "
Lee said .
" I thought I should do something about it . "
He then opened a hemp clothing store here and spoke out on weed issues .
He 's since moved to Oakland and begun his crusade .
The Chron gives his initiative a 50 - 50 shot at passing .
Among those helping out on the campaign is Lee 's 80 - year - old mother Ann , who still lives in Houston .
" The older I get , and the more I look back and think how I grew up in Louisiana with Jim Crow , and did n't really understand it as a white person , " she told the Chron , " the more I realize that we should be talking against an unjust drug war against marijuana just the way we did against Jim Crow .

ContextDecorator : creating APIs that work as decorators and context managers
Two of the best additions to Python in recent years are the with statement and decorators .
Both context managers ( objects used in with statements ) and decorators can be used for similar purposes : performing an action before and after executing the decorated function or the code inside the with block .
In fact I now find that many places I used to use decorators I now prefer the with statement ( if I 'm lucky enough to be able to ignore Python 2.4 compatibility ) .
If you 're a library or framework creator then it is nice to be able to create APIs that can be used either as decorators or context managers .
The patch decorators in mock behave like this , and when I was writing a new variant ( patch.dict )
I found myself having to figure out again how to do it .
It is n't hard , but it 's a bit fiddly .
Nor is this an uncommon pattern , both py.test and Django have code that behaves like this .
I 've written a very simple utility class that does this , called ContextDecorator , and it is now part of contextlib in Python 3.2 .
Context managers inheriting from ContextDecorator have to implement __enter__ and __exit__ as normal .
__exit__ retains its optional exception handling even when used as a decorator .
Even better contextlib.
contextmanager , which is a decorator for writing context managers as functions , uses ContextDecorator so the context managers it creates can automatically be used as decorators as well .
I 've put both ContextDecorator and the new contextmanager into a package on PyPI , and it works with all versions of Python from 2.4 - 3.1 .
Example :
from contextdecorator import ContextDecorator class mycontext ( ContextDecorator ) : def __enter__ ( self ) : print ' Starting ' return self def __exit__ ( self , * exc ) : print ' Finishing ' return False
>>> @mycontext ( ) ... def function ( ) : ... print ' The bit in the middle ' ... >>> function () Starting
The bit in the middle Finishing >>> with mycontext ( ) : ... print ' The bit in the middle ' ... Starting
The bit in the middle Finishing
Existing context managers that already have a base class can be extended by using ContextDecorator as a mixin class :
from contextdecorator import ContextDecorator class mycontext ( ContextBaseClass , ContextDecorator ) : def __enter__ ( self ) : return self def __exit__ ( self , * exc ) : return False
contextdecorator also contains an implementation of contextlib.contextmanager that uses ContextDecorator .
The context managers it creates can be used as decorators as well as in with statements .
from contextdecorator import contextmanager @contextmanager def mycontext ( * args ) : print ' Started ' try : # decorated function or with # statement executed here yield finally : # exception handling here print ' Finished ! '
>>> @mycontext ( ' some ' , ' args ' ) ... def function ( ) : ... print ' In the middle ' ... Started
In the middle Finished ! >>> with mycontext ( ' some ' , ' args ' ) : ... print ' In the middle ' ... Started
In the middle Finished !
Porting mock to Python 3
One of the nice new features in mock 0.7 is that it works with both Python 2 & 3 .
The mock module itself , even with all the freshly added docstrings , weighs in at less than 800 lines of code so compatibility is maintained with a single source base rather than the more recommended 2to3 approach .
There are however about 1500 lines of test code that also need to work under Python 3 ; so whilst not a particularly difficult exercise it was not entirely trivial to get all the tests passing under Python 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 , 2.7 and 3.2 .
Good tests make it much easier to have confidence that the port works .
Attempting this without tests would be much more painful , even though it means there is more code to port .
I 've written up all the changes needed for mock to support Python 3 :
Release : mock 0.7 beta 2
I 'm pleased to announce a new release of the mock module , the first in a while .
Konrad Delong has joined me as a maintainer of mock and has been a great help in getting this release out .
As there are several major new features this is a beta release , with 0.7.0 final coming out in a few weeks assuming there are no major problems discovered .
Please download it and try it out :
mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class .
It is intended to reduce the need for creating a host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite .
After performing an action , you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with .
You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way .
The mock module also provides utility functions / objects to assist with testing , particularly monkey patching .
mock is tested on Python versions 2.4-2.7 and Python 3 .
Full documentation is included in the distribution .
Mock is very easy to use and is designed for use with unittest .
Mock is based on the ' action -> assertion ' pattern instead of ' record -> replay ' used by many mocking frameworks .
See the mock documentation for full details .
Changes in 0.7.0 ( including the much awaited magic method support ) are :
Addition of mocksignature
Ability to mock magic methods
Ability to use patch and patch.object as class decorators
and as class decorators Renamed patch_object to patch.object ( patch_object is deprecated )
to ( is deprecated ) Addition of MagicMock class with all magic methods pre-created for you
class with all magic methods pre-created for you Python 3 compatibility ( tested with 3.2 but should work with 3.0 & 3.1 as well )
Addition of patch.dict ( ... ) for changing dictionaries during a test
for changing dictionaries during a test Addition of mocksignature argument to patch and patch.
object
argument to and help ( mock ) works now ( on the module ) .
Can no longer use __bases__ as a valid sentinel name ( thanks to Stephen Emslie for reporting and diagnosing this )

Addition of soft comparisons : call_args , call_args_list and method_calls return now tuple - like objects which compare equal even when empty args or kwargs are skipped
, and return now tuple - like objects which compare equal even when empty args or kwargs are skipped Added some docstrings .
BUGFIX : side_effect now works with BaseException exceptions like KeyboardInterrupt
now works with exceptions like BUGFIX : patching the same object twice now restores the patches correctly
The tests now require unittest2 to run
Konrad Delong added as co-maintainer
There are several major new features in this release , not least of which is the support for mocking the Python protocols ( magic methods ) .
The easiest way of using magic methods is with the MagicMock class .
It allows you to do things like :
>>> from mock import MagicMock >>> mock = MagicMock ( ) >>> mock .
__str__ .
return_value = ' foobarbaz ' >>> str ( mock ) ' foobarbaz ' >>> mock .
__str__ . assert_called_with ()
Note
In the 0.7.0 final release ( and already in svn ) using the spec keyword argument to MagicMock will only pre-create the magic methods that are in the spec object or list .
Mock allows you to assign functions ( or other Mock instances ) to magic methods and they will be called appropriately .
The MagicMock class is just a Mock variant that has all of the magic methods pre-created for you ( well - all the useful ones anyway ) .
The following is an example of using magic methods with the ordinary Mock class :
>>> from mock import Mock >>> mock = Mock ( ) >>> mock .
__str__ = Mock ( ) >>> mock .
__str__ .
return_value = ' wheeeeee ' >>> str ( mock ) ' wheeeeee '
mocksignature is a useful companion to Mock and patch .
It creates copies of functions that delegate to a mock , but have the same signature as the original function .
This ensures that your mocks will fail in the same way as your production code if they are called incorrectly :
>>> from mock import mocksignature >>> def function ( a , b , c ) : ... pass ... >>> function2 = mocksignature ( function ) >>> function2 . mock .
return_value = ' fishy ' >>> function2 ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ' fishy ' >>> function2 . mock .
assert_called_with ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) >>> function2 ( ' wrong arguments ' )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : < lambda >( ) takes exactly 3 arguments ( 1 given )
Also new is patch .dict for setting values in a dictionary just during a test and restoring the dictionary to its original state when the test ends :
>>> foo = { ' key ' : ' value ' } >>> original = foo . copy ( ) >>> with patch .
dict ( foo , { ' newkey ' : ' newvalue ' } , clear = True ) : ... assert foo == { ' newkey ' : ' newvalue ' } ... >>> assert foo == original
Authentication with Python aside , did you know as long as you have a computer running Windows OS and that 's hooked up to the internet , you could remotely view cctv camera systems , from anywhere in the world ?
Well you can .

Discover 0.4.0 : test discovery for unittest
discover is a backport of the new test discovery features only from Python 2.7 / 3.2 .
The discover module provides automatic test discovery for standard unittest based tests :
python -m discover python discover.py
If you have setuptools or distribute installed you will also have a discover script available .
This will discover all tests ( with certain restrictions ) from the current directory .
The discover module has several options to control its behavior ( full usage options are displayed with python - m discover - h ) .
discover 0.4.0 provides feature parity with the test discovery in Python 2.7 RC1 and unittest2 0.4.2 .
unittest2 provides not just the test discovery features that are new in Python 2.7 , but a whole lot more as well .
The full list of changes since discover 0.3.2 :
Addition of a setuptools compatible test collector .
Set " test_suite = ' discover.collector ' " in setup.py .
" setup.py test " will start test discovery with default parameters from the same directory as the setup.py .
in setup.py .
" setup.py test " will start test discovery with default parameters from the same directory as the setup.py .
Allow test discovery using dotted module names instead of a path .
Addition of a setuptools compatible entrypoint for the discover script .
A faulty load_tests function will not halt test discovery .
A failing test is created to report the error .
function will not halt test discovery .
A failing test is created to report the error .
If test discovery imports a module from the wrong location ( usually because the module is globally installed and the user is expecting to run tests against a development version in a different location ) then discovery halts with an ImportError and the problem is reported .
Matching files during test discovery is done in DiscoveringTestLoader._match_path .
This method can be overriden in subclasses to , for example , match on the full file path or use regular expressions for matching .

Scala vs. F# , Round 2 : Application Programming Features
When comparing the Scala and F# programming languages , the characteristics that most interest mainstream developers are likely those that are typical to development environments , such as :
Use and availability of frameworks for Web , GUI and database development
Support for object orientation
Properties of the runtime environment
In this second installment of my Scala and F# language comparison , I describe how each language stacks against the other in these areas -- with the caveat that it is difficult to compare two languages thoroughly and justly when one ( officially ) runs on only one platform .
F# is implemented by Microsoft and made available only for Microsoft 's Windows platform , while the open source Scala is available to all platforms .
However , Scala is compiled to Java as an artifact and therefore interpreted through Java 's virtual machine system .
Editor 's Note :
This is the second article in the Scala vs. F# series .
The first installment compared Scala 's and F# 's functional programming features .
Scala vs. F# : Application Development Frameworks
F# is a Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) - compliant language that is part of the .NET development toolset , which makes it suitable for all typical application development tasks .
In fact , .NET developers can develop , debug , test and deploy F# programs as CLR executables through Visual Studio ( 2008 and later ) in the same manner as they would C# , C++ or Visual Basic programs .
What differentiates F# from other .NET languages is the immutable , stateless nature of its functional execution .
This attribute makes
F# better suited for scientific , massively parallel and high - performance computing applications .
Beyond functional programming - specific tasks and syntax , F# programs also have access to .NET DLLs , which are accessed and used in the same manner as they are used in other .NET programs .
Scala , being an open source , Java - compliant and Java - compiled language , is available for all operating systems that support Java .
Scala development plugins and syntax - definition files are also available for most of the popular text editors and IDEs , including NetBeans , Eclipse and IntelliJ 's IDEA .
Database Operations
F# database - access routines are part of the core language , and they are accessed through the System .
Data and System .
Data .SqlClient libraries .
F# database - access implementation depends on the underlying ADO.NET mechanisms and configuration at the .NET runtime .
As Scala runs on top of a Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) , it leverages Java 's JDBC .
Database routines are invoked either directly through JDBC or through other Java or third - party database extensions .
There are several Scala - specific , third - party open source libraries available for this purpose , but I cannot attest to their maturity and stability .
GUI Development
GUI development in F# is fully supported through .
NET 's WinForm library .
The GUI development API resides in the System .
Drawing and System .
Windows .
Forms libraries , which are standard shared .
NET DLLs .
GUI development in Scala is accomplished through Java Swing .
As with JDBC , access to Swing features and APIs is done in Scala syntax , so the Swing development feels natural to Scala programmers .
Web Development
Web development in F# , like database access and GUI development , is accomplished through the shared .
NET System .
Web library .
ASP developers can specify F# as one of their server - side languages and then implement the HTTP - handling logic entirely in F# .
Scala does not feature any specialized Web development components .
However , mature Scala - based , third - party frameworks are available for Web development .
At the time of writing , the Lift Web framework was the best known and best - established framework for developing Web - based applications in Scala .

While this blog will often take a comic look at injustice , ironies and general crapulence that we witness in Toronto , this is not that kind of story .
I ’ve lived above Allan Gardens for six years .
It ’s right across the street from the crack / booze demons of George Street and Seton House shelter , so in this otherwise idyllic park , once the stomping ground of late 19th century socialites — I ’ve witnessed my share of sad and desperate scenes .
The mouth - wash drunk is most often responsible for the ugliest incidents .
You might blame Ontario ’s monopoly on alcohol for this .
In the States a homeless guy might scrape up the money needed for a low - end mickey of vodka or whiskey , in Ontario , where that would cost $ 13 , he does n’t stand a chance .
So these addicts turn to Listerine for its high alcohol - content , it rots their guts , and makes them far less coherent than the average drunk .
I ca n’t imagine they even enjoy the first sip .
You know that feeling when you crack a cold beer on a hot day , you do n’t get that with a frothy cup of Listerine .
Today , I witnessed the most disturbing site of my relatively sheltered life .
A man , walking at a good clip , seemingly for no reason , fell , with great momentum , directly on his face , smashing up his nose , and busting his glasses which then lacerated the sagging skin around his eyes .
The blood poured out .
He also suffered a broken arm and a very prominent dislocated shoulder .
Several witnesses and I could only hold hands to our open mouths , gaping in collective anguish .
A dutiful , dog - walking homosexual ran to find a phone .
A saintly Indian woman who appeared to have some nursing background also called 911 .
She provided a better bedside manner than I could have hoped to .
I simply stood on grimacing in horror , shaking my head at this sad , somehow inevitable happening .
“ I was almost home , ” he said when he regained consciousness , amazing us with his good humour .
She laughed a kind , ringing laugh , that suggested maybe she had witnessed some pain in her life .
She offered what was most needed : spiritual aid to the man , who was , despite his intense pain , more than anything –embarrassed .
He was in his 60s , and even managed to joke , “ Why do all Canadians hate Americans ? ” and told us he was from Miami .
The fire truck arrived first and the men did a fine job cleaning up this poor suffering man and getting him on a stretcher .
Commiserating with one of the emergency workers , we agreed that it was a blessing in disguise that the man was so drunk ( he was a known Listerine - abuser ) .
Someone even half as drunk might have got a hand up to break their fall , perhaps , but I ’d hate to consider the physical sensation a sober man might feel after landing hard on the bones in his face .
It reminded me that evil events are out there , waiting to happen .
I saw the man approaching , there was no reason for him to trip , his legs simply gave out in the worst possible fashion and projected his face onto that pavement .
The best way to avoid that evil is to be reasonably sober and lucid , but that ’s easier - said - than - done at the tail - end of a hard life .
Good article on mouthwash abuse from The Eyeopener , Ryerson ’s Student Paper , sadly , the only media that seems to care .
A fascinating game of two vastly different styles – with one clear winner .
Brazil were without both Felipe Melo and Elano through injury , and so Dunga chose Dani Alves on the right of midfield , with Ramires in a deeper , left - sided role .
The rest of the team was as expected .
Marcelo Bielsa was missing the suspended Gary Medel and Waldo Ponce , the two first - choice centre - backs .
He welcomed back Carlos Carmona from suspension , however , and was also able to call upon the fit-again Humberto Suazo upfront .
Mark Gonzelez started on the left , and Jean Beausejour played the enganche role , with Mati Fernandez on the bench .
The most important feature of the game was pressing .
No other international sides have as much focus upon pressing as these two , with Chile in particular defined almost entirely by their aggressive tactics in winning the ball high up the pitch , and denying the opposition space .
They did n’t hold back from the start of this game , closing down all over the pitch and forcing Brazil into hurried clearances and long balls towards Luis Fabiano , and just like against Spain , Chile dominated the opening 20 minutes of the game , and even had more possession – something very rare against Brazil .
Their pressing in midfield was so strict and so intense , that it sometimes seemed like they were man-marking almost the entire Brazilian team .
Every player had a man to close down – the diagram onthe left shows it well .
Carmona was on Kaka , Vidal was on Alves , Beausejour was on Gilberto .
The two wingers took care of Brazil ’s full - backs , whilst Contreras and Fuentes dealt with Luis Fabiano .
One zone decides the game
The only problem was in the zone patrolled by Mauricio Isla , on the right of Chile ’s midfield .
His natural man to close down was Ramires , but this was complicated by Robinho ’s drift into deeper positions , where Jara felt unable to track him .
This meant that Jara effectively passed him on to Isla , which in turn left Ramires in more space than Bielsa would have liked , and he got more time on the ball than any other midfielder .
Brazil were effectively adding another man to their diamond midfield and converting it into a pentagon , which overran Chile ’s diamond through sheer numbers , whilst creating a surplus of Chilean defenders picking up Luis Fabiano .
This seems to be an issue with Bielsa ’s system .
By so strictly and obviously wanting a spare man at the back ( 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 , but never 2 v 2 ) , and switching between 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 and 3 - 3 - 1 - 3 accordingly , he has allowed his last two opponents to give him a problem , as they both fielded players ( David Villa and Robinho ) in left - sided roles where it ’s difficult to categorize them as a forward or as a midfielder .
Chile ’s system seemed slightly stuck in how to deal with a player like this , and it ’s no coincidence that Robinho and Villa got a goal and an assist apiece .
Granted , Spain and Brazil were the pre-tournament favourites and always likely to beat Chile , but their performances do offer a decent model for how to beat Bielsa ’s formation .
Robinho v Jara
That right - sided zone was also key going in the other direction .
Chile were attacking with their usual six players – the three forwards , the enganche , and the two wing - backs .
This can often overpower opponents , but Brazil were generally defending with seven men solidly in front of their own goal – the back four , and the three more defensive - minded midfielders – Gilberto , Melo and Alves .
This meant Brazil generally had a one - man advantage in the defensive phase of play , and Chile struggled to break through .
For a period in the first half , the whole match revolved around the game of chicken between Jara and Robinho when Chile had the ball .
Jara wanted to get forward and join the attack , and was testing out Robinho ’s defensive willingness .
The first time Jara went forward , Robinho tracked him all the way .
The second time he went , Robinho let him go free , and Chile had an overload on their right - hand side .
The third time he went turned out to be the pivotal moment of the game .
Jara had steamed forward to provide an overlap , but was not used , and instead a poor cross was hit into the box .
It was easily cleared towards Fabiano , who won the ball and knocked it down for Robinho , who had n’t bothered tracking Jara .
Suddenly , Brazil had their three flair players running at just three Chilean defenders , Bielsa no longer had his spare man at the back , and the ball was in the net with remarkable speed .
This came three minutes after Brazil had opened the scoring .
That goal , a very simple header from a corner , where Juan used two of his teammates as a shield to get a free jump , could have been considered unfortunate .
It was vaguely against the run of play , it was from a set - piece , it was a fairly unstoppable header .
Chile could convince themselves that it did n’t reflect on the way they were set up , but the second goal was the real killer , because it underlined the fact that Chile ’s all - out - attack style was playing right into the hands of Brazil .
Injuries help Brazil ?
Usually , injuries to first - choice players are a manager ’s worst nightmare , especially in a World Cup .
But today , Dunga may have been assisted by the fact he did n’t have Melo or Elano available .
Not because they are bad players or would have had poor games , but because Dunga was ‘ forced ’ to turn to Alves and Ramires , two incredibly energetic players with tremendous stamina levels .
Against Chile ’s high - intensity , high - pace style , this was vital in making sure Brazil were able to compete physically , and in that sense they were probably better options tonight than Elano or Melo would have been .
Indeed , Alves and Ramires ’ running and positional discipline caused Chile problems throughout .
Those two essentially played as the ’ shuttlers ’ on either side of Brazil ’s lopsided diamond , and meant that Chile ’s wing - backs were forced to come inside to close them down , making their own diamond very narrow .
Usually , the Chilean wing - backs are concerned with opposing wide players , and the fact they had to play much more centrally meant their wide , expansive game was much more difficult to maintain .
Full - backs key
Another area where Dunga played this game well was by telling his full - backs to push on forward .
Chile ’s use of high wingers often means opposing full - backs are subdued and fulfil exclusively defensive roles , but Maicon and Michel Bastos were both brave and forced Gonzalez and Sanchez into positions in their own third , far away from being able to influence the game in an attacking sense .
Maicon was typically cavalier and linked up well with Alves , but Bastos had an equally good game – both when Brazil were attacking , and when Sanchez was running at him with the ball .
Indeed , of the many positives Dunga can take from this game , the fact that the left - hand side of his defence was solid throughout ( there have been questions asked ) is an important one , for Juan and Bastos were two of the best players on the pitch .
In the second half , many of Brazil ’s most dangerous attacks came from ’ surprise ’ players .
Lucio galloped forward more than once to prompt a counter - attack , whilst Ramires did the same .
Brazil ’s final goal came from a driving run from the Benfica player ( something Melo never would have done ) that opened up Chile ’s side incredibly easy .
It was almost as if Chile were so focussed on stopping the four Brazilian attacking players , that they had n’t even considered the prospect of an attack from deeper .
It ’s also no coincidence that Lucio and Ramires were two players who had a decent amount of time and space on the ball , despite the Chilean pressing .
Chile tried and tried , but still could n’t manage a goal .
They probably deserved one for all their attacking intent , but ultimately they only succeeded in proving what a fantastic defensive side Brazil are .
Dunga removed Kaka and Robinho for two defensive players , Gilberto and Kleberson , and Brazil shut up shop and saw the game out .
Conclusion
A wonderful game contested by two fascinating coaches .
Both Dunga and Bielsa have created sides who play a distinctive brand of football , and have constructed formations that , on their own , have provided hours of debate .
It was great to see them up against each other on the world stage , and it was also an open , attacking game – proving that tactical contests do n’t have to be defensive , negative and cagey .
Chile are out .
They were never going to win the World Cup , but they ’ve won many friends for their exciting , attack - minded game .
This is a wonderful young side that has a tremendous future , and hopefully the performance of the South American teams at this competition will spark a greater interest in football from that continent , and consequently , greater coverage of Chile .
Ultimately , a lack of individual quality was probably their downfall .
They played an astonishingly attacking game , and yet only scored two goals in four matches .
Suazo was not 100 % fit , Sanchez did n’t show his best form , and all too often Chile got into the final third and seemed to run out of ideas .
Brazil look more impressive with every game .
Chile ’s system was perfect for them , but they took full advantage – it ’s hard to draw any negative conclusions from this display .
Then again , at this stage four years ago they were looking fine , and then they crashed out with a poor display against France in the quarter - final , so the superlatives should wait .
But they start Friday ’s game against Holland as favourites , and should also be considered favourites to win the competition .

( CNN ) --
The identities of two women involved in a horrific car crash in Arizona last week were mixed up , with one family receiving news that their daughter had died when in fact she was undergoing treatment for her injuries while another family kept watch at her side for six days .
Officials with St. Joseph's Medical Center and the Arizona Department of Public Safety apologized for the mistake Monday , saying they were " acting on the best information " available at the time of notification .
Marlena Cantu , 21 , was killed in the crash July 18 when the SUV in which she was riding blew a tire and rolled several times .
Four others were in the vehicle : a male driver and male occupant , and two other female occupants -- one of whom was 19 - year - old Abby Guerra , described by friends and family as Cantu 's best friend .
The five young people were driving back to Phoenix from a trip to Disneyland in California .
" As doctors struggled to save this patient 's life , we could not readily tell the patient 's identification , " Suzanne Pfister , vice president for external affairs at St. Joseph's , told a news conference Monday .
" We interviewed family members that evening and asked for any discernible information that could help us make that positive identification , " such as bone breaks , scars or other marks .
" From the information that was provided us on that evening , we believed the patient was Marlena Cantu , " Pfister said .
" DPS communicated that information to the family . "
Guerra 's family , meanwhile , was told she was dead .
Pfister said the mix - up was revealed Saturday when the medical examiner compared dental records and determined the patient -- whom the Cantu family had been praying for at her bedside as she underwent multiple surgeries -- to be Guerra .
" We know this is an extraordinarily challenging situation and our hearts and our prayers go out to both families , " Pfister said .
Sgt. Kevin Wood , a spokesman for DPS , described a " chaotic situation " in the emergency room the night of the wreck as the hospital received all four trauma patients from the collision scene .
At least one person had been ejected from the SUV .
" ( Authorities ) tried for quite some time -- something close to five hours -- to figure out who this one female patient was , " Wood said , emphasizing it was not a determination that was made within a matter of minutes .
Pfister said the injuries to Guerra were so severe that she was unrecognizable to family and friends .
She said the hospital , which treats about 3,000 trauma patients a year , does not conduct fingerprinting or take dental impressions in an emergency situation " because the overwhelming emphasis is on saving the patient 's life . "
Nancy Colon , a friend of the Cantus , told HLN's " Prime News " Monday night that the family is " heartbroken . "
Colon said the family was taken into a room at the hospital on Saturday and told that the dental records taken from the female victim at the morgue did not match Guerra's .
They were then questioned about the number of Marlena Cantu 's ear piercings , her molars and past surgeries .
Cantu had her appendix removed in elementary school , Colon said the hospital officials were told .
" They checked the girl in the ICU and she did n't have a scar , " she said .
The family was then told , " I 'm sorry , but that 's not your daughter , " according to Colon .
Pfister declined to provide information about Guerra 's condition Monday , citing the family 's request .
" Our focus is on healing Abby , " she said .
The tragic mix - up is similar to another incident in 2006 .
The family of 22 - year - old Laura VanRyn spent five weeks at the bedside of a woman they believed to be her daughter as she struggled to recover from injuries sustained in a car wreck that killed five others .
When she awoke from a coma and was asked her name , she replied , " Whitney Cerak , " an 18 - year - old who was believed to have been among those killed in the wreck .
The two women had blond hair and similar body types .

Maggie & Eve :
Is celibacy the ' ask ' in their shared Eden ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Both went to Yale .
Both discovered a deepening Catholic faith while there in New Haven , and both were involved with the Party of the Right student political union .
Now post - college , both can be found on record weighing in on *CIVIL * MARRIAGE by saying ( Catholic ) faith - based stuff like this :
Marriage should be reserved for heterosexuals , whose “ relationships can be either uniquely dangerous or uniquely fruitful , ” ...
“ Thus it makes sense to have an institution dedicated to structuring and channeling them . ”
So it 's no surprise that Maggie Gallagher would be a fan of writer Eve Tushnet :
@nomtweets [ Twitter ]
But here 's where it gets concerning : Ms. Tushnet is not only a same - sex marriage opponent .
As hinted in the above tweet : Ms. Tushnet is actually a lesbian .
A lesbian who genuinely thinks that her fellow gays and lesbians should go through life sans orgasms :
As the hundred or so daily readers of eve-tushnet .
blogspot.com , and a larger audience for her magazine writing , know by now , Ms. Tushnet can seem a paradox : fervently Catholic , proudly gay , happily celibate .
She does not see herself as disordered ; she does not struggle to be straight , but she insists that her religion forbids her a sex life .
“ The sacrifices you want to make are n’t always the only sacrifices God wants , ” Ms. Tushnet wrote in a 2007 essay for Commonweal .
While gay sex should not be criminalized , she said , gay men and lesbians should abstain .
They might instead have passionate friendships , or sublimate their urges into other pursuits .
“ It turns out I happen to be very good at sublimating , ” she says , while acknowledging that that is a lot to ask of others .
Marriage should be reserved for heterosexuals , whose “ relationships can be either uniquely dangerous or uniquely fruitful , ” she explained in an e-mail message .
“ Thus it makes sense to have an institution dedicated to structuring and channeling them . ”
A Gay Catholic Voice Against Same - Sex Marriage [ NYT ]
Yup , this is the kind of openly gay writer who earns Maggie Gallagher 's approval .
Who earns not one , but two , weekend tweets .
Who earns a " remarkable " label , even .
All of which leads to the question :
Is the kind of future for which Maggie and NOM are truly fighting :
One that is less about " protecting traditional marriage " and more about protecting gays ' genitalia with government - mandated chastity belts ?
Because while we 've heard Maggie give soft praise to gay people 's intellect , humor , temperament , etc. , we 're not sure we 've ever heard her praise a gay person 's views as " remarkable . "
So since she is so enamored with Eve , is n't it fair for us to assume that it 's the SEX part in same - sex marriage that is really Maggie / NOM 's big sticking point ?
We actually kind of hope that Maggie / NOM do recruit Tushnet to be their new poster person .
The new Carrie Prejean , if you will .
Because while NOM might still hold a ( slight ) majority in terms of public opinion polling on the word " marriage " itself , we 're fairly certain that a much greater majority would be shocked by the suggestion that large swaths of the population can and should channel their love and romantic lives into a non-consummated buddy system .
In terms of the Moral Monopoly on which Maggie Gallagher has built a career , a card that says gays ' journey should be a " bored walk " wherein no same - sex - loving thimble passes " Go " without collecting 200 condemnations would ( hopefully ) be a card overplayed !

The NAACP on the Tea Party :
Today , NAACP delegates passed a resolution to condemn extremist elements within the Tea Party , calling on Tea Party leaders to repudiate those in their ranks who use racist language in their signs and speeches .
I see a fairness problem with the NAACP 's resolution calling upon Tea Party leaders to " repudiate those in their ranks who use racist language in their signs and speeches . "
( The quote is from an NAACP press release which does not provide the text of the resolution . )
Calling on an organization to denounce abhorrent behavior by some of its devotees may seem reasonable .
But it implies that the extremists / bigots / bombers are a sufficiently significant component of the organization that such a gesture is necessary .
I think it 's worth , first , considering the record of American racism , and then the record of the Tea Party and its allies .
Racism tends to attract attention when it 's flagrant and filled with invective .
But like all bigotry , the most potent component of racism is frame - flipping -- positioning the bigot as the actual victim .
So the gay do not simply want to marry , they want to convert our children into sin .
The Jews do not merely want to be left in peace , they actually are plotting world take - over .
And the blacks are not actually victims of American power , but beneficiaries of the war against hard - working whites .
This is a respectable , more sensible , bigotry , one that does not seek to name - call , preferring instead change the subject and strawman .
Thus segregation was n't necessary to keep the niggers in line , it was necessary to protect the honor of white women .
In that same vein we confront Glenn Beck , arguably the movement 's greatest and
This president , I think , has exposed himself as a guy , over and over again , who has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture , I do n't know what it is ... I 'm not saying he does n't like white people , I 'm saying he has a problem .
Here is Glenn Beck
Barack Obama is setting up universal healthcare , universal college , green jobs as stealth reparations .
That way the victim status is maintained .
And he also brings back back ‑door reparations .
Perhaps one considers Glenn Beck merely a minor associate of the Tea Party .
I do n't agree , but fair enough .
It 's probably better to consider those politicians which the Tea Party has embraced , presumably , as embodying their values .
The NAACP 's announcement initially struck me in much the same the way .
But some hours of considering this have proven to me that my initial skepticism says more about the broad American narrative of race and racism , then it does about the justness of the NAACP 's charge .

Here is Glenn Beck discussing President Barack Obama 's attempt to convene Officer Michael Crowley and Henry Louis Gates for a beer - summit :

I do n't agree , but fair enough .
It 's probably better to consider those politicians which the Tea Party has embraced , presumably , as embodying their values .
The reaction to this announcement has been swift and , in the main , negative .
Next door , Dave Weigel , whose knowledge of the Tea Party is formidable , dismisses the resolution as " silliness " and " a stunt , " and Chris Bodenner bemoans the fact that he ended Monday praising the Tea Party over the NAACP .
If I 'm reading this right , Michael Tomasky believes Obama should attack the NAACP because their resolution " heightens division . "
I think Michael McGough captures the spirit of " sensible " criticism :
Steve King has long been an ally of the Tea Party and was the keynote speaker at the Tennessee Tea Party Coalition 's Convention .
Here isKing on President Barack Obama :
" When you look at this administration , I 'm offended by Eric Holder and the president also , their posture .
It looks like Eric Holder said that white people in America are cowards when it comes to race , " said King .
" And I do n't know what the basis of that is but I 'm not a coward when it comes to that and I 'm happy to talk about these things and I think we should .
But the president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race - on the side that favors the black person . "
I think it 's worth acknowledging that the Colorado Tea Party canceled an appearance with King after this statement .
And perhaps this is still too much distance , in which case it 's worth looking at the events which took place at the Tea Party 's own convention .
The Tea Party selected Tom Tancredo , a politician who once called Miami " a third world country , " to give an opening night speech .
Tancredo , true to form , claimed that Obama was elected " because we do not have a civics literacy test before people can vote in this country , " and went on to assert that ..
... people who could not even spell the word ' vote ' , or say it in English , put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House .
His name is Barack Hussein Obama .
Tancredo was roundly cheered , and afterward , lauded by Tea Party Nation organizer Judson Phillips , for giving " a fantastic speech . "
Given this record , I am at a loss to understand the criticism directed at the NAACP .
This is a Civil Right organization who 's taken as part of its mission opposing any attempt to inject racism into American politics .
When the Tea Party 's media advocates , when the politicians the movement embraces , when the speakers at its conventions do precisely that , and the NAACP responds by " calling on Tea Party leaders to repudiate those in their ranks who use racist language in their signs and speeches , " I have trouble finding the actual problem .

News Feature
An imminent swarm of tiny quakes beneath western North America could help seismologists prepare for a big one — but only if they can learn to interpret the tremors , finds Naomi Lubick .
For the past few weeks , seismologists at the University of Washington in Seattle have been on high alert .
Any day now , they expect a flurry of microtremors deep under the nearby Olympic Peninsula , just as occurs roughly every 12 – 14 months .
And when that wave of vibrations comes along , the researchers will be ready to catch it .
Over the past year , the seismology team has set up an elaborate net — an array of more than 100 seismic sensors planted in the ground throughout the peninsula 's mountains .
When those instruments start picking up signs of the tremors , the researchers will rush back out to install extra seismometers above the spots where the earth is shuddering .
Every few days the scientists will tend to the sensors , replacing batteries and downloading data , with the hope of capturing as much information as possible about the seismic events underfoot .
The quakes will pass within a few weeks without anybody feeling them .
But for seismologists , these swarms of tremors , sometimes called non-volcanic tremors , are among the most significant discoveries of the past decade because they could yield insight into the behaviour of destructive faults .
Researchers first noticed them in 2002 in Japan , and a year later teams in the Pacific Northwest detected them beneath the Cascadia region near Seattle .
“ Tremor swarms can help researchers spy on dangerous faults . ”
The Cascadian tremors are attracting interest because they hail from deep beneath the coast , along a massive fault that is thought to have unleashed earthquakes approaching magnitude 9 .
Researchers hope that the detailed measurements they are about to make will help them monitor activity along the fault .
It may be possible to use the recurring swarms as a probe to track changes in stress underground ; the tremors may even yield clues about the timing and location of future large quakes .
" It 's pretty exciting , " says Greg Beroza , a geophysicist at Stanford University in California , who is watching for the results from the University of Washington team .
The regularity of the quakes lets researchers prepare for them , providing an exceedingly rare chance to study seismic events in great detail .
" If you had told me 10 years ago that there was going to be some kind of activity , happening on deep faults , that we could predict was going to happen again soon with some regularity , I would have told you that you were crazy , " says Beroza .
Elusive signals
The seismic trace of a tremor looks different from that of a classic earthquake .
The latter starts with a bang — a burst of high - frequency energy that rapidly tails off .
Tremors are tamer ; their vibrations are rich in low frequencies , and they come and go with less fanfare .
These characteristics , and the weakness of the tremors , make them hard to spot .
Preliminary observations of tremors have come from Alaska and Mexico , among other places , but information remains sketchy because only a few places have networks of seismometers sensitive enough to catch them .
Seismologist Kazushige Obara of the University of Tokyo Earthquake Research Institute was the first person to spot tremors , using signals recorded by a permanent monitoring array buried below the Earth 's surface1 .
The Japanese government established the country - wide network of 600 monitors after the devastating 1995 Kobe earthquake ; the instruments are sunk more than 100 metres below ground , to shield them from human - made noises — such as the rumble from trucks — that can drown out the tremors ' vibrations .
When Obara detected extremely deep microearthquakes lasting for several weeks , 30 kilometres beneath Japan , researchers around the world pored over their own data to see whether they could spot similar traces .
Tremors in Japan occur mostly along junctions between tectonic plates where one dives or ' subducts ' beneath another .
The same structure underlies the Pacific Northwest , along what is known as the Cascadian subduction zone , which stretches from Vancouver Island in British Columbia , Canada , to northern California ( see ' The origin of tremor swarms ' ) .
Here , the Juan de Fuca plate is slipping beneath the North American continental plate .
Since the last huge quake , which is thought to have occurred in 1700 , the dangerous part of the Cascadian subduction zone has remained locked , but researchers expect it to give way cataclysmically within the next century .

With that risk in the background , researchers are especially interested in capturing tremor swarms as a way to spy on what is happening deep down in the subduction zone .
Last year , they missed their chance .
The University of Washington team expected the swarm to occur in August , but it arrived in early May , before many of the instruments were in the field .
The researchers recorded bits of the event using a permanent array , but in much less detail than they had hoped .
This year , they are better prepared .
Once their permanent array picks up the first signs of the tremors , they will head out to augment the network above the swarm .
Each completed array will consist of about two - dozen seismometers stationed 200–300 metres apart in remote areas , away from human noise .
The team 's work is supported by a US $ 500,000 grant from the US National Science Foundation to Earthscope , a non-profit research consortium .
" The experiment we have out now will be unprecedented with regard to what we can see , " says John Vidale , a seismologist at the University of Washington and one of the lead scientists on the project .
The team 's network , called an ' array of arrays ' , can pinpoint the source of the tremors by comparing when the seismic waves arrive at each seismometer , says Vidale .
" As with your ears , you can tell which direction a sound is coming from , " he explains .
The origin of tremor swarms is generating intense debate .
In Japan , seismologists have observed that tremors come from the plane where the plates meet , the subduction - fault boundary , which also gives birth to mammoth quakes .
But in Cascadia , seismic signals indicate that some tremor may also occur above the fault plane , according to Honn Kao and his colleagues , geophysicists at the Pacific Geosciences Centre in Sidney , British Columbia2 .
Deep origins
Locating the source of the vibrations could help researchers to understand the physical processes that create them .
The tremors originate tens of kilometres underground , where Earth 's cold crust is pulled into the warmer mantle .
Rocks in the upper crust are brittle enough to break under stress , which leads to earthquakes .
But those in the mantle are so hot that they warp under pressure instead of cracking .
Tremors seem to happen in the complex zone where the subducting plate has warmed enough for its rocks to become malleable .
A study published this week3 could help to explain the process that produces tremors under parts of Japan .
Satoshi Ide , a seismologist at the University of Tokyo , suggests that tremor behaviour beneath Shikoku island could be controlled by the types of rock present in the subduction zone there .
Ide found that the locations of some tremors line up in stripes matching the direction in which the subducting plate has travelled during the past 10 million years .
He hypothesizes that these bands could trace the path left by seamounts , the remnants of former volcanoes embedded in the oceanic plate that is diving under Japan .
If he is right , the seamounts could influence the behaviour of tremors in two possible ways , he says .
They might snag on the overlying plate as the crust slides into the mantle , creating occasional bursts of tremors .
Alternatively , their chemical composition might cause them to act as lubricants , like lumps of grease , smoothing out the movement of the plates and turning what could have been catastrophic ruptures into bumpy jitters .
Beroza calls
Ide 's findings preliminary , but " a really important result " that indicates how the properties of the rocks along faults might be preserved for millions of years and affect the occurrence of tremors today .
As in Japan , tremors in Cascadia sometimes occur in bands that might reflect some characteristic of the subducting rocks .
Researchers are trying to determine what conditions create tremors instead of full - blown earthquakes , using data from old and new laboratory experiments that test how friction , porosity and other attributes of rock change under pressure .
These studies could help reveal what controls the movement of faults at subduction - zone depths , says geophysicist Paul Segall of Stanford University .
Quake clues
Scientists also wonder how tremors relate to larger earthquakes on the same faults .
The better - observed tremor events in Japan and Cascadia tend to be close to the parts of subducting plates that produce great earthquakes ; the tremors originate below the ' locked ' areas that store up energy for future large quakes .
Joan Gomberg , a geophysicist at the University of Washington , says researchers are looking for changes in tremor patterns that may hint at stress shifts in a fault .
If such connections emerge , seismologists could start to monitor tremors for signs that precede a big earthquake .
They have found some intriguing clues but nothing solid so far .
The San Andreas Fault in California , for example , has experienced tremor events alongside earthquakes of magnitude 1 or 2 , but direct associations between the two have yet to be confirmed4 .

Meanwhile , Obara and his colleagues plan to put out an extra monitoring system , to gather more details about tremor events beneath Japan .
And researchers in Cascadia are ready to pounce when the swarm hits .
" These things happen almost like clockwork , but not exactly , " says seismologist Ken Creager of the University of Washington , recalling last year 's disappointment when the team missed the tremors .
This year , he is more confident .
" We 'll catch it one way or another . "

Have you ever been out on a date with someone , and before you know it , your night out starts to feel like a job interview ?
Find out how you can deal with these overzealous QnA moments with flair .
You ’re out on the first date with a great new cutie , but you feel like you ’re sitting on the hot seat as this inquisitive and attentive person bombards you with different questions to know you better .
It ’s understandable , but you might find a question or two that you wish you ’d rather not discuss .
So how do you answer those questions and impress your date at the same time ?
Read on to learn the ways .
Change the Topic
Now this is too obvious , but who cares !
If you do n’t want to answer something and do n’t want to snap back at your date , just say “ Hmmm … ”  , smile and call out for the waiter or ask another question back at your date , something random like “ so … what were we talking about just before you asked that ? ” 
And smile again !
Be Direct
Sometimes , it ’s best to say it out directly .
If you do n’t want to answer the question , then just say that you ’re not very comfortable talking about that particular topic .
But make sure you use this line just once in the entire night out , or it could end up making you look too uptight , or worse , there may be no second date !
Stay Quiet for a Moment
The silence will make your date uneasy and they will immediately rephrase the question without you having to answer it .
This will also give you enough time to give the question a deeper thought .
Use an Evasive Answer
This is another great way to turn the question away from you .
If you do n’t want to answer a question , then just redirect the question back to your date and tell them something like “ That ’s interesting , what would you say about that ? ”  or something along those lines .
This would prevent you from saying the wrong comment and at the same time , get your date to tell you more about their past dates !
Overstepping the Line
There are times when your date might get carried away and ask you something that would make you uncomfortable .
But you can hide your discomfort by smacking them gently on the shoulder and saying something like “ Do you always ask such intimate questions on a first date ? ” 
You could also smile to reassure your date that you ’re not really upset with the question , but you just do n’t want to answer it .
Try these sure - fire ways to feel more comfortable and sweat less , while you impress more on your first date .
The roaring twenties were a time of great prosperity , as the economy boomed after World War I .
The nation was intent on having fun ; a jazz obsession swept the nation , and prohibition did little to dampen the national spirit .
Advertising at the time reflected the wealth of the nation , and a naivete and optimism that science was on the precipice of a golden age .
Here are 40 ads from the 1920 ’s that reveal a nation intent on sprinting into the future :
The 1920 ’s were a strange time full of wacky fads , and too much trust in unproven science .
Advertisers were beginning to figure out what worked and what did n’t , and their enthusiastic ad copy would attempt to sway even the most incredulous purchasers .
Saws were sold as instruments ( why work ?
it ’s time for fun ! ) , and lysol was subtly branding itself as a contraceptive ( really , go have some fun ) .
What better time to learn an instrument or light up some cigarettes and hit the town ?
(
The art deco style was seen as elegant and refined … the peak of modernity .
Ads from this time period are actively sought by collectors because of their distinctive look .
( Images via artdecoblog , artdecoblog , ioffer )
Many of the brands we find around our houses today were already hitting their stride in the booming domestic market .
Many would flourish , but not all would be able to ride out the rises and dips of the American market .
( Images via myinsulators , tjsrecords )
The nation was looking forward , and was brimming with optimism and confidence .
World War I was over , and scientific inquiry and noble pursuits would propel the United States into a idyllic future .
It was almost as if a utopia was right around the corner , and efforts like Prohibition ( “ The Noble Experiment ” ) were signs of a nation trying to purify itself in preparation ( ironically providing fuel for “ vice ” to flourish in the hands of the mob ) .
A booming economy fed the rapidly growing film industry .
The introduction of sound in film in the mid to late 1920 ’s only served to make the industry explode into a national obsession .
Classy film posters , hand painted and elegant , advertised the newest films to hit the big screen .
Scientific breakthroughs had brought man to the verge of utopia .
An incredible lack of regulation led to some of the strangest quackery our nation has seen .
New inventions were flooding into stores that promised to reshape one ’s face , fix an ailing back , or protect one from any virus .
Strange , but well intentioned , the populace had almost too much trust in “ science ” .
Breakthroughs in science were so common , that ads gleefully espousing the healing and restorative properties of expensive soaps were everywhere .
One could lose weight simply by rubbing a specialty soap on fat deposits once a day !
High fashion was huge in the 1920 ’s , with European looks sweeping the nation .
The flapper style was a mix of the formal designs and carefree , radical attitudes .
Men tried to look dapper but remain comfortable , and society as a whole seemed to have a dress code .
Factories that had been used years before to create tanks and airplanes were put to good use pumping out automobiles for a populace eager to spend and put the conservatism of the previous decade behind them .
A car was like a personal chariot , and the special relationship between Americans and their cars truly began to appear .
Candy was everywhere , and it was healthy too !
Baby Ruth bars were meant to be cut up like a delicacy , and their packaging touted its healthful benefits : “ Rich in dextrose , the sugar your body uses directly for energy . ”
State of the art office equipment , and the predecessors to the modern television were pouring off the shelves .
Secretaries were given the most modern typewriters , and ditto machines were arming them with the capability to do their work better and faster .
US Apologizes to Billionaire Added to Terror No-fly List
Gilbert Chagoury Still Does n't Know ' Why I Was Branded A Terrorist '
The United States has issued a written apology to a jet - setting billionaire businessman with close ties to former President Bill Clinton whose name was added to the no-fly list in the wake of the attempted Christmas day bombing of an American passenger plane .
Gilbert Chagoury , 64 , a Nigerian citizen of Lebanese descent , was pulled off a private jet Jan. 15 at Teterboro airport in New Jersey and detained for more than four hours after federal agents discovered his name was on the then - recently updated no - fly list .
The private jet crew of two and four other passengers were detained for four - and - a - half hours while agents questioned Chagoury .
He and the others were ultimately allowed to continue their trip to Paris .
" I think a huge mistake is an understatement , " Chagoury said in a phone interview with ABCNews.com and the Center for Public Integrity .
" I cannot accept being labeled a terrorist when I am known all over the world as a person who loves peace .
It really hurt , " he said .
It took Chagoury , a well - known philanthropist and an ambassador to the United Nations educational office , more than four months and thousands of dollars in legal fees to get the U.S. government to offer an apology and to give him a waiver to fly freely across U.S. airspace .
" Let us apologize for any inconvenience or unpleasantness you have experienced , " wrote Jim Kennedy of the Department of Homeland Security 's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program in an April letter obtained by the Center for Public Integrity .

" Please understand that in order to detect those international travelers involved in illicit activities , we must , at times , unfortunately inconvenience law - abiding travelers , " the DHS official wrote to Chagoury in April .
The formal waiver allowing him , his family and private jet pilots to travel again to the U.S. was finally granted last week .
There was , however , no explanation of why Chagoury 's name had ended up on the no-fly list in the first place .
" I do n't know why me .
I look at myself as a friend of America , I 've always loved your country , " said Chagoury .
Chagoury said he had regularly traveled to the United States without incident until this January .
Given the timing , it appears Chagoury was ensnared by changes in the criteria for the antiterrorism list after the failed bombing attempt .
The accused bomber grew up in Chagoury 's homeland of Nigeria , and Chagoury said he was acquainted with the suspect 's father , a Nigerian banker .
" He has always been a great banker and a very nice gentleman , " said Chagoury of Abdulmutallab 's father , who had gone to the U.S. Embassy to sound an alarm about his son's possible recruitment as a terrorist .
" Practically everybody knows everybody in the business community in Nigeria , " Chagoury added .
Chagoury said the U.S. agents asked him , " Which bank do you bank with in Nigeria ? "
He told them that his corporation did business with at least six or seven different banks in Nigeria , he said .
" I still believe it was personal and until I find out the answer I will really not be happy , " Chagoury said , with anger in his voice .
To make matters worse for Chagoury , the incident received widespread international attention after it was first reported by ABC News , which cited official documents .
" Everyone understands that after the December attempt , the government re-examined a lot of travelers .
Ambassador Chagoury has no problem with the government taking a second look at him , and he 's pleased that he 's been cleared to fly to the United States , " said Chagoury 's spokesman , Mark Corallo .
" What he does n't understand is the decision by someone in the government to disclose his name to the media and to unfairly suggest that he was a potential threat . "
Chagoury said the episode was particularly painful because over the years he has provided significant assistance to the U.S. State Department in diplomatic and overseas matters , especially related to Nigeria .
" I did a lot of that at the American embassy in Nigeria .
Always they used to come to me with one problem or another , " he said .
Chagoury 's case also raises a tantalizing question .
If it was difficult for a politically - connected billionaire to restore his privileges to fly into the United States , what about ordinary people entangled in the enhanced screening for the no-fly list ?
Ben Wizner , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union , said his group is working with seven Americans caught in the same no - fly list crackdown as Chagoury .
Four are trapped outside the United States and unable to get home .
" If you do n't have a private plane or a yacht , it 's hard to know what these people are supposed to do , " Wizner said .
" Some have tried to get in the back door flying to Mexico and Canada and even that has n't worked . "
CHAGOURY AND POPE BENEDICT XVI
One of the ACLU 's clients , Steven Washburn , 54 , a former Air Force officer from New Mexico , said he had been stuck in Ireland for three months , unable to return home because he appeared on the no-fly list sometime after his last U.S. trip in November .
Washburn told the Center for Public Integrity in an interview he worked as a security expert at a company in Saudi Arabia for the last couple of years but wanted to return home with his wife , a Spanish citizen , in February after a brief visit in Ireland with his stepdaughter and new grandchild .
Washburn said he was halted from boarding a direct flight to the United States in February and told he was on the no-fly list .
He was interviewed by FBI agents , who told him they had no concern about him and even suggested Washburn get around the no-fly list by flying to Mexico then driving across the border , he said .
Washburn took their advice and boarded a flight to Mexico City .
Three hours into the flight , the pilot was ordered to return to London 's Heathrow Airport , where Washburn said he was detained , fingerprinted and tested for DNA by Scotland Yard officials .
Washburn said he learned the plane was forced to return because it would briefly enter U.S. air space as it approached Mexico , triggering the no-fly restriction .
Washburn , his family and his lawyer said the FBI questioning gave some hints of what might have landed him on the list : the agents discussed his conversion to Islam after the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks , his recent work in Saudi Arabia , his opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fact that he hailed from New Mexico where the Yemeni - American imam Anwar al - Awlaki -- linked by US .
officials to the failed Christmas Day terror plot -- once taught years ago .
Washburn told the Center he loves America , has never supported extremism , has never committed a crime and served honorably in the Air Force .
He has yet to get an explanation from the U.S. government and has lost thousands of dollars in airline tickets .
" I thought America is supposed to be the country that stands up for people 's rights , not the country that takes them away , " Washburn said .
" America is supposed to assume you 're innocent before proven guilty , not force you to prove your innocence while assuming you 're too guilty to fly . "
Washburn said he is making another attempt to return home later this week , a 72 - hour journey through Germany , Brazil and Mexico carefully scripted to avoid U.S. airspace .
" This is a secret , unchecked executive power with absolutely no due process for people who are on the list , " said Wizner , a longtime critic of the no-fly list .
" You can wake up one morning and find yourself unable to fly without ever being told why and without any meaningful opportunity to challenge it . "
The Homeland Security Department 's web site for its Traveler Redress Inquiry Program is where those denied access to flights can appeal .
But Wizner said his clients have filed appeals on the website and are still waiting for a resolution .
The Terrorist Screening Center , which manages the government 's various terrorist databases including the no-fly list , referred a reporter seeking comment to recent testimony by the center 's director , Tim Healy .
" Our Redress Unit researches the complaints , coordinates with the agency that nominated the complainant to the Terrorist Watchlist , and , if warranted , corrects any Terrorist Watchlist data that may cause the individual difficulty during a screening process , " Healy told lawmakers back in December .
Healy testified that less than one percent of the complaints filed with the unit actually involve the terror watchlist .
Of those , about 51 percent are appropriately watch - listed , 22 percent have been modified or reviewed prior to a complaint , 10 percent involved people with similar names , and 15 percent are completely removed or downgraded due to the redress process .
In Chagoury 's case , he was n't seeking permission to fly on commercial planes to the United States .
He simply got an FAA waiver for his family to fly aboard his corporate jets into and out of the United States .
Chagoury said the four - month ban on U.S. travel caused him to miss one of his favorite events , watching the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBC playoffs .
" I just love the Lakers .
Not going to see the Lakers because you 're busy is one thing , but not going to see the Lakers because you 're not going to see the Lakers is another thing , " Chagoury said .
Chagoury 's biography reads like a rags - to - riches tale .
He was born in Nigeria to a family of Lebanese descent , got a job in an industrial conglomerate as a teenager , and quickly climbed the corporate ladder to become a sales executive at age 17 .
He married the daughter of a wealthy industrialist and by 1971 formed a firm called the Chagoury Group that today is one of Nigeria 's largest companies , with multi-billion dollar assets in construction , manufacturing , real estate and hotels , according to Chagoury 's official web site .
He travels on a British passport and his philanthropy work spans the United States and the globe , his spokesman said .
His support for the St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Tennessee , founded by actor Danny Thomas , also of Lebanese descent , has won him several humanitarian awards .
He and his wife have donated to the Louvre Museum in Paris and by the mid-1990s they also became major supporters of Bill Clinton .
Chagoury attended a December 1996 dinner at the White House after donating nearly a half million dollars to a Democratic Party - backed voter registration group .
His political donation became the subject of scrutiny during the fund - raising investigation into unlimited " soft money " donations in the 1996 election and the system of donor rewards created by the Clintons .
Non-US citizens may not contribute to individual candidates but are allowed to make contributions to get - out - the vote organizations .
Chagoury 's relationship , however , continued with the Clintons .
He donated at least $ 1 million to Clinton 's presidential library and last year made a historic $ 1 billion commitment to Clinton 's global initiative to help combat climate change - related erosion in Africa .
Chagoury said he had never contacted former President Clinton or his other powerful friends to help him with his no - fly list problem .
" I am ashamed to call any of my friends and tell them this thing is happening , " Chagoury said .
Along the way , Chagoury has won audiences with Pope John Paul II , Pope Benedict , former President Ronald Reagan and other world leaders .
In 1995 , the Caribbean island of St. Lucia named Chagoury to be its permanent ambassador to the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) .
And with global fame and wealth came controversy .
Chagoury was identified in a Wall Street Journal article as having close ties to former Nigerian military dictator Sani Abacha during the years he landed lucrative business contracts in that country .
After Gen. Abacha died in 1998 , Swiss and other European authorities froze a number of bank accounts , including some related to Chagoury .
The matter was settled and he has never been charged with any wrongdoing .

My second post today about something from 1975 is a nice little audio documentary ( wedded with just OK visuals , but it works fine ) about a song that I ’ve always been very intrigued with .
I love that it ’s both a rigorous formal experiment and a tremendously succesful pop tune , to say nothing of its dark and deeply melancholic atmosphere .
It ’s easily one of the best radio hits of the 70’s and I can’t imagine ever tiring of it .

The Ku Klux Klan was in the forefront of job - title inflation
THE ( fawning ) obituaries of Robert Byrd have reminded me that I missed an important organisation in last week 's column on job - title inflation : the Ku Klux Klan .
Mr Byrd held the titles of Exalted Cyclops and Kleagle ( recruiter ) for the Klan in West Virginia .
Other Klan job titles include Grand Imperial Wizard ( CEO ) , Grand Magi ( vice - president ) , Grand Scribe ( secretary ) , Grand Dragon of the Realm ( vice - president ) , Hydra ( assistant to the vice - president ) , Grand Titan of the Dominion ( regional vice - president ) , Grand Titan of the Province ( assistant regional vice - president ) , Lictor ( security guard ) and Night Hawk ( night watchman ) .
Ordinary members were known as ghouls .
Byrd had plenty of other titles in the rest of his career , including Senate minority leader , Senate majority leader and president pro tempore of the United States Senate , but none had quite the resonance of Exalted Cyclops .
In today 's day and age , it may be hard to fathom an era when comic strips were promoted in advertisements worded like movie promotions , but long before " Scott Pilgrim " trailers and " Marmaduke " trailers graced YouTube , " Peanuts " had such ads .
If you were around for early " Peanuts " installments or you 've seen Fantagraphics ' more recent collections , you 'll recognize a younger , less evolved Charlie Brown .
digg_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2010/07/09/vintage-peanuts-ads-charlie-brown-charles-schulz/';

Each example introduces part of the original " Peanuts " cast , though Woodstock is n't a part of the picture yet , and Snoopy has n't learned to fly in scans posted by Rosebud Archives .
Charlie Brown , however , gives a compelling sell in his new - kid speech from a tall box that would have been a perfect modern sidebar ad .
You 'll find him , Patty , Shermy , Violet , Shroeder and Snoopy in the crease - crossed clips , though do n't bother looking for Marcie , Franklin or Pig - Pen , because Charles Schulz had n't integrated them into his world at that point .
Figure out who you do recognize , though , and decide if you would have been sold on " Peanuts " based on the scenes in the gallery below .
A female police officer was seriously injured last night during sectarian rioting in Northern Ireland after a loyalist parade was forced past a Catholic area of north Belfast .
The police officer was struck on the head with a breeze block during an attack by rioters from the nationalist Ardoyne .
She was given mouth - to - mouth resuscitation in the midst of the riot on the Crumlin road .
As she was being tended to , rioters continued to throw missiles at her and colleagues had to hold up shields to protect her and paramedics .
She was later transferred to hospital by ambulance .
The violence across Belfast and in two towns in Co Armagh was blamed on republican dissidents who have been accused of exploiting tensions over Ulster 's loyalist marching season .
A significant number of prominent republican dissidents were seen on the Crumlin road last night .
Police were pelted with petrol bombs , iron bars , bricks and bottles at the border between nationalist and loyalist areas in Belfast 's Ardoyne district after 100 police officers in riot gear pushed the Orange Order march up the Crumlin Road .
Police fired baton rounds and deployed water cannon against nationalist demonstrators who were forced off the road shortly before 9 pm .
The protesters had sat down on the Crumlin Road aiming to block local Orangemen returning from Belfast city centre .
Earlier police snatch squads had failed to take the demonstrators off the road .
There were reports that an Orangeman in his 60s was hit in the head with a brick as nationalist youths also threw missiles at the parade .
As the Orange march passed by , riot police held up shields to protect the marchers from the bombardment .
Sinn Féin and the police have blamed republican dissidents for orchestrating the trouble in north and west Belfast during which three police officers were shot and 27 others injured .
Gerry Kelly , a Sinn Féin minister at Stormont and former IRA bomber , said there was evidence that outsiders were behind the violence .
" There was other people who came and took over the protests – I think with the intention there would be riots later on and you can see what happened since , " he said .
Five petrol bombs and several paint bombs were hurled at police on the Ormeau bridge in south Belfast according to the police .
In west Belfast , two armed and masked men hijacked a bus and forced its driver to drive to the local police station in Woodburn .
The men said they had left an explosive device on the bus , which the driver was forced to abandon at the station .
The area around the station was sealed off while the army dealt with the device .
Army bomb disposal officers later declared the device to be a hoax .
While Sinn Féin appealed for peaceful protest yesterday , a number of republican dissidents closed the Crumlin Road .
On Sunday night three police officers were hurt when a masked man opened fire on police lines with a shotgun in North Queen street , which runs from the nationalist New Lodge area to loyalist Tigers Bay .
Police had been trying to prevent clashes between nationalist and loyalist youths .
One officer still remained in hospital last night with gunshot wounds to his arm .
There was also violence on Sunday night in Broadway , which links the republican Falls road to the M1 , after police patrols blocked one end to prevent republicans attacking homes in the loyalist Village area .
Up to 200 rioters attacked the police , who deployed water cannons .
Seven civilians , including two children , were also injured in the Village after a car hit a crowd by a bonfire .
There was further violence last night in Lurgan , Co Armagh where up to 50 youths attacked police on the nationalist Kilwilkie estate .
Seven petrol bombs were thrown at officers .
Earlier nationalist youths in Lurgan tried to set fire to a train on the Belfast to Dublin line , but the driver managed to move clear and get his 55 passengers off safely .
Late last night , petrol bombs were still being thrown at police patrols in the Antrim Road area of Lurgan .
There were also disturbances in nearby Armagh city last night where nationalist youths attacked police patrols .
Nationalists set fire to bins and blocked the lower Catholic end of the road during the trouble sparked by the return of a local Ormeau Orange Order lodge .
There was also trouble in east Belfast at a sectarian flashpoint between the nationalist Short Strand and the loyalist Woodstock areas .
Return to violence
The 12th of July is the key date in the Ulster loyalist marching season .
It marks the anniversary of King William of Orange 's victory over Catholic King James II in the Battle of the Boyne .
There are always demonstrations by nationalists against loyalist parades that pass Catholic areas such as Ardoyne in north Belfast .
However , the hike in violence this year is due in large part to republican dissidents opposed to the peace process .
The Real IRA and Continuity IRA want to exploit anger over decisions to allow loyalists to march past certain Catholic areas to win new recruits .
Welcome to Svali Speaks !
This is a blog dedicated to Svali , who is / was a former mind control programmer for the Illuminati .
She was groomed from birth to have a key role in the Illuminati and back in the 1980 ’s was forced against her will to marry another generational Illuminati member .
They had two children from this marriage and they also were raised and tortured by the cult until Svali fled the cult in the early 1990’s .
She was severely warned by the cult to keep quiet about her past .
She had been writing and speaking out against the cult and their activities .
She has not been heard from since November , 2006 .
There is no known verifiable evidence of her being alive or has there been any known contact with Svali by anyone that I know of .
All traces of her have disappeared .
I am a personal friend of Svali’s and I have not been able to reach her or find out where her husband or children are .
She and her family have vanished .
If you have any information on the whereabouts of Svali please leave me a comment with your email address and I will contact you .
Thanks !
It is my desire that no matter what happened to Svali I want her writings to be available online for everyone to read .
As you read them you will sense the validity of her story .
I know Svali was telling the truth as I saw the struggle she went through to break free from the cult .
Her story lives on through these writings .
( This is Svali ’s intro from other sites posted several years ago .
She has not been heard from since November , 2006 )
About the author :
Hi , my name is Svali .
Both I and my entire family were involved in a cult group until several years ago , when we broke free .
I used to be a programmer in the cult , and now I want to share the knowledge that I have to help others .
It is possible to break free of cult abuse if a person is involved .
It is a long , heart - breaking process , but well worth it .
In the articles that I will be providing , I hope to help the survivor of cult abuse find tools to help in their journey towards freedom .
I have been a consultant to an on - line survivors group that helps people dealing with issues related to cult programming and becoming free , for the past year and a half .
I myself have been in therapy for ritual abuse and DID for nine years , with the last five being aware of the recent cult abuse .
I am also a writer , and a registered nurse .
I currently work as a diabetic educator in Texas 20 hours a week .
I have also self - published a book on breaking free of cult programming , which several experts in the field have said has “ invaluable information ” for the survivor of ritual abuse .
Both my ex-husband and my two children broke free of cult abuse last year .
My children are living with me while my husband is working on healing .
They all have DID ( dissociative identity disorder , formerly known as multiple personality disorder ) as well , which makes life at home interesting !
I am currently married to my second husband , who is also a recovered DID and who got out of the cult five years ago .
I am a survivor of both ritual abuse and governmental mind control .
My greatest hope in sharing on these pages is that the information will be helpful to others in breaking free of coercive cult control and help them realize that it is really possible to become free .
My other goal is to help educate therapists and supporters of survivors so that they can better understand what survivors have gone through , and things that have helped others in their healing journey .

Svali on : Healing from the Trauma of Cult Programming
Ritual abuse is the systematic , continued , repetitive abuse of both children and adults by either an individual or a group .
It can involve psychological , sexual , physical , and spiritual abuse .
This abuse is often done in the name of promoting an agenda , or a group ’s religious idealogy .
The victims of ritual abuse are often children , although adults are often abused as well .
The victim is an unwilling accomplice in the perpetrator ’s goals , although they may eventually learn to comply with , and even learn to perpetrate themselves as they grow older .
Increasing numbers of survivors of ritual abuse are beginning to speak out , to give voice to the atrocities which occur .
Whether the survivor was traumatized within an organized group , or by individuals , they must often overcome years of conditioning to be silent in order to speak and disclose their abuse .
This abuse may have included torture , mind control , cult programming , or other methodologies to ensure the victim ’s silence .
This page is dedicated to the bravery and courage of these people who are in the process of breaking free from cult abuse .
To the courageous adults and children who are overcoming fear , and disclosing what their lives have been like .
May others learn that they , too , can become free .
The Importance of Overcoming Denial
Often times it is much easier for the average person to look away when the subject of ritual abuse comes up .
To believe that it is extremely rare .
Or even to wonder if it is real , in spite of the extensive documentation that has been done that proves its existence .
For more information on this subject , please go to some of the links provided on this page .
Ritual abuse is not going to go away , in spite of the desire of many to minimize its impact both on the survivor community , and their supporters .
The more people become aware of this problem , the more hope that this type of abuse can be stopped , and that no more children will be wounded in the war that is being waged for their hearts and souls .
There is currently legislation that has been passed in six states outlawing ritual abuse , with other states pending .
Legislators are becoming educated in the reality of this type of abuse , and are beginning to take measures to ensure that it is stopped .
There have been extensively documented cases of ritual abuse which have gone to court and been proven .
Anyone who denies the reality has not read the current literature available on the subject .

The next high - profile firm to find itself in court looks to be Facebook .
In the week that a pair of strapping rowers named Winkelvoss intimated that their battle with Mark Zuckerberg was n’t yet over , the social networking firm is at the center of a patent challenge by Cross Atlantic Capital Partners .
In the court papers , XACP claims that it lodged a patent for an Internet - based “ community for users with common interests to interact in , ” dating back to 2000 .
The case between the two parties was filed back in 2007 , until Facebook asked for a stay of litigation in order to take an “ inter partes ” re-examination at the patent just before the trial was due to start , the following year .
The go - ahead for the trial was given last month , after the Patent and Trademark Office validated XCAP ’s claim , which says that Facebook did n’t start developing its site until December 2003 .
It ’s highly unlikely that the suit will shut down the rumbling juggernaut that is Facebook , but should XCAP succeed , then the firm will have to pay out millions of dollars .
The court case will undoubtedly slam the brakes on Facebook ’s IPO which , since it recently started turning a profit , can not be that far off .
“ Speak Like a Child ” ( video )
Episode Summary
Faye is gambling on horses , hoping one will win ; Spike is fishing , and has almost caught something .
She loses at the same moment he loses the fish , although both are in wholly separate locales .
Jet is hanging laundry at the same time all of this is going on and telling Ed a story about a kingdom with plenty and a treasure chest .
Spike , who was fishing in the river nearby , grumbles about having nothing to eat and not seeing treasure in a while .
A package arrives for Faye and Jet has to pay C.O.D. charges .
Faye comes back from the betting parlor and runs into Jet who demands money .
She sees the package and immediately runs off .
We know from a previous episode that Faye was kept in stasis for years and the place that kept her in stasis wants to collect .
Jet , Spike and Ed do n’t know what we know ( Spike sort of does – see “ My Funny Valentine ” ) ;
Faye is muttering to herself about whether the package is from them as she flies away .
Jet , of course , is angry and wants his money back .
The package turns out to be a videotape .
He and Spike go to a buyer who collects videos .
The video is Beta and the buyer actually has a Beta machine ; he ’s pronouncing the virtues of Beta over VHS and Jet and Spike even see some of the video before the machine fails to work .
The buyer then says this happens with Beta machines all the time , and Spike kicks the machine hard until it is a smoking pile of junk .
They get their video back with a very angry buyer wanting a replacement .
Jet still wants to see what ’s on the video .
This requires getting a Beta machine , which is in an abandoned museum .
Jet and Spike take very real risks – an elevator almost falls on them , they trudge through a number of areas that have flooded and have beasts – for what they call a treasure hunt .
Jet laments that in the story he was telling Ed , he wondered why the man who got the treasure also got old as soon as he got the treasure .
Spike says all treasure hunts are more trouble than they ’re worth : they ’re not even clear on what is so valuable about this .
They get a machine and a tv .
It turns out to be a VCR and wo n’t play Beta .
But that ’s when a Beta machine comes from the same people who sent the video in the mail , also cash on delivery which Jet pays .
Faye , who was losing money on ponies , switched to dogs and won some .
Then , being Faye , she lost all of it .
She comes back to the ship just in time for the viewing .
Jet wo n’t let her watch the video unless she pays , but she wo n’t pay ; she just watches secretly from the hall , unable to make a sound .
It turns out the video is something Faye made for herself at 10 years of age , and was meant to be a time capsule and seen in another 10 years .
Faye recorded her friends , her bedroom , stuffed animals , and the piano and – of course – herself .
Everyone in the room recognizes her because of the mannerisms .
Everyone is stunned silent .
The younger Faye talks about how she wo n’t be the same but will be exactly the same person in 10 years , and does a cheer – “ go me ” – saying that she ’ll always be there , cheering herself on .
The Faye we know remembers none of this , even as she recognizes herself on the screen .
Comment
Episode 16 ( “ Black Dog Serenade ” ) is where Jet encounters his past and his past eliminates itself thoroughly .
Both his partner and a villain he always wanted put away are killed .
Episode 17 ( “ Mushroom Samba ” ) is where we explore a bit more of Edward ; there is no past , but we see Edward ’s strengths and limitations .
For Ed , the past itself is a question to be asked , as those of you familiar with all the episodes can attest .
We ’re leading up to Episode 19 , where we encounter a man who could be Spike ’s dad .
There is a past , it is noble , it defines Spike in a deep way ( esp. the way he fights ) , but that fusion of flexibility and tradition is just plain weird : consider how Spike gets rescued at the end .
This session is the deepest of the group of four : it is n’t an adventure like the others .
Nearly everything Faye does in the episode is gamble ; I wonder if you can say running away is a gamble itself .
There ’s a definite regression in the episode ;
Faye bets on horses , then on dogs – sometime later , Jet encounters a jellyfish .
And the overall movement is definitely from adult to child ; gambling and fishing become treasure hunts and home movies .
So what exactly is going on ?
There ’s some kind of link between memory and fortune .
Faye , deprived of all her past , has nothing but fortune .
That link is created by two things : stories and technology .
Stories – like the one Jet tells
Ed – work off the premise that if we remember correctly , we will have good fortune .
It is no coincidence treasure hunts end up being moral lessons , or actual explorations of one ’s past , and are perhaps more deadly than bounty hunting .
But technology more literally links memory and fortune .
It kept Faye alive while wiping her mind clean : all it did was give her a “ chance . ”
Of course one can say technology delivers stories to us , but Faye is literally staring at herself cheer herself on and nothing is triggering .
Does this mean Faye ’s confrontation with her past is a clever way of restating the whole series ?
That as the series focuses on a Wild West future , it focuses on our necessary fragmentation ?
That ’s a bit too trite and too clever , especially when the questions are bound up with a character that ’s learning what home is again , what it means to trust , what it means to fall in love .
Faye is defined by fragmentation in a way no other character is ;
Jet ’s past has the courtesy to kill itself off .
There is n’t much to say more about the episode , except to reflect on the centrality of memory .
Despite all the awesome things our heroes are capable of , it definitely feels like the past is the most difficult thing for them to grip properly .
The question is what lies beyond fortune : is there a virtue – something like loyalty or fulfilling one ’s duties – that helps one work with the past appropriately ?
What about all our heroes ’ capabilities , and the fact that their strengths correspond to their views on life ?

The Manchester United full - back led the team during their dismal World Cup campaign in South Africa and was a leading figure in the team 's refusal to train the day after Nicolas Anelka 's was kicked out of the squad following a verbal clash with the coach , Raymond Domenech .
Speaking after this morning 's meeting of the FFF 's general council in Paris , Thuram said : " I demanded that the players be harshly punished and that Evra never returns to the France squad .
When you are captain of the France team , you must have a responsibility to the jersey and the people .
When the players shut themselves in the bus , that showed that the coach was no longer respected .
" In any group there are leaders and people who follow , and others who do not agree and do not dare say no . "
Thuram won 142 caps for France and was part of the teams that won the 1998 World Cup , the European Championship two years later and the 2003 Confederations Cup .
He also played in the 2006 World Cup final , which Les Bleus lost to Italy .
Thuram 's former international team - mate Laurent Blanc has today been confirmed as Domenech 's replacement as France coach .
According to the FBI , terrorists have noticed that Americans will go crazy and attack themselves ( shutting down public spaces and transit , evacuating busy areas , subjecting innocents to search , detention and questioning ) if you leave a " suspicious " bag in a public place .
This is thanks to programs like New York City 's " See Something , Say Something , " which generates thousands of calls about " suspicious activity " every year , not one of which has ever led to an actual terrorism arrest .
Of course , leaving bags of water or socks is an errand that 's a lot less risky than planting bombs .

For the act to be classified as " Tread heading " there can be no penetration of the anus .
With yesterday ’s leak of the full ACTA text ( updated to include the recent round of talks in Lucerne ) the simmering fight between the U.S. and the E.U. on ACTA is now being played out in the open .
During the first two years of negotations , both sides were at pains to indicate that there was no consensus on transparency and the treaty would not change their domestic rules .
Over the past four months , the dynamic on both transparency and substance has changed .
The turning point on transparency came as a result of two events in February and March .
First , a Dutch government document leak that identified which specific countries were barriers to transparency .
Once identified , the named European countries quickly came onside to support release of the text , leaving the U.S. as the obvious source of the problem .
Second , the European Parliament became actively engaged in the ACTA process and demanded greater transparency .
As the New Zealand round approached , it was clear that the Europeans needed a resolution on transparency .
The U.S. delegation used the transparency issue as a bargaining chip , issuing a release at the start of the talks that it hoped that enough progress could be made to allow for consensus on sharing the text .
The U.S. ultimately agreed to release the text , but subsequent events indicate that it still views transparency as a bargaining chip , rather than as a commitment .
At the conclusion of the latest round of negotiations in Lucerne , the U.S. did not achieve its goals for the talks and refused to agree to the release of an updated text .
The disagreement between the U.S. and E.U. has played out in the open this week , with the USTR ’s Stan McCoy acknowledging that the talks did not achieve as much as the U.S. hoped and EU Commissioner Karel de Gucht plainly blaming the U.S. for blocking release of the text , indicating that he did not expect much progress in the next round on talks in Washington , and calling out the U.S. for its “ hypocrisy ” on key issues .
The fact the text was leaked within hours of de Gucht ’s comments highlight Europe ’s frustration with the U.S. position on transparency .
The transparency fight is really cover for the bigger fight – the substance of the treaty .
A review of the latest text reveals that virtually every major area of disagreement ( there are still many ) comes down to the U.S. on one side and the E.U. on the other .
The various other ACTA countries including Canada , Mexico , Japan , Korea , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand , and Switzerland , are often simply left to pick a side .
There are some independent proposals and some specific language suggestions from those countries ( including a coalition of Australia , NZ , Singapore , and Canada promoting a provision on abuse of IP rights ) , but most of the agreement boils down to the U.S. vs. the E.U .
By far the biggest source of disagreement remains scope of the agreement , with the U.S. ( supported by Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and Singapore ) pushing for an agreement limited to trademark and copyright , while the E.U. and Switzerland seeking to extend it to all intellectual property .
Of particular importance to the E.U. is the inclusion of geographical indications and industrial designs , with de Gucht calling the issue a “ red line ” issue and questioning the value of the treaty if they are not included .
If they are included , many countries will be forced to make significant changes to their domestic laws , since many do not have criminal or civil enforcement or border measures dealing with the issue .
In other words , satisfying the E.U. on the issue may require reneging on earlier commitments to leave domestic laws largely untouched .
However , failure to satisfy the E.U. may ultimately kill the agreement altogether .
Moreover , with the same U.S. companies that urged the government to negotiate ACTA , now warning against extending it too far , adopting the E.U. position risks alienating some of ACTA ’s biggest supporters .
The issue of scope is one that will ultimately require one side to cave or otherwise leave ACTA in limbo for the foreseeable future .

In a week ’s time , more than 100,000 people have given a virtual thumbs up to a Facebook group that suggests the Gulf oil leak ought to be plugged with none other than former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .
The group ’s growth comes on the heels of Palin ’s own controversial Facebook posting suggesting environmentalists are to blame for the spill in the Gulf .
The pro Palin - plug argument : “ We have been presented with the opportunity to not only plug the worst oil spill in U.S. history , but also the opportunity to finally find a purpose for Sarah Palin , the erstwhile former vice - presidential candidate and current $ 100,000 - a - gig convention speaker . ”
They also offer T - shirts , mugs and tote bags for the cause .
The motto : Don a swimsuit .
Become a hero .
Save the Planet !
The group ’s goal is to get to one million supporters .
What happens then ?

Here are five celebrities who found fame and fortune thanks largely to an extensive ethnic makeover .
It 's 2009 , and race still matters .
Especially if you 're in front of the cameras and realize that in these enlightened times audiences like racial diversity as long as , you know , everyone looks sort of white .
5 Cindy Margolis
Cindy Margolis was born a gorgeous , brunette , Jewish girl .
She continued being all three of those things in the 80s , when she was making okay money as a model .
Her biggest credit was " Ribcage Girl " in a video called Shape up for Sensational Sex .

She needed to take that next step to stardom , and she knew that here in America we like a certain type of girl .
This type .
This is the type .
The Metamorphosis :
A. Nose job .
She had them thin the bridge of the nose .
Now it makes us sound like dicks to say she did it to make herself look " less Jewish " but the truth is , the procedure is depressingly very common for that exact reason .
The first nose job ever performed was on a Jewish patient , in an era when it was n't done out of vanity , but because of the terrible things that tended to happen to Jews in those days .
So our society has advanced , but only to the point that you still have to do the procedure if you want to sell a certain number of bikini posters .

B. Cheek implants .
Fuller , higher cheeks give her a more " All - American " or Midwestern look .
C. Eye lift .
Notice the complete re-sculpting of the area around her " ethnically " bushy eyebrows .
The Payoff :
Umm , how about this for starters :
After making the change to wholesome blonde , Margolis 's bikini pics became a sensation in 1995 , on some newfangled device called " the World Wide Web . "
She soon became a modeling phenomenon , advertised as " The Sexiest Woman Online . "
However , this life of extreme fame and fortune , just for laying around , is eclipsed by her greatest achievement :
Her own reality show where douchebags line up to win her affections .

So surgery or not , that appears to be the ceiling for Cindy .

Proving A Proof Is A Proof
How to convince someone your proof is really a proof
Roger Apéry was a mathematician who solved a beautiful problem that had been open for hundreds of years .
He was not an amateur in any sense , but because his result was so surprising there was initial doubt about its correctness .
Even professional mathematicians have some of the same problems that amateurs do .
Today I want to talk about how to know if your proof is a proof .
And further how to convince others your proof is a proof .
I have no magic single insight , but I have a few suggestions that I find useful , perhaps you will too .
Apéry proved that is irrational .
In general
is the value of the famous “ zeta ” function at .
Leonhard Euler found a closed form for for any integer .
This expression shows that for all integers , the value of is irrational — actually it is a transcendental number .
For example ,
Before Apéry ‘s work the status of was unknown .
Then in June 1978 he gave a talk , during which he presented a proof that was indeed an irrational number .
Ron Graham told me a story about the talk .
It seems likely Apéry had a proof , but his presentation style and some of his comments — jokes ?— did not make the audience feel confident in his claim .
Apéry ‘s proof depended on the following identity
At the time no one had seen such an identity .
It was new .
And it seemed magical — even the factor is strange .
Apparently someone in the audience asked Apéry how did he find this identity ?
Apéry answered ,
They grow in my garden .
You can imagine the effect such a comment might have on a group of skeptical mathematicians .
If he had said :
The identity follows by using shifted Legendre polynomials .
I can prove that all
It would have been okay .
But “ they grow in my garden ” caused , according to Ron , many to start to leave the talk .
However , someone in the back of the room had a programmable HP calculator , and quickly wrote a tiny program to check the identity .
They interrupted the talk and said that the identity checked to the allowed accuracy of the calculator .
Ron says this got everyone ’s attention , and people sat back down and listened to the rest of Apéry ‘s talk .
In the years after the talk other mathematicians found proofs that were based on Apéry ‘s work .
They were done and explained in a more conventional manner , and is indeed irrational .
See this for more discussion on the state of further work .
Some Suggestions
I have a small collection of suggestions on how to know your proof is a proof .
The same suggestions can be used to convince others , so I will concentrate on convincing yourself .
In my opinion the last way to convince yourself or anyone else is to use formal methods .
I have seen some comments in our discussions on using this or that formal system .
I think that they have a role in mathematics , but not in the checking of a new result .
See this for my thoughts on this topic : it ’s an old paper with Rich DeMillo and Alan Perlis on the nature of proof .
Calculate : Many of the great mathematicians were tireless calculators .
Euler , Carl Gauss , Bernhard Riemann , and many others did extensive calculations of all kinds .
It is even more remarkable they did this , when they did not even have calculators — let alone computers .
Trying small examples , checking identities to high precision , and building tables is one of ways to get a feel for the problem at hand .
I am suggesting that this be used to check some of your “ lemmas ” and claims .
This approach does require a caution .
Nature , especially in number theory , often will not reveal her secrets in small cases .
I have already discussed a classic theorem of John Littlewood that showed that calculations can be misleading .
But calculations can disprove a claim , even if they cannot prove a claim .
I have more than once thought that a false X was true and tried to prove it .
In one case , after trying quite a while to prove such an X , I asked Philippe Flajolet for help .
Philippe is a world expert on such problems .
He used a combination of a technical insight I did not know and Maple to show why I could not prove X .
The simple difficulty was there is a counter - example to X .
Check Concrete Cases :
A related idea to calculation is to check all lemmas and claims in small cases .
For example , suppose you have “ proved ”
Lemma :
For each integer , the Euclidean space has the red property .
I would suggest you check that and actually have this property .
If you can show that the line and the plane have the red property , that will help .
Even better is if your argument in these special cases is different from the general argument used to prove the lemma .
I have discussed before work I did on the Vector Addition Problem .
One false claimed proof that the problem was decidable had a lemma like the above .
The lemma stated some property of Euclidean space .
The difficulty was that the property failed even for the one - dimensional case .
My geometric intuition is terrible , but the authors should have checked that their lemma at least worked on the line .
It did not — there was a simple counter - example .
Watch Case Arguments :
The easiest error to make in any proof is to forget a case .
This is especially true when there are many cases , or when the cases have sub-cases and so on .
In geometry , for example , there are great paradoxes based on “ proofs ” that leave out a case .
A related issue is check any argument that handles a case X by saying : “ the proof follows in the same way as case Y . ”
This is type of argument often relies on a symmetry between X and Y .
But if the symmetry is missing , then X has not been proved .
This happened years ago in a claimed proof that SAT needed super - polynomial size circuits .
The claim was made by a world expert , and the bug was exactly of this type .
Know The Obstacles :
If you have proved something that others could not , you should know the barriers they faced .
Further you should be prepared to explain how you overcame those barriers .
Imagine if Grigori Perelman had claimed the Poincaré Conjecture based on the Ricci Flow methods of Richard Hamilton .
Yet when asked how he handled the “ cigar ” singularity suppose he had said ,
the what singularity ?
That would have raised lots of doubt about Perelman ’s work .
If you solve a problem , even a much more modest problem than Poincaré , you should know the difficulties that others have faced .
And be prepared to explain how you overcame them , went around them , or through them — in general how you avoided them .
What is Your New Idea ?
I have discussed this before here .
I believe that anyone who solves an open problem needs to have some new idea .
An idea that was missed by previous researchers .
The idea can be small , but it is essential .
If someone says here is how I proved the Riemann Hypothesis : “ it is a careful induction ” I wil be pretty pessimistic .
If instead they say :
Say a set of complex numbers is a - set if it can be covered by lines .
I eventually show that the zeroes of the zeta function are a set .
First I show they are a - set for some finite .
I noticed if this was false , then by
This sounds like it has a new idea , and while I need to see the details , I will listen .
Even if the proof fails , there is some chance that the new ideas could be useful in solving other problems .
Do n’t Prove Too Much :
This is one of my favorite tools when I am searching for a proof .
I have not heard it discussed before , but perhaps it is known .
Suppose I am trying to prove some statement X . I may see an outline that looks like it will eventually lead to a proof of X .
Often there are lots of details that have to be checked and lots of work to be done .
However , sometimes I can see that if my method can prove X it could also prove another statement Y .
This is a kind of “ meta ” argument , but I often find if a method proves X it will prove a related Y .
The key is then what is Y ?
If the statement Y is known to be false , then my method must fail .
In this case I have avoided a great deal of work , and can use my time to refine my approach to X .
If the statement Y is open , but considered likely to be false , then I may still continue .
But now I am much more careful .
Another possibility is that the statement Y is a major open problem .
Of course if my method will work this is great news , but usually I view it as showing my method is suspect .
This does not make me abandon my approach ; it does again make me very careful about each step .
Almost always I find that I have a hidden issue in my approach in this situation .
Explain
It to Others :
One way to see if your argument is reasonable is to try to explain it to others .
The best situation is to try to do this to an interested and expert audience .
This is not always possible .
I have found , however , that even explaining your ideas to non-experts is quite useful .
More than once in the middle of a detailed explanation of a “ proof ” I realized the “ bug ” myself .
I think forcing one to say all the details forces you to see all the nooks and crannies where your proof could go wrong .
It is a bit like reading text out loud to better proof - read it .
Work With Others : Yes Perelman worked alone .
But even Andrew Wiles needed the help of Richard Taylor to finish his great proof of Fermat ’s Last Theorem .
Wiles rightly deserves the credit , but there are two papers that were needed to resolve this famous problem .
Most of the false claims of famous open problems — I believe — have been single authored papers .
Perhaps that is a lesson for us all .
Harry S. Truman once said :
It ’s amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit .
Open Problems
Did these suggestions help ?
Do you have some additional ideas to help check proofs ?

Singer Beyonce may be one bad mama jama ….
but that does n’t mean she can violate the law !
( Or Oprah ’s “ No Phone Zone Pledge ” lol )
Last month ,
Be was pulled over and ticketed by the NYPD police when she was spotted texting while driving .
According to a source , the incident was very embarrassing for the R&B diva who even tried to use her celebrity status as an easy way to get out of the ticket .
However that did n’t work out all too well to her advantage .
“ Beyoncé was really embarrassed because she only recently got her driver ’s license , ” a source said .
“ She tried to charm that cop and told him she had no idea that texting while driving was against the law .
He had no idea who she was .
He just slapped her with the ticket , which was worth more than $ 100 ! ”
We bet she was completely shocked about that one !
But $ 100 to someone like Beyonce is like $ 0.01 to the rest of us …

Consider an experiment economists call “ the ultimatum game ” :
The experimenter gives one player , the sender , $ 20 to distribute between himself and another player , the receiver .
An egalitarian sender might propose a split of $ 10 each .
A more selfish sender might propose to give the receiver only $ 1 , keeping $ 19 for himself .
If the receiver accepts the deal , the two players collect their shares .
If the receiver rejects the deal , both walk away with nothing .
Were humans perfectly rational , the receiver would accept whatever is offered : even a dollar is better than nothing , right ?
Instead , researchers find , receivers will reject an overly lopsided deal , gladly giving up their shares just to punish the stingy senders .
In “ The Upside of Irrationality , ” Dan Ariely , a professor at Duke , gives us a tour of the irrational side of human decision - making and the science of behavioral economics .
When it comes to our motivations , he writes , we are less like “ hyper-rational Mr. Spock ” and more like the “ fallible , myopic , vindictive , emotional , biased Homer Simpson . ”
Given these frailties , Ariely wants to help us “ figure out how we can get the most good and least bad out of ourselves ” when making choices about our money , our relationships and our happiness .

As in his previous book , the best - selling “ Predictably Irrational , ” the experiments Ariely describes generate entertaining and often counterintuitive insights .

The Bay to Breakers is going dry .
Race organizers plan to announce today that the 100th running of the world - famous , 7.46 - mile footrace will take place May 15 , 2011 - only this time , " there will be no alcohol , period , " race spokesman Sam Singer said .
The renewed push for a booze ban comes on the heels of insurance and financial giant ING 's announcement that it was dropping out as the race 's sponsor after five years of blottoed boozers , bare - naked runners and increasingly bad press .
Not to mention irate neighbors .
" Bay to Breakers is very concerned that someone is going to get hurt or worse because of the overconsumption of alcohol , " Singer said .
" Unfortunately , people can't control themselves . "
Organizers said more than 30 participants had to be taken to hospitals via ambulance after this year 's race , most for alcohol - related reasons .
Two years ago , organizers tried to crack down on public intoxication by banning keg floats and alcohol from the race .
They relented after public protests , and Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi helped broker a compromise .
After this year 's mess , however , the floats and alcohol will be banned - with extra cops hired by organizers to crack down on public drinking .
Violators " will be arrested , cited and fined , " warned Angela Fang , the race 's executive director .
Mirkarimi , while not condoning the drunkenness , said organizers risked killing the very spirit that has made the race unique .
Plus , " I do n't know how they are going to enforce it , " Mirkarimi said .
Dugard dollars :
One of the more puzzling aspects of the Jaycee Dugard kidnap case is the logic behind the $ 20 million claim settlement recently approved by the state Legislature .
According to an internal memo from the attorney general 's office , $ 7 million is for what 's expected to be a lifetime of counseling for Dugard and the two daughters allegedly fathered by kidnapping suspect Phillip Craig Garrido .
Another $ 450,00o is for their education .
The biggest piece of the settlement , $ 12.55 million , is based on the premise that the state screwed up so badly in its supervision of Garrido , a paroled rapist , that a jury might give even more to Dugard and her daughters .
Probation officials must have really screwed up - because that 's about 10 times what the state has paid in past parole flub - up cases .
History lesson :
After looking over the latest Field Poll numbers , pollster Mark DiCamillo has two words of warning for Jerry Brown : " Huffington - Feinstein . "
It was 1994 and Dianne Feinstein entered her re-election race to the U.S. Senate with a 2 - 1 favorable rating with California voters .
Then , multimillionaire Republican candidate Michael Huffington ( at the time , husband of Arianna Huffington ) hit Feinstein with a $ 30 million nonstop TV blitz .
" By the time the election rolled around , Feinstein 's image was more negative than positive - which was pretty amazing , " DiCamillo said .
Feinstein eventually squeaked past Huffington by fewer than 2 percentage points .
" We 're seeing the same thing at work here , " DiCamillo said , referring to Republican multimillionaire Meg Whitman 's attacks on Democrat Brown .
DiCamillo noted that Brown 's unfavorable ratings have risen sharply in the wake of the attacks .
Not that Whitman is coming across that well .
The latest Field Poll numbers show her favorable rating down there with Brown's .
More planning porn :
A fifth supervisor has lost his job , and a sixth firing may be on the way in the fallout from the San Francisco Planning Department 's computer porn scandal .
As many as two dozen staffers have been under investigation since complaints surfaced about e-mails at work containing sexually explicit images and videos .
The result has been the dismissal of some of the department 's most senior and experienced staff , including the second in command .
A number of workers have also been suspended .
Supporters of the accused are pushing back with their own e-mail blasts , accusing Planning Director John Rahaim of overreacting and " destroying the department . "
To which Micki Callahan , the city 's human resources director , shoots back : " If there are people feeling demoralized because they are no longer allowed to look at pornography in the workplace , then maybe employment in the city and county is n't right for them . "

Wherein the New York Times is dumb , and the NASCARization of the web continues .
You may notice that I 've sprinkled a bunch of Facebook " Like " buttons all over the web site .
You 'll see one in the title box of this blog entry , on the flyer pages , and next to each calendar event .
I guess it 's a low - key way to tell your friends what events you 're attending without making the commitment of actually posting about it , or something .
It 's kind of ugly and cluttered , but all the cool kids are doing it .
There 's also a thing on the ticket checkout page that exhorts you to post about your planned attendance to Facebook and Twitter .
I 've seen a few people using that so far , so I guess that 's working .
Meanwhile , here 's a really dumb War on Fun article in the New York Times :
Patrolling Near Clubs Carries High Cost
But the police argue that closing clubs will not stem the violence , or the department 's mounting costs .
Kitt Crenshaw , a police commander who oversees the North Beach patrols , said the burden should be shifted to club owners .
So which is it ?
If the closing the clubs wo n't stem the violence , does n't that imply that the clubs are not the cause ?
And if they are not the cause , why do you want them to pay for the excessive , commerce - destroying ( and , apparently , ineffective ) police presence in North Beach ?
Mr. Crenshaw plans to propose regulations , based on practices in other cities , that would require clubs handling crowds of 100 or more people to enlist their state - certified security guards in unprecedented police - led training , install video cameras , improve outdoor lighting and install identification card readers that would allow the police and club owners to track patrons .
He said he would also like to see certain clubs pay a fee for police services .
So which is it ?
Are these " based on practices in other cities " or are they " unprecedented " ?
I think you do not know what that word means .
Forcing clubs to further invade their patrons ' privacy by scanning their IDs on the way in will do nothing .
If you 've been following the press about the recent shootings , the common thread is that these people were not customers of the clubs !
This was gang violence happening on public streets .
Then the article wraps up with the harrowing tale of a guy who was sitting on the sidewalk , and may have made a gang sign .
Then the police told him that they were considering the possiblity of telling him to move along .
Wow .
Is n't " sitting " illegal now , anyway ?
Dawn Sanchez was last seen alive when she stepped into Bernado Bass ' car in 1991 .
Her disappearance and death remained unsolved until recently when — thanks to a little NASA robot — her murderer was sentenced to six years in prison .

Bass was Sanchez 's boyfriend at the time of her disappearance and there were witness reports claiming that he shot the girl " in a vacant lot after the two got into a fight . "
The only problem was that no evidence to support this explanation was anywhere to be found .
No car .
No gun .
No body .
This meant that Bass got away with the murder until recently when parts from the suspect 's car were found buried in a large abandoned lot .
They most likely would not have been found without the aid of the NASA equipment borrowed for the investigation .
Using this equipment , investigators were able to figure out just where they needed to excavate :
The case was dismissed in 1991 due to lack of evidence .
The case was recently reopened , when an informant reported that the car may have been disassembled and buried in a large abandoned lot in Alviso .
The exact location in the lot was not specified , and the cost to excavate the entire area was too high .
Further , the lot contained a substantial amount of buried and surface metallic debris , making a simple survey with metal detectors insufficient . [...]
[ T ]he mixed team of scientists and engineers from CMIL , NASA Ames and the USGS deployed an instrumented Senseta MAX 5.0A rover hosting the research technologies under development , and mapped the magnetic environment of the survey area .
The USGS received the processed data set , and after further post - processing , presented the county DA 's office with their analysis and possible locations for excavation .
Based on this data , the county excavated the site and retrieved car parts that matched the suspect 's car .

The suspect , Bass , was apprehended and sentenced to six years of prison for manslaughter .

All three are stationed at Joint Base Lewis - McChord , near Seattle , and each soldier is suspected in separate incidents , the Army said in a statement announcing the charges .
Earlier this month , Spc. Jeremy Morlock , 22 , from Wasilla , Alaska , and Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs , 25 , from Billings , Montana , each were charged with three counts of murder and one count of assault .
Lt. Col. Tamara Parker , an Army spokeswoman , said the three counts of muder Morlock and Gibbs face involve the same victims as the cases agaisnt Holmes , Wagnon and Winfield .
Morlock is in pre-trial confinement at the base , while Gibbs was charged in Kuwait and he is expected to return to the installation within days , the Army said .
All five soldiers are assigned to B Company , 2nd Battalion , 1st Infantry Regiment , 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team , 2nd Infantry Division .

The monster sum was placed over the telephone with a well known British bookmaker and is reputed to be one of the largest bets ever to be placed on a single World Cup fixture .
The punter stands to pocket £ 375,000 ( €454,000 ) in profit if Germany can beat the hotly tipped La Furia Roja over 90 minutes .
Germany have been a profitable bet throghout the World Cup with bookmakers underestimating them to beat England and Argentina only to thump them 4 - 1 and 4 - 0 respectively .
betting and odds expert David Mole said the bookies wo n't be too happy if Germany maintain their winning run .
" One major UK bookmaker has taken a massive bet on Germany to go through at the expense of Spain .
They must be confident that Spain will be too much for them , or have built up a large liability of Spain to be willing to absorb the risk from such a large bet .
The way this German team has demolished England and then Argentina , there will be some sullen faced bookmakers if the demolition continues !

The following article is the Foreward to the July - August 2010 issue of the US socialist magazine Monthly Review , which features Marta Harnecker 's “ Latin America and Twenty - First Century Socialism : Inventing to Avoid Mistakes " .
Bellamy Foster will be a feature speaker at the Climate Change Social Change conference , to be held in Melbourne , November 5 - 7 , 2010 .
* * *
I ’m certain that this process is irreversible .
This movement of change , of restructuring , of revolution , will not be stopped .
— Hugo Chávez , 20021
By John Bellamy Foster
Monthly Review --
In the eyes of much of the world , the year 1989 has come to stand for the fall of the Berlin Wall , the demise of Soviet - type societies , and the defeat of twentieth - century socialism .
However , 1989 for many others , particularly in Spanish - speaking countries , is also associated with the beginning of the Latin American revolt against neoliberal shock therapy and the emergence in the years that followed of a “ socialism for the 21st century ” .
This revolutionary turning point in Latin American ( and world ) history is known as the Caracazo or Sacudón ( heavy riot ) , which erupted in Caracas , Venezuela on February 27 , 1989 , and quickly became “ by far the most massive and severely repressed riot in the history of Latin America ” .
2
The Caracazo started in the early morning in the suburb of Guarenas in response to a 100 percent increase in transport fares .
These transport hikes were part of a set of neoliberal shock policies introduced by the government of President Carlos Andrés Pérez .
The object was to put Venezuela back in good standing with the IMF and international financial institutions , obtain their assistance in the servicing of its foreign debt , and provide “ fresh money ” for the oligarchy to rely on — all on the backs of millions of poor people .
Outraged by the doubling of transport fares , the Caracas demonstrators hurled stones at the buses and overturned them .
Motorcycle couriers joined in the protests , going from one part of the city to the other and spreading the message .
Riots also broke out that same morning in nineteen other cities across the country .
By late afternoon in Caracas , public transport had come to a standstill .
Hundreds of thousands of people were walking home and buses were burning .
The protestors began to loot shops and supermarkets in order to obtain basic needs — food and clothing .
That night , in what came to be known as “ the day the poor came down from the hills , ” the impoverished barrio - dwellers , joined in some instances by the police , engaged in a campaign of massive looting , first in the commercial center of Caracas and then in the privileged residential districts of the wealthy .
From the standpoint of the majority of the Venezuelan poor , the looting was an act of social justice and retribution , an attempt to take back a little of what had been taken from them for decades — as they watched the oligarchy become ever richer , while they struggled to get enough merely to survive .
( President Peréz ’s ostentatious inauguration , only a few weeks before the announcement of the austerity program , was reported as “ one of the grandest celebrations Latin America has ever known , ” with a total of ten thousand invited guests attending , consuming 650,000 hors d’oeuvres , 209 sides of lamb , and twenty sides of beef — washing it all down with twelve hundred bottles of scotch , accompanied by immense quantities of champagne . )
In response to the widespread riot , President Pérez imposed martial law and a nighttime curfew .
This was followed by a brutal repression of the population .
Soldiers entered the barrios with orders to “ reestablish order ” .
One soldier recounted that they were ordered to “ shoot anything that moved , and shoot to kill ” .
One citizen recalled that the soldiers “ did n’t say raise your arms or anything .
But everything that appeared , they killed ” .
Hundreds , even thousands , of people were killed , with numbers of the dead ranging from 396 to 10,000 , and with many thousands more wounded .
The brutality of the retaliation stripped away any illusions about Venezuela ’s fake democracy , and set in motion the struggle for a new society .
As Richard Gott stated , it “ marked the beginning of the end of Venezuela ’s ancien régime ” .

Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution
It would be a decade before the revolutionary turning point represented by the Caracazo would lead to a victory for the left in Venezuela .
But already there existed within the Venezuelan military a Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement or Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario-200 ( MBR - 200 — the 200 marking the two - hundredth anniversary of Bolívar ’s birth ) , founded secretly in 1982 by a group of officers , led by Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías .
These revolutionary officers too were caught off guard by the Caracazo , but were subsequently spurred to action by these events .
In 1992 Chávez , then a colonel , led a military coup attempt ( intended to be a military - led insurrection ) that failed , but that — thanks to a one - minute television broadcast — turned him into a popular hero .
In the sixty seconds allotted him , Chávez asked the rebellious Bolivarian troops to stand down , while taking full personal responsibility for the attempted coup , and stating : “ for the moment , the objectives we had set ourselves have not been achieved ” .
Chávez ’s “ for the moment ” ( por ahora ) came to be thought of by Venezuela ’s poor as a promise that he would return .
Por ahora became a popular slogan on the streets and a permanent part of Venezuela ’s political lexicon .
4
After serving two years in prison , Chávez was released and immediately began working for a radical transformation of the Venezuelan state .
Already in 1993 he declared : “ The sovereign people must transform itself into the object and the subject of power .
This option is not negotiable for revolutionaries ” .
Indeed , for Chávez a new form of democracy was called for : “ [ T ] he concept of participatory democracy will be changed into a form in which democracy based on popular sovereignty constitutes itself as the protagonist of power .
It is precisely at such borders that we must draw the limits of advance of Bolivarian democracy .
Then we shall be very near to the territory of utopia ” .5
In 1997 Chávez formed a political party , Movimiento Quinta República ( MVR ) , the Fifth Republic Movement — a name meant to indicate a complete break with the past — to promote his campaign for the presidency .
In the 1998 presidential election , a multiparty contest , Chávez received 56 percent of the votes in the first round .
6
Immediately upon his election , he called for a National Constituent Assembly to establish a new Bolivarian Constitution — a call that won overwhelming popular endorsement in six separate votes , carried out in a little more than a year .
By 2000 Venezuela not only had a new ( 1999 ) constitution , and a new name — the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela — but was governed by a new National Assembly , and a president reelected under its new Constitution .
7
As Michael Lebowitz explained in Build It Now :
Here was a constitution that returns over and over again to the theme of human development as the goal , which stresses the importance of dignity and solidarity for the realisation of human potential and embodies the concept of a human family — one whose relations are based upon “ equality of rights and duties , solidarity , common effort , mutual understanding , and reciprocal respect ” .
The view is one of a society where “ obligations which , by virtue of solidarity , social responsibility , and humanitarian assistance , are incumbent upon private individuals according to their abilities ” .
Here , too , was a vision of new Bolivarian subjects producing themselves — both in the political sphere ( “ the participation of the people in forming , carrying out and controlling the management of public affairs is the necessary way of achieving the involvement to ensure their complete development , both individual and collective ” ) and in the economic sphere ( “ self - management , co-management , cooperatives in all forms , including those of a financial nature , savings funds , community enterprises , and other forms of association guided by the values of mutual cooperation and solidarity ” ) .
This is a constitution that demands a “ democratic , participatory , and protagonistic ” society , a constitution whose premise is that the full development of human beings as subjects is based upon their “ active , conscious , and joint participation in the processes of social transformation embodied in the values which are part of the national identity ” .
8
Although the new Bolivarian Constitution represented a genuinely revolutionary political transformation , breaking , in many ways , with the logic and language of liberalism , it was not socialist .
In fact , key parts of the Constitution were conducive to capitalism , guaranteeing the position of private property .
As Lebowitz says , it “ represented a snapshot of the balance of forces at the time , ” and thus embodied contradictory elements .
The economic policy adopted by the Bolivarian government in its initial phase was aimed at endogenous national development and was redistributive , but was not directly inimical to the regime of capital .
As Chávez put it in an interview with Marta Harnecker in 2002 ( following the unsuccessful coup attempt to remove him from power ) : “ We are stuck in a capitalist system , we have not changed it , it would be dishonest to suggest otherwise ” .
The goal , as he articulated it , was to provide “ an economic alternative to dehumanised capitalism ” — to “ humanise capitalism ” .
Nevertheless , he saw the revolutionary political transformation even then as part of a longer , wider “ transition process ” ( in the sense of István Mészáros ’s argument in Beyond Capital ) away from capitalism .9
The main political thrust of the Bolivarian Revolution was , in fact , anti-capitalist in its underlying logic of the institutionalisation of social revolt .
This meant the continual mobilisation of the population as social protagonists : subjects and objects of their own human development .
The many measures , adopted with the aim of generating greater equality in the society , were viewed by the representatives of capital , inside and outside Venezuela , as constituting in aggregate an enormous attack on their interests — a fundamental uprooting of their position in society .
What had begun initially as a massive revolt against neoliberalism , was thus rightly seen by the powers that be as ultimately posing a dire threat to their permanent , propertied interests .
The Bolivarian Circles that Chávez instituted in 2001 to reestablish the political movement on a truly mass foundation — mobilising the people to apply the new Bolivarian Constitution in their own communities to solve their most pressing problems — represented a corrosive force , threatening the hegemony of the Venezuelan capitalist class .
In April 2002 , with the covert support of the United States , the oligarchy launched a military coup against Chávez .
Removed forcibly from power and taken prisoner , Chávez , in one of history ’s more dramatic reversals , was nonetheless swept back into power within days , through the militant actions of the Chávistas , Venezuela ’s poor , who came out en masse in his support , soon backed by loyal sectors of the military .
This was followed in 2002 by what is known as the attempted “ oil coup , ” in which forces allied with the oligarchy and supported by Washington sought to use their control of the state oil company to paralyze the country with a lockout , thereby depriving the state of revenue , with the intention of bringing about Chávez ’s removal .
The “ oil coup ” too was soundly defeated .
Various other attempts to unseat Chávez were made by the vested interests , but in general they only led to the strengthening of popular support for the revolution .
By 2003 Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution came to focus increasingly on the transformation of the social economy , promoting cooperatives , worker management , a massive program to bring health care to the poor ( Misión Barrio Adentro ) , and an equally massive program to spread literacy ( Misión Robinson , named after Bolívar ’s mentor Simón Rodrígruez ) .
In 2004 Misión Vuelvan Caras ( Turn Your Faces ) was launched to provide revolutionary employment solutions directed at “ converting — through work — the creative potential of the people into creative power ” .
It emphasised the promotion of endogenous development , social economy , the transformation of agriculture in the direction of food sovereignty , and the formation of cooperatives .
The number of cooperatives in the country — encouraged by both Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Constitution and by the Vuelvan Caras — rose from less than a thousand to more than 180,000 in about a five - year period .
Inspired by Mészáros ’s Marxian critique , Chávez was soon arguing for creating space for a new form of exchange ( in opposition to capitalist commodity exchange ) .
This was to be a form of communal exchange based on activities or use values .
This would go hand - in - hand with real planning ; not by means of a command economy but through “ coordinated societal self - management ” .
10
This notion of the communal exchange of activities was central to the formation of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA ) , launched in 2004 by Venezuela and Cuba .
ALBA was meant to generate a broad Latin American alternative to the so - called “ free market ” .
( The word “ alba ” in Spanish means “ dawn ” . )
The best known example of the type of exchange promoted by ALBA is the trading of Venezuelan oil for the help of twenty thousand Cuban doctors in bringing basic health care to at least seventeen million Venezuelans .11
What was emerging organically from the Venezuelan revolutionary struggle — personified by Chávez but involving countless others as well — was a new vision of socialist organisation and development .
Hence , when Chávez , at the close of the 2005 World Social Forum , called for a “ socialism for the 21st century , ” declaring that , “ we have to reinvent socialism , ” he was simply following the historical logic of the Bolivarian revolutionary process , which had unfolded in this way .
The emerging “ socialism for the 21st century ” involved opposition to neoliberalism , imperialism , and the regime of capital , as well as the creation of a new radical “ protagonistic democracy , ” based on the mass of the hitherto oppressed population .
Chávez has insisted again and again that the only way to rid the country of poverty and to have a genuine democracy is to transfer power to the people .
In April 2006 a law was passed , establishing communal councils .
These provide elected community “ spokespeople , ” based on groupings of two hundred to four hundred families in urban areas ( or twenty in rural areas ) .
The spokespeople work side - by - side with regional and local authorities but remain directly accountable to their communal councils .
So far , there are close to twenty thousand separate communal councils operating in the country .
12
The Latin American revolt
Although Latin America ’s “ socialism for the 21st century ” began with the Caracazo in Venezuela , parallel struggles were going on elsewhere in the region .
Cuba ’s “ special period , ” following the collapse of the Soviet Union , saw major changes in the society , and new forms of activism , including what is known as “ the greening of Cuba , ” reflected in its massive shift to organic agriculture .
13
In 2005 Evo Morales , of the Movement Toward Socialism , was elected president of Bolivia , becoming the country ’s first indigenous head of state .
He immediately took on the mantle of “ socialism for the 21st century ” and joined ALBA .
Under Morales ( who rose to power partly as a result of the Cochabamba water wars and their effect in transforming the politics of the country ) , Bolivia has come to play a leading role in defining a third world perspective on the global ecological crisis , as witnessed by the April 2010 Cochabamba Protocol .14
In 2009 Morales was elected to a second term , winning 63 percent of the total vote .
Meanwhile , in 2006 , Rafael Correa , another proponent of “ socialism for the 21st century , ” was elected president of Ecuador .
Today ALBA ’s membership includes Venezuela , Cuba , Bolivia , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and three smaller countries from the Caribbean : Antigua and Barbuda , Dominica , and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines .
The power of the Landless Workers ’ Movement in Brazil and Lula ’s presence as a social democratic president there can also be seen as representing a significant shift leftward .
Meanwhile , dissent in Mexico , where millions rose up in protest of the stolen 2006 election , has been growing .
Just over twenty years after the Caracazo , Latin American socialism is expanding rapidly and generating a renewal of socialism worldwide .
15
So much so that the United States , as the main imperial power , has sought to intervene again and again — not only playing a role in the failed military coup against Chávez , but also in the successful 2009 military coup against Honduras ’s democratically elected president , Manuel Zelaya , who had brought Honduras into ALBA .
Washington has subsequently given its support to a “ normalisation ” of the rightward shift in Honduras , and , in the face of the fierce repression of the protesting Honduran people , has simply looked the other way .
Meanwhile , the United States is constructing as many as seven military bases in Colombia , bordering Venezuela and Ecuador .
Marxism and vernacular revolutionary traditions
For many on the left accustomed to seeing socialism in terms largely derived from the Russian Revolution , the recent developments in Latin America are startling , even bewildering .
These reflect very different revolutionary conditions , and a very different theory and practice of socialism .
For some of those still firmly wedded to old models , and who see only one possible path to socialism , this is simply “ not the right way ” to carry out the transition to socialism .
The victories that brought these revolutionary - popular governments to power were through the ballot box , not armed struggle .
The seizure of the state and economy is by no means complete .
The role of the revolutionary political instrument ( the party ) is very different from that of old .
Nor does there seem to be an emphasis on top - down , state - bureaucratic planning .
Most disturbing of all , perhaps , is the fact that these revolutions seem to be inspired initially not so much by Marxism , as by revolutionary traditions indigenous to Latin America that go back centuries .
Chávez has played a leading role in this , defining the Bolivarian Revolution , in relation to Bolívar himself , his teacher and mentor , Simón Rodríguez , and Ezequiel Zamora , the leader of the peasant revolt in the federal wars of the 1850s and ’60s .
Marx , it is sometimes pointed out by left critics of the Bolivarian Revolution , wrote an article on Bolívar that was entirely negative toward “ the Liberator ” ( based on distorted sources ) .
16 How could the Bolivarianism of early nineteenth - century Latin America relate to socialist struggles today ?
How , then , are Marxists to view a Bolivarian Revolution ?
There is no doubt that Marxism ’s emergence in the nineteenth century provided a powerful set of tools for the analysis of revolutionary change in bourgeois society .
Yet , all too often , these tools were converted into a mechanical “ science of revolution ” to be imposed on the most diverse situations .
At its crudest , it was tied to a unilinear view of history , in which all historical peoples were destined to pass through the same identical stages on the same identical path .
This imposed a kind of doctrinal purity on Marxism .
It is important to understand that Marx himself never viewed his own critical analysis in this way .
“ Success , ” he wrote , “ will never come with the master - key of a general historico - philosophical theory , whose supreme virtue consists in being supra-historical ” .
17 Confronted with the development of revolutionary movements in Russia late in his life , Marx therefore did not seek to impose a ready - made model but delved into the specific historical conditions , learning Russian and studying the works of the revolutionary Russian populists .
As a result , he ended up incorporating aspects of the vernacular revolutionary tradition in Russia into his analysis , responding to Russian conditions and struggles .
He thus arrived at an understanding that was , in many ways , diametrically at odds with his own “ Marxist ” followers in Russia at the time .
18
All peoples have their own vernacular revolutionary traditions , extending back into the distant past .
These reflect a particular history and culture , past defeats , and deep - seated problems which remain unsolved .
Some of these historical legacies can no doubt be discounted as archaic .
But just as often , they reflect radical solutions that were simply ahead of their time or that were not organically connected to earlier struggles .
Sometimes they simply represent important causes that were defeated only to grow again .
Hence , their transformative power remains .
Reaching back into the past and building creatively on these vernacular revolutionary traditions is thus crucial to deriving the language , means of inspiration , and concrete practices to overcome obstacles in the present .
History is by nature a revolutionary process .
At the end of Open Veins of Latin America , Eduardo Galeano declared : “ All memory is subversive because it is different , and likewise any program for the future ” .
19
The relation of Marxism to vernacular revolutionary traditions is therefore complex .
As Teodor Shanin pointed out in 1983 , in Late Marx and the Russian Road , during Marxism ’s first century or so ,
the purest forms of “ scientific socialism , ” i.e. those most strictly deduced from the masters , invariably proved politically impotent . …[ Similarly ] , all of the pure “ vernacular ” forms of revolutionary socialism have also ended with defeat .
It has been the integration of marxism with the indigenous political traditions which has underlain all known cases of internally generated and politically effective revolutionary transformation of society by socialists .
The polarity between the victories of Lenin , Mao , Ho , and others on the one hand , and on the other hand , the defeats of Kautsky , the Mensheviks of Plekhanov or Martov or of the Asian Marxists like Roy , bears testimony to the different sides of similar equations .
While there is no way to understand political results in terms of the theoretical thinking of its participants only , marxism has derived specific strengths form the “ impurity , ” i.e. from its amalgamation with “ vernacular ” traditions .
20
This is also true in the reverse : vernacular revolutionary traditions have gained through their amalgamation with Marxism , as the most sustained attempt to bring knowledge and science to bear on the problem of revolution — and on the problem of capital , the hegemonic structure of our time .
Needless to say , all the “ successful ” revolutions that Shanin mentioned above ran into serious difficulties .
The year 1989 , as we have noted , came to symbolise the fall of “ actually existing socialism , ” i.e. , of the first great wave of socialist revolution .
These revolutions , as exemplified by the Soviet Union , had long succumbed to internal and external contradictions , and well before their collapse had ceased to be viable “ models ” on which to act .
The transformative process in Venezuela following the 1989 Caracazo therefore drew its inspiration primarily from vernacular revolutionary traditions , in which Marxism played only a secondary role at the outset .
This contributed to the uniqueness of the recent revolutionary process in Latin America .
As Marta Harnecker declared in 2003 , it could be seen as “ a sui generis revolution ” .
21
Chávez ’s genius was to draw on the vernacular revolutionary tradition of Bolivarianism , and especially on Bolívar himself .
In the sacred oath that he took on Monte Sacro in Rome in 1805 , in the presence of Rodríguez , Bolívar famously declared : “ I swear before you ; I swear by the god of my fathers ; I swear by my ancestors ; I swear by my honor and I swear by my homeland that I will not allow my arm to rest , nor my soul to repose , until we have broken the chains that oppress us by the will of Spanish power ” .
22 Bolívar lived that oath for the rest of his life , leading revolutionary armies that freed much of Latin America , including what are now six separate countries , and installing new constitutional orders .
Referring to the forms of Spanish rule , Bolívar wrote : “ Our existing laws are disastrous relics derived from every despotic regime that has ever been , both ancient and modern ; let us ensure that this monstrous edifice will collapse and crumble , so that we may construct a temple of justice away from its ruins ” .
Indeed , for Bolívar , equality was “ the law of laws ” .
23 Accordingly he fought for the elimination of slavery and for the rights of indigenous peoples .
His struggle to emancipate the slaves in the liberated colonies of Spanish America occurred long before slavery in the United States was abolished .
Bolívar is particularly known for his stance on Latin American unity , especially vis-à - vis the colossus of the North .
“ The United States of America , ” he wrote , “ seem to be destined by providence to condemn [ our ] America to misery in the name of Liberty ” .
24
Bolívar , the revolutionary man of action , referred to Rodríguez as the “ philosopher ” whom he wished to have constantly “ beside me ” .
25
It was Rodríguez who introduced Bolívar to European radical democratic and revolutionary thought , including Rousseau , and who himself was to become a utopian socialist .
Late in his life , in 1847 , Rodríguez wrote : “ The division of labour in the production of goods only serves to brutalize the workforce .
If to produce cheap and excellent nail scissors , we have to reduce the workers to machines , we would do better to cut our finger nails with our teeth ” .
He was especially notable for his unswerving defense of the indigenous and black populations .
“ The scholars of America have never revealed the fact that they owe their knowledge to the Indians and the blacks ; for if these scholars had had to plough , and sow and reap , and to gather up and prepare everything they eat and wear and use and play with during their valueless lives , they would not know so much ” .
He also argued for the uniqueness of Latin America , its capacity to invent its own future .
“ Spanish America , ” he wrote , “ is an original construct .
Its institutions and its government must be original as well , and so too must be the methods used to construct them both .
Either we shall invent , or we shall wander around and make mistakes ” .
26
Scarcely less important in defining the vernacular of the Bolivarian Revolution as articulated by Chávez is the figure of Ezequiel Zamora , who helped organise an army of peasants and slaves to oppose the landholding oligarchy in the civil war of the 1850s and ’60s .
A famous portrait of Zamora after military victory depicts him as wearing two hats , one on top of the other , the first was a bowler , the second a military cap .
This was meant to symbolise Zamora ’s attempt to merge armed struggle with the struggles of civil society .
27
For Chávez , this vernacular revolutionary heritage has been a mine from which to extract resources for the forging of a new society in which equality is the “ law of laws ” .
Seven years before the Caracazo , in 1982 , the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement in Venezuela was established when a number of revolutionary officers , at Chávez ’s instigation , each took Bolívar ’s sacred pledge — under a famous tree known as the Samán de Güere , near Marcay in central Venezuela , that Bolívar is said to have slept beneath before the battle of Carabobo in 1821 .
They pledged not to allow their arms to rest until they had broken the chains that oppressed the people .
Chávez , however , modified the original oath in a number of ways , incorporating from Zamora : “ Free elections , free land and free men , horror to the oligarchy ” .
Again and again , Chávez has returned to the ideas of Bolívar , Rodríguez , and Zamora in his speeches and writings to provide the inspiration for a different kind of revolutionary process , beginning with constitutional change aimed at the promotion of substantive equality .
28
Since 2003 , however , the Bolivarian revolutionary process in Venezuela , while retaining its uniqueness , has increasingly sought a synthesis between its own vernacular and Marxism .
The reasons for this can be traced , as we have seen , to the objective conditions of the revolution itself .
If the Bolivarian Revolution started out as a far - reaching political revolution , it has moved inexorably in the direction of growing conflict over production and the role of capital .
Politics led so that economics ( i.e. , revolution at a deeper level ) could follow .
Chávez once expressed this metaphorically as the “ cavalry ” ( the political revolution ) being the advance guard , while the rear guard ( the more economic revolution ) was the “ artillery ” .
Previous revolutions , he said , had often made the error of inverting the two.29
This growing focus on issues of production , new forms of exchange , and the implementation of a more radical , substantive equality at all levels of society has naturally gone hand - in - hand with the call for a “ socialism for the 21st century ” .
This in turn has resulted in a greater reliance on some of the more innovative forms of Marxian theory .
In this , Chávez has been influenced especially by the systematic critique of capital as a social - metabolic order ( and also of Soviet - type societies ) embodied in the work of István Mészáros , whom the former has described as the “ pathfinder ” of twenty - first century socialism .
He has also drawn on the ideas of a number of other critical Marxian thinkers , including Marta Harnecker and Michael Lebowitz.30
Following his reelection in December 2006 , Chávez deepened his presentation of socialist ideas , introducing his notion , inspired by Mészáros , of the “ elementary triangle of socialism ” : ( a ) social ownership of production , ( b ) social production organised by workers , and ( c ) production for communal needs .
All three elements of the triangle must be present , in Chávez ’s conception , in order for a socialist alternative to be actualised .

Marta Harnecker and revolutionary inventiveness
Marta Harnecker ’s “ Latin America and Twenty - First Century Socialism ” ( originally released in Spanish and translated for publication in this issue of Monthly Review ) has as its subtitle “ Inventing to Avoid Mistakes ” .
In the vernacular of Latin America ’s Bolivarian Revolution , this is clearly recognisable as a quotation from Rodríguez ( referred to above ) , expressing the necessity of revolutionary inventiveness if fatal errors are to be avoided .
Harnecker ’s intention , as she makes evident , is to explore the distinctive nature of these Bolivarian Revolutions .
But she does so not as a bystander outside this process , simply recounting the developments in Venezuela , Bolivia , etc. , but as an active protagonist of this Latin American revolutionary process .
As a result , her argument is both an account of the “ socialism for the 21st century ” in Latin America and an attempt to analyze and advance it further .
The overall emphasis is on popular revolutionary practice and the strategic context that will allow this process to move forward .
As a socialist intellectual , Harnecker is eminently qualified to play this dual role as critic - protagonist of the revolutionary process .
Born in Chile , she was a student of Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser in France in the 1960s , and in 1968 began a lifetime process of seeking to advance revolutionary social transformation in Latin America .
She was the editor of the magazine Chile Hoy ( Chile Today ) during Salvador Allende ’s Popular Unity government .
After the 1973 coup that overthrew Allende , she fled to Cuba where she became director of the research center , Memoria Popular Latinoamericana , in Havana and an advisor to the Cuban government .
More recently , she has taken up residence in Caracas , conducting investigations at the Centro Internacional Miranda research institute , and serving as an advisor to President Hugo Chávez .
She has written some eighty books and monographs , among them , Understanding the Venezuelan Revolution : Hugo Chávez Talks to Marta Harnecker ( Monthly Review Press , 2005 ) .
In her richly detailed analysis in the following pages , one gets a clear picture at the ground level of the revolutionary process now taking place in Latin America — and in Venezuela in particular — of its successes and failures , and above all its inventiveness .
Analyzing these developments from a Marxist perspective , Harnecker nonetheless departs from doctrinal purity .
In fact , there is to be found here a constant dialectical interchange between Marxist theory and the particular vernacular revolutionary process .
As a result , the contradictions of each are brought to light , and new , concrete syntheses are evoked .
Harnecker argues strenuously against a narrow “ workerist ” view of revolution , and against all kinds of revolutionary isms : “ vanguardism , verticalism , authoritarianism , ” excessive centralism , etc .
Socialism for the twenty - first century , in her vision , is a revolution defined by its commitment to protagonist democracy .
In Venezuela the revolution has taken the form of a “ peaceful armed transition , ” i.e. , peaceful but not defenseless , as in the case of Allende ’s Chile .
It is a process in which the object is constantly to push the revolution forward by continually transferring ever more power to the people .
The Bolivarian Revolution , she explains , adamantly rejects representative democracy , choosing instead participatory or protagonist democracy .
32
This is a real struggle , one that can be won or lost , she tells us .
It is rife with contradictions and “ impossible obstacles ” that nonetheless need to be surmounted .
The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela exists in the context of a capitalist economy .
It does not control the state as a whole , but simply part of the government .
Its life , its very existence , thus depends on the continual mobilisation and the developing capacities of the population , the multitude , the poor .
Above all , Harnecker attunes us to the distinctiveness of this revolution , which is unlike any other , and yet which is putting forth new principles and modalities of revolutionary change that may aid in the formation of similar struggles worldwide .
Its strength is its historical specificity , and it is out of this that its real universality arises .
She tells us : “ Chávez — influenced by José Carlos Mariátegui — thinks that twenty - first century socialism cannot be a carbon copy of anything but has to be a ‘ heroic creation . ’
That is why he talks of a Bolivarian , Christian , Robinsonian [ referring to Simón Rodríguez ] , Indoamerican socialism , a new collective existence , equality , liberty , and real , complete democracy ” .
If the transition away from capitalism is now an organic tendency of world history in our time , it also follows : “ to each country , its own transition ” .
In the end , what is needed , she concludes , is “ a left that understands that , more important than what we have done in the past , is what we will do together in the future to win our sovereignty — to build a society that makes possible the full development of all human beings : the socialist society of the twenty - first century ” .
Notes
Stephen Moss : Army officer , second lieutenant , starting salary £ 24,133
I can't claim I ever seriously considered a career in the army as a 20 - year - old , but 30 years later military life appeals .
There 's an unimpeachable certainty about it that does n't apply to other jobs .
You are there to serve your country , albeit in some dodgy foreign wars .
I also like the uniforms .
So 30 years too late I am attending the Army Officer Selection Board in Westbury , Wiltshire , to see whether I 'm made of the right stuff .
This is phase one of the officer selection process : young men and women who pass here go on to Sandhurst , emerging 11 months later as second lieutenants fit to command a platoon of 30 soldiers .
I am sure I 'll be a natural , and fancy being a field marshal ( a step above general ) .
" Some people come here with a romantic idea of what it means to be in the army , " says Brigadier Philip Mostyn , commanding officer at Westbury , " and we make certain that they have no illusions about the seriousness of the business they wish to join . "
These words will come back to haunt me .
The day begins with a series of tests in verbal , numerical and abstract reasoning .
The latter , I know , will be a problem : it involves identifying relationships between shapes , and I have no spatial sense .
Lieutenant - Colonel Mark Pomroy , who oversees my day at the camp , describes my performance in that part of the test as " catastrophic " .
My scores in the other two parts are n't up to much either .
" The tests tell us the horsepower of the brain , " says Mostyn .
My battery appears to be flat .
We move to the gym , where I have to negotiate five obstacles .
Some allowance must be made for my 50 - year - old self , but even at 20 I would have struggled .
I manage to get over the hurdles and just about clamber across a series of bars while carrying a log , but I can't do the long jump , fail to get over the wall ( even though I 'm allowed to have a go at the smaller women 's wall ) , and fall off the rope on which you 're supposed to swing across a barrier .
Incredibly , this is not the worst of it .
I am with six other journalists , here to write about army careers , and we go outdoors for some group exercises .
We first practise tying knots , and lash a few planks together to improvise a bridge .
Pomroy then sets us two tasks : carrying a box and a barrel over an obstacle course without touching the ground .
What is remarkable is how one of the group , so self - effacing I had barely noticed him , suddenly takes command , working out a plan and seeing it through with steely determination .
I , by contrast , make a total hash of tying two planks together .
If I 'd been in command of the Normandy landings , Europe would still be waiting to be liberated .
Exhausted , we have lunch in the officers ' mess , and here I perform brilliantly , eating a herculean number of sandwiches .
If I could go straight in as a gouty field marshal , I 'd be sensational .
I bet the Duke of Wellington did n't have to pass an abstract reasoning test or excel in the long jump .
This is war , not the modern pentathlon .
The final blow comes after lunch , when Pomroy asks us to imagine we are deep in the jungle , when a man falls seriously ill with malaria .
How can we get him assistance , while also getting to the airport in time to catch a flight ?
I fail to read the briefing properly and , rather than get the man to hospital as instructed , have him treated in situ .
The upside is that I get to the airport with several hours to spare .
" I 'll have time to get a drink , " I say proudly .
The downside is that the malaria victim probably dies .
" Your plan is pants , " is Pomroy 's pithy summing up .
It is clear I am not going to make the grade .
The Brigadier offers a crumb of comfort .
" Perhaps it 's better that you 've discovered you would n't have made it .
Otherwise you might have felt you 'd missed out on your perfect career . "
I ask Pomroy how my platoon would have fared in a war zone .
He gives me a lateral answer .
" Sometimes your men will follow you not because of your inspirational leadership but because they 're intrigued to see what will happen .
They will go with you because they 're interested . . . but only up to a point . "
Sam Wollaston : Fisherman , trainee deckhand , £ 10,000
Just before Chris Wightman left school , he went to see the careers adviser .
The man asked Chris what he planned to do .
Chris said he was going to be a fisherman .
The man looked it up in his little book , so he could give some advice .
But it was n't there , there was no advice .
The job of fisherman did n't exist .
It 's easy to believe this , at 6.30 am at the fish dock at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast .
There 's not an awful lot going on .
Lowestoft , the most easterly town in Britain , used to be one of the country 's busiest fishing ports , with more than 100 drifters and trawlers operating out of it .
Now there are just a dozen or so .
One of them is Maximus , a 10 metre ( 33 foot ) boat used mainly for long - lining .
It 's co-owned by Chris , now 34 ; and Steve , his 40 - year - old brother .
Fishing has been in the Wightman family for generations .
We load the lines – 18 in all , each with 240 hooks , baited with squid , coiled in tin baths that are light enough to be carried by hand – on to the boat and head to sea .
It 's an exciting moment for me .
I 've always wanted to be a fisherman .
I love the sea , and boats , and fish – and the idea of having a proper job , doing something useful .
You do n't need any specific qualifications , but people can enroll on training courses .
Steve , the skipper , silent and authoritative , looks at his navigation instruments .
Chris is the chatty one .
It 's both the best job in the world , and the worst , he says .
How the best ?
Well , look around – the sun , still low in the east , has turned the water silver , it 's calm today , and warm for the end of October .
This is n't a bad little place to come to work .
But the North Sea can be cold and miserable at times – they do n't go out if it 's blowing over 20 knots – and , of course , you never know if you 're going to catch anything .
Today Steve has picked a spot about two hours south of Lowestoft , 12 miles or so offshore .
The lines go out , one after the other , with anchors and chains to keep them to the seabed .
This is when it 's easy to lose a finger to a hook shooting over the stern , especially if the boat is moving around a lot in a big sea .
It 's not a job for the work experience boy , but I 'm allowed to hose down the empty tin tubs .
Thanks guys .
When the line is out , all six miles of it , there 's time for a cup of tea before winching it back in again .
There are n't many to begin with , a few small thornback rays ( skate to you ) and dogfish , which are thrown back into the water alive .
It 's mesmeric watching the line come up , watching and hoping — I can see why Chris says you need to be an optimist to be a fisherman .
Steve says the tide is not running fast enough for a good haul of cod , but there are a few , a beautiful greeny gold when they come out of the water .
Plus some bigger thornbacks , whiting and rough hounds – a small shark that usually gets called rock salmon at the chippy because no one would eat a rough hound .
I 'm allowed to gut the whiting , and when I 've mastered that , a few rays .
The underside of a ray is an extraordinary thing , like an aeroplane from below .
It has a strange mouth , with no teeth , but lips strong enough to crush a cockle .
The cod go into iced water , to keep them superfresh .
In spite of all the stories , they 've had a good couple of years for cod .
Not today though .
We get just over a box – about 50kg , worth about £ 150 at market .
And four boxes of thornbacks , which may fetch £ 350 .
The experience has been brilliant for me , but Chris and Steve have probably caught just enough to cover their costs – fuel plus the massive loan on the boat .
Maybe tomorrow will be better .
It 's half term and Steve 's eight - year - old son , Maximillian ( the boat is named after him ) will be with them .
Is Max going to be a fisherman when he grows up ?
Of course he is .
Laura Barton : Milliner , £ 15,000
When my Great Auntie Evelyn died , she was kind enough to bequeath me , along with two mustard - coloured armchairs and a floral - patterned tea service , her large collection of hats – small , brightly hued straw concoctions , a bubble of yellow and white felt , an ocelot - print pillbox , a brown suede bakerboy cap .
It was , you see , Great Auntie Evelyn's hat collection that kindled my early desire to be a milliner , that inspired my fascination with cloches and skullcaps and Philip Treacy and feathers and veiling .
I took GCSE textiles and even in the summer of my A - levels I wavered between studying for a degree in English literature and pursuing millinery .
I chose the former , and sometimes wonder about all the cocktail hats that might have been .
Up a tiny flight of stairs in London 's St James 's , lie the showroom and workroom of Rachel Trevor - Morgan .
A milliner for 17 years , she " fell into it by mistake " at the age of 19 when she took an apprenticeship with Graham Smith , gradually progressing to her own shop .
Her hats are elegant , deeply feminine affairs – a curled peacock alice band ; a peach lace crescent with burnt ostrich feathers and a flower ; a simple grosgrain disc – and prices vary from £ 150 to £ 900 for a couture hat .
Most of her work is bespoke , customers ranging from well - to - do society ladies to brides in search of something unusual .
She has even made hats for the Queen , including the white and silver number she wore for her diamond wedding .
This is the quiet time of the year , but in the spring , pre-Ascot and just before the wedding season begins in earnest , her showroom downstairs may have as many as eight hour - long appointments each day .
Today there is just one , for which Trevor - Morgan is busy dyeing fabric in pans atop a small stove in the kitchen , while her assistants , Lucy and Ann , are working on an order for Harrods that requires the construction of endless bows and flowers .
They sit me down with a bag of white feathers to learn the subtle art of making tiny quills : you choose a small , pretty part near the top of the feather , peel away the lower fronds and snip it sharply at the top .
These can be dyed later and used to trim the hat .
It is peaceful work ; we chatter and listen to the radio , to the sound of rain against the window and the hiss of the steam iron .
All the while , Trevor - Morgan 's tiny dog , Daphne , slumbers quietly in a basket in the fireplace .
After lunch , Lucy teaches me to block a hat , while we listen to the Archers and Radio 4's afternoon play .
We 're making a delicate little teardrop of a hat , which starts life as stiff , webbed , white cotton fabric cut to shape and then moulded to the block with the heavy , huffy iron .
The edges are glued down and smoothed and then the teardrop is covered in pink slub silk and finished with near - invisible stitches .
It 's fiddly work , and I 'm a little cackhanded , but I love it .
The pink teardrop can be trimmed and then attached to a headband , worn at an angle on the head .
I 'm thoroughly enjoying my taste of the millinery life , though I suspect that with time I might come to miss the variety of journalism ; I 'm not sure I 'm altogether made for a job where I know what I am likely to be doing each morning .
For now , though , it 's much nicer than staring at a computer screen all day , and there is something truly thrilling about actually making something tangible , something beautiful that someone would keep for ever .
Tim Dowling : Local reporter , £ 15,000
I sidled into journalism without really knowing what skills , qualifications or experience were required .
By the time I realised just how underqualified I was , it was too late to give the money back .
I have , however , always harboured dreams of having the benefit of training and a long apprenticeship .
A day 's work experience as a reporter on the Hackney Gazette was n't going to provide either , but it might give me some sense of what I 'd missed .
The Gazette shares its offices – a pair of shopfronts in Bethnal Green , east London – with two sister papers , the Docklands and the East London Advertiser .
Sitting in the office of group editor Malcolm Starbrook , it is immediately dispiriting to find out that had I presented myself as a prospective employee , he would n't have taken me on .
Successful recruits have usually already completed an accredited course and have a minimum shorthand rate of 100 words a minute , as opposed to my zero .
There is no shortage of applicants , even though the pay is terrible .
" We can afford to be quite tough at the interview stage , " says Starbrook .
Nevertheless , he is happy to let me be his trainee for a day .
" There are a few things we can show you , " he says .
" Have you ever done a death knock ? "
" No , " I say , feeling the blood drain from my face .
I want to go home already .
Starbrook has a chat with reporter Victoria Huntley about an incident the previous week when a local man doused himself in petrol and set himself alight in front of his estranged wife and their two kids .
He tells her to go out and find the family , and instructs me to go with her .
It will be my first death knock .
On the train I 'm hoping we 'll fail to find anyone to talk to .
The police have n't released the dead man 's name , and the details are sketchy .
It 's the sort of story that , if it was n't reported by the Hackney Gazette , would n't be reported at all .
When we arrive at the road in question , we find a pile of flowers and cards .
Several of the cards mention a man 's first name , but they all spell it differently .
Undeterred , Huntley picks a house opposite the flowers and knocks .
When she gets no answer , she tries the next one along .
A woman comes to the window , then the door .
She is barefoot , wearing a blue bathrobe and holding a cat .
She is , it transpires , the mother of the estranged partner of the dead man .
Huntley asks her a few questions in a soft voice , noting down the woman 's answers in elegant shorthand .
" When he said he was gonna do it , we did n't believe him , " says the woman .
That 's about all I manage to write down .
I stare down towards the end of the road , where a bendy bus is passing .
The interview will form the basis of next week 's front - page story , headlined HUMAN FIREBALL HORROR .
On the way back to the office I realise that although the death knock was a lot of things – grim , tragic and an experience I would never care to repeat – it did n't seem particularly intrusive .
The woman seemed quite keen to explain things .
" It 's rare that people do n't want to talk to us , " says Starbrook when I ask him about it later .
" In that moment they 're keeping that person alive , by talking about them . "
He says it 's not unusual for the families of victims to come to the office to provide photographs and biographical details .
By late afternoon Starbrook is standing behind a subeditor suggesting headlines ( " What about ' SICK PERVERT RUINED MY LIFE ' ? " ) and I have moved on to a story about some film project , caught between an editor who wants me to write it and a PR who does n't .
" It 's not a public event , " the PR says when I ring .
At least , I think , I 'm not doing any harm .
Then I kick a wire under my desk , accidentally unplugging four computers , including mine .
I try to log back on using a succession of passwords suggested by colleagues , eventually locking myself out of the system .
IT has to be called and I decide I have delighted the Hackney Gazette long enough .

Emine Saner :
Veterinary surgeon , £ 30,000
" If you feel faint or queasy , sit on the floor , " says Laura Bowen , one of the vets at Hall Place Veterinary Centre just outside Maidenhead in Berkshire .
Some student vets do , she says , so I should n't feel bad .
I do n't think I 'm squeamish , but now I 'm worried that I 'm going to throw up over the anaesthetised Jack Russell on the table in front of us .
It is about to be spayed and lies on its back , its paws in the air in a parody of a dead dog .
Bowen makes a slice a few inches along the dog's shaved belly ; I stay on my feet .
She puts her fingers inside the dog and pulls until I hear a sickening pop – she was detaching an ovarian ligament – attaches clamps to stem the blood flow , does a bit more snipping and then pulls out the womb and ovaries and spreads them out on the bit of blue paper towel on her steel trolley .
I do n't feel sick ; it is fascinating .
Bowen then stitches up the Jack Russell as neatly as the seams on a wedding dress .
Bowen , 48 , has been a vet for 25 years and has treated everything from elephants and tigers ( castration for them ) to farm animals and pets .
She once operated on a hamster to remove bladder stones , after its owner insisted .
I can understand this – when my guinea pig , Ruby , was ill , I spent more than £ 2,000 on ultrasound scans , x-rays , hysterectomy surgery , and six months of drug treatment .
As a child I wanted to be a vet , as many do ; as an adult , the vet who treated Ruby took on the status of a god to me and I began to seriously wonder whether I had made the wrong choice of career .
Today is spay day .
It takes two nurses to lift a German Shepherd , out cold , a tube down her throat , on to the operating table .
As Bowen gets to work , I notice my tummy is rumbling , then I notice Bowen 's is too .
So does she .
She looks up , scalpel in hand .
" It 's not a very nice thought , but there 's a theory that it 's the carnivore in us , " she says .
" That it 's our body 's reaction to the scent of fresh blood . "
I look at the deep pink liquid spilling around the wound and am troubled ; I 've been vegetarian for 23 years and , even if I was n't , I probably would n't eat a dog .
I spend the rest of the afternoon in the kennels , checking that the dogs are recovering and gently scratching their noses through the bars .
I realise I would have loved to have been a vet , but I doubt that I would have made it – Bowen says you need three science A - levels at A grade , and even that 's not a guarantee you 'll get in to vet school , which is very competitive ( it 's a popular profession and there just are n't enough places to go around ; interestingly the balance of the genders has switched too – once it was overwhelmingly male , now more women are qualifying ) .
If you do get a place , you train for five years .
But what a lovely life – you are around animals all day , and it must be very satisfying to diagnose , operate and cure them .
Bowen clearly loves it .
But what , I ask her , is it like to put an animal down , something I was dreading having to witness ?
" It 's always hard , says Bowen , " but you do it because it 's the right thing for the animal . "

John Crace : University lecturer , up to £ 43,000
" You 'll be great , " says Dr Corinna Wagner , steering me into the largest lecture theatre in Exeter University 's arts faculty .
I 'm not so sure .
The notes on " Humour in literary criticism " I 'd knocked out over the weekend feel horribly inadequate now I 'm facing a virtual full - house of academics and students .
The English department is one of the best in the country – outscoring Oxford and Cambridge at the last research assessment exercise – and I fear this could be the first lecture where the entire audience is better informed than the speaker .
An hour later I 'm done .
Thanks to an extensive pre-coating of anti- perspirant there are no telltale signs of excessive anxiety and the applause at the end goes beyond the mere polite .
The talk has ended up – more or less – at the place where I intended in the allotted time and if I have papered over any cracks in my own argument by keeping the laughs coming regularly , no one seems to mind .
Best of all , Sam North , lecturer in creative writing , invites me back to give another talk – paid this time .
I could get used to this .
But then a university academic was what I always wanted to be – until my time as a postgrad at the LSE in the 80s exposed the fact I just was n't bright enough to make head nor tail of the post - structuralists .
So with what I am convinced is intentional irony , Wagner invites me to watch her deliver her contribution to the following day's 9 am lecture on a " Post - structuralist approach to Keats ' Ode to Autumn " .
It 's an eye - opener .
Not the post - structuralism – nearly 30 years on I 'm none the wiser , though I suspect one of the reasons I always understood so little is because there 's bugger all to understand – but the performance .
Wagner commands the room .
She paces around , waving her arms passionately .
I have n't a clue whether she believes a word of what she 's saying , but she 's so in control of her material that she 's an entirely convincing cultural chameleon .
It 's up to the students to make up their minds about what she 's saying .
Discussing ideas that may or may not be crap ; testing theoretical approaches for the hell of it ; working away at your own research : it 's my idea of heaven , though you need at least a PhD to be in with a shout of a job these days , and now tuition fees have been thoroughly commodified , you 're likely to have to put yourself £ 50 K in debt just to get to the starting line .
" It is a great life , " says Professor Tim Kendall , head of department , " but you do n't want to get too romantic about it .
There is the research excellence framework . . . "
Ah , yes – the spanner in every academic 's life .
Even though the next deadline is more than three years away , the university has already made everyone aware what is expected of them in terms of the cash value of research grants pulled in and the number and quality of journals in which they should have their work published .
With no tenure , any academic who does n't come up to scratch can find themselves out on their ear , so much of an academic 's life is spent filling in grant proposals online .
Towards the end of the day , Wagner takes me to her two - hour seminar on the romantic poets and I get to meet the students close - up .
Some academics grumble that their job would be perfect but for the students , but Wagner 's mob seem agreeable enough .
Sure , one or two appear to regard the two hours as a punishment to be endured before the evening 's fun , but most make impressive efforts to engage with the text .
And then there 's . . . let 's call him B .
The guy is a phenomenon .
Sharp as you like , armed to the teeth with references , steeped in theory , B trades ideas with Wagner and neither gives an inch .
He reminds me of those students at the LSE who helped expose my own ignorance .
I do n't care how you do it , B. Somehow you 've got to find the £ 50 k .
You 're a born academic .
Go and have the career I always wanted .
Hannah Pool : Hairdresser , up to £ 20,000
I spend the day before my work experience at Junior Green Hair and Beauty salon flicking through the pages of Black Hair Magazine for inspiration and worrying about what to wear .
" There 's no uniform as such , but we tend to wear all black , " says Green , when I call him in a fluster .
Of course they do , they 're hairdressers .
I have been fascinated by hair and hairdressing for as long as I can remember .
I suspect it 's because when I was growing up in Manchester I had such hideous experiences at the hands of white hairdressers who did n't have a clue what to do with my afro .
And now , here I am in a smart Knightsbridge salon run by the award - winning hairdresser Junior Green and his partner ( in both senses ) Joy Miller .
With 40 years of hairdressing experience between them , their mission is to provide a West End hairdressing experience at a reason - able price for those with afro hair .
My day starts with colourist Janet Xisto showing me how to apply highlights .
" I 'm not that keen on cutting and blowdrying , but I love the challenge of colour , " says Xisto , who got into hairdressing at 15 , via the traditional route of a Saturday job , before going to hair college and working part - time at a salon .
Xisto shows me how to apply the correct amount of colour and wrap the hair carefully in tinfoil .
Before I can do any serious damage , I 'm whisked off to Nadine Haynes , at the back , to learn the art of giving a good shampoo .
" Massage the scalp , " says Haynes , while showing me how to hold my hands .
" Do n't use your nails , use the cushion of your fingertips . "
I try asking the client about her holidays in a bid to distract from my poor shampooing technique .
I 'm hoping we 'll move from holiday chat to salacious gossip , but it does n't happen .
Often quoted as the happiest profession , hairdressers are personal stylists , therapists and confidantes , rolled into one .
But I think you have to be able to give a decent shampoo before anyone tells you their secrets .
Green calls me over to a woman who is having a Rihanna - inspired haircut .
He shows me how to hold the scissors properly ( using my thumb and third finger ) and I feel as if I have hit the big time .
Under his watchful eye , I cut tentatively and try not to panic when hair falls on the floor .
Moments later I 'm sweeping the hair off the floor , and figuring out how many shampoos it would take before I could have my own Knightsbridge salon .
If I could skip the years of bad pay and working my way up , I 'd be tempted to give it a go .
Maxton Walker : Special effects artist , £ 20,000
Watching Jon Pertwee 's features magically melting into those of Tom Baker in Doctor Who : Planet of the Spiders is one of my earliest and most formative memories , so I can't quite believe what 's happening on an unseasonably mild November morning in central London .
" Here 's the script for the Christmas Day episode , " says Will Cohen , head of TV at the Mill visual effects company in central London .
" Read it and have a think about how you 'd tackle the effects . "
I hunker down on a sofa , almost too excited to concentrate .
I and my colleagues for the day – 60 " cool nerds " overwhelmingly in their 20s and 30s – are crammed together in a surprisingly dark and stuffy attic , working on the special effects for various television projects .
Jabberwoks , dragons and Tardises are lurching , snarling and spinning on the banks of PCs running an array of specialist software with names such as Maya , Shake and Nuke .
I 'm intrigued by an early scene in my script where John Simm 's The Master makes his entrance in a " vortex of light " .
In an editing suite , Marie Jones , the producer responsible for ensuring Doctor Who 's digital effects are up to scratch and finished on time , loads up an early edit of the scene ; one put together before the effects have been added .
The actual shot is almost finished ; it took various artists at the Mill a combined total of 90 days on their computers to put together the vortex .
The artists use specialist software to create the vortex and then the actors ' movements have to be painstakingly mapped out on the computer so the streams of light can interact with them .
( Nearly 1,200 working days went into the digital effects for the final two David Tennant episodes that were shown over Christmas . )
Marie admits that her job is essentially managing a hugely complex logistical task .
I feel I 'm more the obsessive artist / nerd type , so after lunch I hook up with Simon Wicker , who , on the computer , " paints " backgrounds of alien planets and other scenery , on to which the actors are later placed .
I 'm not so much envious of him as murderously jealous – he stole the life I was supposed to have .
A life - long Doctor Who obsessive and Star Wars fan , Wicker worked on the effects of Gladiator .
After they won an Oscar for the Mill , he was hired to work on the new Star Wars films – " I thought it was a wind - up when they first called " – and went to the US .
When he returned , the new Doctor Who was just starting up .
" I 'd knocked off one of my obsessions , so I thought I should tackle another , " he says .
Is it too late for me to change career ?
Maybe not .
Cohen says that London is in such demand as a centre for CG effects that he can't hire enough good people .
Many do specialist courses – at places such as computer animation school Escape Studios – before spending a couple of years as " runners " .
It is not completely unheard of , though , for people just to start at the bottom and work their way up – you can learn on the job .
While we 're taking pictures , I chat with Marie and correct her over a plot point .
The photographer looks at me in horror .
" Jesus , " she says .
" You know more about Doctor Who than the people who make it . "
Maybe there 's such a thing as being too obsessed .
Amy Fleming : Landscape gardener , up to £ 20,000
" Working with seasons and life cycles , " says " Capability " Chris O'Donoghue , gazing out at the dew rising from the fields , " you feel deeply aware that we 're all part of the same thing .
Ending up back in the earth seems natural rather than scary . "
I only arrived half an hour ago , but already some of the assumptions I have made about gardening for a living , while having been cooped up in an office for the past 14 years , have been validated .
It 's not only good for your body , it also soothes your soul .
I am spending a day helping O'Donoghue to maintain the grounds of a small estate in East Sussex .
A former potter , he started gardening professionally six years ago , when his work as a freelance model and mould - maker began to dry up .
He placed an ad in the local paper and got work immediately , so quickly learned the ropes by studying gardening books ( his top recommendation is Nicola Ferguson 's Right Plant , Right Place ) .
He now has three Chelsea Flower Shows under his belt where , just shy of a gold , he won two silver - gilt medals and one silver .
There is to be no gentle planting for me today .
I am sent up in a cherry picker – a crazy portable lift on a spindly looking hydraulic boom – armed with a pair of secateurs to prune the wisteria that has gone ballistic around the third floor windows .
Every time I lean over to grab bits of the plant , I feel the picker wobble in the wind .
I am terrified , but the view is stunning from up here .
Next , I am moved on to the leaf blower , which consists of a petrol engine strapped on your back and a fat hose .
At first it 's fun – I feel like a ghostbuster !
But an hour later I 'm bored .
No matter how hard I try , I can't make the leaves behave and , in any case , the trees are shedding them faster than I can blow them .
Come tea-time , we decamp to O'Donoghue 's workshop so I can look at his garden designs over tea and biscuits .
I zone out a little , suddenly feeling shattered .
I go home still in love with the idea of being a gardener , but O'Donoghue 's job is largely solitary , and to imagine myself in his shoes full - time is to imagine a world impossibly quiet .
Gardening will have to remain a hobby for the time being .
• This item was amended on 6 January 2010 .
The original named the gardener as Chris O'Donohughe .
This has been corrected .
Steve Chamberlain : Plumber , up to £ 21,000
Like most middle - aged men who have ever assembled an Ikea bookcase or fixed a dripping tap by turning it off really hard , I have long harboured fantasies of jacking it all in and getting a proper job – the kind with a toolbox and a van to cart it around in .
So I 'm giving plumbing a go .
I 'm doing a bathroom in east London and my mentor for the day is Rick from Roman Baths who says he sort of drifted into the game .
One look at his tiling tells me I 'm in the hands of a master and there wo n't be any drifting today .
The first thing I have to deal with though is tea – or rather my dislike of it .
Rick has a whole bucket of equipment for making it , rather like a mobile Starbucks , and it sees a lot of action through the day .
" No tea ? " he says suspiciously .
" Are you sure ?
Well it 's straight to work then . "
OK , so hand me my blowtorch and some copper piping and let 's finish this sucker so we can get down to some serious white van -driving . . .
Actually no ,
Rick wo n't let me loose on anything that might leak : it 's tiling for me .
I 've seen the videos in B&Q , so this should be easy enough : slather adhesive all over the place and put some grooves in with a special tool .
" Never take any notice of those DIY videos , " warns Rick .
" They assume you 're working in the perfect house .
In the real world you 're never the master .
Look at this wall : it 's all over the place , it bows in and out , bulges everywhere .
All that has to be overcome . "
So begins a long morning of unlearning the little I thought I knew about tiling – it 's painstaking and fiddly work .
But at least you can earn good money .
I 've seen all the ads for courses that promise a plumber 's salary of £ 50,000 a year .
What could I expect starting out , I ask , as a plumber 's mate , say ?
" Maybe £ 50 a day .
More experience might see you to £ 120 a day , " says Rick .
More experience means an NVQ at a local college or an independent training organisation .
Eventually we break for lunch – only half an hour though .
Sometimes Rick says he does n't take one at all .
Damn , this is proper work , with heavy lifting and everything .
And then there 's all the tea drinking on top of that .
I 'm not so sure I can handle this after all .
I got my mega fucking cool gift today .
When I got the package from the mail room I was excited , and yet completely unprepared for the surge of raw awesomeness that flowed out as soon as I opened the box .
Enclosed was a letter listing the contents .
I have reproduced the letter below :

Who says biology , engineering , and medicine are different fields ?
Researchers led by Dr. Donald Ingber at Harvard ’s Wyss Institute reported in Science that they have engineered a coin - sized microchip that can be loaded with wet biological cells , mimicking the workings of an actual lung .
The bioinspired chip can be used to model drug action , determine the effects of environmental toxins , and could even replace some animal testing – all while speeding up research and dropping its costs .
To mimic the physiology of an actual lung , the chip contains two chambers separated by a flexible , porous membrane .
One chamber contains human lung cells ( alveoli ) , which are tiny air sacs with thin walls – this chamber allows researchers to introduce foreign particles , just as breathing would do in an organism .
Across the membrane , the second chamber contains capillary blood cells ( endothelium ) which normally take up particles into the blood stream , as well as interface the immune system with potential toxins and pathogens .
The computer chip is transparent , which allows real - time observation of how the cells respond to introduced particles .
Did I mention it also breathes ?
Because the chip is flexible , fluctuating the air pressure within a network of channels along its surface can replicate the mechanics of breathing – stretching and expanding the cells inside the chambers , roughly as they would in real life .
This capacity for the chip to mimic breathing is an important step forward , because cell culture techniques are unable to replicate how mechanical factors influence cell behavior .
Filling this gap brings laboratory models closer to the real - world organs they try to represent .
Think of it as a miniature version of the donated lungs made to breathe outside the body .
Check out this video of lead researcher Donald Ingber talking about the chip :
Researchers ’ first test of the lung - chip looked at how the system responded to the introduction of a pathogen .
E. coli was added to the first chamber containing lung cells , mimicking the exposure of lungs to airborne bacteria .
The second chamber was given a healthy dose of white blood cells ( leukocytes ) , which are the immune system ’s first line of defense against foreign invaders .
Show time .
Through the transparent chip , researchers watched in real time as the white blood cells migrated across the porous membrane , engulfing and killing the bacterial invaders .
The chip clearly modeled the body ’s own inflammatory response to pathogens .
A second test looked at how the lung - chip responded to the introduction of nanoparticles comparable to those found in toxic pollutants .
Some of the particles induced an immune response and were trapped ; others crossed the chip ’s membrane and entered the blood chamber .
Using the chip to model the introduction of non-biological particles illustrates how some toxins can make their way past the immune system and invade the body .
It also provides an excellent system to test how airborne drugs are taken up into the lungs , which will cut costs and save time in the development of inhaled medications .
The next step ?
Currently , the cells used come from immortalized cell lines , which are n’t patient - specific and only provide a kind of average response to different drugs .
If the lung - chip could be loaded with “ primary ” cells from an individual patient , testing could determine individual responses to potential drug action .
Induced pluripotent stem cells , which can be derived from a patient ’s skin , could be stimulated into alveoli and endothelium cells and provide a personalized lung - chip for specific testing .
This would fit well into the larger movement towards patient - specific medicine .
The lung - chip is n’t quite ready for broad application yet – it still needs to be cross -compared with current methods of testing inhalant effects , which use rats as experimental organisms .
If these comparisons show that the chip accurately mimics a normal lung , it could eventually mean an end to animal testing for this type of research .
In addition to the obvious win for animal rights folks , the chip would save time and money by replacing costly animal research .
Future research will plan to apply comparable techniques to other organs of the body – a gut - chip , kidney - chip , heart - chip , etc .
This will help us understand how drugs and toxins effect the body more broadly .
Imagine having a series of personalized chips for all your different organs – your doctors could custom - test any potential treatment against miniature models of your own body .
The computer / body interface is already being explored with chips that can detect cancer or identify bacterial strains within the body ; the lung - chip represents an exciting new application of this hybrid technology outside the body .
It ’s worth recognizing how exciting the Wyss Institute itself is .
Founded last year by Ingber himself , the institute is devoted to biologically - inspired engineering : figuring out mother nature ’s tricks , and replicating them in man -made systems .
The faculty list reads like a who ’s - who of biology ( George Church and James Collins , to name a few ) and if this research is any indication , we can expect more exciting research from this group in the future .
As it stands , the lung - chip is an amazing example of how biology is creating new frontiers in engineering : an impressive reminder of the sort of human - machine interface that represents the future of medicine , and potentially ourselves .

The Sunday Times has disclosed that the Conservative Party filmed pre-election cinema advertisements that portrayed a gay couple , in a shower “ coming out ” as Conservative among racy series with references to pornography and teenage pregnancy but were never shown .
The newspaper claims that the advertisements cost £ 100,000 to make , while others say they cost between £ 300,000 and £ 500,000 .
The films that were produced by advertising agency Euro RSCG reportedly included one particularly aimed at the gay community .
It showed two “ good - looking ” young men in a sports changing room shower .
One says “ It feels so right .
I am going to tell everyone . ”
According to the Sunday Times , the other then puts a hand to his friend ’s mouth as part of an embrace and replies “ I think I am too . ”
The camera then pans around to reveal the two men ’s team - mates looking on “ in horror ” , a Vote Conservative slogan is then revealed .
The advertisement was to be one of a series linked to “ I ’ve never voted Tory before ” billboard campaigns that were criticised for being rather bland and then mimicked with spoofs across the internet .
Another advertisement that was abandoned began with an Asian teenage boy appearing to be “ furtively ” looking at pornography , which is then revealed to be Conservative Party literature .
His mother expresses horror at the discovery and asks her husband what the neighbours would think .
A third advertisement makes references to teenage pregnancy with a girl confessing to her parents “ I am three months Conservative . ”
Her father blames the girl ’s boyfriend for her conversion to the Tory cause .
A Conservative Party insider told the newspaper : “ The ads are all very clever and much more imaginative and funnier than anything that they put out during the election campaign .
“ They were designed to appeal to voters who would not have thought of backing the Tories in the past .
However , the risk with these ads was that they might have alienated more traditional core supporters . ”
A spokesman for the party explained why they were never shown : “ At any one time there are always various ideas at different stages of development on the table , many of which do n’t end up being used . ”
The cost of the advertisements did not need to be declared to the Electoral Commission because they were never used .
The Sunday Times said they cost £ 100,000 to make , while ConservativeHome claims they cost £ 300,000 and the Spectator ’s Fraser Nelson said the party spent £ 500,000 on unused advertisements .

Citizens of British Columbia who have been crying out for government transparency can now uncork the champagne .
After years of access to government information eroding in a culture of secrecy and gutted freedom of information laws , we finally have something to celebrate .
Last week , journalist Sean Holman posted a link on his Web site to the B.C. Public Service Executive Role Profile .
This document is part of the job description for senior civil servants and it is as transparent a government document as you are ever likely to see .
It comes right out and says that the government considers it part of the job of senior bureaucrats to fabricate crises in order to advance policy .
How ’s that for laying it on the line ?
Here ’s exactly what it says under the “ Characteristics / Behaviours ” section of the role profile : “ Executives anticipate , and are prepared to institute change quickly .
At times , to capitalize on the best opportunity , executives create a crisis to force change . ”
Naomi Klein’s
The Shock Doctrine is a book all about political and economic exploitation of disasters like September 11 and Hurricane Katrina .
Political exploitation of crisis is apparently such standard operating procedure that President Barack Obama ’s advisor Rahm Emanuel has blandly stated , “ You never want a serious crisis to go to waste . ”
But thanks to the B.C. government ’s New Transparency , we see the cutting - edge innovation of actually manufacturing the crisis .
And we further learn that opportunistic crisis - creation is not despicable .
In fact , it is a vocation reserved for the selflessly brave , as we see in the document under the somber header “ Are You Courageous Enough ? ” which follows : “ Positive opportunism , instituting change and creating crisis involves a high level of risk and risk taking .
Executives are prepared to take these risks , have the courage to move forward , and acknowledge the ultimate consequence if they do not succeed . ”
Let ’s not get too caught up in the Tony Soprano talk about “ ultimate consequences ” ; it ’s the fabricated crises and “ positive opportunism ” that is the main point .
Nobody accuses the public of being insufficiently cynical about politicians .
Voting rates alone tell a sorry tale .
We might be forgiven for trusting in the civil service though .
Up until we read the B.C. Public Service Executive Role Profile , we thought we were worldly and urbane because we expected senior government bureaucrats to be well - versed in damage control .
Turns out we were a bunch of hayseeds .
Damage control ?
Try damage creation !
Thanks to the New Transparency , we now know how truly cynical to be .
And we are grateful for this enlightenment , as there is always a certain grisly satisfaction in having our lowest surmises confirmed .
But we ca n’t help but feel just a touch depressed too .
When we think about what it means to live in a democracy , we think about voting and fundamental freedoms and the separation of powers .
It ’s been a while since it ’s been fashionable to include ethics and trust on the list , let alone truth .
At the risk of sounding hopelessly retro , this is not good .
Our spin culture has now spun so far out of control that the effective functioning of our democracy is seriously damaged .
Simply put , the big idea with democracy is that the citizens are the rulers , and we rule ourselves through our governments and we make our decisions about government based on information .
The whole system falls down if we have no information , only infomercials and fabricated crises .
That we have a government that is blatantly advertising for crisis - fabricators to head up the civil service should give us very serious concern .
Civil servants deserve respect and citizens deserve the truth .
We call on the government of British Columbia to leave off crisis - creation and attend to the real crisis of democracy that has become only too apparent .
Micheal Vonn is the policy director for the B.C. Civil Liberties Association .

Facing a worse - than - expected outlook for US growth and unemployment , the Federal Reserve has floated the idea of new measures to spur economic recovery , according to minutes published Wednesday .
Details from the Fed ’s latest rate - setting meeting , held in June , showed the central bank expected US growth to slow to 3.0 - 3.5 percent this year , well down from previous estimates .
ADVERTISEMENT
Noting that the recovery continued at a “ moderate pace , ” members of the Federal Open Market Committee — which sets interest rates — said that a worsening outlook could prompt debate over further stimulus .
“ The committee would need to consider whether further policy stimulus might become appropriate if the outlook were to worsen appreciably , ” the minutes said .
The Fed also raised its end - of - year unemployment forecast to 9.2-9.5 percent , predicting the troubled labor market would recover more slowly than expected .

Schoolgirl 's skin erupts in blisters as she suffers allergic reaction to the sun on plane home from family holiday
After a sun-drenched family holiday , schoolgirl Phoebe Richards was looking forward to showing off her glowing tan back home .
Instead , on the flight home , the 17 - year - old 's skin erupted in gruesome plum - sized blisters on her chest and arm .
Phoebe spent up to five hours a day in the sun as temperatures in Portugal climbed to almost 100f ( 38 c ) .
Patched up : Phoebe Richards is on the mend after suffering an allergic reaction to the sun , air conditioning and cabin pressure on her flight home
Horrific holiday snaps : Phoebe Richards shows her painful blisters caused by an allergic reaction to the sun
The A - level student said she plastered her fair skin with factor 15 - 20 sun cream and stayed out of the sun in the middle of the day .
By the end of the fortnight she had a golden tan , but then the blisters erupted on the return flight .
' I was a little bit burnt anyway , so maybe the pressure on the plane made my skin weep and then it formed these blisters , ' she said .
Upset : Phoebe was distressed when her skin erupted in blisters after a family holiday in Portugal
' When you just want to be brown you just stay in the sun .
Because I had n't been on holiday for so long I just wanted a nice tan .
' We did n't really go out in the sun between 12 and 4 pm because it was too hot but I probably spent about four to five hours in the sun each day . '
Phoebe , from Clevedon , near Bristol , and her boyfriend , Olli , 18 , had joined her parents , Trudi and David , her sister Lydia , 19 , and Lydia 's boyfriend for a week in a villa in Carvoeiro on the Algarve .
After her family flew home , the teenager and her boyfriend then spent a second week on the Portuguese coast .
Back home , doctors confirmed that the blisters were severe sunburn and Phoebe was given compression bandages to try to prevent scarring .
But they warned that she could suffer permanent marks .
' I 've got two blisters on my arm and one on my chest , ' she said .
' I 'm just glad it 's not my face . '
She warned other girls about the dangers of staying out in the sun .
Clare O'Connor , head of suncare research and development at Boots , said cases like Phoebe 's were generally due to using sun cream with the wrong sun protection factor and UVA protection for your skin , and failing to reapply it regularly .
ESPN ’s ESPY

Remember when JT smelled David Beckham ’s foot in 2008 ?
Or when Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly teamed up to give their hysterical list of demands for hosting ?
( “ I want Harry Caray riding Mike Ditka at my kid ’s birthday party . ” )
But this clip of Dinner for Schmucks costars Steve Carell and Paul Rudd spoofing Lebron James ’

We are hoping to find work that represents Detroit ’s radical past , ideally with an aesthetic that would allow it to fall into the category of art , ha .
The piece need not necessarily be your own , it may be an old poster , print or photo from your personal collection .
Pertinent art might connect to one or more of the following :
proves another Detroit ’s been happening
honors those who came before us
illustrates unique Detroit self sufficiency / survival solutions
shows the circular motion of revolution
Deadline for submissions June 11 , 2010 .
Email trumbullplex@yahoo.com with size and photo(s ) of your contribution
Partial opening June 13th , 2010 in collaboration w/ Trumbullplex Cafe II
Official opening June 21st $ 1.00 Soul( stice ) Party
AMC / USSF Stencil Mural Creation with Just Seeds Date TBA
Another Detroit‘s Been Happening !
From the moment we are born , there is movement –especially in Detroit .
Our story is unique and our revolving collective history is a map to finding connections to one another .
This city has a long history of inspired radical activism and at the Trumbullplex we feel activism should be expressive , it should be creative and poetic .
It should be art .
The US Social Forum ’s slogan has been Another World is Possible !
Another US is Necessary !.
Detroit ’s version is Another Detroit ’s been happening !
As consistently as Detroit has been referred to as The city in a prolonged state of emergency , the emergence of exciting alternatives and resistance to the status quo have been equally present .
In Detroit we ’ve been making a lot out of what we ’ve been given .
This means that we have to take a lot of shit …we also take some shit when we need to .
For 17 years the Trumbullplex has existed under the banner of the black flag , making it an easy target for ridicule and misunderstanding .
We admit we ‟re not ideally run .
What bonds us is our will to embrace big ideas like appreciation for those who came before us , people organizing themselves and taking chances .
In the Trumbullplex community space during the Allied Media Conference , United States Social Forum and New World From Below Collective Convergence , we‟ll attempt to draw out just some of the connections between current Detroit efforts and our past .
Even if we curate a superbly flawed show , we hope it will leave a lot of space for the viewer , listener , observer etc. to insert their own experiences and questions .
With your help , the art will demonstrate why Detroit should indeed be of interest to the country .
Detroit has been the recognizable canary in the coal mine , giving warning signals that the conditions are dangerous , actually “ ground zero ” .
With a past to back it up , our city should also be understood as a place of emerging solutions and creative ideas for how to overcome some struggles we all face .

The PV sector has seen its share of market turbulence over the past years with the impacts of the global downturn , the over - supplied silicon market and the impact of revisions to feed - in tariffs all taking their toll .
However , despite this , the sector appears to have emerged relatively unscathed .
David Appleyard reports .
According to the latest market analysis , the global solar photovoltaic ( PV ) electricity market saw about 7.2 GW of new capacity installed in 2009 , bringing the total global installed capacity to more than 22 GW worldwide .
Crucially , the industry itself , through the European Photovoltaic Industry Association ( EPIA ) , identifies this growth as ‘ the most important annual capacity increase ever ’ which it says is particularly impressive in light of the difficult financial circumstances seen over the past year .
Furthermore , in 2010 , global cumulative installed PV capacity is expected to grow by at least 40 % , while the annual growth is expected to increase by more than 15 % .
Much of this growth is anticipated to be seen in Europe , which remains the leading market for PV technology .
Indeed , during 2009 , Germany remained the largest market globally – with Italy ranking second – and will most likely remain the largest market in 2010 , EPIA believes , with a cumulative installed capacity of almost 10 GW , including around 3.8 GW installed in 2009 , according to the numbers given by the German Bundesnetzagentur .
This represents almost a doubling of the 2002 MW installed in 2008 and is attributable , in part , to the improved project economics resulting from the decline in module prices .
However , this growth has caused the German government to pursue an additional mid-year cut in incentives in 2010 above and beyond what was already scheduled and these recently announced feed - in tariff cuts are expected to significantly affect the development of Germany ’s national industry in the longer term .
The country is nonetheless expected to remain the single largest market for PV in 2010 .
Meanwhile , in the medium term , Italy appears as one of the most promising markets with an additional capacity of some 730 MW installed in 2009 , more than doubling from 2008 ’s 338 MW .
The country ’s strong incentives and good solar resources should help the market stay strong in 2010 , US trade group the Solar Energy Industry Association ( SEIA ) says , referring to both the high levels of solar irradiation , and the new Conto Energia law , which is due to be announced as REW goes to press , and which is expected to support strong momentum in the Italian market .
Elsewhere in Europe , the Czech Republic shows significant growth in 2009 , with 411 MW installed .
Though the country ranked fifth in installations , it installed more new PV per capita ( roughly 40 watts per person ) than any country except Germany in 2009 .
The massive growth , from just over 50 MW in 2008 , was due to the country ’s generous US $ 0.63 / kWh solar incentives .
However , this rapid ramp - up in solar capacity has , like Germany , prompted a reduction in its feed - in tariff payments – which are seen as overly generous – and the market is expected to shrink significantly in 2011 after another year of strong growth in 2010 .
‘ This underlines the imperative need for support mechanisms to be designed in a way to ensure a long term , predictable and sustainable development of the market and avoid instability and discontinuity in market evolution , ’ explained Adel El Gammal , secretary general of EPIA .
Belgium also made its entry into the top 10 markets in 2009 , with 292 MW of new PV capacity installed over the year .
Due to a revision of the financial support scheme early 2010 , the market is , however , expected to slow down slightly in 2010 .
France follows with 185 MW installed in 2009 , with an additional 100 MW installed but not connected to the grid yet .
In spite of a huge potential , this clearly demonstrates the importance for France to solve grid connection issues in order to allow the market to develop , EPIA believes .
In Spain , after rocketing past Germany to become the largest PV market in 2008 , a drastic reduction in incentives pushed installations down to 180 MW in new PV and CSP capacity for 2009 , compared to 2710 MW in 2008 .
Even so , PV accounted for about 3 % of the electricity production in the country in 2009 .
Finally , Greece , Portugal and the UK are showing interesting potential for growth in 2010 and beyond , EPIA says .
Asia Could Become a Major Demand Centre
Outside Europe , Japan has succeeded in positioning itself as the third largest market with 484 MW installed in 2009 .
While edging out the US for third place in annual capacity additions , the Japanese market also shows an important growth potential thanks to favourable political support , the industry believes .
Certainly , after two stagnant years , Japan has recovered to have its best year ever with the resurgence driven in part by falling equipment costs and in part by new incentives ( roughly US$ 0.80 per watt ) that went into effect in January 2009 .
EPIA expects Japan to become a GW market in 2010 under a policy - driven scenario and by 2012 even in the moderate scenario , with ambitious objectives to reach 28 GW of installed PV power by 2020 and 53 GW by 2030 .
Both China and India also made headlines in 2009 when they independently announced plans to expand their solar power capacities to 20 GW each by 2020 .
A major PV manufacturer , China was until recently almost totally absent from the world PV market , but with more than 12 GW of large projects in the pipeline , it could rapidly become a major market .
With high irradiation levels and a surge in the electricity demand , the potential for PV in China is huge and depends mainly on government ’s decisions .
According to the national energy plan of 2009 , cumulative installed PV power is forecast to reach 20 GW at least in 2020 .
Meanwhile , with India ’s increasing electricity demand and high irradiation levels , the country has definitively a huge potential for PV .
Starting from a low 30 MW installed in 2009 , it could grow to 1.5 GW in 2014 under a policy - driven scenario , EPIA believes , and probably well beyond afterwards .
The market size in 2010 will clearly depend on the political choices to possibly reach between 50 MW and 300 MW .
If these plans move forward , Asia will become a major demand centre for solar energy equipment after several years of expanding manufacturing capacity and both markets are expected to boom in the next five years .
Canada and Australia also showed significant market development in 2009 and are expected to open the way to the development of new markets .
Brazil , Mexico , Morocco and South Africa are also seen as promising countries , the trade groups suggest .
The US Sector Takes Off and Looks Set to Grow
In the US , the market has finally taken off , with around 475 MW installed in 2009 , and appears as a potentially leading market for the coming years .
Both new installations and employment figures rose , with the total US capacity from both PV and CSP technologies climbing past 2 GW during 2009 .
Solar industry revenues also surged despite the economy , says the SEIA , climbing 36 % in 2009 with a doubling in size of the residential PV market .
In another sign of continued optimism identified by the SEIA , venture capitalists invested more in solar technologies than any other clean technology in 2009 .
In total , $ 1.4 billion in venture capital flowed to solar companies in 2009 .
For an industry that had a total US volume of roughly $ 4 billion , this signals huge optimism about near - term growth , the trade group says .
This investment is supported by the solar provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) , which got off to a slow start but continues to ease the pressures of the credit crisis .
As of early February 2010 , more than 46 MW of solar capacity has been deployed with the help of Treasury grants totaling $ 81 million in lieu of the investment tax credit ( ITC ) .
Representing more than $ 271 million in solar energy investment , the 13 solar thermal and 169 solar electric projects receiving the grant are spread over 30 states .
Solar equipment manufacturers have also been awarded $ 600 million in manufacturing tax credits under ARRA , representing investments in new and upgraded factories of more than $ 2 billion .
The grant created by ARRA reduces the need for tax equity partners and significantly lowers the transaction costs for a solar project .
The PV industry managed to maintain growth in 2009 despite difficulties in the housing and construction sectors and cumulative grid -tied capacity sailed past the 1 GW mark by installing 429 MW .
An estimated 40 MW of off - grid capacity was also added .
However , year - over - year growth in annual grid - tied capacity additions of 38 % fell short of the 84 % growth seen in 2008 , SEIA says .
Notable growth came in the utility sector which nearly tripled from 22 MW in 2008 to 66 MW in 2009 .
Residential installations were also buoyed by the removal of the $ 2000 cap on the ITC , more than doubling volume from 78 MW in 2008 to 156 MW in 2009 .
However , 2009 marked a second year of major price declines for PV modules , with US prices falling to $ 1.85 –$ 2.25 per watt from $ 3.50 –$ 4.00 per watt in mid-2008 , a drop of over 40 % , the SEIA observes .
With module prices accounting for up to half of the installed cost of a PV system , these prices are beginning to put downward pressure on system prices .
Indeed , average installed cost fell roughly 10 % from 2008 to 2009 , despite the large shift to the more labour - intensive residential installations .
In the US , residential and commercial rooftop installations are expected to remain strong and utility - scale PV is expected to grow significantly , with more than 6000 MW in announced projects in the pipeline .
And , although solar energy continues to account for less than 1 % of US energy supply , its contribution is expected to rise dramatically in the coming years as costs continue to decline making it more competitive in more states .
National requirements will effectively mandate some 9 GW of solar capacity by 2025 , the SEIA reports .
Furthermore , when compared to the high cost of generation in places like Hawaii , where most electricity is generated with oil , solar energy is looking increasingly attractive .
A Bright Future for PV ?
Given the economic turmoil of the previous year or so , it is perhaps surprising to see analysis firms such as iSuppli Corp , dramatically upgrade forecasts for installations of PV systems in 2010 .
A surge of sales in Germany combined with plunging prices are set to boost solar demand in 2010 , iSuppli predicts , arguing that solar installations will rise to 13.6 GW in 2010 , up 93.6 % from 7 GW in 2009 .
The company ’s previous forecast , released in February , outlined its expectations for 8.3 GW worth of installations in 2010 , up 64 % from 2009 .
The strong rise in PV installations in 2010 will be driven by robust market conditions in the second and fourth quarters , which will more than compensate for slower performances in the first and third quarters , iSuppli predicts .
‘ This will be an up and down year for PV installations ’ , said Henning Wicht , director and principal analyst for PV at iSuppli .
‘ The first quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by winter conditions , likely causing a decline in installations compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 .
However , the second quarter is expected to be a blockbuster for the global PV industry ’ , Wicht added , explaining : ‘ Reduced feed - in tariffs in Germany are coming in July and consumers in that country will rush to install PV systems before that incentive becomes less compelling .
A market correction will happen in the third quarter , leading to a huge fourth quarter due to the approach of other countries ’ FIT deadlines in January 2011 . ’
In addition to the FIT deadlines , growth in the second half of the year will be driven by reductions in the cost of solar installations .
‘ Plummeting prices for solar panels during 2009 now are being reflected in system prices ’ , Wicht observed , noting : ‘ These price declines will compensate for the FIT reductions , resulting in a favourable return on investment ( ROI ) for homeowners and project developers .
In some cases , the ROI will remain higher than 10 % . ’
‘ Needless to say , these quarterly ups and downs in 2010 will result in a difficult year for the PV supply chain and production planners as they struggle to figure out how much is needed , where it is needed and when is it needed , ’ Wicht concluded , saying : ‘ Because of this , there could be material supply constraints during the year .
Spot shortages of inverters , and perhaps panels , could curtail growth to some degree . ’
According to EPIA , the global PV market could reach between 8.2 GW and 12.7 GW of new installations assuming a moderate scenario and a policy driven scenario , respectively , and would represent a growth of 40 % and 60 % of the overall cumulative installed capacity compared to 2009 for the two scenarios .
In a policy - driven scenario , the global annual PV market could reach up to 30 GW in 2014 – based on favourable conditions established by policy makers , regulators and the energy sector at large , the group contends .
Announced worldwide PV production capacity would also be sufficient to cover the expected evolution of the market in the coming five years , EPIA says .
As evidenced in the EPIA SET For 2020 study , PV could provide up to 12 % of the EU ’s electricity demand by 2020 , provided specific boundary conditions are met , and could be competitive with other electricity sources in as much as 76 % of the EU electricity market by 2020 , even in the absence of any form of external price support or subsidy .
In the current pre-competitive phase , PV market deployment is , to a large extent , dependent on the political framework of any given country .
Support mechanisms are defined in national laws .
The introduction , modification or fading out of such support schemes have profound consequences on PV markets and industries .
‘ In addition to the ramp - up of many markets in Europe , the development and opening of new markets in Asia , the Americas and Africa is paving the way to a strong and sustainable momentum of PV powered supply solutions all around the world ’ , concluded Ingmar Wilhelm , the newly appointed president of EPIA .
However , looking ahead to 2011 , there could be more supply constraints , according to iSuppli ’s analysis of capacity announcements .
The company believes that unless additional expansions take place , crystalline - Silicon ( c - Si ) modules could encounter constraints in 2011 with utilization rates for c - Si module production facilities anticipated to climb to more than 90 % in 2010 .
Nonetheless , iSuppli also believes that despite the short - term supply challenges , the outlook for global PV installations remains bright .
By 2011 , global PV installations will rise to 20.3 GW , nearly triple the 7 GW in 2009 .
Rights groups are not optimistic that companies hard - hit by the global recession will be willing to allow their interns to work fewer hours or pay them more , although a labour standards bureau in Ibaraki Prefecture , north of Tokyo , has this week indicated that it will recognise the death of a Chinese man in June 2008 as having been caused by overwork .

The actor : Rob Huebel started performing comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater in New York alongside Paul Scheer , Rob Riggle , Rob Corddry , and Ed Helms .
He ’s still connected to those comedy pals , though his network has grown .
Perhaps best known for his role on MTV’s Human Giant , the reliably hilarious Huebel has appeared in just about every funny TV and film project over the last few years , including The Office , Curb Your Enthusiasm , and Party Down .
He was one of the leads on Corddry ’s web series Childrens Hospital , currently being adapted for Adult Swim :
The repurposed webisodes begin airing July 11 , with a second season coming August 22 .

Childrens Hospital ( 2008 - 2010 ) — “ Dr. Owen Maestro ”
Rob Huebel : I was n’t involved with the initial conception of it .
Rob Corddry and David Wain thought it up .
I think it was during the strike that they were kicking around the idea .
I was brought into it afterward , because they wanted someone on the show that any normal living female would want to have sex with , and I fit the part , so … [ Laughs . ]

The A.V. Club :
Your part is sort of reminiscent of other parts you play — the kind of cocky - but - oblivious dude .
Did they write the part with you in mind ?
RH : That ’s a great question , and I ’m not sure I know the answer .
Let me take a second .
I have to shift into interview mode here , sorry ; I was in lunch mode .
I was just eating barbecue pork down here in Baton Rouge , Louisiana .

AVC : What are you filming ?
RH : We ’re shooting this movie down here called Flypaper .
It ’s Jeffrey Tambor , Tim Blake Nelson , and McDreamy , you know , Patrick Dempsey , and Ashley Judd .
It ’s this crazy bank - heist movie where basically two sets of bank robbers show up at the exact same moment to rob the same bank .
And I ’m like the asshole assistant manager of the bank , and I get taken hostage right away .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : Do you guys call him McDreamy on the set ?
RH : I call him McDreamy , or Dream , or Dreamboat , or Dreams - A - Lot .
He ’s actually the nicest guy in the world .
Let me get back to the Childrens Hospital thing .
I think the whole idea behind doing that project was that they got some money from Warner Brothers , from the WB , to do this thing .
And it was really “ Let ’s get all our friends together and just make this thing . ”
Because at the time , it was just for the Internet .
It was n’t for TV .
It became this dream project .
So many funny people , and great guest spots and stuff — Nick Offerman , all these super - fun people .
Advertisement
AVC : Does any particular memory or day of shooting stand out ?
RH : Well , pretty much every day on set , you knew you were going to be making out with somebody .
I think I ’ve made out with all the women on the show ; I think Ken Marino and I have made out .
Maybe we did n’t even film that , we just made out for fun .
[ Laughs . ]
We did this one scene — it ’s a really serious scene — and Megan Mullally is the chief of the hospital .
So she calls all of the doctors into the emergency room and gives us this big speech , and she goes , “ Now go out there and save some lives . ”
And then , one by one , she comes up to each of us , and just like , frenches us , full - on .
It ’s so unnatural .
Like , normally when you kiss somebody , it ’s a nice little intimate thing , and then to just immediately have them betray you and kiss the person next to you , and then the person next to them …
[ Laughs . ]
Malin Akerman and I had sex on top of the unconscious body of a young hermaphrodite girl .
We were doing surgery on this girl to either make her a boy or a girl — I honestly can’t remember — and we get so turned on by operating on this child ’s sex organs that we start making out , and then we have sex on top of this girl ’s body .
So it ’s a really family - friendly show .
The Parents ’ Television Council is going to be super - happy about it .

AVC : I saw the first season online , and thought “ Wow , they really go there . ”
RH : Yeah , it ’s literally hilarious , and it ’s so inappropriate .
It ’s hilarious to me that that show is going to be on a children ’s network .
Like , it ’s going to be cancelled right away .
What Cartoon Network does is lure them in during the day with cartoons , and then at night , they just fucking zap their brains with insanity .

Party Down ( 2010 ) — “ Mr. Dauntless ”
RH :
That is a huge loss of great television , in my book .
But I think everyone might have seen that coming , because it seems that most people on that show had gone on to do other things .
But really , that was Starz ’ fuckup .
Starz did n’t lock those people down , and they ’re all so funny and so talented , and if you do n’t lock them down …

AVC : How did they approach you for your episode ?
RH : We were shooting Childrens Hospital around the same time .
The comedy world is like a small pond ; we all know each other .
David Wain was directing that , so he called me and said “ You should come in and do this thing , you know , where you and Kerri Kenney are trying to seduce Martin Starr and have sex with him . ”
The chance to have a three - way with Kerri Kenney and Martin Starr …
I would n’t turn that down .
Advertisement
AVC : Because the community is so small , does the pendulum ever swing the other way ?
Is there competition ?
RH : I do n’t see it that way .
I see it as a huge bonus .
At least in L.A. I just moved to L.A. a few years ago .
I was in New York for 10 years , but my experience there was the same thing .
There seems to be this weird love - fest going on , where a lot of people in the comedy world are just super - supportive and help with each other ’s projects and are doing each other ’s shows .
The chance to get to work with all these other people that really crack you up and make you laugh , it ’s such a fucking fun time .
Advertisement
AVC : What do you think it is about comedy that makes people so supportive , and brings people together ?
RH : Hmm. Cocaine ?
Guns ?
I would say the illegal fighting of dogs , and wagering on those fights .
All of those elements combine to make an explosive environment .
I do n’t know whether it ’s just that we see each other perform live .
Advertisement
AVC : It is n’t like there ’s a lot of live , improvised drama , where dramatic actors can just swing by and hang out .
RH : I think dramatic actors might take themselves too seriously .
[ Laughs . ]
Comedians are generally drinking or doing other illegal things .

Human Giant ( 2007 -2008 ) — Various characters
RH : Human Giant was a kind of lightning in a bottle .
A rare opportunity for us to write and create our own sort of thing , with very few restrictions .
During the first season of Human Giant , I remember the people at MTV were all over us .
They had n’t really done a live - action short - film comedy show , so they did n’t know what it was going to be , and they were worried .
But after that , they let us do whatever we wanted .
The beauty of that show is that we overshot ; we shot so many sketches that we never used .
Sometimes we would start to work on stuff and we would look at it and say , “ This was really funny when we were talking about it in the room , but looking at it , this was a terrible idea , let ’s never …
Let ’s bury this . ”
Advertisement
AVC : Do any come to mind ?
RH :
There were so many that we killed .
It ’s almost too embarrassing .
That ’s like making someone look at something in the toilet and saying , “ I just made that ! ” [ Laughs . ]

AVC : In other interviews , you ’ve talked about the origin of “ Shutterbugs , ” how you had a stack of kids ’ headshots .
How did that come about ?
RH : I do n’t know what kind of question that ’s supposed to be .
I do n’t know what you ’re implying , that it ’s weird or creepy that I have a bunch of children ’s headshots at my house .
Let me tell you something , man , I do n’t go fuckin ’ sneaking around , poking my head into your personal affairs .
Get off my back .
[ Laughs . ]
A friend of mine in New York is a casting director , and I was in her office one day , and there was a stack of like 300 kids ’ headshots , just these little kids , like 5 years old .
I started looking at it , and I started laughing so hard .
Because when you see the headshot of a child , they ’re so filled with wonder and joy and optimism ; they have no idea of the shame and humiliation that awaits them in life .
And it just made me laugh so hard .
Advertisement
So I asked her if I could have the stack .
I showed them one time to Aziz [ Ansari ] , and we were like , “ Oh my God , we gotta shoot this thing . ”
We did [ “ Shutterbugs ” ] live at Upright Citizens Brigade in New York , and the bit was that Aziz and I were headshot photographers .
So that ’s where the title “ Shutterbugs ” came from ; that was the name of our business .
We started writing that as a miniseries , and that was really the first thing we ever shot with Jason [ Woliner ] .
Then Paul [ Scheer ] and Aziz went off with Jason and shot “ Illusionators . ”
Again , this was before the TV show ; we were just kind of messing around .
MTV saw that stuff , and that ’s how we got the show .
AVC : Did you find Bobb’e J. Thompson through those old headshots ?
RH : Bobb’e J. is amazing .
No , we found Bobb’e J because Jason and Aziz and Paul were obsessed with this show America ’s Most Talented Kids ; he was a judge on the show .
He would improvise all these ridiculous lines .
Like a little girl would perform a song , and it would just cut to Bobb’e J. , and he would be like , “ Sweetheart , let me tell you something , girl , you must have just fallen from heaven , because you smell like an angel to me . ”

30 Rock ( 2008 ) — “ MILF Island Host ”
RH : MILF Island , yeah .
That was one of my favorite things .
I knew Tina a little from the New York comedy world , so she asked me if I wanted to do that .
I was living in L.A. already , but I flew to New York because it was like , “ Oh , I ’m going to be the host of a fake reality show called MILF Island .
Fuck yes . ”
Advertisement
AVC : Was it just one day ?
RH : Yeah , they had all these fake Survivor - type sets built .
The crazy thing about MILF Island was that they had this ceremony where the women would get kicked off — my line was something like , “ We no longer wanna hit that . ”
Then they would go over to this huge bonfire , and would take off their bikini tops and throw them into the fire in this symbolic gesture .
I guess on the show , on MILF Island , they do n’t even let them keep their swimming suits .
But there were little kids there on the set .
[ Laughs . ]
There were a lot of , like , 10 - year - old boys on MILF Island , watching the ceremony of these women taking off their bikini tops and burning them .
I think they actually shot it in a way where the women ’s nipples probably had Band - Aids on them or something .
But I remember the boys — you know that ’s the dream job for a 10 - year - old actor , like , “ What ?
I ’m going to be on an island with these women , and I ’m going to see boobies ? ”
I remember there was this one little fat kid , who between takes was going over to the craft - services table , snacking on all the candy and drinking soda , and then they were shooting and he was looking at boobies .
I remember him just taking in the whole scene and thinking , “ This is my dream job . ”

The Office ( 2009 ) — “ A.J. ”
RH : I always play Holly ’s boyfriend A.J.
That was one of the things where my natural tendency is to be an asshole .
[ Laughs . ]
And the director was like “ No , you ca n’t be an asshole , because no one wants Holly to be dating an asshole .
She ’s smarter than that , and she deserves better than that . ”
So yeah , I got shot down on that one .
I had to play it really straight and just sort of be normal , which was really hard for me .
Amy Ryan and Steve Carell together ?
Both of them are so talented , but together , it ’s so fun to watch them .
Like , you do n’t want me in the background fucking it up .
Advertisement
AVC : Why is your natural instinct to go the asshole route ?
RH : Well , now we ’re delving deep into my psychology .
I do n’t know why I like to play assholes so much , but I really do .
I think it ’s because in real life , I do n’t think I ’m an asshole .
But when you meet someone that is really oblivious to the rest of the world , so selfish and arrogant , it makes me laugh so hard .
I do n’t know why .
Those guys just really make me laugh .
Eventually I ’ll have to play things a different way .
I wo n’t be able to be a douchebag .
I ’ll have to be just a really sweet , sincere guy .
And then you ’ll read like the next day on the Internet that I blew my head off .

Arrested Development ( 2005 ) — “ Dave Williams ”
RH : That ’s like one of my all - time favorite shows .
I ’m looking at Jeffrey Tambor right now .
I ’m shooting a movie with him , and I ’m watching him walk around set .
[ Laughs . ]
He ’s the nicest guy in the world .
I wish I could kill him and crawl inside of his body .
I was on Arrested Development for — if you blink , you ’ll miss it .

Curb Your Enthusiasm ( 2005 ) — “ Dr. Mark ”
RH : When you audition for Curb , you go in and you actually audition with Larry David .
Like , he ’s there !
You do the scene with them , and it ’s improvised .
They give me a little piece of paper : “ You ’re a doctor .
You live next door to Larry .
He thinks you ’re stealing his newspaper every day . ”
And that ’s all it said .
You do n’t try to steal scenes from Larry David .
He ’s funny , and you just let him be Larry .
And then eventually he ’s gonna do something that ’s embarrassing or inappropriate , and you ’re gonna go “ LARRY ! ”
But that show — I know I sound like I ’m just repeating myself , and I ’m saying that everything is so fun and everyone is so great , but —
Advertisement
AVC : Everything was so fun and everyone was so great ?
RH : Yeah , doing comedy shows , it ’s hard to not have fun .
Well , I ’ve done my share of — I ’ve eaten my share of shit .
In fact , I host a live show in L.A. every month at Upright Citizens ’ Brigade called “ The Shit Show . ”
I get a group of actors to come out onstage , and they have to show a clip of the worst thing they ’ve ever been in .
I have done so many stupid commercials and terrible other little projects that never went anywhere and just ended up being terrible .
Advertisement
AVC : Once I was watching Human Giant , and during the commercial break , you were in an Olive Garden commercial .
RH : Well it ’s funny you bring that up .
First of all , the interview ’s over , because you brought up the one thing I refuse to talk about .
This interview is completely over .
Yeah , that ’s like the closest I ’ve ever come to actually killing myself .
What happened was … [ Laughs . ]
That commercial … I was in New York , and when I auditioned , they told me they were going to go in a completely new direction .
The commercials were going to be really funny , and they wanted improvisers .
So when I shot it , all day long I was just improvising whatever I wanted , being really sarcastic and shitty .
Like , the waitress would come over and go , “ Hey , how ’s it goin ’ ? ”
And I would go “ Excuse me , adults are talking here .
Come back later . ”
You know ?
Weird crap .
And at the very end of the day , they go , “ Hey , do you mind doing one take where you just say this line and this line ? ”
And I go “ Okay , yeah , sure .
No problem . ”
So I did it .
And of course that ’s the one that they use .
It was really sincere .
And really shitty .

So I forgot about it .
It did n’t air for the longest time .
And then right after Human Giant got picked up , it started airing .
All my friends were e-mailing and calling me , like “ What the fuck is this ? ” I had no idea .
I did n’t even remember doing it , and then it was airing all the time .
And thankfully , since it had been so long since they shot it , the contract was just about to expire — I think they could only air it for a month .
So they aired the shit out of it for a month .
Then when they went to renew my contract , I told my agent , “ Tell them that I want a million dollars . ”
And he was like , “ Well they ’re going to cancel it . ”
“ But I want you to tell them that I want a million dollars . ”
So they went back to them and told them that I wanted a million dollars .
And then it got pulled off the air .
About a month later , a different commercial popped on with the exact same dialogue with a guy that looked a lot like me .
Then about a month later , I started getting the checks for it and I got , like , a crazy amount of money .
I thought about , for a while , keeping it running and taking all that money to build a statue in front of Olive Garden of me sitting on the toilet , eating Olive Garden .

AVC : So what else have you shown at The Shit Show ?
The Love Guru ( 2008 ) — “ Frat Guy ”
RH : Man , this interview is becoming too painful .
It started off so positive and fun , and now it ’s becoming a bucket of shame .
I feel like I need to take a shower .
Let me see — The Love Guru came about — well , I got a phone call and they said , “ Do you want to do this Mike Myers movie ? ”
And I said “ Yeah ! ” You know ?
When you hear that on the phone , it ’s like “ Yeah , I ’ll do a scene in a Mike Myers movie . ”
They ’re like “ You ’re gonna be starting a fight with Mike Myers in a bar .
He ’s gonna pick up a beer bottle and smash it over your head .
And then this huge bar fight ’s gonna break out .
It ’s gonna be hilarious . ”
I did n’t really read the script .
I just went to Toronto and shot it .
I did n’t really know what the movie was .
But the scene was really fun .
It was with , like , a hundred stuntmen .
Then I went to the première of the movie , and about 30 seconds in , I was like “ Oh no .
Oh no .
Oh , what ’s happening ?
What ’s happening ? ”
So I waited around until my scene came on , I saw my scene , and then snuck out of the theater .
At the première .

Sonars are specifically designed to help locate the fish which has many systems that has a basic principle from other sonar systems .
The sonar device transmits the sound pulses , which can be measured at the time and can be taken from the echoes to return .
After the pulses return , you can easily calculate the distance of the object , which can produce you with accurate results .
This sonar powered technology can easily send and receive signals many times per second .
This provides for a concrete sound into the beam that can be easily transmitted from the transducer .
The unit later , with the help of the echoes , can create a visual display of the underwater with the help of a continuous line — the objects in the water and between the surface to help you see the bottom .
These fish finders generally can detect the presence of the fish just by detecting the air in the swim bladders .
The air can be easily conserved in the swim bladder , which can work with the changes in the sound path that can reflect the energy back .
The fish finder can reflect the energy and convert the fish images on the screen accurately .
The fish finders operate one a high frequency of sounds which is 20 - 200 kHz which helps you define the target it can allow you even differentiate with the echoes or arches .
The lower frequencies can easily penetrate in deep waters which can help him have individual targets .
Also , it allows you to put more energy into the pulse , which is sent out by the transducer that increases the probability of getting the signal into the deeper waters .
The images which are formed are on visual display can help with the arches and allows you to move with the movement of boats .
The sound is transmitted from the transducer into the concentrated into a beam .
The sound passes into the deeper waters which later spreads out and covers a wider area .
Later , the transmitted sound can be plotted and make it to the pointed top on a broad base .
Fish which can swim within the cone can reflect the sound .
The reflected sound , echoes , and appears on the sonar chart display .
If you find a school of fish , you can also differentiate between the shapes and the formations which is caused in the transducer cone .
A fish arch forms and it can move with the fish as it moves through the sonar beam and enters the cone .
The fish swims through the cone the distance between the transducer and the fish which can mark the way to curve up as the fish continues to move through the beam to the opposite end of the cone which increases the distance .
This means that the curve can be downwards when the fish is moving further away from a transducer .

There 's a new face on Comedy Central who is more popular than Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart .
That would be Daniel Tosh , the host of " Tosh.0 , " a talk show that " chronicles all that 's newsworthy , weird and lewd about the Internet , " and that has roughly 2.4 million viewers , which makes it Comedy Central 's most - watched and top - rated studio - based show .
Reuters reports :
Since the comedian 's summer season premiered June 2 , five of the show 's six episodes have marked a new series high .
" It 's a show that came in under the radar and it's a truly word - of - mouth kind of show , " said Kent Alterman , head of original programing at Comedy Central .
" He has n't been written about that much .
There 's really just one factor that stands out -- the show is really funny . "
" Tosh " is averaging 2.2 million viewers this season vs. 2 million for " The Daily Show " and 1.4 million for " Colbert Report . "
Overall , it is the third most - popular show on the network ( behind " South Park " and " Futurama " ) .
Comedy Central has already renewed the show for a third season , with 29 new episodes set to debut next January , in addition to a stand - up tour for Tosh .

Since 1999 , when then - Gov. George Bush signed a law that deregulated the Texas electricity market , a debate has raged about whether and how much the move has benefited ordinary Texans .
Deregulation aimed to introduce market competition as a way to increase options to consumers and force down prices .
Clearly , the ramifications hardly have broken down so simply , and some believe the industry and large industrial customers have benefited more than the workaday electric consumer — who generally pays rates higher than the national average .
Last week , the Legislature 's Sunset Advisory Commission , which is currently evaluating the Public Utility Commission and ERCOT , the grid operator , recommended several important changes , including making it easier for Texas ratepayers to lodge complaints against electric companies .
The broader questions about the merits of deregulation remain a wonkish but important dispute .
Conservative groups assert that deregulation has allowed consumers to choose lower electricity prices , caused old plants to be replaced with efficient new ones and encouraged renewable energy .
Some ratepayer groups argue that deregulation has caused rates for ordinary Texans to be higher than they would have been otherwise .
" It 's a very , very difficult question , " says Steve Minick , the vice president for governmental affairs at the Texas Association of Business .
Many factors , especially the price of natural gas — which has fluctuated widely in the past 10 years — determine the cost of electricity .
His group , which represents both electric companies and large users of electricity like manufacturers , favors competition and thinks that deregulation has worked , but also acknowledges the " growing pains " of the market .
In the fog of conflicting figures and agendas , this much seems clear : Deregulation is here to stay .
Texas manufacturers , who are big users of electricity , cheer the onset of competition , presumably because they employ people savvy enough to aggressively shop for lower electricity rates in a confusing market .
Texas consumers , for their part , can in theory also choose plans with low rates .
But in reality , few people spend their days scouring for the best deal , and therefore some of the proclaimed benefits of deregulation may be overstated .
Comparison shopping for electricity sits low on the household to - do list , and so they may exert less pressure on the market than advocates had hoped .
Just over half of all Texans live in " competitive areas " ; electric cooperatives and municipal utilities , like those in Austin and San Antonio , as well as electric cooperatives , are not subject to deregulation .
In Texas , the giant utilities got split into three parts : the generator ( producer of the power , such as a coal plant ) , the operators of the wires for transmitting and distributing electricity , and the company that actually sells it to the customer .
In theory , the companies that sell power should compete for consumers on the basis of price and services .
A nifty website , powertochoose.org , allows Texans to type in their ZIP code , and up will pop a list of providers and their proffered rates .
" Competition in the electric industry will benefit Texans by reducing monthly rates and offering consumers more choices about the power they use , " Gov. Bush said at the time .
Offers lower " prices " — but real costs rise
Of course , deregulation , while it implies the busting up of monopolies , does not necessarily mean a switch to an unfettered free for all .
Consumers can still complain , and the Public Utility Commission and ERCOT will still flag unfair practices if they see them .
But electric providers are essentially free to offer whatever rates they choose , and change their offers at will , whereas before they would have had to beg the Public Utility Commission for permission .
Including Texas and the District of Columbia , 15 states have deregulated their electricity markets ; most of these are in the Northeast , where electricity rates are high , and state officials wanted to try new measures to bring them down .
Seven other states , including California ( in the wake of its energy crisis 10 years ago ) , have suspended deregulation programs .
So has deregulation caused the cost of electricity to go up or down for ordinary Texans ?
That answer is complicated by the fact that no one knows how rates might have increased without it .
" Most Texans can easily buy electricity today below 2001 regulated prices , " asserts the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation , in a recent paper .
With inflation adjustments , the group says , " the average competitive price today is 9.46 percent lower than regulated prices in Texas in 2001 . "
That depends on your definition of " price " :
In this study , it 's not what consumers actually pay , according to Bill Peacock , the group 's vice president of research .
Rather , it reflects the offers available at powertochoose.org .
" We do n't know what choices customers made , " Peacock acknowledges .
The " offers " the foundation tracked do not necessarily translate into customers — an important distinction in the literature on deregulation .
In other words , how many people will take up tantalizingly low offers — some of which may be here one day and gone tomorrow — is unclear .
From 2002 to mid-2009 , 86 percent of customers made at least one observable switch , whether between providers or to a different plan offered by the same provider , according to a report by Bret Slocum of Clark , Thomas & Winters , who serves as legal counsel to several retail electric companies .
But Tom " Smitty " Smith , the director of Public Citizen Texas , a consumer and environmental advocacy group , says that deregulation has been " a disaster for the average consumer " — partly because people do n't have time to shop around , and also because it is hard to evaluate the offers .
" It 's almost impossible to compare Offer A to Offer B and determine who 's got the better deal for you , " he says .
Jake Dyer , a policy analyst with Lloyd Gosselink Rochelle & Townsend , a law firm that represents a coalition of cities who are customers in the deregulated markets , says that between 2002 and 2008 , the actual cost of electricity offered to residents by almost every company in competitive areas was higher on average than the cost of electricity nationally .
Rates in Texas , he says , were consistently below average for the 10 years before deregulation .
( Dyer says that 2001 , a year often cited by deregulation advocates , has an anomalous spike caused partly by the run-up to deregulation ; Peacock of the Texas Public Policy Foundation counters that natural gas prices were a big factor in the spike . )
Last year , residential electricity rates for all of Texas — including both regulated and deregulated areas — were 17 percent above the national average .
Meanwhile , Texas manufacturers , which buy huge quantities of power and presumably command commensurate stroke in the market , say they are happy with deregulation .
" The fact is that current power prices in the Texas electric market compare favorably to anywhere else in the country , " said Luke Bellsnyder , the executive director of the Texas Association of Manufacturers , in a statement .
The natural gas factor
Both sides acknowledge that natural gas prices are a key factor in electricity rates ; they soared in 2008 , sending five electricity retailers out of business .
Since then , gas prices have fallen by about two - thirds .
Texas , where 42 percent of generation comes from natural gas ( compared with 23 percent in the nation as a whole ) , has been in for an especially wild ride .
John Fainter , the president of the Association of Electric Companies of Texas , believes Texas should be compared to other gas - reliant states ; New Mexico and Oklahoma , which have lower electricity rates than Texas , are both more coal - reliant , he says .
Argues Dyer : " Natural gas certainly explains some of the fluctuations we 've seen in electricity prices in this state , as in other states — but it does not explain why our rates in Texas seem to be consistently higher . "
Another way to examine the question is to compare Texas electric providers to " un-deregulated " municipal utilities , like Austin and San Antonio .
Electricity industry groups such as AECT like to note that it 's always possible to find a lower rate on offer in a deregulated area .
A document from the group , for example , argues that the municipal utilities often " have prices that are above what are being offered in the competitive market today . "
And in every competitive area , the group says , there are prices available that are below the national average .
Dyer , however , notes that for March 2010 , the cost of electricity in Austin , San Antonio and San Marcos ( measured per 1000 kilowatt - hours , the industry standard ) is below the overall Texas average — which includes competitive areas ( 9.7 cents per kilowatt hour in San Antonio , against 11.88 cents per kilowatt - hour across Texas ) .
Asked about this , AECT responded that municipal utilities tend to be more dependent on coal and nuclear power and said , " What is clear is that since gas prices have dropped — their price advantage over the rest of the state has also dropped . "
Deregulation boosts renewable energy
Leaving aside the eternal cost debate , has deregulation aided new - era energy tools , like wind power and smart - grid technology ?
" Deregulation was great for wind , " says Andy Bowman , the founder and president of Pioneer Green Energy , a renewable energy development company .
That 's because the system encouraged greater use of natural gas immediately after deregulation ; then , when gas prices soared several years ago , wind power became competitive .
Texas ' first " renewable portfolio standard " — or requirement that the state 's utilities get a certain amount of their power from renewable energy like wind — was signed into law in 1999 , as part of the same legislation that deregulated the electric market .
Lisa Singleton , a spokeswoman for Energy Future Holdings , whose companies include TXU Energy , argues that deregulation has also encouraged the development of smart - grid technologies .
Without it , " I do n't think we would have seen the same investment or deployment of smart - grid technologies , " she says .
( It bears noting , however , that California utilities — which do not operate in a deregulated environment — are also moving quickly toward smart - grid additions . )
At any rate , the interests surrounding electric deregulation likely will be fighting about its effects for years to come — because a re-regulation movement is not in the offing .
Richard Sedano , a director of the Regulatory Assistance Project , a Vermont - based nonprofit that studies the environmental and economic issues associated with the power sector , notes that deregulation in many parts of the country , including Texas , was done in the late 1990s .
Nowadays , no states are seriously considering switching their status , either to become deregulated or , conversely , suspending deregulation programs .
In Texas , not even critics like Dyer are in favor of abandoning the system .
" We are not advocating in any way , shape or form re-regulation , " Dyer says .
Rather , he adds , " We want the system to work the best it can work . "

Two ways output sockets B1 9V Battery S1 Switch
Two steel rods of appropriate length
Its purpose was to remotely monitor the water - level in a metal tank located in the attic by means of a very simple control unit placed in the kitchen , some floors below .
Mains requirements were :
* No separate supply for the remote circuit
* Main and remote units connected by a thin two - wire cable
* Simple LED display for the main unit
* Battery operation to avoid problems related to mains supply and water proximity
* As the circuit was battery operated a low current consumption was obviously welcomed
The very small remote unit is placed near the tank and measures the water level in three ranges by means of two steel rods .
Each range will cover one third of the tank capacity :
* Almost empty – signaled by means of a red LED ( D3 ) in the control unit display
* About half - level – signaled by means of a yellow LED ( D2 ) in the control unit display
* Almost full – signaled by means of a green LED ( D1 ) in the control unit display
4012 NAND gate IC LM393 Comparator IC BC547 NPN Transistor
Circuit operation :
When the water - level is below the steel rods , no contact is occurring from the metal can and the rods , which are supported by a small insulated ( wooden ) board .
The small circuit built around IC1 draws no current and therefore no voltage drop is generated across R5 .
IC2A , IC2B and Q1 are wired as a window comparator and , as there is zero voltage at input pins # 2 and # 5 , D3 will illuminate .
When the water comes in contact with the first rod , pin # 13 of IC1 will go high , as its input pins # 9 to # 12 were shorted to negative by means of the water contact .
Therefore , R4 will be connected across the full supply voltage and the remote circuit will draw a current of about 9 mA .
This current will cause a voltage drop of about 0.9V across R5 and the window comparator will detect this voltage and will change its state , switching off D3 and illuminating D2 .
When the water will reach the second rod , also pin # 1 of IC1 will go high for the same reason explained above .
Now either R3 and R4 will be connected across the full supply voltage and the total current drawing of the remote circuit will be about 18 mA .
The voltage drop across R5 will be now about 1.8V and the window comparator will switch off D2 and will drive D1 .
The battery will last very long because the circuit will be mostly in the off state .
Current is needed only for a few seconds when P1 is pushed to check the water - level and one of the LEDs illuminates .
Notes :
* The two steel rods must be supported by a small insulated ( wooden ) board
* IC1 and R1 - R4 are mounted on a small board placed near or on the steel rods support
* The two - wire cable connecting the remote circuit board to the main control board , i.e. J1 to J2 , can be of any size and type ( preferably thin for obvious reasons ) .
It can be very long , if necessary .
* The circuit can be used also with non-metal tanks , provided a third steel rod having the height of the tank will be added and connected to pin # 7 of IC1 , R3 , R4 and J1 .
* The 4012 chip was chosen because it contains two gates and was at hand , but you can use two of the gates contained into 4001 , 4011 , 4093 , 4049 , 4069 etc. chips , provided all inputs of each gate are tied together and all inputs of unused gates are connected to the positive rail , leaving output pins open .

Lloyd Blankfein's Days Are Numbered as Chairman of Goldman Sachs
It 's a testament to the odd world in which we live that when a Wall Street firm pays a $ 550 million fine by conceding negligence in how it dealt with clients , its stock surges , adding billions of dollars in market value for the firm 's shareholders .
But that 's what 's happening to Goldman Sachs , as it reached its long awaited settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over how it sold a basket of mortgage related debt to investors in 2007 .
Back when the SEC brought the case , the conventional wisdom on Wall Street and the financial media was that Goldman did n't have to settle -- the case was weak and Goldman is , after all , Goldman .
As I wrote on these pages back then , Goldman would have to settle because : ( a ) the SEC dug up some real questionable activity ; and ( b ) no Wall Street firm , not even one with the ties to government that Goldman possesses can go to war with its primary regulator .
Now that Goldman has indeed settled , the news is being spun , again mostly by the financial media , that the deal with the SEC was a victory for Goldman 's CEO Lloyd Blankfein , who survived the investigation largely unscathed , paying a measly $ 550 million to the government ( equivalent to a few days trading gains at Goldman ) and without having to give up any power , such as relinquishing his role as chairman of the board , as senior executives both inside Goldman and at competing firms believed would be part of any settlement .
Well , if history is any guide , Blankfein may not go tomorrow , or even next month , but sometime in 2011 , Blankfein will at the very least no longer be chairman of Goldman , and may also be forced out of the firm altogether .
If you do n't believe me ask former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill .
Like Blankfein , Weill ( at least on paper ) was a good CEO from an operational standpoint .
Following the creation of Citigroup in 1998 , shares of the big bank soared .
The bank was what 's known as a Wall Street darling for its strong earnings and a surging stock price , and Weill was regarded as the King of Wall Street , having engineered the largest financial deal ever when he merged his company , the Travelers Group brokerage , insurance and investment banking empire , with commercial banking powerhouse Citicorp .
At the height of his power , Weill suddenly popped up on the radar screen of New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer .
Before Spitzer got involved with hookers and became a TV host , he was the sheriff of Wall Street , looking to right wrongs from the last great scandal , the internet bubble where firms sold worthless dotcom and tech stocks to unsuspecting investors .
Emails he uncovered showed that Weill at least did something stupid , if not fraudulent :
He pressured an analyst , Jack Grubman , to inflate his stock rating on telecom giant AT&T , which was an investment banking client ( Weill also sat on AT&T 's board , while AT&T CEO Michael Armstrong sat on Citi's board )
Grubman wrote in an email that as a favor for upgrading the stock , Weill got his kids in an exclusive pre-school .
The scandal , was described by the Wall Street Journal , as a " kid pro quo . "
Weill continued to deny wrongdoing and was never charged .
Citigroup , however , was charged with fraud and ended up paying a $ 400 fine to settle the matter , but Weill appeared to have retained his control of the bank .
The initial reaction in the press and among his peers in the financial business was that Weill had won , by having the bank pay a relatively small fine , and his status as CEO and the King of Wall Street secure .
Not quite .
A few months later , Citigroup announced that Weill was stepping down as CEO , handing that job to Chuck Prince , who basically negotiated the settlement package .
Citigroup maintained that the two moves were unrelated .
But people in Spitzer 's office told me they really were n't :
While negotiating the settlement , Citigroup 's board made it clear to investigators that Weill 's days were numbered at the top of the firm that he founded .
Spitzer was merely affording Weill a graceful exit in an effort to end the case .
Full disclosure : I have no knowledge that Goldman 's board has tacitly agreed to pull a Weill on Blankfein and has plans for him to step aside , but the circumstances involving the two men are so remarkably similar .
While Blankfein was n't directly involved in the questionable trade that landed Goldman in trouble , he is responsible for remaking Goldman into predatory trading culture that has caught the attention of regulators , Congressional committees ( recall Sen .
Carl Levin badgering Goldman traders for selling " shitty " investments to their clients ) and hurt Goldman 's once stellar reputation , as Weill 's actions hurt Citigroup's .
Some would say that 's where the comparisons end ; Citigroup deals with the general public that buys stocks through its brokerage unit ( Smith Barney ) and makes deposits in its branch banking offices .
Goldman deals with large sophisticated investors who could n't care less how Darwinian the company behaves .
That used to be true , but no more .
Goldman 's image has been battered , not as bad as say a company like BP , but not far behind .
And image does count these days given the scrutiny and oversight placed on Wall Street and the banks following the financial collapse - induced bailouts .
Now that financial reform has been passed , Goldman will have to cut back on some of that aggressive trading that powered its earnings and was Blankfein 's forte .
That means it will have to devote more and more resources to developing its client business and relationships , convincing blue chip companies that it is the right firm to handle delicate negotiations involving mergers , acquisitions , and other corporate financing assignments .
More and more , these clients do care about image ( ask yourself why has so many top companies embraced the useless but politically correct " green agenda " ) .
In fact some have already jettisoned Goldman as scrutiny of the firm grew over the past year .
Who is the right guy to change Goldman 's image to fit the new paradigm it faces ?
It 's not Lloyd Blankfein and that 's why he wo n't survive .
SACRAMENTO — A Field Poll released Friday suggests trouble for supporters of California ballot propositions seeking to overturn the state ’s greenhouse gas protections and legalize marijuana for recreational use .
The survey found that 48 percent of likely voters oppose the marijuana initiative , while 44 percent support it .
That ’s far from the level of support typically needed at this stage of a campaign , said Mark DiCamillo , the poll ’s director .
“ When you ’re starting out behind , the odds are against you , so that ’s going to be a tough one to pull off , ” he said .
Proposition 19 would allow adults to cultivate marijuana and enable local governments to regulate and tax sales of the plant to raise revenue .
Proponents have said the proposal could generate $ 200 million per year , but others say the amount would be lower .
California already allows marijuana use for medicinal purposes .
Voters also are skeptical of an oil - company - funded initiative , Proposition 23 , that seeks to suspend the state ’s landmark global warming law .
Just 36 percent support the effort , while 48 percent are opposed .
DiCamillo said both initiatives face difficulties , because propositions with less than 50 percent support early in the campaign tend to lose .
They are among 10 propositions that will appear on November ’s general election ballot .
Backers of Proposition 23 dismissed the poll ’s results as irrelevant .
“ The only thing this so - called ‘ poll ’ illustrates is that the majority of voters have not heard about Prop. 23 , ” said John Kabateck , executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business / California .
He is a co-chairman of the Proposition 23 campaign .
Steven Maviglio , a spokesman for the no- on - 23 forces , was jubilant .
“ Even with their Texas - sized checkbooks , oil companies Valero and Tesoro will have a difficult time convincing Californians to support their deceptive ballot measure that will effectively kill clean air and energy standards , ” said Maviglio , of the group Californians for Clean Energy & Jobs .
Other opponents of the measure include PG&E , the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
An $ 11.1 billion water bond placed on the ballot by Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers is favored by 42 percent of voters , although many had no opinion .
The Republican governor recently urged lawmakers to pull the bond off the ballot , saying the state ’s high unemployment rate and $ 19 billion budget deficit would hurt its chances of passing .
He wants to delay the vote until 2012 , although the Legislature has not yet acted on his recommendation .
A wide majority of voters is supporting a proposition seeking to change the state ’s budget process .
Among likely voters , 65 percent said they would approve Proposition 25 .
The constitutional amendment calls for a simple majority vote in the state Legislature to approve a budget , rather than the current two - thirds majority .
It retains the two - thirds threshold for raising taxes .
Just 20 percent would vote no on the proposition , while 15 percent remain undecided .
DiCamillo said support for the initiative has increased since January , perhaps because it also calls for docking lawmakers ’ pay when a budget is late .
If voters approve the measure , lawmakers would permanently forfeit their salaries and daily expense reimbursements until they pass a budget .
The telephone survey of 1,005 likely voters was conducted June 22 to July 5 .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points and a higher margin for subgroups .

Palliative care does not necessarily end when someone has died .
Family members may need support as they grieve the loss of a loved one and try to manage numerous strains and stresses .
Bereavement programs are often part of the comprehensive care offered as part of palliative care .
See also : World Health Organization ’s Definition of Palliative Care
Palliative care is a type of health care for patients and families facing life - limiting illness .
Palliative care helps patients to achieve the best possible quality of life right up until the end of life .
Palliative care is sometimes considered end - of - life care , with a main focus on comfort .
However , it is increasingly recognized that a palliative approach , as part of health care is beneficial early on in serious and chronic illness .
A more difficult question is knowing when the time is right to actually become registered with a palliative care program .
Many palliative care programs will not register patients who are in the early stages of illness .
The people working with these programs , however , may consult with your health care team and provide suggestions for managing your symptoms .
As long as your health care providers are paying close attention to controlling your pain and other symptoms , you are receiving palliative care .
Palliative care can be provided at any time , to anyone with advanced illness , regardless of age .
Taking steps to increase a patient ’s overall comfort is always a good thing to do .
Canada does not have a national palliative care program , so you may see differences in the type of care available in each province .
The people contributing to your care will also vary depending on your specific needs and the services available where you live .
Many health care providers contribute to palliative care teams , depending on the needs of the patient and the family .
Nurses , family doctors , social workers , spiritual care providers , palliative care specialists , occupational therapists , physiotherapists , home care and personal support workers , volunteers , and pharmacists are just some of the people who may be involved .
Where is palliative care provided ?
Palliative care can be provided anywhere .
Many palliative care programs provide services and support for patients wherever they are living – at home , in a residential hospice , in hospital or in a personal care home .
The best place to receive care is usually the place that best matches your needs .
Home
Some people choose to stay at home for as long as they can .
Family members , with support from the health care team , may decide that they want to be the main caregivers in the home .
Many communities have supports in place and services to help patients and families provide care at home , including these :
Respite programs
Family caregivers need time to rest and many home care programs offer respite programs that provide short - term patient care for several hours or even several days .

Home care programs
Most Canadian home care programs offer palliative care services in the home .
Professional nursing care is often available through these programs , along with other home - based support services .

Private companies
Sometimes people will pay for private home care services because they need extra help .
Private home care companies supply part - time , as needed or around - the - clock care .
However , unless you have insurance , you will have to pay for these costs yourself .

Hospice volunteers are carefully screened , selected and educated to offer emotional , spiritual and practical support to individuals and families living with advanced illness .
Volunteers are often matched with families and are available to talk on the phone or make in - person visits .
Palliative care programs
Some palliative care programs offer in - home visits from nurses or doctors who are specialists in palliative care .
Even if in - home visits are not offered , program staff may still be available to offer telephone advice on pain or how to manage other symptoms .
These programs are often run through hospitals .
Check with your local hospital or government home care office to see what palliative care is offered in your area .
If you choose to stay at home , remember that at any point you can change your mind about where a death is going to happen .
Some families decide they want a home setting for as long as possible .
If you eventually choose to leave home , many other facilities offer palliative care .

Residential hospice
A residential hospice provides full - time palliative care , generally in a home - like setting .
Some hospices will also take care of the person who is ill for a few days at a time so that caregivers can get some rest .
Unfortunately , there are n’t enough residential hospices to meet the needs of everyone who needs palliative care in Canada .
Residential hospices often give priority to people who are nearing the last stages of life and are not expected to live more than a few months .
Hospice staff will pay close attention to physical symptoms .
Symptoms such as nausea and constipation need to be treated so that the patient can be as comfortable as possible .
Staff will also care for the patient ’s emotional and spiritual health .
Patients may need to confirm that their expectations for medical treatment match services that can be provided in the hospice .
Sometimes the care provided in a residential hospice is not covered by the public health system .
In that case , the family will likely be required to pay a daily charge .
Sometimes private or group insurance will cover these costs .
Hospital
Many hospitals have staff with special training in palliative care .
These people provide support and work with the patient and the patient ’s health care providers .
Some hospitals have special palliative care units or wards to help manage symptoms that are more difficult .
These units offer privacy and a more home - like environment , however they are generally not meant for long - term stays .
Instead , symptoms are brought under control so that patients may be transferred to another unit of the hospital , to a hospice or home .
Personal care home
Personal care homes , also known as nursing homes , regularly provide palliative care services .
You do n’t have to be a long - time resident to receive palliative care in a personal care home .
People with advanced illnesses will sometimes move into a personal care home so that they can receive palliative care .
Personal care homes may have access to teams that have special training in palliative care .
These consultants provide support and work with the patient , the family and the patient ’s health care providers to help with symptom management .
They also offer support in difficult decision making to ensure that the best care is provided .
It ’s less than two hours before boarding time but most of the staff of Libo Airport are walking off their dinner of spicy dog meat with an evening stroll around the parking lot .
Others sit in a circle on a grassy median smoking cigarettes and marveling at a full moon .
A security guard naps on a metal bench .
A saleswoman behind the ticket counter enjoys a shoulder rub in the darkened terminal .
“ Can you at least turn on the lights ? ” asks a traveler carrying a bag of snacks .
“ I ’d like to see what I ’m eating . ”
Handling just two flights a week has n’t fostered a deep sense of urgency for the 50 or so workers at the airport .
On this night , a garage door - sized video monitor displays a single arrival and departure .
This is not how things were supposed to be when the $ 57 - million airport opened in late 2007 .
Local officials were so confident that tourists would flock to this beautiful , mountainous county in southwestern China that they made the terminal big enough to accommodate 220,000 passengers annually , and built a runway capable of handling a 140 - seat Boeing 737 .
But only a few charters and budget carriers have established service here .
A grand total of 151 people flew in and out of Libo last year .
At a time when anxiety is growing over the United States ’ aging infrastructure , China is pouring billions of dollars into improving its transportation network to catch up with the developed world .
China has added about 40 airports in the last decade alone , bringing its total to 166 .
The U.S. , by comparison , has 503 airports that serve at least 2,500 passengers a year , according to the Federal Aviation Administration .
But in the mad dash to expand China ’s civil aviation system , many new airports are lacking one important thing : passengers .
Spurred by federal infrastructure money , easy bank loans and the cachet of having planes land in their backyard , many small cities jumped at the opportunity to lay down runways and open terminals .
“ An airport is like a business card for the city .
It can boost tourism and the economy , ” said Xu Hongjun , a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China .
“ But a lot of small airports are not doing well .
They need a lot of subsidies from the central government .
They were too optimistic . ”
Despite the building binge , the majority of China ’s air traffic is still concentrated among a handful of large cities .
The top eight airports commanded about half of all passenger traffic .
The top three -- Beijing , Guangzhou and Shanghai ’s Pudong -- handled half of all cargo traffic .
Experts say up to two - thirds of the nation ’s airports are losing money .
They must compete with a quickly expanding high - speed rail network whose tickets are often cheaper .
Yet China plans to add 80 more airports over the next decade .
Officials believe the expansion will eventually pay off .
China ’s airline passenger traffic has grown an average of 15 % annually over the last four years and is estimated to jump 44 % over the next 10 years to 700 million fliers .
Last year China became the largest purchaser of jetliners on the planet , spending twice as much as the U.S. did on passenger planes .
“ China has led the world in recovering from the global air travel slump , ” said Richard Aboulafia , an aviation analyst for Teal Group in Fairfax , Va .
“ Its growth rates are the highest in the world . ”
But some locations chosen for new airports have left even experts scratching their heads .
Last year a facility was opened 13,000 feet above sea level on the steppes of the Qinghai - Tibetan Plateau , where temperatures can drop to minus - 43 degrees Fahrenheit .
Engineers had to temper the concrete runway just to withstand the harsh weather conditions .
Only 7,500 passengers used the airport last year .
“ When can they make money ?
We ’ve got a long way to go , ” said Ping Wang , an advisor to the Civil Aviation Administration of China and co-founder of GCW Consulting , an aviation consultancy based in Arlington , Va .
“ But an airport ’s purpose is not just making money , ” he said .
“ It ’s a public utility .
. . .
Without small airports , many areas of the country wo n’t be connected to the outside world . ”
The rest of the world still feels very far away in Libo ( pronounced lee - BWAH ) , a city of about 166,000 in a mountainous region in Guizhou , one of the poorest provinces in China .
Even by rural Chinese standards , this place is a backwater .
Roosters live in apartment courtyards .
A sit - down restaurant means a stool on a dusty floor .
Cows sometimes obstruct the airport road .
Most young people have left for jobs in coastal factories .
Coal mining and farming are the mainstays of the economy .
The airport was part of a development plan to attract more tourists to visit the region ’s forest reserve , which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996 .
The soaring rock faces and narrow peaks in the area resemble parts of the Grand Canyon , with trees .
But visitors rarely come , except during the country ’s biggest national holidays .
“ We were hoping the airport would bring more people here , but it has not been very helpful , ” said Qin Zhengshao , 38 , a farmer who turned part of his home into a guesthouse .
Peasants like Qin could never fathom traveling by plane .
Tickets for the lone route to the provincial capital of Guiyang cost between $ 40 and $ 70 -- about half of what some farmers here earn in a year .
Airport officials are instead looking to attract more wealthy urban dwellers .
Spokesman Qin Jungmeng said management has already secured more flights from southern Guangdong province .
In the meantime , airport employees have become accustomed to the light load .
Though paid for full - time work , many have to come in only to attend to the airport ’s two round - trip flights -- one on Friday , one on Sunday .
When passengers do come , many turn out to be government officials , not tourists .
“ This place just was n’t promoted properly , ” said one administrator who did not want to share her name .
“ It ’s a shame because we really offer good services . ”
Employees joke that the airport , which is situated on a lonely plateau , would be an ideal site for a horror film .
Doors swing open and slam violently from the strong winds that roll off the hills , echoing through the halls .
On a recent Sunday night the staff prepared to celebrate the national lantern festival .
Four cardboard boxes filled with fireworks were stored in an office ready to be set off later that evening .
First , however , there was the matter of an incoming flight .
About an hour before its arrival the workers took their stations .
A dozen staff members carrying walkie - talkies headed for the tarmac .
Fourteen minutes ahead of schedule , flight G42663 landed on Libo ’s runway , an almond - colored strip of concrete noticeably unscarred by tire marks .
The 50 - seat Canadair CRJ taxied toward the terminal and came to a halt .
When the door swung open , two women descended the stairs , followed by one male passenger .
That was it .
The employees of Libo Airport could soon call it a night and enjoy their fireworks show .

If this comic does n’t make any sense you should probably go see Inception .
It ’s worth your time .
MOSTLY SPOILER FREE COMMENTARY BELOW :
I do not understand why I am hearing the phrase “ mind fuck ” tossed around with regards to this movie .
Inception actually makes a clear , concerted effort to explain exactly what ’s going on during the film .
At no point are you questioning what is reality and what is a dream ( well , sort of … ) .
My point is that while there ARE dreams within dreams within dreams , the plot spells each “ level ” and it ’s purpose out very clearly .
There really is n’t a Fight Club or Sixth Sense moment where you think “ this movie has been PLAYING ME ALL ALONG ! ”
Again , that is only my reaction to some of the chatter I am reading about Inception from my perch high atop the Twitmosphere .
It is not a judgement on the film , nor am I suggesting the story would have been better served by some sort of twist ending .
Far from it , in fact .
Inception is an original story , expertly acted and beautifully shot .
If we still only had 5 best film Oscar slots , it would certainly take one of them .
Christopher Nolan is a fantastic story teller , though he has almost exclusively been telling other people ’s stories .
Inception was his baby and it shows .
The fact that it took him 8 years to write also shows .
The plot is complex without being hard to follow .
There is a balance that leaves you thinking long and hard about what you ’ve just seen but not questioning it .
I will suggest that you take a bathroom break during the previews because Inception is two and a half hours long and there really is n’t a good time to leave the theater .

( CNN ) --
The man who pleaded guilty in the failed Times Square car bombing said before the incident that the strike would be a " revenge attack , " according to an airing Wednesday on an Arabic - language TV network .
Al Arabiya showed what it said was a tape of Pakistani - American Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty in June to the attempt .
The authenticity of the tape could not immediately be verified , and the person in the video appeared sometime before the May 1 event .
The comments , made in English , were translated into Arabic for the news report .
He said the " revenge attack " will be carried out " in the name of all the mujahedeen , the fighters and the weak and the oppressed Muslims , " he said , mentioning Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , and Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred .
" I will take revenge on their behalf , inshallah , and I really wish that the hearts of the Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah . "
Mehsud was the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , and al - Zarqawi headed al Qaeda in Iraq .
" Eight years have passed with the war in Afghanistan and you will see that the war of the Muslims has just started , and we will show you how Islam will spread throughout the whole world . "
The speaker stressed that " jihad " is a prominent pillar of Islam , a term often used to mean " holy war . "
" By jihad , Islam is established , Allah 's word is made superior , " he said .
" By abandoning jihad , may Allah protect us from that , Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into inferior positions .
Their honor is lost , their lands are stolen .
Their rule and authority vanish .
Jihad is an obligated duty in Islam on every Muslim . "
He said Islam will spread across the world .
He said democracy will be defeated as communism was .
" All the other -- isms and -- schisms will be defeated and the word of Allah will be supreme , inshallah .
And Muslims are gonna do that . "
Haaaaaaa
I love it finally a useful store .

Line Segment / Circle - Collision Detection
Here is another piece of code I did n't want to throw away , it uses vector projection to determine if a circle collides with a line segment .
The idea was to figure out if one NPC can pass the ball to another in a way that no opposing team members can intercept it .
We represent each opposing team player as a circle , the size of the circle will grow or shrink depending on the velocity of the player then we check each circle for collision with the line segment if non collides we assume it is a safe pass , following images shows a safe pass where non of the three opposing players can intercept the pass ,
( defn closest - point - on - line [ a b c ] ( let [ ac ( subtract c a ) ab ( subtract b a ) proj-mag ( dot - product ac ( normalize ab ) ) ] ( cond ( < proj-mag 0 ) a (> proj-mag ( magnitude ab ) ) b : default ( add ( project ac ab ) a ) ) ) )
We begin by creating two new vectors , one from the start of the line to end of the line ( AB ) and one from start of the line to the center of the circle ( AC ) , then we calculate the magnitude ( length ) of the projection of AC onto AB , if it is smaller than 0 then the closest point on this line to the circle is the point A ( start of the line segment ) , if it is bigger than the magnitude of the AB vector then the closest point is B , else we return the projection of AC onto AB plus A ( which converts it back into world coordinates ) that gives us the closest point on the line to the circle .
( defn path - clean [ a b c r ] ( let [ closest ( closest - point - on - line a b c ) distance ( magnitude ( subtract c closest ) ) ] ( if ( <= distance r ) false true ) ) )
Now that we know the location of the closest point on the line to the circle , collision detection is as simple as calculating the length between closest point and the circle , if it is smaller than the radius of the circle we have a collision else we have a clean path .
What happens when the U.S. government awards DuPont , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Bosch , and 3M $ 1.6 million to develop a longer - lasting , less expensive way to store clean energy ?
We will soon find out .
The organizations announced today that they will use the grant money — awarded under Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy ( ARPA - E ) — to collaborate on research aimed at improving grid operations through temporary storage with a new battery system .
The collaboration of the partners is a part of why the program should succeed .
“ This ARPA - E funding provides us an opportunity to combine our strengths in batteries and fuel cells and work on an important new area , which is grid - scale storage , ” said Venkat Srinivasan , scientist – Berkeley Lab , lead investigator for the project .
“ We believe we have a very promising solution to the storage problems for grid applications , and this will provide the seed funding required to bring our research to fruition . ”
Grid stability is important when more renewables come into the mix .
A cloud that suddenly covers solar panels or a drop in wind speed can cause sudden energy losses from PV panels and wind turbines , respectively .
Temporary energy storage is seen as the way to mitigate those sudden fluctions of energy .
“ Bosch views stationary energy storage as one of the important enabling technologies for larger penetration of renewable energy sources into the national electricity grid , ” said Dr. Horst Muenzel , regional president – Bosch Corporate Research North America .
“ Bosch is very appreciative of the opportunity to contribute to a technology that we hope will improve the national grid and allow for a larger share of electrical energy to be derived from green sources . ”
The work will be carried out at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , Calif . ; Bosch in Palo Alto , Calif. , and Cambridge , Mass. ; DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington , Del. ; and facilities at 3M .

As the local food trend grows , so does consumer demand for farmers ’ markets .
But as it stands , farmers ’ markets are mostly the domain of middle and upper - class neighborhoods .
GOOD and The Architect ’s Newspaper aim to change that with the Redesign Your Farmers ’ Market competition , a challenge that asked designers to figure out ways to effectively sell fresh , local produce to urban residents .
The winning entry , chosen today from 22 finalists , is Farm on Wheels , designed by Mia Lehrer and Associates .
The Farm on Wheels concept features a fleet of electric trucks that dispatch produce from a vast network of local farms to residents of Los Angeles .
A centralized farmer ’s market dishes out fruits and vegetable for the electric trucks , which travel to underserved areas throughout the city , fresh farm food in tow .
Other finalists include the New City Center for Urban Farming , a farmer ’s market hub that contains a greenhouse , farmer ’s market , data center , and information center , and the Urban Field Farm Stop , which imagines bus stops redesigned as mini farmer ’s markets .
Mia Lehrer and Associates wo n’t , unfortunately , receive any funding for their winning design , but the Farm on Wheels concept will be published in both GOOD Magazine and The Architect ’s Newspaper .
But who knows –maybe one day , farmer ’s market trucks will become as ubiquitous as neighborhood ice cream trucks .

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) said Friday that he expects former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) to be among the crowd of GOP presidential candidates in 2012 .
Gingrich , himself a potential candidate for president , sized up the field of would - be competitors , detailing which GOP politicians he expects to jump into the race .
The field Gingrich listed included : former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , Palin , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , Sen. John

" There are going to be lots of Republicans running — Gov. Romney clearly , Gov. Palin , Gov. Huckabee , Gov. Mitch Daniels , Gov. Haley Barbour , Gov. Tim Pawlenty .
I think John Thune , the senator from South Dakota , is probably going to get in .
Ron Paul 's probably going to run again , " Gingrich said in an interview with Newsmax , a conservative magazine .
" I think it 's going to be a lively campaign , there 'll be a lot of good candidates .
" Some of the candidates Gingrich listed — like Romney and Pawlenty — have already begun to quietly organize a team to prepare for a bid to challenge President Obama .
Others have taken a more unconventional route , like Palin , who 's used Facebook and Twitter missives to build support among a field of conservative House and Senate candidates .
Gingrich , asked specifically about Palin , said she'd be a formidable opponent .
" I think she 's already a very strong personality and has the potential to be a very strong candidate , " he said .
As for his own plans , the former House speaker , who 's flirted with presidential bids in previous cycles only to back out , said he 'd decide on a run early next year .
" Calista and I , along with our family , will make that decision in February or March , " he said .
" For the moment , I 'm totally focused on trying to help Republicans win the biggest possible election this fall . "

The event ' hosts ' included a lobbyist that represented bank associations and accounting firms on the Troubled Asset Relief Program , a program to which Pawlenty has expressed opposition .
Pawlenty lunches with lobbyists
Minnesota GOP Gov. Tim Pawlenty made a stop for cash in Washington on Monday , holding a fundraiser at a downtown law firm with a handful of insiders and lobbyists .
Tickets for the lunch started at $ 500 with those identified as “ co-hosts ” of the event having to give or raise $ 2,500 for Pawlenty ’s political action committee , Freedom First PAC , according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO .

Representatives of other PACs invited to the event were encouraged to donate $ 1,000 .
Among the 10 named “ hosts ” of the event was Sam Geduldig , a lobbyist for Clark Lytle & Geduldig who lobbied on the Troubled Asset Relief Program on behalf of banking associations and several accounting firms , though did not help firms acquire funds .
Pawlenty has expressed opposition to the program .
Six of the other “ hosts ” are also registered lobbyists , according to the Senate database , working for industries ranging from biodiesel to subprime mortgages .
Brian Brooks , another one of the fundraisers ’ “ hosts , ” is not a registered lobbyist , but boasts of having “ four of the largest subprime mortgage lenders and servicers in state attorney general investigations and litigation , and in nationwide class actions ” on the website of O’Melveny & Myers , a law firm with offices around the world .
A spokesman for the Minnesota governor , a likely contender for the GOP presidential nomination , declined to comment on the event , noting its private nature — the fundraiser was not announced by Pawlenty 's PAC .
The spokesman also declined to provide details on who else attended the fundraiser or how much Pawlenty was able to haul from the event .
Prior to the fundraising lunch , Pawlenty sat down with members of the Washington press corps for a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor .
In his remarks , Pawlenty said he hopes GOP wins this fall could create a new generation of talent that refutes the idea that Republicans are “ a bunch of country - club elitists . ”
CORRECTION : An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the Sam Geduldig ’s work with respect to the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
He lobbied on the TARP bill for banking associations and accounting firms but did help firms acquire funds .
The Press has to stay away from the Gulf Spill 65 feet from any area the Coast Guard determines …
The press might impede progress … oh like when the President visits ?
Effectively reporting on the Gulf oil spill is now a Class D felony , punishable by a fine of up to $ 40,000 .
That ’s right , the most transparent administration in history has made it a felony , effective July 1 , to get within 65 feet of what the Coast Guard determines are essential recovery efforts .
According to Anderson Cooper , officials tried to up that number to 300 feet .
Cooper , who claimed federal officials prevented CNN on two occasions from taking photographs in the gulf , seemed frustrated when he reported on the new laws the day they went into effect .
The press is “ not the enemy here ” he pleaded .
The new policies , he said , make it “ very easy to hide failure , and hide incompetence . ”
Cooper also let loose this zinger : “ Transparency is apparently not a priority with [ Coast Guard Commandant ] Thad Allen these days . ”

( CNN ) -- Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February 2008 was legal , the International Court of Justice ruled in a 10 - 4 vote Thursday .
There were celebrations in Pristina , with fireworks being set off in the capital of Kosovo after the finding was announced , journalist Vlora Rrustemi told CNN .
But Serbia 's Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic expressed disappointment , saying Belgrade had hoped for a " peaceful compromise solution " that did not create " dangerous secessionist precedents " elsewhere in the world .
The U.N. General Assembly asked the court to clarify the legality of Kosovo 's declaration of independence , based on a request from Serbia , and the court held hearings last December .
Serbia maintains Kosovo 's move for independence was illegal and that it remains a part of the Serbian republic .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called the president of Serbia before the court made its announcement , the White House said .
Biden told Boris Tadic that Washington fully supports " a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo , and he reiterated the United States ' unwavering commitment to Kosovo 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " the administration said .
He urged Serbia to work with Kosovo to resolve their problems , and also " affirmed the strong and deep ties between the United States and Serbia . "
Thursday 's verdict was not legally binding .
It 's an advisory opinion , not a judgment , a court spokeswoman said .
The United Nations General Assembly therefore remains free to decide what action to take .
Such opinions still carry great legal weight , however , and Thursday 's verdict could set the tone for Kosovo 's relations with other countries .
The court considered written statements from 36 U.N. member states , including Serbia , along with Kosovo .
Since the declaration of independence , many countries , including the United States and United Kingdom , have recognized Kosovo as an independent state .
Many countries -- such as Russia , China , neighboring Bosnia , and the European nations of Spain and Greece -- have not , however .
The court 's opinion could also encourage other separatist regions to declare independence .
The General Assembly made its request for clarification after Serbian President Boris Tadic told members that Kosovo's " unilateral , illegal , illegitimate " move meant " the very nature of the international system has been called into question . "
Serbia then put forward a resolution to ask the International Court for an advisory opinion , and member states voted overwhelmingly in favor of it in October 2008 .

Free -agent linebacker Keith Bulluck officially joined the New York Giants on Saturday , after nailing a private workout Monday in the oppressive Meadowlands heat .
But he unofficially joined them in March in the cold Manhattan rain .
Coming off ACL surgery just seven months ago , with no team to supervise his recovery , Bulluck spent most of his spring rehabbing in New York .
In the process , he fell back in love with the city of his youth -- and signed Saturday with the Giants , making it the city of his immediate future .
Bulluck 's one - year deal is worth about $ 2.5 million with incentives , a league source told ESPNNewYork.com 's Ohm Youngmisuk .
" Just walking the streets of New York gave me my edge back , " said Bulluck , 33 , a former Pro Bowl player who has spent his 10 NFL seasons with the Tennessee Titans .
" Some of those walks were tough , man .
Like when it 's raining or sleeting or it 's just cold out .
And your knee aches .
I was n't 100 percent at the time .
" But the energy of it all helped me , " Bulluck added .
" Just the people , the good attitudes , the bad attitudes , just the whole vibe of the metropolitan area .
If you 're from there or have ever been there , you definitely know what I 'm talking about .
I 'd have to say this is a dream come true . "
Bulluck visited with the Arizona Cardinals after his visit with the Giants this week but it did n't take him long to make up his mind on where to play this season .
" He was pretty geeked up about both places , " Gary Wichard , Bulluck 's agent , said by telephone on Saturday .
" Next day he calls me up and he says , ' I 've been dreaming about this my whole life .
I 'm from New York .
It 's not even close . '
It was his dream to play for the Giants .
He grew up in New City .
Like all kids his age , LT [ Lawrence Taylor ] was what it is about . "
A native of New City , New York -- about 20 miles from the Meadowlands -- Bulluck fills a huge need for the Giants , who released middle linebacker Antonio Pierce in February and were trying to replace him with Jonathan Goff and Chase Blackburn .
But the Giants also fill a huge need for Bulluck , who'd been twisting in the wind ever since he blew out his left knee Dec. 20 -- two weeks before becoming an unrestricted free agent .
" It 's just hard when you 're a free agent with an injury , " he said .
" You kind of feel like after all you 've done , you 're being abandoned . "
Bulluck had 108 tackles last season in 14 games before suffering his knee injury .
Bulluck had started 127 straight games prior to the injury .
Wichard said Bulluck 's knee is n't an issue .
" He is seven months post - operation , he is ready to go , " Wichard said .
" He did n't want to visit or meet anybody until he could work out for them . "
Following the 2009 season , Bulluck was only allowed to rehab at the Titans facility through Feb. 28 -- because , as of March 1 , he was no longer a member of the organization .
And he left town miffed , because management seemed ambivalent about re-signing him .
Welcome to the city of Bell .
Average income : $ 24,800 , $ 8,000 less than the national average .
Public debt per capita : $ 1,972 , up from $ 599 six years ago .
Average wage for the city ’s leaders ?
Well , that ’s where things get nuanced .
An overflow crowd packed a City Council meeting in Bell , a mostly Hispanic city of 38,000 about 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) southeast of Los Angeles , to call for the resignation of Mayor Oscar Hernandez and other city officials .
Residents left standing outside the chamber banged on the doors and shouted “ fuera , ” or “ get out ” in Spanish .
It was the first council meeting since the Los Angeles Times reported July 15 that Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo earns $ 787,637 — with annual 12 percent raises — and that Bell pays its police chief $ 457,000 , more than Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck makes in a city of 3.8 million people .
Bell council members earn almost $ 100,000 for part - time work …
Bell ’s general fund revenue declined 4.6 percent to $ 14.1 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30 , 2009 , according to the city ’s financial statement .
The city ’s expenses rose 2.3 percent to $ 15.9 million in same period .
The Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Office has begun an inquiry into Bell council member pay , according to Dave Demerjian , head of the office ’s Public Integrity Division .
He said Bell council members were receiving $ 8,083 a month , mostly by serving on city - related commissions …
“ It seems obscene to me , ” De La Torre said in a telephone interview .
“ People making $ 30,000 a year are paying taxes so that their council members can make $ 80,000 . ”
Mayor Hernandez ’s defense : “ Our streets are cleaner , we have lovely parks , better lighting throughout the area , our community is better . ”
Worth every penny , baby .
As enraged as most of you will be by this , you really should be grateful :
This is precisely the sort of jawdropping freak - show case of government at the trough that concentrates the average voter ’s mind on spending .
A hundred posts about the myriad ways in which the public sector is fleecing the private sector are n’t as effective as one news story about a poor little city struggling to keep its municipal overlords rolling in dough .
Thanks , Rizzo !
My friends , I fear there ’s only one man capable of dealing with this situation .

MET in person , the northern spotted owl seems an unlikely casus belli .
Last Friday , the Woodland Park Zoo here allowed me a private audience with its three captive owls , a mating pair and a lone elderly female , each of whom resembled a miniature , flecked - brown overcoat of Harris tweed .
Their eyes  unlike the eyes of most owls , which are bright yellow  were the color of dark chocolate .
Blinking slowly , rooted to their perches , they looked more wistful than wise , dreaming , perhaps , of flying squirrels , on which they like to dine in the wild , or of extinction , which still appears their likeliest fate .
The fast - disappearing owl was listed as “ threatened ” under the Endangered Species Act 20 years ago last week .
At the time , it was the ideal “ indicator species ” of the health of Northwest old - growth forest habitat  the squelchy , dank - smelling , multistory ecosystem , where the ground is strewn with rotting ancient trees , called “ snags ” and “ nurse logs , ” and the jungled undergrowth of ferns , vines , berries , moss and fungi shelters a great multitude of creatures , from bears and cougars to newts and banana slugs .
It was this irreplaceable ecosystem , centuries in the making , that environmentalists were really trying to protect under the terms of the act ( whose first declared purpose is to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend ) ; and the owl was their best available legal tool .
Environmentalists saw the land as a sacred space , to be venerated and conserved in honor of what Emerson called “ the occult relation between man and the vegetable . ”
But for the timber industry , long accustomed to clear - cutting in federal forests , it was a commodity , a renewable resource to be cut down , regrown and cut down again .
There was no reconciling the two philosophies .
On one side , the forest primeval , the murmuring pines and the hemlocks , the inviolate wilderness ; on the other , people and their histories and traditions , jobs , communities , an economy based entirely on timber .
When the owl was listed , the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest was already facing difficulties for economic reasons , but in the ailing milling and logging towns , the hapless owl was seized on as the scapegoat .
In January 1991 , an Olympic National Park ranger found a spotted owl nailed to a sign by the road to the visitor center , a red - tipped kitchen match protruding from its breast , and a typewritten note attached to the corpse .
“ If you think your parks and wilderness do n’t have enough of these suckers , plant this one , ” it read .
“ They talk of social unrest .
The match has yet to be struck . ”

SALT LAKE CITY -- Police have arrested a city attorney who they say tried to buy drugs .
He knows how undercover drug operations work , because he 's prosecuted people who have been caught in them .
My reaction was shock because I had no idea whatsoever that Mr. Nielsen had any of these types of issues at all .
– City Manager Barry Edwards
But now the North Salt Lake City Attorney is on the other side of a case -- as the defendant .
Police conduct undercover drug operations in the area of Pioneer Park in downtown Salt Lake City several times a month .
They say they had no idea during a recent sting they had arrested a city attorney .
" If these allegations are true then I am very disappointed , " said North Salt Lake City Manager Barry Edwards .
" Disappointed for him and his family and hope he can get his arms around this issue . "
Colleagues of D. Michael Nielsen say they did n't have a clue he had been arrested and booked into jail until contacted by KSL for this story .
In fact , Edwards thought it was a joke until he was shown Nielsen 's mug shot .
D. Michael Nielsen
" My reaction was shock because I had no idea whatsoever that Mr. Nielsen had any of these types of issues at all , " Edwards said .
On the night of June 27 , Salt Lake City narcotics officers were conducting a sting near Pioneer Park .
They nabbed 18 people who were allegedly trying to sell or buy drugs from undercover officers .
One of them was Nielsen , whom police say tried to buy cocaine .
" Normally this was a Class A misdemeanor charge , but in this case it was within about 1,000 feet of the Greek Orthodox Church so that actually enhanced it up to a third - degree felony , " said Sgt. Robin Snyder with the Salt Lake City Police Department .
A third - degree felony arrest means a trip to jail .
But after the incident Nielsen returned to work , resumed his duties as North Salt Lake 's attorney and did n't tell his supervisors about his arrest .
" We had a city council meeting last night and he was there , " Edwards said .
Because the incident happened within 1,000 feet of the Greek Orthodox Church , Nielsen is facing a third - degree felony rather than a misdemeanor .
Edwards is trying to give Nielsen the benefit of the doubt , but after speaking with KSL , he says Nielsen admitted to the arrest and said he plans to resign from his position as the city 's attorney .
" He 's always been a bright and great guy , " Edwards said .
" I just hope that this has a happy ending somehow . "
North Salt Lake plans to hold a special city council meeting to discuss Nielsen 's arrest .
Calls to Nielsen have not yet been returned .

On abortion rights , Ruth Bader Ginsburg said yesterday , " We will never go back to the way it once was . "
The audience erupted in " huge applause " .
But did she mean what they thought she meant ?

Politico , too , led with , " Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declared Thursday that abortions would continue to be available to women regardless of the legal challenges now being waged by opponents of Roe v. Wade . "
Which makes it sound like Ginsburg said it would n't matter if Roe were overturned because , as she actually did say , " Over a generation of young women have grown up , understanding they can control their own reproductive capacity , and in fact their life 's destiny . "
( The headline is even more misleading : " Ginsburg : Roe will hold , " something she does not appear to have actually said . )
Her full remarks have not yet been put online by the Aspen Ideas Festival , her venue for making them , but judging from the Daily Beast account , Ginsburg actually was n't declaring that reproductive rights would remain protected for the foreseeable future — at least , not all women :
If the court were to change its mind , " there wo n't be any real change for anyone in this audience or any daughters of anyone in this audience , " Ginsburg said .
" The only women who would be truly affected are poor women .
Because even at the time before Roe , women who wanted abortions could have a safe , legal abortion … Women could travel from one state to another and did n't have to go to Japan or Cuba … Whatever the court may do , it 's only the poor women who will suffer .
When people realize that , maybe they will have a different attitude . "

Maybe .
Or maybe they do n't really care about what happens to poor women .
Hopefully — with Ginsburg on board — we never have to find out .
Ginsburg : Roe Will Hold [ Politico ]
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Talks About Abortion Rights [ Daily Beast ]
This was a bad World Cup for a lot of old favourites – anybody who appeared on the Nike ad , Marcello Lippi , preconceptions about Africa – but none of them had quite such a miserable tournament as 4 - 4 - 2 .
When even its old friend Michael Owen starts doubting it , the future for the formation that has ruled British football for 40 years looks bleak .
Johan Cruyff got stuck in as well last week – not particularly surprisingly given his lifelong ideological insistence on 4 - 3 - 3 – pointing out that " the numbers do n't match up " and explaining that a system of three straight bands does n't lend itself to the creation of passing triangles .
This has always been an axiom : all else being equal , a triangle will always beat a line , and the Cruyff mode of play has always been predicated on the creation of triangles .
A 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , with its W shape in midfield , is essentially comprised of interlocking triangles .
Which raises the question of why , if 4 - 4 - 2's disadvantages are so obvious , it has survived for so long ?
To start with , it should be made clear that Cruyff is speaking about his particular vision of football , which is rooted in ball possession and pressing , something that caused him , even before the game , to align himself with Spain rather than Holland in the World Cup final .
That is one way to play – and the recent success of Barcelona and Spain shows it is a successful way to play – but it certainly is n't the only way .
That a short - passing , technique - based game is n't for everybody was demonstrated very clearly in a tournament in which many people preferred the more dynamic , if more reactive , football of Germany .
Those passing triangles are only important for a side looking to dominate possession .
For a side looking to disrupt that , 4 - 4 - 2 can be extremely effective – the famous " two banks of four " that for a long time seemed to be such a feature of any English team playing an away game in European competition .
Fulham showed last season how effective the style can still be .
Sit the midfield line deep on the back four so there is minimal space between the lines for attacking midfielders or deep - lying forwards to exploit , and it becomes very hard to penetrate .
It does n't matter how many triangles you create if you never get the ball closer than 35 yards from the opposition goal .
Think of Gérard Houllier 's Liverpool away to Roma in the Uefa Cup in 2001 , with Owen and Robbie Fowler left high upfield , often 50 yards and more from the midfield : keep it tight , make sure of the clean sheet , and if , as in that case , Owen can pilfer two goals , that 's a bonus .
Think of Fulham in the Europa League semi-final against Hamburg .
Slovenia 's method both in qualifying and at this World Cup , although slightly more possession - based , was n't dissimilar , particularly after Zlatan Ljubijankic had replaced Zlatko Dedic .
Ljubijankic is a more technical player and a better finisher than Dedic , but he does n't drop off and does n't forage which , at least against England – a game in which Slovenia played with such trepidation you wondered if anybody had told them Stan Mortensen and Tom Finney had retired – left Valter Birsa 's occasional forays on the right as the only bridge between midfield and attack .
Sacchi's squeeze and the modern stretch
So 4 - 4 - 2 has a future as a reactive formation , yet it was also the preferred formation of Arrigo Sacchi , probably the most proactive coach of all .
It was the system 's defensive attributes , though , that made it work for him .
The great strength of the Milan of the late 80s was its pressing , with Sacchi demanding an ideal of 25 metres from centre - forward to centre - back when his side were out of possession .
They squeezed high up the pitch , and so 4 - 4 - 2 made sense because a four - man midfield meant each member of the back four was protected by a midfielder and so was less likely to be isolated ( which , with acres of space behind him , was a real concern ) .
Possession was less of a concern for Sacchi .
I recently watched Milan 's 5 - 0 victory over Real Madrid in the second leg of the semi-final of the 1989 European Cup , and was struck by how often ( comparatively speaking ) they gave the ball away .
Madrid , for long periods , looked the better side on the ball , but were undone by the dynamism of Sacchi 's side ( although 5 - 0 was still a freakish scoreline ) .
It 's probably the case that , as Egil Olsen posited in a more pragmatic context , a team have to choose between prioritising possession and position on the field .
Pressing is still part of the game , and Barcelona and Spain both perform the high press excellently , but it has been made harder to execute because of the liberalisation of the offside law .
The effective playing area has been stretched , and as a result , three - band systems have increasingly been replaced by four - band systems .
Perhaps it is just about conceivable that , if players could be persuaded to put their egos to one side ( and that could be an issue for Roy Hodgson if he attempts to apply the Fulham system at Liverpool this season ) , a club team could still be drilled into an effective pressing 4 - 4 - 2 , but achieving that level of discipline is an exhausting , demoralisingly boring process that became too much even for Milan after three seasons ; it was very hard to implement then , with the change in the offside law and players enjoying greater freedom to change clubs it is even harder now .
At international level , anyway , where the time available to work with players is limited and they are fatigued by club commitments , it is impossible , something even Sacchi was forced to acknowledge .
4 - 4 - 2 is n't dead
What the World Cup has done is to expose the problems 4 - 4 - 2 without hard pressing faces , and not just in terms of being outnumbered in midfield ; with the stretching of the effective playing area , the midfield band can become exposed , with space in front of it and space behind it .
That gap between defensive and midfield lines was precisely the space Mesut Ozil exploited so well in the first half of Germany 's victory over England ( this space , as Matthias Sindelar , Alfred Bickel , Laszlo Kubala , Nandor Hidegkuti , Pelé , Günter Netzer , Diego Maradona , Ruud Gullit , Zinedine Zidane , Rui Costa and Juan Román Riquelme and countless others have demonstrated , has always been a problem for England , and that weakness is one of the reasons Eric Cantona , Dennis Bergkamp and Gianfranco Zola were so successful in the Premier League in the 90s ) .
Quite apart from the furious search for immediate justice that followed the non-award of a goal after Frank Lampard 's shot had crossed the line , it may be that a desire to compress that area was partly behind England 's suicidally high line in the second half of that game .
And yet when the Premier League begins again next month , probably around half the sides will be playing 4 - 4 - 2 , and not all as a stifling tactic .
That is not because of a lack of tactical sophistication , or at least not just because of a lack of tactical sophistication : 4 - 4 - 2 , to those brought up in Britain , is the default ; it 's what every player is brought up to understand .
A five - man midfield , however it is arrayed , brings its own problems , perhaps most obviously that it can be difficult , particularly for less technical teams , to get men forward to support the lone striker .
Below the very highest level , it may be that it is better simply to let players do what comes naturally .
Then there is the issue of personnel , particularly at clubs with a relatively limited budget .
At Sunderland , for instance , Steve Bruce may like the idea of 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , but when he has Kenwyne Jones and Darren Bent forming a potent partnership , it makes little sense to disrupt it , even if the corollary is that he occasionally loses control of midfield .
Sunderland 's form last season notably improved when Steed Malbranque moved to the left and began cutting infield , effectively giving Sunderland an auxiliary central midfielder and bringing them greater control in the centre .
So 4 - 4 - 2 is n't dead , but the World Cup confirmed that the trend of the past decade at the highest level is against it .

Think of North Korea , and repression , starvation and military provocation are probably the first things that come to mind .
But beyond the geopolitical posturing , North Korea has also been quietly building up its IT industry .
Offshoring : The 25 Most Dangerous Cities for Outsourcing in 2010
Universities have been graduating computer engineers and scientists for several years , and companies have recently sprung up to pair the local talent with foreign needs , making the country perhaps the world 's most unusual place for IT outsourcing .
With a few exceptions , such as in India , outsourcing companies in developing nations tend to be small , with fewer than 100 employees , said Paul Tija , a Rotterdam - based consultant on offshoring and outsourcing .
But North Korea already has several outsourcers with more then 1,000 employees .
" The government is putting an emphasis on building the IT industry , " he said .
" The availability of staff is quite large . "
At present , the country 's outsourcers appear to be targeting several niche areas , including computer animation , data input and software design for mobile phones .
U.S. government restrictions prevent American companies from working with North Korean companies , but most other nations do n't have such restrictions .
The path to IT modernization began in the 1990s but was cemented in the early 2000s when Kim Jong
Il , the de-facto leader of the country , declared people who could n't use computers to be one of the three fools of the 21st century .
( The others , he said , are smokers and those ignorant of music . )
But outsourcing in North Korea is n't always easy .
Language can be a problem , and a lack of experience dealing with foreign companies can sometimes slow business dealings , said Tija .
But the country has one big advantage .
" It is one of the most competitive places in the world .
There are not many other countries where you can find the same level of knowledge for the price , " said Tija .
The outsourcer with the highest profile is probably Nosotek .
The company , established in 2007 , is also one of the few Western IT ventures in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital .
" I understood that the North Korean IT industry had good potential because of their skilled software engineers , but due to the lack of communication it was almost impossible to work with them productively from outside , " said Volker Eloesser , president of Nosotek .
" So I took the next logical step and started a company here . "
Nosotek uses foreign expats as project managers to provide an interface between customers and local workers .
In doing so it can deliver the level of communication and service its customers expect , Eloesser said .
On its Web site the company boasts access to the best programmers in Pyongyang .
" You find experts in all major programming languages , 3D software development , 3D modelling and design , various kind of server technologies , Linux , Windows and Mac , " he said .
Nosotek 's main work revolves around development of Flash games and games for mobile phones .
It 's had some success and claims that one iPhone title made the Apple Store Germany 's top 10 for at least a week , though it would n't say which one .
Several Nosotek - developed games are distributed by Germany 's Exonet Games , including one block - based game called " Bobby 's Blocks . "
" They did a great job with their latest games and the communication was always smooth , " said Marc Busse , manager of digital distribution at the Leipzig - based company .
" There 's no doubt I would recommend Nosotek if someone wants to outsource their game development to them . "
Eloesser admits there are some challenges to doing business from North Korea .
" The normal engineer has no direct access to the Internet due to government restrictions .
This is one of the main obstacles when doing IT business here , " he said .
Development work that requires an Internet connection is transferred across the border to China .
But perhaps the biggest problem faced by North Korea 's nascent outsourcing industry is politics .
Sanctions imposed on the country by the United States make it all but impossible for American companies to trade with North Korea .
" I know several American companies that would love to start doing IT outsourcing in North Korea , but because of political reasons and trade embargoes they can't , " Tija said .
Things are n't so strict for companies based elsewhere , including those in the European Union , but the possible stigma of being linked to North Korea and its ruling regime is enough to make some companies think twice .
The North Korean government routinely practices arbitrary arrest , detention , torture and ill treatment of detainees , and allows no political opposition , free media or religious freedom , according to the most recent annual report from Human Rights Watch .
Hundreds of thousands of citizens are kept in political prison camps , and the country carries out public executions , the organization said .
With this reputation some companies might shy away from doing business with the country , but Exonet Games did n't have any such qualms , said Busse .
" It 's not like we worked with the government , " he said .
" We just worked with great people who have nothing to do with the dictatorship . "

Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee appears to be ignoring that age - old advice , taking several moments during a recent Fox News broadcast to attack veteran White House reporter Helen Thomas over her opinion on the Israel - Palestine conflict — in spite of his own remarkably similar comments on Palestinians .

Thomas had remarked to a Rabbi that Palestine is “ occupied ” by Israel , which should “ get the hell out . ”
“ [ Jews ] can go home , Poland , Germany , and America and everywhere else , ” she said , sparking a swell of criticism , both from her colleagues and critics .
“ I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians , ” she later said on her Web site .
“ They do not reflect my heart - felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance .
May that day come soon . ”
Huckabee called her apology “ pretty lame . ”
“ Her comments were outrageous , anti-Semitic , racist , indefensible , ” he said on Sunday .
“ She says that the Jews ought to go home .
Helen , they are home .
They are home .
Read Genesis 15 , Exodus 23 , Numbers 34 , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why they are where they are .
Helen , IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve got a suggestion , maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s time for you to go home . ”

However , Huckabee told right - wing conspiracy site World - Net Daily in 2008 that he believes Palestine to be illegally located on Israeli land , suggesting that Palestinians should just go somewhere else .
“ There is only one place on earth where the Jewish people could have a homeland that is consistent with their roots , whereas the Palestinians can create their homeland in many other places in the Middle East , outside Israel , ” he said , leveraging the comment to slam a proposed two - state peace solution .
Huckabee has repeatedly said he ’s vehemently against Israel recognizing the Palestinian state .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The question is should the Palestinians have a place to call their own ? ” he added in a separate interview noted by Washington Independent .
“ Yes , I have no problem with that .
Should it be in the middle of the Jewish homeland ?
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s what I think has to be honestly assessed as virtually unrealistic .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
He has not apologized .
“ [ Huckabee ’s position is ] not just at odds with Washington , ” commented Washington Independent ’s Spencer Ackerman .
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a stance at odds with the entire international community , pretty much every Israeli government of the past 15 years and , as Amjad Atallah writes , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s even to the right of Hamas . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Liberal watchdog blog Think Progress added : “ Moreover , HuckabeeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s suggestion that the Bible be used to justify international boundaries and dictate foreign policy seems to be both a violation of the separation of church and state , and dangerously out of touch with reality .
Would Huckabee endorse expanding Israel to cover the entire area
God promised to Abraham Ã¢â‚¬â€  which would stretch from ‘ the river of Egypt to the great river , the Euphrates , ’ including much of modern - day Egypt , Jordan , and Syria Ã¢â‚¬â€  and kick out the local populations along the way ? ”
In spite of his comments on Palestine , Huckabee continues to be a paid contributor at Fox News and has not been called upon to resign .
Thomas , who resigned on Monday morning , effective “ immediately , ” covered every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy for the UPI wire service , then as an opinion columnist for Hearst Newspapers .
She turns 90 in August .

From the Department of You Just Can't Make This Stuff Up , check out this little - noticed report from the Billings Gazette today :
Liz Fowler , a key staffer for U.S. Sen.
Max Baucus
who helped draft the federal health reform bill enacted in March , is
joining the Obama administration to help implement the new law ...
Fowler headed up a team of 20 - some Senate Finance Committee staffers
who helped draft the bill in the Senate .
She was Baucus ' top health care
aide from 2001 - 2005 and left that job in 2006 to become an
executive at WellPoint , the nation 's largest private insurer .
She was
vice president of public policy at WellPoint , helping develop
public - policy positions for the company .
In 2008 , she rejoined Baucus to
work on health reform legislation .
For some good background on Fowler and the insidious role she played
in killing the public option , watch Bill Moyers ' recent segment here .
Clearly , this is a telling indictment of the health care law
itself , strongly suggesting that it was constructed by the Obama
administration - as some progressives argued - as a massive
taxpayer - financed giveaway to private insurers like Wellpoint .
And let's
be honest :
In investment terms , Fowler has been a jackpot for the
health industry .
The industry maximized her public policy experience for
their own uses when they plucked her out of the Senate .
Then , having
lined her pockets , they deposited her first into a key Senate committee
to write the new health care law that they will operate under , and now
into the administration that will implement said law .
Any bets on how
much Fowler will make when Wellpoint ( or another health insurer )
inevitably rehires her in a few years ?
This story is also a telling indictment of the Washington media .
You 'll notice that the Obama administration 's move was reported by the
Billings Gazette , but ( save for a blog entry on the Hill 's website , one context - free line at the bottom of the Washington Post 's gossip column , and a blurb in Congressional Quarterly 's HealthBeat newsletter ) was almost completely ignored by national Washington - based publications .
That 's not because D.C. reporters did n't know it was happening - more
likely , it is because the political press corps in the nation 's capital
no longer sees this kind of revolving door corruption as even mildly
problematic , much less newsworthy .
That 's how pervasive corruption is
these days - ubiquitous to the point of invisible in the eyes of most of
the so - called watchdogs .
Torrential rain has prompted a weather bureau warning of flash flooding across eastern Sydney , including the CBD .
And what is being reported as a twister tore the roof off a garage in Macpherson Street , Bronte , about 11.25 am , police said .
Two people - a woman and a child were home at the time , but neither were injured .
Weatherzone.com.au meteorologist Martin Palmer said there were reports of a small spout but was impossible to record such events .
He said that there was a very low risk that another spout would hit the east coast of Sydney within the next 12 hours .
Weatherzone.com.au is owned by Fair fax Media .
The severe weather warning was issued shortly before 2 pm today , with advice not to drive , cycle or walk through floodwaters .
ABC ran the entire pilot episode for No Ordinary Family today at Comic - Con , followed by a brief Q&A session with Greg Berlanti , John Harman Felman , and stars Michael Chiklis and Julie Benz .
It looks promising .
It ’s a little hard to pin down , genre - wise .
It ’s not a super - hero show , but it has super - powers ( and lots of references that comic book readers will catch ) .
It ’s not really an action show , though there is some action involved .
I ’d say it ’s primarily a family drama with comedic and action highlights .
On one hand , there is a bit of an Incredibles vibe to it :
It ’s about a family with super - powers , the father is trying to reclaim his glory days by going out and secretly fighting crime , etc .
But it ’s different enough not to feel like a retread .
For one thing , the powers are new , and it ’s set ( like Heroes ) in a real - world setting that has n’t seen super - powers before .
The pilot is structured as an interview with flashbacks , first with Jim Powell speaking , then with Stephanie Powell taking over , then switching back and forth .
The episode shows the characters and how they relate , then shows each of them discovering their powers , then delves into how those powers affect them .
Edit :
You do eventually find out who they ’re talking to .
Sort of like Freshmen , they all gain powers related to their self - perceived shortcomings .
Jim ( Michael Chiklis ) is a police sketch artist who feels like he can’t measure up .
He gains powers similar to the Golden - Age Superman : strength , can catch bullets , some invulnerability but not completely , and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound .
( He discovers that he ca n’t fly in , I believe , the same alley where Peter Petrelli attempts the same experiment . )
Stephanie is a research scientist , head of R&D for a biotech company , and is so busy that she ’s constantly falling behind in one thing or another .
Naturally , she gains super - speed .
The scene where she first bursts out running is one of the better depictions of super - speed that I ’ve seen I hate to compare it to The Incredibles again , because visually it ’s entirely different , but it manages to capture the same sense of wonder that Dash ’s first all - out run does .
The effects for that sequence are also more elaborate than later scenes ( which mostly make use of the standard blur - and - wind technique ) , adding in distortion , shock waves , and a mix of high - speed and slow motion .
Their daughter Daphne is dealing with social pressures as a teenager , and is constantly texting .
She picks up telepathy ( which , as we know from Buffy the Vampire Slayer , is not easy to deal with in high school ) .
Their son JJ may have a learning disability ( Stephanie refuses to admit the possibility , so he has n’t been tested ) , and when the super - powers start breaking out , he seems once again to have been left behind .
The effects team has managed to find a way to provide visual cues for non-visible powers .
Rounding out the cast are Jim ’s friend , the DA , to whom he confides his powers immediately , a detective who will probably be the main “ hide the powers from her ! ” character , and a lab tech to whom Stephanie reveals her abilities because she ’s both a scientist and a comic - book fan .
Edit :
The scenes with the confidantes are great , particularly the DA ’s changing reaction to Jim ’s powers , and Stephanie ’s assistant ’s gleeful hypothesizing as they start running experiments to see just how fast she is .
( After all , what else would a scientist do after getting super - powers ?
Experiment ! )
Thankfully , they do n’t drag the “ hide the powers from the significant other ” plot out longer than a few minutes — and the hiding is presented as a symptom of their fracturing relationship , not as the standard Silver Age “ I must lie to my girlfriend in order to protect her ” line .
From the discussion it sounds like they will be making some adjustments to the pilot to set up more elements for the series .
I ’m not 100 % sold on it yet , and at moments it is a bit sappy for my tastes , but I ’ll definitely be giving it a shot when it airs this fall .

Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) -- Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio calls himself " America 's toughest sheriff . "
He is famous for creating a tent city jail in the Arizona desert ; for providing pink underwear for inmates ; for bragging that he spends more to feed his dog than a prisoner in his jail .
This year he has made national headlines for his tough enforcement of Arizona 's anti-illegal immigration laws and for his vocal support for a controversial new immigration law that takes effect at the end of July .
But the 77 - year - old lawman is himself the subject of serious allegations of abuse of power .
Arpaio 's critics say he has a long history of launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents and anyone else who gets in his way .
This year a federal grand jury started looking into the allegations .
Former Maricopa County School Superintendent Sandra
Dowling says what happened to her is a case in point .
Dowling says was locked in a political battle with some members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors over school district funds when the sheriff 's SWAT team came in the dead of night to search her home .
Dowling was charged with stealing money from a school for homeless students .
There were 25 felony counts in all .
" Never could I have imagined what a nightmare was waiting ahead , " Dowling said .
Arpaio promised to uncover massive public corruption -- " We are looking into all avenues of this investigation , " he said -- and to win a speedy conviction .
From the start Dowling maintained her innocence : " I kept saying I did n't do anything .
I did n't do anything . "
It took three years , but finally a judge threw out all the felony counts against Dowling .
She entered a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor charge .
But she said her reputation had been shattered , her career destroyed , and she owed more than $ 100,000 in legal fees .
" I still do n't think that everybody knows I was innocent , " she said .
Dowling is not alone .
Arpaio has launched -- either on his own or in conjunction with the county attorney -- high - profile criminal investigations against a who 's who of Maricopa County politicians and officials .
The list includes the mayor of Phoenix , a former police chief , two members of the board of supervisors , Superior Court judges , and even a former state attorney general .
The charges have included public corruption , misuse of taxpayers ' dollars , bribery , rape and even child molestation .
What all these investigations hold in common is that they were launched with great public fanfare , but rarely resulted in convictions .
Among the investigations recounted in this report , the only conviction has been on the misdemeanor charge against Dowling .
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon calls the sheriff 's long list of investigations a " reign of terror . "
Gordon came under Arpaio 's scrutiny , he says , after speaking out against the sheriff 's neighborhood sweeps to round up illegal immigrants .
The mayor says he received a torrent of records requests from sheriff 's investigators , and he was later told that he was under investigation on possible child molestation charges .
Gordon says the sheriff " bragged that he was watching my office from his office with a telescope . "
The sheriff 's department confirmed that Gordon was investigated on child molestation accusations .
In the end charges were never filed .
" He is a coward , " said former Buckeye , Arizona , Police Chief Dan Saban .
In 2004 Saban challenged Arpaio 's bid for a fourth term in the sheriff 's office .
That was when the local news reported that Arpaio was investigating his rival on charges of rape .
It was a claim made by Sabin 's foster mother .
She claimed the rape occurred 30 years earlier , when Saban was only 15 years old .
Saban says he was the victim , not the foster mother .
Once again charges were never filed .
But Saban noted the sheriff alerted the media to the details of the sordid accusation .
" They put out a media campaign against me , " he said .
" That I was the subject of a criminal probe . "
It sounds familiar to County Supervisor Don Stapley .
" They indicted me on 118 counts . " he said , " none of which I 'm guilty of . "
Those 118 counts of public corruption against Stapley made big headlines before they were thrown out of court by a judge .
Arpaio has refilled many of those charges and Stapley is still fighting to clear his name .
Arpaio turned down CNN requests for an interview , citing the federal grand jury investigation and a series of threatened lawsuits from these and other cases .
However , one of Arpaio 's long - time assistants was eager to defend his boss .
Deputy Chief John MacIntyre says that in each and every case , the sheriff 's investigations were fully justified .
" Was there probable cause ?
There was a ton of probable cause , " he said .
In the rape investigation of the sheriff 's political rival , Saban , for example , MacIntyre says it was a case the sheriff had to investigate .
" We did n't make up the mother 's testimony , " he said .
" It came in here like a bombshell . "
MacIntyre says it was just coincidence that the sheriff benefited when the story was leaked to the press .
Andrew Thomas is another Arpaio ally .
He is the former Maricopa County attorney who participated in a number of Arpaio 's high - profile cases .
He is currently running for the Arizona attorney general 's office .
He , too , defends Arpaio 's investigations , saying , " The reality is these were legitimate cases that needed to be brought . "
" It was n't just brought up out of thin air , there was evidence to back up those cases , " he said .
The sheriff 's critics , he said , are " being portrayed as martyrs and I feel that 's absolutely inaccurate . "
Thomas paints a picture of Maricopa County as a pit of corruption that includes the judicial system , which he blames for his lack of convictions .
" We had to go into courts where the judges were collaborating with the targets of the investigations , " he said .
" They were working together to thwart investigations ( and ) prosecutions . "
The Arizona Bar Association takes a different view .
Its ethics committee is currently considering a case against Thomas for his role in Arpaio 's investigations of public officials , the association said .
MacIntyre says it is up to the public to untangle the web of political intrigue surrounding Phoenix and its environs .
" The electorate is going to have to say we do n't want to do this anymore , and we will vote one or more people out , " he said .
" Right now the sheriff 's polls indicate that the public still supports him rather overwhelmingly . "
Whether the grand jury investigation or the threatened lawsuits bring change remains to be seen .
Mike Lacey , a newspaper editor who was once arrested after criticizing Arpaio , says the end is not yet in sight : " If you are a critic of the sheriff , or if you represent an opportunity for publicity , you become a target for this man . "
The US National Security Agency ( NSA ) is embarking on a secret domestic surveillance project dubbed " Perfect Citizen " , intended to monitor and protect important national infrastructure such as power grids and transport systems .
The Wall Street Journal , citing unnamed government and industry sources , says that the NSA has awarded a " black " ( classified ) $ 100 m contract to defence contractor Raytheon which will see secret monitoring equipment installed within US networks deemed to be of national importance .
According to the WSJ , Perfect Citizen has caused some disquiet among those in the know .
It could be seen as the NSA - a military combat support agency whose focus is supposed to be on external threats - carrying out massive automated surveillance of American companies and citizens .
The paper quotes an internal Raytheon email as saying that " Perfect Citizen is Big Brother " .
The stated purpose of the project is to get a clear idea of the level of threat facing American infrastructure IT .
Many older systems , designed in the pre-network world , have since been hooked up to the internet for ease of use and maintenance .
It is feared by some in the US intelligence / defence community that unfriendly powers and organisations are already engaged in probing these systems with a view to learning how to attack them .
The NSA 's Perfect Citizen equipment would be designed to flag up unusual network events indicating an impending cyber attack , according to the WSJ 's sources .
" You 've got to instrument the network to know what 's going on , so you have situational awareness to take action , " an unnamed military source told the paper .
Many of the networks that the NSA would wish to place Perfect Citizen equipment on are privately owned , however , and some could also potentially carry information offering scope for " mission creep " outside an infrastructure - security context .
For instance , full access to power company systems might allow the NSA to work out whether anyone was at home at a given address .
Transport and telecoms information would also make for a potential bonanza for intrusive monitoring .
The full scope of the project remains to be determined , according to the WSJ report , with no certainty as yet on which companies or types of companies would be asked to cooperate - or how much information the NSA would get access to .
The NSA - whose boss has now also been confirmed as head of the Pentagon 's uniformed Cyber Command - apparently got the job by default , as it is considered the only US agency with enough network and cyber savvy to take the task on .
The Reg has contacted Raytheon and the NSA for comment on Perfect Citizen , but thus far has not received any reply . ®
The Sheikh Who Got Away
The coffin of Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah , covered in a black cloth embroidered in gold with verses from the Quran , wound through Beirut ’s southern suburbs July 6 , traveling from his home to the Hassanein mosque , where he used to deliver Friday sermons .
It was followed by thousands of mourners , most of them wearing black and many carrying pictures of Lebanon ’s most eminent Shiite cleric on their way to his final resting place .
Tributes poured in from across the Middle East .
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei referred to the late ayatollah as a " true companion of the Islamic Republic . "
Hassan Nasrallah , the secretary - general of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , even came out of hiding to pay his respects at Fadlallah ’s casket and offer his condolences to his family .
Nasrallah issued a statement mourning the death of " a merciful father and a wise guide . "
But the accolades did not just come from America ’s enemies .
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri , a Sunni leader considered sympathetic to the United States , called Fadlallah " a voice of moderation and an advocate of unity . "
Ali al - Adeeb , an official in Iraq ’s Dawa Party , which Fadlallah helped create , said that it " will be hard to replace him . "
Dawa Party leader and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , who has worked closely with U.S. forces in the country , counted himself among the ayatollah ’s many followers .
Even British Ambassador to Lebanon Frances
Guy offered her praise , writing that when visiting with him " you could be sure of a real debate …
and you knew you would leave his presence feeling a better person . "
Although Fadlallah may have confounded the Middle East ’s traditional fault lines , the United States never wavered on its stance toward the ayatollah :
He was the " spiritual advisor " to Hezbollah , a terrorist who was responsible for numerous attacks on U.S. interests in the region .
This grudge was formed more than a quarter - century ago , during Lebanon ’s 15 - year civil war , when the CIA reportedly sponsored a notorious plot to assassinate Fadlallah .
On March 8 , 1985 , a car bomb carrying 200 kilograms of explosives detonated outside Fadlallah ’s home in the southern suburbs of Beirut .
The bomb devastated the neighborhood , killing 80 people and wounding approximately 200 more .
Fadlallah , however , escaped without injury .
In the eyes of his followers , there was no doubt who was responsible :
They strung up a " MADE IN USA " banner over a destroyed building immediately following the attack .
The U.S. government , however , steadfastly denied any involvement .
Targeted assassinations , officials pointed out , were explicitly forbidden since Gerald Ford ’s administration .
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward ’s explosive account of CIA involvement in the Middle East , Veil : The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981 - 1987 , would eventually undermine the official denials .
Woodward , drawing on interviews with President Ronald Reagan ’s aggressive CIA Director William Casey , reported that Casey had circumvented the spy agency ’s established bureaucracy to funnel money to a professional hit team trained to assassinate Fadlallah .
It was a bloody time for the United States in Lebanon .
The 1983 U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks bombings and the 1984 attack on the U.S. Embassy annex in East Beirut had claimed the lives of hundreds of Americans .
The CIA station chief in Beirut , William Francis Buckley , was also kidnapped in 1984 and eventually died in captivity after being tortured by Hezbollah interrogators .
U.S. officials were itching for revenge .
Fadlallah " had been connected to all three bombings of Americans facilities in Beirut , " wrote Woodward .
" He had to go . "
Woodward may have gotten an explosive scoop on the inside story of the CIA ’s involvement , but he got the much easier story of Fadlallah ’s relationship with Hezbollah wrong .
In Veil , Woodward refers to Fadlallah as " the leader of the Party of God , Hizbollah , " and an " archterrorist . "
The confusion over Fadlallah ’s connection to the organization would continue to bedevil U.S officials and media until the current day .
Robert Baer , a former CIA case officer who worked in Beirut during the 1980s , denies that Fadlallah played any operational role within Hezbollah .
" I can guarantee you , and I have seen every bit of intelligence , that Fadlallah had no connection [ to the attacks ] , " he told me .
" He knew the people carrying out the terrorism acts , but he had no connection in ordering them . "
Fadlallah himself consistently denied having any official role within the Shiite militant group , even while making no apologies for supporting many of its aims .
" I live in a warm atmosphere surrounded by the youth of ‘ Hezbollah , ’ whom I consider my sons , " he said in one 1995 interview .
" However , and since the inception of Hezbollah , I was never part of its organizational structure . "
Fadlallah did have relationships with some of the highest - ranking Hezbollah officials and had never made a secret of the fact that he issued rulings offering religious sanctions for its attacks .
He enthusiastically supported attacks against Western forces in Lebanon during the civil war and continued to support attacks on Israel until his last days .
" He was n’t our friend , let ’s get that straight , " noted Baer .
" But that does n’t mean he was a master terrorist . "
Fadlallah ’s political worldview considered the Islamic world a victim of oppression and injustice at the hands of imperialism and Zionism .
Like his contemporaries in the Shiite Islamic revival of the era , he turned to the Quran for justification to overturn the status quo .
" There is no alternative to a bitter and difficult jihad , " he wrote in a 1983 article titled " The Islamic Revolution in Iran : Reflections from the Inside , " to remedy these ills .
He also provided religious legitimacy for the use of suicide operations in this religious war .
" There is no difference between dying with a gun in your hand or exploding yourself , " he reasoned .
" What is the difference between setting out for battle knowing you will die after killing ten [ enemies ] , and setting out to the field and knowing you will die while killing them ? "
While Fadlallah ’s political agenda often overlapped with Hezbollah ’s , he often parted ways with the group on important matters of religion .
He came to embody an Arab Shiism that competed for primacy with the Iranian clerics who seized power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Fadlallah distinguished himself from Iranian Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini by fusing Shiism with Arab nationalism .
" [ N ] obody can criticize the Islamists about their Arabism , " he wrote in his 1997 book Hadith Ashura .
" We are intertwined with Arabic , our Prophet was Arab , our language is Arabic , and for this reason Islam has been able to expand in the Arab circle . "
Hezbollah , with its strong religious and operational ties to Iran , recognized Khomeini and later Khamenei as its preeminent source of religious knowledge and authority .
Fadlallah supported wilayet al - faqih , Iran ’s religiously inspired system of governance , during the 1980s , under the reign of Khomeini , a respected cleric .
However , he soon broke with the system after Khomeini ’s replacement by Khamenei , who could not match his predecessor ’s religious authority .
In 1995 , Fadlallah declared himself a marja , the highest religious authority within Shiism — a step that was opposed by the Iranian religious establishment , which saw Khamenei as the proper source of emulation for the Shiite world .
Although both Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Fadlallah upon his death , they studiously avoided referring to him as a marja .
For this reason , Western claims that Fadlallah was " the spiritual advisor " to Hezbollah were particularly ironic :
Although he was clearly influential , it was on precisely the issue of Fadlallah ’s ultimate religious authority that he and the Party of God parted ways .
Starting in the 1990s , Fadlallah began to preach a more self - consciously modern version of Shiism , placing particular emphasis on scientific and rational methods .
He opposed the practice of self - flagellation on the Shiite holy day of Ashura , arguing that it accentuated sectarian differences in Lebanon rather than promoting coexistence .
His rulings in the field of gender relations have also been important :
He asserted that women were qualified to lead men in prayer and were fully capable of moving up the ranks of the Shiite clergy , up to the post of ayatollah .
In 2007 , he issued a fatwa saying that a woman could fight back in self - defense if she were beaten by her husband .
This debate was more than an internecine feud over religious principles — it had important repercussions for the political balance of power within Lebanon ’s Shiite community .
Fadlallah criticized Hezbollah openly at times , notably picking a fight with the group after it declared to its supporters that voting for the party in the 2005 parliamentary election was a religious obligation .
He argued that such " perverted practices " would eventually delegitimize religious authority .
His extensive network of schools throughout Lebanon , which enrolled 14,300 students in 2000 , produces its own religious textbooks rather than use those approved by Iran ’s religious leadership .
Just as the relationship between Fadlallah and Hezbollah was hitting a low point in the mid-1990s , the United States once again lumped the Shiite cleric in with the party .
Fadlallah was declared a " leading ideological figure " of Hezbollah and named a " Specially Designated Terrorist , " which empowered the U.S. Treasury to freeze his assets and prohibited him from conducting any future financial transactions with U.S. institutions .
Fadlallah ’s charities continued to attract the attention of the U.S. government — even causing problems for some of its erstwhile allies .
In 2003 , the United States barred then Lebanese Finance Minister Fouad Siniora from entering the country because of a donation he had made to Fadlallah ’s charity years earlier .
Siniora would go on to serve as Lebanon ’s prime minister from 2005 to 2009 , acting as a staunch supporter of U.S. policies in the region during a period when the Lebanese government confronted Syria and its domestic Lebanese allies .
Following the end of the Lebanese civil war , Fadlallah became more circumspect about justifying attacks on Western targets .
Along with Hezbollah and Iran , Fadlallah condemned the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as incompatible with Islamic law .
The attackers , he said , were not martyrs but " merely suicides . "
He attributed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden ’s motivations for carrying out the attacks to " personal psychological needs " stemming from a " tribal urge for revenge . "
He also denounced the July 7 , 2005 , attacks in London as " a kind of barbarism that Islam unequivocally rejects . "
As Fadlallah grew in stature throughout the Arab world and also seized the attention of many in Washington , the competing portrayals of him quickly failed to bear even a passing resemblance to each other .
For the U.S. government , he was an unrepentant terrorist who played an integral role in Hezbollah ’s most vicious operations .
To the mourners in Beirut , he was a fierce critic of colonialism and an important pioneer in efforts to reconcile traditional religious teaching with modernity and gender equality .
There was an element of truth to the U.S. stance : Fadlallah was certainly no liberal , nor an ally to be recruited to advance U.S. security goals .
However , even a quarter - century after that misguided assassination attempt , U.S. officials failed to appreciate the areas where their interests and Fadlallah ’s overlapped , both in isolating Iran and reducing the appeal of fundamentalism within Lebanon .
The United States always preferred blunt instruments and simple epithets — crude tools indeed for a complex man .
My earlier post C compilers Disprove Fermat ’s Last Theorem generated a good amount of discussion both here and on Reddit .
Unfortunately , the discussion was riddled with misunderstandings .
Some of this was because the topic is subtle , but some was my fault : the post was intended to be lightweight and I failed to explain the underlying issues well at all .
This post gives a more complete picture .
Our goal is to determine the meaning of this C program :
#include < stdio.h > int fermat ( void ) { const int MAX = 1000 ; int a=1 , b=1,c=1 ; while ( 1 ) { if ( ( ( a * a * a ) == ( ( b * b * b ) + ( c* c*c ) ) ) ) return 1 ; a ++ ; if ( a > MAX ) { a=1 ; b++ ; } if ( b> MAX ) { b=1 ; c++ ; } if ( c > MAX ) { c=1 ; } } return 0 ; }
int main ( void ) { if ( fermat ( ) ) { printf ( " Fermat 's Last Theorem has been disproved .
" ) ; } else { printf ( " Fermat 's Last Theorem has not been disproved .
" ) ; } return 0 ; }
This program is a simple counterexample search ; it terminates if it is able to disprove a special case of Fermat ’s Last Theorem .
Since this theorem is generally believed to be true , we would expect a counterexample search to run forever .
On the other hand , commonly available C compilers emit terminating code :
regehr@john - home : ~$ icc fermat2.c - o fermat2 regehr@john - home : ~$ ./ fermat2 Fermat 's Last Theorem has been disproved .
regehr@john - home : ~$ suncc - O fermat2.c -o fermat2 " fermat2.c " , line 20 : warning : statement not reached regehr@john - home : ~$ ./ fermat2 Fermat 's Last Theorem has been disproved .
Before proceeding , let ’s clarify a few things .
First , I am not asking this question :
How could I change this code so that the compiler will respect its termination characteristics ?
This is easy and there are several reliable ways to do it , for example using volatile variables or inline assembly .
Second , I am not interested in “ answers ” like this :
It is obvious what is going on here : the compiler sees that one path out of the function is dead , and then deduces that the only remaining path must be live .
This observation is not untrue , but it ’s a little like explaining that World War II happened because people could n’t all just get along .
It completely fails to get at the heart of the matter .
Third , there are no integer overflow games going on here , as long as the code is compiled for a platform where an int is at least 32 bits .
This is easy to see by inspecting the program .
The termination problems are totally unrelated to integer overflow .
Program Semantics
A program ’s meaning is determined by the semantics of the language in which it is written .
The semantics tells us how to interpret constructs in the language ( how wide is an integer ?
how does the “ if ” operator work ? ) and how to put the results of operations together into an overall result .
Some computer languages have a formal mathematical semantics , some have a standards document , and some simply have a reference implementation .
Let ’s look at a few examples .
I ’ll continue to use C , and will be quite informal ( for a formal take on the meaning of C programs , see Michael Norrish ’s PhD thesis ) .
To keep things simple , we ’ll look only at “ self - contained ” programs that take no inputs .
Consider this program :
int main ( void ) { return 3 ; }
it means { { 3 , ” ” }} .
The notation is slightly cluttered but can be read as “ the program has a unique interpretation which is to return 3 and perform no side effects . ”
To keep things simple , I ’m representing side effects as a string printed to stdout .
Of course , in the general case there are other kinds of side effects .
Here ’s a slightly more complex program :
int main ( void ) { int a = 1 ; return 2 + a ; }
it also means { {3 , ” ” }} since there is no possibility of integer overflow .
Not all programs have a unique meaning .
Consider :
int main ( void ) { unsigned short a = 65535 ; return a + 1 ; }
The meaning of this program is { {65536 , ” ”} , { 0 , ” ” }} .
In other words , it has two meanings : it may return 65536 or 0 ( in both cases performing no side - effecting operations ) depending on whether the particular C implementation being used has defined the size of an unsigned short to be 16 bits or to be larger than 16 bits .
Another way that a C program can gain multiple meanings is by performing operations with unspecified behavior .
Unlike implementation defined behavior , where the implementation is forced to document its choice of behavior and use it consistently , unspecified behavior can change even within execution of a single program .
For example :
int a ;
int assign_a ( int val ) { a = val ; return val ; }
int main ( void ) { assign_a ( 0 ) + assign_a ( 1 ) ; return a ; }
Because the order of evaluation of the subexpressions in C is unspecified , this program means { {0 , ” ” } , { 1 , ” ” }} .
That is , it may return either 0 or 1 .
This C program :
#include < stdio.h >
int main ( void ) { return printf ( " hi
" ) ; }
means { {0 , ” ” } , { 1 , ” h ” } , { 2 , ” hi”} , { 3, ” hi
” } , { - 1 , ” ” } , { - 2 , ” ” } , { - 3 , ” ” } , …} .
The 4th element of this set , with return value 3 , is the one we expect to see .
The 1st through 3rd elements indicate cases where the I/O subsystem truncated the string .
The 5th and subsequent elements indicate cases where the printf ( ) call failed ; the standard mandates that a negative value is returned in this case , but does not say which one .
Here it starts to become apparent why reasoning about real C programs is not so easy .
In subsequent examples we ’ll ignore program behaviors where printf ( ) has something other than the expected result .
Some programs , such as this one , do n’t mean anything :
#include < limits .h>
int main ( void ) { return INT_MAX+1 ; }
In C , overflowing a signed integer has undefined behavior , and a program that does this has no meaning at all .
It is ill - formed .
We ’ll denote the meaning of this program as {{UNDEF}} .
It ’s important to realize that performing an undefined operation has unbounded consequences on the program semantics .
For example , this program :
#include < limits .h>
int main ( void ) { INT_MAX+1 ; return 0 ; }
also means {{UNDEF}} .
The fact that the result of the addition is not used is irrelevant : operations with undefined behavior are program cancer and poison the entire execution .
Many real programs are undefined only sometimes .
For example we can slightly modify an earlier example like this :
int a ;
int assign_a ( int val ) { a = val ; return val ; }
int main ( void ) { assign_a ( 0 ) + assign_a ( 1 ) ; return 2/a ; }
This program means {{UNDEF} , { 2 , ” ” }} .
Showing that a real C program has well - defined behavior in all possible executions is very difficult .
This , combined with the fact that undefined behavior often goes unnoticed for some time , explains why so many C programs contain security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows , integer overflows , etc .
One might ask :
Is a C program that executes an operation with undefined behavior guaranteed to perform any side effects which precede the undefined operation ?
That is , if we access some device registers and then divide by zero , will the accesses happen ?
I believe the answer is that the entire execution is poisoned , not just the parts of the execution that follow the undefined operation .
Certainly this is the observed behavior of C implementations ( for example , content buffered to stdout is not generally printed when the program segfaults ) .
Finally we ’re ready to talk about termination .
All examples shown so far have been terminating programs .
In contrast , this example does not terminate :
#include < stdio.h >
int main ( void ) { printf ( " Hello
" ) ; while ( 1 ) { } printf ( " World
" ) ; return 0 ; }
Clearly we cannot find an integer return value for this program since its return statement is unreachable .
The C “ abstract machine , ” the notional C interpreter defined in the standard , has an unambiguous behavior when running this program : it prints Hello and then hangs forever .
When a program behaves like this we ’ll say that its meaning is {{âŠ¥ , ” Hello
” }} . Here âŠ¥ ( pronounced “ bottom ” ) is simply a value outside the set of integers that we can read as indicating a non-terminating execution .
Assuming that signed integers can encode values up to two billion ( this is true on all C implementations for 32 - and 64 - bit platforms that I know of ) , the semantics that the abstract C machine gives to the Fermat program at the top of this post is {{âŠ¥ , ” ” }} .
As we have seen , a number of production - quality C compilers have a different interpretation .
We ’re almost ready to get to the bottom of the mystery but first let ’s look at how some other programming languages handle non-terminating executions .
Java
Section 17.4.9 of the Java Language Specification ( 3rd edition ) specifically addresses the question of non-terminating executions , assigning the expected {{âŠ¥ , ” ” }} semantics to a straightforward Java translation of the Fermat code .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about this part of the Java Language Specification is the amount of text it requires to explain the desired behavior .
First , a special “ hang ” behavior is defined for the specific case where code executes forever without performing observable operations .
Second , care is taken to ensure that an optimizing compiler does not move observable behaviors around a hang behavior .
C++
C++0x , like Java , singles out the case where code executes indefinitely without performing any side effecting operations .
However , the interpretation of this code is totally different : it is an undefined behavior .
Thus , the semantics of the Fermat code above in C++0 x is {{UNDEF}} .
In other words , from the point of view of the language semantics , a loop of this form is no better than an out - of - bounds array access or use - after - free of a heap cell .
This somewhat amazing fact can be seen in the following text from Section 6.5.0 of the draft standard ( I ’m using N3090 ) :
A loop that , outside of the for - init - statement in the case of a for statement , makes no calls to library I/O functions , and
does not access or modify volatile objects , and
performs no synchronization operations ( 1.10 ) or atomic operations ( Clause 29 ) may be assumed by the implementation to terminate .
[ Note :
This is intended to allow compiler transformations , such as removal of empty loops , even when termination cannot be proven .
–end note ]
Unfortunately , the words “ undefined behavior ” are not used .
However , anytime the standard says “ the compiler may assume P , ” it is implied that a program which has the property not -P has undefined semantics .
Notice that in C++ , modifying a global ( or local ) variable is not a side - effecting operation .
Only actions in the list above count .
Thus , there would seem to be a strong possibility that real programmers are going to get burned by this problem .
A corollary is that it is completely clear that a C++ implementation may claim to have disproved Fermat ’s Last Theorem when it executes my code .
We can ask ourselves :
Do we want a programming language that has these semantics ?
I do n’t , and I ’ll tell you what : if you are a C++ user and you think this behavior is wrong , leave a comment at the bottom of this post or send me an email .
If I get 50 such responses , I ’ll formally request that the C++ Standard committee revisit this issue .
I have n’t done this before , but in an email conversation Hans Boehm ( who is on the C++ committee ) told me :
If you want the committee to revisit this , all you have to do is to find someone to add it as a national body comment .
That ’s probably quite easy .
But I ’m not sure enough has changed since the original discussion that it would be useful .
Anyway , let me know .
Haskell
Haskell has a bottom type that is a subtype of every other type .
Bottom is a type for functions which do not return a value ; it corresponds to an error condition or non-termination .
Interestingly , Haskell fails to distinguish between the error and non-terminating cases : this can be seen as trading diagnostic power for speed .
That is , because errors and infinite loops are equivalent , the compiler is free to perform various transformations that , for example , print a different error message than one might have expected .
Haskell users ( I ’m not one ) appear to be happy with this and in practice Haskell implementations appear to produce perfectly good error messages .
Other Languages
Most programming languages have no explicit discussion of termination and non-termination in their standards / definitions .
In general , we can probably read into this that a language implementation can be expected to preserve the apparent termination characteristics of its inputs .
Rupak Majumdar pointed me to this nice writeup about an interesting interaction between a non-terminating loop and the SML type system .
C
Ok , let ’s talk about termination in C .
I ’ve saved this for last not so much to build dramatic tension as because the situation is murky .
As we saw above , the reality is that many compilers will go ahead and generate terminating object code for C source code that is non-terminating at the level of the abstract machine .
We also already saw that this is OK in C++0 x and not OK in Java .
The relevant part of the C standard ( I ’m using N1124 ) is found in 5.1.2.3 :
The least requirements on a conforming implementation are :
At sequence points , volatile objects are stable in the sense that previous accesses are complete and subsequent accesses have not yet occurred .
At program termination , all data written into files shall be identical to the result that execution of the program according to the abstract semantics would have produced .
The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take place as specified in 7.19.3 .
The intent of these requirements is that unbuffered or line - buffered output appear as soon as possible , to ensure that prompting messages actually appear prior to a program waiting for input .
Now we ask : Given the Fermat program at the top of this post , is icc or suncc meeting these least requirements ?
The first requirement is trivially met since the program contains no volatile objects .
The third requirement is met ; nothing surprising relating to termination is found in 7.19.3 .
The second requirement is the tricky one .
If it is talking about termination of the program running on the abstract machine , then it is vacuously met because our program does not terminate .
If it is talking about termination of the actual program generated by the compiler , then the C implementation is buggy because the data written into files ( stdout is a file ) differs from the data written by the abstract machine .
( This reading is due to Hans Boehm ; I had failed to tease this subtlety out of the standard . )
So there you have it : the compiler vendors are reading the standard one way , and others ( like me ) read it the other way .
It ’s pretty clear that the standard is flawed : it should , like C++ or Java , be unambiguous about whether this behavior is permitted .
Does It Matter if the Compiler Terminates an Infinite Loop ?
Yes , it matters , but only in fairly specialized circumstances .
Here are a few examples .
The Fermat program is a simple counterexample search .
A more realistic example would test a more interesting conjecture , such as whether a program contains a bug or whether a possibly - prime number has a factorization .
If I happen to write a counterexample search that fails to contain side - effecting operations , a C++0 x implementation can do anything it chooses with my code .
Linux 2.6.0 contains this code :
NORET_TYPE void panic ( const char * fmt , ... ) { ... do stuff ... for ( ; ; ) ; }
If the compiler optimizes this function so that it returns , some random code will get executed .
Luckily , gcc is not one of the compilers that is known to terminate infinite loops .
( Michal Nazarewicz found this example . )
In embedded software I ’ll sometimes write a deliberate infinite loop .
For example to hang up the CPU if main ( ) returns .
A group using LLVM for compiling embedded code ran into exactly that problem , causing random code to run .
When re-flashing an embedded system with a new code image , it would not be uncommon to hang the processor in an infinite loop waiting for a watchdog timer to reboot the processor into the new code .
Another plausible bit of code from an embedded system is :
while ( 1 ) { #ifdef FEATURE_ONE do_feature_one ( ) ; #endif #ifdef FEATURE_TWO do_feature_two( ) ; #endif # ifdef FEATURE_THREE do_feature_three( ) ; #endif } fputs ( " Internal error
" , stderr ) ;
If you compile this code for a product that contains none of the three optional features , the compiler might terminate my loop and cause the error code to run .
( This code is from Keith Thompson . )
Finally , if I accidentally write an infinite loop , I ’d prefer my program to hang so I can use a debugger to find the problem .
If the compiler deletes the loop and also computes a nonsensical result , as in the Fermat example , I have no easy way to find the latent error in my system .
Are Termination - Preserving Compilers Uneconomical ?
The C and C++ languages have undefined behavior when a signed integer overflows .
Java mandates two ’s complement behavior .
Java ’s stronger semantics have a real cost for certain kinds of tight loops such as those found in digital signal processing , where undefined integer overflow can buy ( I have heard ) 50 % speedup on some real codes .
Similarly , Java ’s termination semantics are stronger than C++0 x ’s and perhaps stronger than C’s .
The stronger semantics have a cost : the optimizer is no longer free to , for example , move side effecting operations before or after a potentially non-terminating loop .
So Java will either generate slower code , or else the C/C++ optimizer must become more sophisticated in order to generate the same code that Java does .
Does this really matter ?
Is is a major handicap for compiler vendors ?
I do n’t know , but I doubt that the effect would be measurable for most real codes .
Worse is Better
Richard Gabriel ’s classic Worse is Better essay gives the example where UNIX has worse semantics than Multics : it permits system calls to fail , forcing users to put them in retry loops .
By pushing complexity onto the user ( which is worse ) , UNIX gains implementation simplicity , and perhaps thereby wins in the marketplace ( which is better ) .
Pushing nonintuitive termination behavior onto the user , as C++0 x does , is a pretty classic example of worse is better .
Hall of Shame
These C compilers known to not preserve termination properties of code : Sun CC 5.10 , Intel CC 11.1 , LLVM 2.7 , Open64 4.2.3 , and Microsoft Visual C 2008 and 2010 .
The LLVM developers consider this behavior a bug and have since fixed it .
As far as I know , the other compiler vendors have no plans to change the behavior .
These C compilers , as far as I know , do not change the termination behavior of their inputs : GCC 3.x , GCC 4.x , and the WindRiver Diab compiler .

My understanding of these issues benefited from conversations with Hans Boehm and Alastair Reid .
This post does not represent their views and all mistakes are mine .
The application of nanotechnology in the field of drug delivery has attracted much attention in recent years .
In cancer research , nanotechnology holds great promise for the development of targeted , localized delivery of anticancer drugs , in which only cancer cells are affected .
Such targeted - therapy methods would represent a major advance over current chemotherapy , in which anticancer drugs are distributed throughout the body , attacking healthy cells along with cancer cells and causing a number of adverse side effects .
By carrying out comprehensive studies on mice with human tumors , UCLA scientists have obtained results that move the research one step closer to this goal .
In a paper published July 8 in the journal Small , researchers at UCLA 's California NanoSystems Institute and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center demonstrate that mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) , tiny particles with thousands of pores , can store and deliver chemotherapeutic drugs in vivo and effectively suppress tumors in mice .
The researchers also showed that MSNs accumulate almost exclusively in tumors after administration and that the nanoparticles are excreted from the body after they have delivered their chemotherapeutic drugs .
The study was conducted jointly in the laboratories of Fuyu Tamanoi , a UCLA professor of microbiology , immunology and molecular genetics and director of the signal transduction and therapeutics program at UCLA 's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , and Jeffrey Zink , a UCLA professor of chemistry and biochemistry .
Tamanoi and Zink are researchers at the California NanoSystems Institute ( CNSI ) and are two of the co-directors of the CNSI 's Nano Machine Center for Targeted Delivery and On - Demand Release .
The lead investigator on the research is Jie Lu , a postdoctoral fellow in Tamanoi 's lab .
Monty Liong and Zongxi Li , researchers from Zink 's lab , also contributed to this work .
In the study , researchers found that MSNs circulate in the bloodstream for extended periods of time and accumulate predominantly in tumors .
The tumor accumulation could be further improved by attaching a targeting moiety to MSNs , the researchers said .

The treatment of mice with camptothecin - loaded MSNs led to shrinkage and regression of xenograft tumors .
By the end of the treatment , the mice were essentially tumor free , and acute and long - term toxicity of MSNs to the mice was negligible .
Mice with breast cancer were used in this study , but the researchers have recently obtained similar results using mice with human pancreatic cancer .
" Our present study shows , for the first time , that MSNs are effective for anticancer drug delivery and that the capacity for tumor suppression is significant , " Tamanoi said .
" Two properties of these nanoparticles are important , " Lu said .
" First , their ability to accumulate in tumors is excellent .
They appear to evade the surveillance mechanism that normally removes materials foreign to the body .
Second , most of the nanoparticles that were injected into the mice were excreted out through urine and feces within four days .
The latter results are quite interesting and might explain the low toxicity observed in the biocompatabilty experiments we conducted . "
Researchers at the Nano Machine Center for Targeted Delivery and On - Demand Release are modifying MSNs -- which are easily modifiable -- so that the nanoparticles can be equipped with nanomachines .
For example , nanovalves are being attached at the opening of the pores to control the release of anticancer drugs .
In addition , the interior of the pores is being modified so that the light - induced release of anticancer drugs can be achieved .
" We can modify both the particles themselves and also the attachments on the particles in a wide variety of ways , which makes this material particularly attractive for engineering drug - delivery vehicles , " Zink said .
The team is now planning future research that involves testing MSNs in a variety of animal - model systems and carrying out extensive studies on the safety of MSNs .
" Comprehensive investigation with practical dosages which are adequate and suitable for in vivo delivery of anticancer drugs is needed before MSNs can reach clinics as a drug - delivery system , " Tamanoi said .
The research received support from National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
In addition , NanoPacific Holdings Inc. provided critical support for the animal experiments .
The arrests of Joseph Lightfoot and Amber Wildenstein , both 29 , on one count apiece of child abuse raised eyebrows in the medical marijuana community .
After all , the charges against Lightfoot and Wildenstein are based solely on them growing marijuana in their home -- something they 're authorized to do because of his status as a caregiver .
According to Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney 's Office , the investigation into Lightfoot and Wildenstein began with " a domestic violence call .
I think it was another family member who'd called the police and said , ' They 're fighting .
I can hear the kids .
Can you check it out ? ' "
In the end , police determined that " it had only been a verbal argument , so no domestic - violence crime had been committed , " Kimbrough continues .
That means the child abuse charge is solely due to the presence of a marijuana grow in the home .
As Kimbrough points out , Colorado Revised Statute 18-6-401 states that " a person commits child abuse , if , in the presence of a child , or on the premises where a child is found , or where a child resides ... the person knowingly engages in the manufacture or attempted manufacture of a controlled substance . "

Lightfoot had the legal right to grow marijuana .
As Kimbrough notes , " he has his paperwork from the medical marijuana registry , and paperwork that he is a caregiver . "
But that does n't mitigate the offense in the view of the DA 's office .
" This is what 's on the books right now , " Kimbrough says .
" It 's state law , and we do n't pick and choose the laws we enforce and prosecute .
We have an obligation to go forward with what 's on the books , and marijuana is a controlled substance . "
That 's not the way Sensible Colorado 's Brian Vicente sees it .
While the attorney is n't representing Lightfoot or Wildenstein , he sees their case as worrisome .
" Fundamentally , we encourage parents and caregivers to keep a real firewall separating minors , their children , from medical marijuana , " he says .
" But at the same time , marijuana is less harmful than alcohol or just about any prescription drugs out there .
So this charge is not reflective of reality .
" What 's the actual danger here ?
You 've got people who are ostensibly following state law .
They have the proper paperwork to lawfully engage in this action .
So for the DA 's office to be wantonly prosecuting them for doing this in their home , it 's concerning . "
Given the way the law currently reads , Vicente thinks a legislative solution may be in order -- " but I also think the right to grow marijuana in your home is enshrined in the Colorado constitution , and that 's the highest law in the state .
So I feel that , barring any exceptional circumstances , that should be the trump law we turn to in these cases . "
The licensing situation during the transition period from the passage of HB 1284 , the bill to regulate the medical marijuana industry , to its formal implementation only adds to the confusion , Vicente believes .
" Currently , the license for a grow operation would be exactly the same thing as having a red card , " he notes .
" In terms of the commercial side , cities and the state are starting to deal with this issue , but in Denver , at least , they have not issued such a license yet .
But that does n't mean these activities are n't protected under state law . "
For her part , Kimbrough hopes members of the medical marijuana community will familiarize themselves with the statute being used against Lightfoot and Wildenstein .
" This is n't a new law , but I guess what may be new are some of the circumstances , " she says .
" Maybe there is some public awareness that needs to take place .
On that front , having this discussion and having people become aware of exactly what the law is would be a good thing . "
Vicente agrees that it 's important to " really separate children 's lives from the medicine in the same way you would with a bottle of vodka or a prescription of Xanax .
And we 're continuing to educate people on that topic . "
Still , he hopes this case does n't signal a new wave of child abuse charges against medical marijuana patients and caregivers with legal home grows who also have kids .
" People in all walks of life get sick -- anyone from parents to grandparents , " he points out .
" And I think we need to encourage the DA 's office to use discretion , and not penalize people for being ill . "
Here 's the DA 's office release on the arrest :
STRONG BREW
The term “ tea - bagger ” is like uttering the “ n ” word , some say .
Though he aspires to promote civility , evidence has surfaced that President Obama has added “ tea - bagger ” to his public lexicon , though it ’s considered a cheap and tawdry insult by “ tea party ” activists .
Watchdogs at Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) barked when they saw the proof , tucked in a sneak peak of Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter ’s new book , “ The Promise : President Obama , Year One , ” to be released May 18 .
Indeed , it appears the president joined certain partisan critics and the liberal media , and took the tea -bag plunge .
“ This remark is the equivalent of using the ‘ n ’ word .
It shows contempt for middle America , expressed knowingly , contemptuously , on purpose , and with a smirk .
It is indefensible to use this word .
The president knows what it means , and his people know what it means .
The public thought we reached a new low of incivility during the Clinton administration .
Well , the Obama administration has just outdone them , ” ATR president Grover Norquist tells Inside the Beltway .
There is not always parity in these situations .
There were outraged calls for Rep.
Dan Burton ’s resignation and massive press coverage after the Indiana Republican called President Clinton a “ scumbag ” during the Monica Lewinsky matter in 1998 .
TWT RELATED STORIES :
• Coats , Burton win primaries in Indiana

The offending passage that started the tea - bagger shuffle ?
Mr. Alter wrote , “ Obama said that the unanimous House vote against the Recovery Act ‘ set the tenor for the whole year ’ : ‘ That helped to create the tea - baggers and empowered that whole wing of the Republican Party to where it now controls the agenda for the Republicans . ’ ”
Mr. Obama himself was recently ruing the contentious state of politics , noting Saturday at a college commencement speech , “ We ’ve got politicians calling each other all sorts of unflattering names .
Pundits and talking heads shout at each other .
The media tends to play up every hint of conflict , because it makes for a sexier story . ”
The watchdogs , incidentally got their advance look at the book in Mike Allen ’s “ Playbook ” in Politico .

“ Drill ” is not a dirty word among U.S. voters , even after the big BP oil spill .
A Zogby poll reveals that 63 percent support the expansion of offshore drilling .

The poll of 3,100 likely voters was conducted April 30 to May 3 .
TEACHABLE MOMENT
Will the treatment of Times Square car - bomb suspect Faisal Shahzad — closely monitored by the press — amplify the controversy surrounding a proposed trial of Khaliq Sheikh Mohammed in New York City , and the treatment of terrorists in general ?
“ I strongly believe that Shahzads recent arrest will spur further controversy about trying terrorists in civilian courts , and I think that that is a very appropriate response .
This weekends foiled plot proves that NYC remains an active target for terrorists , and we are incredibly fortunate that the last several terror attempts have been thwarted , ” Michael Wildes tells the Beltway .
Mr. Wildes is a former federal prosecutor who recently represented Kwame James — the Trinidad - born hero who subdued “ Shoe Bomber ” Richard Reid — in his quest for U.S. citizenship .
“ Once the suspects are apprehended , however , we should think twice before inviting terrorists into New York City to stand trial , affording them a further platform and audience to spew their venomous hatred .
This latest threat is a function of our ongoing war on terror and as such , it is a military matter that should be handled in a tribunal setting , ” Mr. Wildes says .

Mr. Crist ’s new campaign slogan : “ People Above Politics . ”
Meanwhile , is Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a “ good get ” for TV talk bookers ?
Must be .
PBS ’ Charlie Rose spent an hour with him Monday , ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos takes his turn Wednesday on “ Good Morning America ” when the pair discuss why Mr. Ahmadinejad doesnt fear an Israeli attack , and his theory that President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton are at odds over Iran .

“ All responsible energy development must be accompanied by strict oversight , but even with the strictest oversight in the world , accidents still happen , ” says Sarah Palin , who ramped up oversight of the oil industry in her state and created a “ petroleum systems integrity office ” as Alaska governor .
“ No human endeavor is ever without risk — whether its sending a man to the moon or extracting the necessary resources to fuel our civilization .
I repeat the slogan ‘ drill here , drill now ’ not out of naivete or disregard for the tragic consequences of oil spills - my family and my state and I know firsthand those consequences , ” Mrs. Palin continues .
“ How could I still believe in drilling Americas domestic supply of energy after having seen the devastation of the Exxon - Valdez spill ?
I continue to believe in it because increased domestic oil production will make us a more secure , prosperous , and peaceful nation . ”

New rules officially adopted by the UCI ’s Management Committee today will mean major changes for the world ’s top races come this fall .
The rules , which cover everything from allowed bicycle components to course design , were approved following the recommendation of the UCI ’s Cyclocross Commission , and address a number of issues that arose during the 2009 - 10 season .
UCI to Allow Disc Brakes in Cyclocross
The most significant change among those announced today – and the most polarizing – was the decision to allow the use of disc brakes in international competition .
Disc brakes , which are already legal for lower - level races in the US , offer significant advantages over cyclocross ’ traditional cantilever brakes , especially in bad conditions , though they are also considerably heavier .
Several riders from the professional ranks expressed their disappointment that the UCI was abandoning a decision that has kept ’ cross rooted to a long tradition for years .
On Twitter Adam Myerson , a former member of the UCI Cyclocross Commission , wrote :
“ Disc brakes are for mountain bikes and motorcycles .
Not cyclo-cross bikes . ” - Adam Myerson
Others , like Britain ’s Ian Field , who pointed out that the rule change does not require racers to use discs , and Jeremy Powers , who noted he never felt the need to use them , seemed more sanguine about the impending changes .
UCI Makes a Big Deal Over Two Millimeters
But at the same time as ’ cross was taking one step towards its fat - tired cousin , it was also taking steps in the other direction .
The Committee reduced the maximum width of tires from 35 mm to 33 mm , meaning some riders will have to adapt to slightly narrower tires for next season .
Although not many UCI racers compete on clinchers , this rule could impact those who race with wider tires .
It ’s important to note that most 700x35 c clinchers are undersized and do not measure out to be more than 33c on a standard road rim , according to our comprehensive tire reviews .
When It ’s Hot , Hand - Ups Are Not a Crime
The UCI also moved to allow hand - ups during races when the temperature is over 20 degrees Celsius ( 68 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
An unusually warm spell in western Europe during the early part of last season left a number of riders complaining about rules that forbade feeding , most notably former World Champion Niels Albert .
After an extremely dry and dusty Vlaamse Houtlandcross race in September , Albert told reporters that the decision to bar feeding was “ scandalous “ .
Lowering Barriers , Pulling Riders
The rule changes also modified course design and race dynamics themselves , allowing race promoters to include more obstacles than in the past , and to use lower barriers with more distance between then than was previously allowed .
Those two changes will make hopping barriers much more a part of successful ’ cross racers ’ arsenals .
Additionally , race officials will now be permitted to pull riders who are more than 80 % off the leader ’s lap time .
The new 80 % rule , which will likely impact late - race dynamics , also addresses an issue that came up last year , when a lapped rider interfered with Sven Nys on the final lap of the Igorre World Cup , costing the Belgian Champion any shot at his first World Cup win of the season .
The detailed race rules , which take effect in July , are posted on the UCI web site , as are the rules regarding disc brakes and tire selection .

Then , I made a capsule / telescope that would hold documents that tell the story of Spudnik and his crucial role in saving the spirit of humanity from apocalyptic doom .
I had a lot of fun making this , so I thought I 'd share . "
Oh , brava , Sarah !
Spudnik : Steampunk Mr. Potato Head
Mozilla on Thursday boosted bug bounty payments six - fold by increasing the standard cash award to $ 3,000 .
The new bounty for vulnerabilities in Firefox , Firefox Mobile and Thunderbird is also six times the normal payment by Google for flaws in its Chrome browser , and more than double the maximum $ 1,337 that Google pays for the most severe bugs .
Mozilla and Google are the only browser makers that pay security researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in their products .
" A lot has changed in the six years since the Mozilla program was announced , and we believe that one of the best ways to keep our users safe is to make it economically sustainable for security researchers to do the right thing when disclosing information , " said Lucas Adamski , director of security engineering .
Mozilla kicked off its bounty program in August 2004 .
In an e-mail reply to questions , Adamski later Friday said Mozilla picked $ 3,000 as the new bounty after talking to researchers , saying it was " a number that we felt would fairly compensate them for their efforts . "
Only bugs that Mozilla ranks " crucial " or " high " -- its top two ratings -- are eligible for payment .
In Mozilla 's hierarchy , critical vulnerabilities are those that allow remote code execution ; in other words , ones that when exploited give the attacker full control of the machine .
High vulnerabilities are those that expose " high - value " personal information , such as usernames , passwords and credit card numbers .
Denial - of - service flaws are not eligible for a bounty , Mozilla said .
Google launched its own cash - for - flaws program in January 2010 , paying $ 500 for most bugs .
Some vulnerabilities , however , earn their discoverer $ 1,000 , or even $ 1,337 , the latter given only to bugs that Chrome 's team judge 's " particularly severe or particularly clever . "
The last time Google paid bounties was July 2 , when it handed out $ 2,500 to a pair of researchers for reporting four vulnerabilities .
Bugs in the Mozilla Suite , which the Mozilla Foundation dropped in 2005 -- will no longer be eligible for bounties , said Adamski .
But vulnerabilities in Firefox Mobile , Mozilla 's mobile browser , as well as any Mozilla services that Firefox or Thunderbird rely on for safe operation , are eligible .
Mozilla also added new language to its reward policy that gives it some new flexibility .
" Mozilla reserves the right to not give a bounty payment if we believe the actions of the reporter have endangered the security of Mozilla 's end users , " the revised guidelines now state .
Adamski noted that change in his blog posting , but did not elaborate .
He also later declined to provide more information on the scenarios that might make Mozilla invoke the new clause .
Researchers may have questions for Mozilla about the new language , since the FAQ for the bounty program says that they do n't have to wait for patches to be built and applied to , say , Firefox before they go public with their information .
" If I report the bug directly to you , do I have to keep the bug confidential and not publish information about it in order to receive a reward ? " the FAQ asks .
Mozilla 's answer : " No .
We 're rewarding you for finding a bug , not trying to buy your silence . "
Other bug bounty programs , particularly HP TippingPoint 's and VeriSign iDefense's , not only pay more than either Mozilla or Google -- they are secretive about their payment structures , though -- but require researchers to keep mum until the vulnerability they 've reported is patched .
That may change : Both TippingPoint and iDefense appear to rethinking their policies .
In mid-June , Aaron Portnoy , security research team lead at TippingPoint , tweeted , " Spender 's post makes me want to enforce a hard deadline for vendors to patch .
If not , ZDI drops the bug anyway .
It 's oddly safer that way . "
Portnoy 's reference was to a long message posted by Brad Spender on the " Dailydave " security mailing list , in which he took Microsoft and several publications , including Computerworld to task for linking Tavis Ormandy , a researcher who publicly disclosed a critical vulnerability in Windows XP just days after reporting it , to his employer , Google .
After Portnoy tweeted his comment , TippingPoint declined further comment .
Two weeks ago , iDefense chimed in .
" We should carefully watch and respond to the recent change in vulnerability disclosure trends , " the company Twitter account broadcast .
The tweets from TippingPoint and iDefense seem to be a reaction to the controversy over Ormandy 's disclosure of a Windows Help and Support Center bug on June 10 , five days after he reported it to Microsoft .
His disclosure set off a heated debate between researchers , with some security researchers critical and others supportive .
Microsoft patched the flaw last Tuesday in its July security updates .

Pity Tony Hayward , erstwhile boss of BP .
He ’s really had it rough .
He ’s been “ demonized and vilified ” , to use his own words .
The poor CEO was so busy dealing with the massive oil spill perpetrated by his company that he almost missed watching his yacht race in a very important race !
Almost , but he was able to watch the race anyway .
Because , you know , someone else was probably working on cleaning up the oil fouling the Gulf of Mexico .
It ’s not really the CEO ’s job , you see .
It ’s more of a job for the “ small people ” of the world .
“ Life is n’t fair .
Sometimes you step off the pavement and get hit by a bus , ” Hayward said recently .
Yes , that ’s true .
And sometimes , you end up the CEO of one of the most powerful oil companies in the world .
A company that has a long history of criminal and ethical violations that should make them unfit to operate a lemonade stand , much less a major multinational corporation with power to contaminate the entire Gulf of Mexico– and perhaps , Beyond !
“ Beyond Petroleum ” was their catchy , greenwashing way of hinting that maybe , someday , they ’d not be an oil company anymore .
They would be “ beyond ” all that .
Until that impossible someday rolls around though , they are keeping their hands dirty in the oil business .
Well , the oil business and the Washington power - lobbying business .
There ’s so much overlap these days though , who ’s to say where one ends and the other begins ?
But , back to the point - we really should be feeling sorry for poor Mr. Hayward .
He ’s retiring with a barely - adequate pension of £ 600,000 per year .
For you Americans , that ’s a miserly $ 935,800 in dollars at current exchange rates .
Oh , and he gets his regular salary for a full year .
Also , he retains his rights to his stock and options , which “ could be worth millions of pounds “ .
Such a nasty , imprecise amount that is .
Let ’s assume that it ’s only worth a measly one million pounds ( $ 1.97 million dollars ) .
Yes , poor Tony .
Oh , I almost forgot– he ’s not really “ retiring ” , per se .
It ’s more like a re-assignment .
He ’s getting a cushy board position with another BP joint venture :
But BP ’s decision to nominate Hayward for a board position at TNK - BP , the company ’s 50 - 50 joint venture with Russian oligarchs , suggests that the company still holds more faith in its embattled CEO than much of the US public and political establishment .
Stories like this one make me want to rage .
I want to scream at the top of my lungs to everyone that this must not stand .
This is not right .
This environmental disaster affects the “ small people ” in a very real way– people like William Allen Kruse .
Mr. Kruse was the captain of a charter fishing boat that had been re-tasked to help clean up the oil spill .
The things he saw affected him so deeply , he simply could n’t go on .
Despondent over the damage he was witnessing , Mr. Kruse shot himself in the head .
I ’m reminded of a set of riddles that environmentalist Derrick Jensen often tells .
Here , he is discussing how the magic word , “ Corporation ” , can provide immunity from even the most heinous of acts :
I ’ve decided also that I ’m going to join with politicians and corporate journalists and begin preaching the gospel of limited liability corporations everywhere I can .
I even know where I ’m going to begin my missionary work .
I teach creative writing at a supermaximum security prison here in northern California .
The men I teach are called by the corporate press “ the worst of the worst ” : robbers , thieves , murderers .
But I now understand that these men are amateurs .
If they really want to succeed at their chosen professions , they need to get themselves special “ limited liability get out of jail free ” cards .
Because the truth is that all of the men in this prison have killed far fewer people , destroyed far fewer lives , stolen far less money , than the average CEO of the average limited liability corporation .
Here are two riddles about this , neither of which are very funny .
Question :
What do you get when you cross a long drug habit , a quick temper , and a gun ?
Answer :
Two life terms for murder , earliest release date 2026 .
Question :
What do you get when you cross two nation states , a large limited liability corporation , forty tons of poison , and at least 8000 dead human beings ?
Answer : Retirement with full pay and benefits .
If my students had robbed or killed people in the service of economic production , behind the legal fiction of a limited liability corporation , they could now be joining Warren Anderson , ex-CEO of Union Carbide , on the back nine , instead of spending the rest of their lives in tiny cells .
Jensen did n’t really provide the full context of the Bhopal disaster there , but it was in the news again lately and I found this snippet which adequately explains what happened : ( or see also the Wikipedia article )
More than 15,000 people died and more than 500,000 people were sickened after plumes of methyl isocyanate gas leaked out of a Union Carbide pesticide factory in Bhopal in December 1984 .
The company settled a civil lawsuit out of court in 1989 and paid the Indian government $ 470 million to compensate victims .
Warren Anderson , then - CEO of Union Carbide , was charged in the Indian courts with manslaughter .
He returned to the US following his arrest but before his trial , and has since been declared a fugitive from justice in India .
The US is declining to extradite Anderson .
Yes , it ’s lonely at the top , but it ’s also extremely profitable .
Want to know the future ?
You do n't need crystal ball or a time machine .
Just examine your moles or your fingernails or your cats .
Really .
Ailuromancy or felidomancy .
Simply observe the way your cat moves or jumps to determine the future - especially weather .
A black cat crossing your path being a bad omen is an old piece of ailuromancy .
Did your cat lick her ears three times ?
Company must be on the way .
Right ear ?
It 's a gentleman caller .
Left ear ?
Expect a lady .

Rumpology .
This is just what is sounds like - divination via the derriere .
But take this one with a grain of salt - the only major backer of this method is Jackie Stallone , Sly 's mom and , by most accounts , a rather questionable " psychic . "
Jackie says Rumpology works a lot like palm reading : the cracks , crevices , birth marks and dimples can reveal a lot about a person .
According to one rumpologist , an apple - shaped butt " indicates someone who is charismatic , dynamic , very confident and often creative .
A person who enjoys life . "
Uromancy .
I bet if you think about the root word you can figure this one out .
Yep … it 's fortune - telling based on your urine .
Sure , your urine can definitely tell you a few things about your health - how well hydrated you are , for example .
But uromancy is the interpretation of the bubbles in urine to reveal future events .
If the bubbles are big and spaced far apart , expect good things .
If they are small and close together , something terrible ( death of a loved one or a serious illness ) may be just around the corner .
Cromniomancy .
Good news for gardeners - you can use your onions to see if you should prepare for bad news .
One method is going to require that you build an altar , though : in the past , people separated from their loved ones could write their names on onions ( one name per veggie ) and then lay them on the altar to sprout .
The faster the onion sprouted , the better health and happiness the person whose name was on the onion was experiencing .
Woe to the person whose onion did n't sprout .
You can also use cromniomancy to answer yes or no inquiries : plant two onions , one with each answer on it .
The one that sprouts first is the answer to your question .

Sternomancy
This sounds like a cheap pick up line to be used at a bar , but Sternomancy is actually future - prediction by looking at someone 's chest .
Back in yesteryear , the study was limited to markings and bumps on the chest , kind of similar to phrenology ( the study of head shape and bumps to determine personality ) .
But these days , men's and women 's magazines have taken it upon themselves to twist sternomancy into personality prediction based on the size and shape of a woman 's breasts .
Sternomancy does n't just apply to humans - the old tradition of breaking the wishbone at Thanksgiving is an old form of the practice .
Onychomancy .
Believe it or not , your fingernails are very powerful .
Fingernail clippings were once used in spells , healing rituals and superstitions .
In fact , many of the superstitions are still floating around out there - Japanese girls are told that biting their fingernails will result in a difficult childbirth later on down the line .
The white spots on your fingernails are supposed to be a sign of good fortune - a spot on thumb specifically means that a gift is about to be bestowed upon you .
Greedy people are said to have crooked fingernails , and the half - moon shape ( " lunula " ) at the base of the nail indicates your lifeline - the bigger the lunula , the longer your life will last .
Ever bend your nail back ?
Bad news : not only did it probably make you use a few choice words , it also means there 's a difficult time ahead of you and it could last for a couple of months .
Oomancy .
Making an omelet ?
Give this a try first : separate the egg white , then drop into boiling water and see what shape the whites take .
It 's kind of like reading tea leaves .
Before you dismiss the idea , consider this : one of the girls involved in the Salem Witch Trial was playing this seemingly harmless game with her friends when she saw her egg whites take the shape of a coffin .
Not long after , 24 deaths rocked the community .

Moleosophy .
And you thought those little bumps were just birthmarks .
Nope , according to some , moles can indicate exactly what the future holds for you if you know how to read them just right .
Actually , it does n't take too much imagination to figure out moleosophy - most of it is fairly straightforward .
Mole on or near your bellybutton ?
You want kids .
Mole on your butt ?
You 're lazy and not very ambitious .
A mark on your back means you 're rather unreliable .
Some are n't quite as obvious , however - moles on the ears are considered lucky , a mole on the elbow indicates a love of travel and adventure , and a mole on your fingers means you 're dishonest .
Margaritomancy .
I briefly thought this was something along the lines of reading tea leaves , but having something to do with margaritas .
And I was totally prepared to go out and test the theory , purely in the name of research .
But " margarita " is actually Latin for " pearl , " so Margaritomancy is actually the study of pearls to predict the future .
Darn .
Many years ago , a pearl would be thrown into a pot sitting in a fire and its reaction to the heat would determine a person 's guilt or innocence .
If the pearl just sat there , the person was innocent .
Any movement indicated guilt .
The BBC has been getting a good few hits today as a result of its " horse - boy " revelation , the amazing tale of a horse - human hybrid spotted trotting through Street View in Aberdeen :
Horse boy has reportedly been spotted in the real world as far away as Germany and Norway , according to Beeb readers .
In which case , the old timer responsible must be capable of a bit of a gallop , despite his apparently advanced years .
Here he is preparing to confront the Street View spymobile :
Well , it 's a good effort we reckon .
Perhaps horse - geezer might consider joining forces with the Viking frogmen , the better to intimidate Google 's Orwellian black Opels . ®

Is anyone else excited that Futurama is back ?
I AM– hence the effort I put into making these Futurama theme cupcakes .
For these toppers I used Wilton Edible Writers on hard fondant disks .
The cool thing about edible writers is that you can use them to doodle , and they are safe to eat .
Personally , I ’m not a big fan of fondant , but they make for a perfect canvas .
Instead of using fondant to fully cover your cupcakes , you can make disks to top your cupcakes .
Fondant Disks
- Roll out fondant to 1/4 ″ thick , and cut out desired shape using cookie cutter .
Allow to dry on a parchment paper - lined cookie sheet for 4 - 5 hours .
How to Draw Bender :
Tutorial for Bender ( and other Futurama characters ) here
I ’m going to make it a little easier for you to try this at home …
I ’m giving away 5 packs of Wilton Edible Writers to 5 lucky readers .

We started our series discussing the basics of Python ’s object system ( Objects 101 and 102 ) , and it ’s time to move on .
Though we ’re not done with objects by any stretch of the imagination , when I think of Python ’s implementation I visualize this big machine with a conveyor belt feeding opcodes into a hulking processing plant with cranes and cooling towers sticking out , and I just have to friggin’ peer inside already .
So whether our knowledge of objects is complete or not , we ’ll put them aside for a bit and look into the Interpreter State and the Thread State structures ( both implemented in ./ Python/pystate.c ) .
I may be naïve , but I chose these structures because I ’d like this post to be a simple basis for our understanding of actual bytecode evaluation that we ’ll begin in the next few posts .
Soon enough we ’ll pry open Pandora boxes like frames , namespaces and code objects , and before we tackle these concepts I ’d like us see the broad - picture of how the data structures that bind them together are laid out .
Finally , note that this post is a tad heavier on OS terminology , I assume at least passing familiarity with it ( kernel , process , thread , etc ) .
As you probably know , in many operating systems user - space code is executed by an abstraction called threads that run inside another abstraction called processes ( this includes most Unices / Unix - likes and the decent members of the Windows family ) .
The kernel is in charge of setting up and tearing down these processes and execution threads , as well as deciding which thread will run on which logical CPU at any given time .
When a process invokes Py_Initialize another abstraction comes into play , and that is the interpreter .
Any Python code that runs in a process is tied to an interpreter , you can think of the interpreter as the root of all other concepts we ’ll discuss .
Python ’s code base supports initializing two ( or more ) completely separate interpreters that share little state with one another .
This is rather rarely done ( never in the vanilla executable ) , because too much subtly shared state of the interpreter core and of C extensions exists between these ‘ insulated ’ interpreters .
Still , since support exists for it and for completeness ’ sake , I ’ll try anyway to write this post from the standpoint of a multi-interpreter world .
Anyhow , we said all execution of code occurs in a thread ( or threads ) , and Python ’s Virtual Machine is no exception .
However , Python ’s Virtual Machine itself is something which supports the notion of threading , so Python has its own abstraction to represent Python threads .
This abstraction ’s implementation is fully reliant on the kernel ’s threading mechanisms , so both the kernel and Python are aware of each Python thread and Python threads execute as separate kernel - managed threads , running in parallel with all other threads in the system .
Uhm , almost .
There ’s an elephant in that particular living room , and that is the Global Interpreter Lock or the GIL .
Due to many reasons which we ’ll cover briefly today and revisit at length some other time , many aspects of Python ’s CPython implementation are not thread safe .
This is has some benefits , like simplifying the implementation of easy - to - screw - up pieces of code and guaranteed atomicity of many Python operations , but it also means that a mechanism must be put in place to prevent two ( or more ) Pythonic threads from executing in parallel , lest they corrupt each other ’s data .
The GIL is a process - wide lock which must be held by a thread if it wants to do anything Pythonic – effectively limiting all such work to a single thread running on a single logical CPU at a time .
Threads in Python multitask cooperatively by relinquishing the GIL voluntarily so other threads can do Pythonic work ; this cooperation is built - in to the evaluation loop , so ordinarily authors of Python code and some extensions do n’t need to do something special to make cooperation work ( from their point of view , they are preempted ) .
Do note that while a thread does n’t use any of Python ’s APIs it can ( and many threads do ) run in parallel to another Pythonic thread .
We will discuss the GIL again briefly later in this post and at length at a later time , but for the time being I can refer the interested readers to this excellent PyCon lecture by David Beazely for additional information about how the GIL works ( how the GIL works is not the main subject of the lecture , but the explanation of how it works is very good ) .
With the concepts of a process ( OS abstraction ) , interpreter (s ) ( Python abstraction ) and threads ( an OS abstraction and a Python abstraction ) in mind , let ’s go inside - out by zooming out from a single opcode outwards to the whole process .
This should give us a good overview , since so far we mainly went inwards from the implementation of some object - centric opcodes to the actual implementation of how they operate on objects .
Let ’s look again at the disassembly of the bytecode generated for the simple statement spam = eggs - 1 :
# what 's ' diss ' ?
see ' tools ' under ' metablogging ' above ! >>> diss ( " spam = eggs - 1 " ) 1 0 LOAD_NAME 0 ( eggs ) 3 LOAD_CONST 0 (1 ) 6 BINARY_SUBTRACT 7 STORE_NAME 1 ( spam ) 10 LOAD_CONST 1 ( None ) 13 RETURN_VALUE >>>
In addition to the actual ‘ do work ’ opcode BINARY_SUBTRACT , we see opcodes like LOAD_NAME ( eggs ) and STORE_NAME ( spam ) .
It seems obvious that evaluating such opcodes requires some storage room : eggs has to be loaded from somewhere , spam has to be stored somewhere .
The inner -most data structures in which evaluation occurs are the frame object and the code object , and they point to this storage room .
When you ’re “ running ” Python code , you ’re actually evaluating frames ( recall ceval.c : PyEval_EvalFrameEx ) .
For now we ’re happy to lump frame objects and code objects together ; in reality they are rather distinct , but we ’ll explore that some other time .
In this code - structure - oriented post , the main thing we care about is the f_back field of the frame object ( though many others exist ) .
In frame n this field points to frame n- 1 , i.e. , the frame that called us ( the first frame that was called in any particular thread , the top frame , points to NULL ) .
This stack of frames is unique to every thread and is anchored to the thread - specific structure ./ Include.h/ pystate.h : PyThreadState , which includes a pointer to the currently executing frame in that thread ( the most recently called frame , the bottom of the stack ) .
PyThreadState is allocated and initialized for every Python thread in a process by _PyThreadState_Prealloc just before new thread creation is actually requested from the underlying OS ( see ./Modules/_threadmodule.c : thread_PyThread_start_new_thread and >>> from _thread import start_new_thread ) .
Threads can be created which will not be under the interpreter ’s control ; these threads wo n’t have a PyThreadState structure and must never call a Python API .
This is n’t so common in a Python application but is more common when Python is embedded into another application .
It is possible to ‘ Pythonize ’ such foreign threads that were n’t originally created by Python code in order to allow them to run Python code ( PyThreadState will have to be allocated for them ) .
APIs exist that can do such a migration so long as only one interpreter exists , it is also possible though harder to do it manually in a multi-interpreter environment .
I hope to revisit these APIs and their operation in a later post , possibly one about embedding .
Finally , a bit like all frames are tied together in a backward - going stack of previous - frame pointers , so are all thread states tied together in a linked list of PyThreadState * next pointers .
The list of thread states is anchored to the interpreter state structure which owns these threads .
The interpreter state structure is defined at ./ Include.h/ pystate.h : PyInterpreterState , and it is created when you call Py_Initialize to initialize the Python VM in a process or Py_NewInterpreter to create a new interpreter state for multi-interpreter processes .
Mostly as an exercise to sharpen your understanding , note carefully that Py_NewInterpreter does not return an interpreter state – it returns a ( newly created ) PyThreadState for the single automatically created thread of the newly created interpreter .
There ’s no sense in creating a new interpreter state without at least one thread in it , much like there ’s no sense in creating a new process with no threads in it .
Similarly to the list of threads anchored to its interpreter , so does the interpreter structure have a next field which forms a list by linking the interpreters to one another .
This pretty much sums up our zooming out from the resolution of a single opcode to the whole process : opcodes belong to currently evaluating code objects ( currently evaluating is specified as opposed to code objects which are just lying around as data , waiting for the opportunity to be called ) , which belong to currently evaluating frames , which belong to Pythonic threads , which belong to interpreters .
The anchor which holds the root of this structure is the static variable ./ Python / pystate.c : interp_head , which points to the first interpreter state ( through that all interpreters are reachable , through each of them all thread states are reachable , and so fourth ) .
The mutex head_mutex protects interp_head and the lists it points to so they wo n’t be corrupt by concurrent modifications from multiple threads ( I want it to be clear that this lock is not the GIL , it ’s just the mutex for interpreter and thread states ) .
The macros HEAD_LOCK and HEAD_UNLOCK control this lock .
interp_head is typically used when one wishes to add / remove interpreters or threads and for special purposes .
That ’s because accessing an interpreter or a thread through the head variable would get you an interpreter state rather than the interpreter state owning the currently running thread ( just in case there ’s more than one interpreter state ) .
A more useful variable similar to interp_head is ./ Python / pystate.c : _PyThreadState_Current which points to the currently running thread state ( important terms and conditions apply , see soon ) .
This is how code typically accesses the correct interpreter state for itself : first find its your own thread ’s thread state , then dereference its interp field to get to your interpreter .
There are a couple of functions that let you access this variable ( get its current value or swap it with a new one while retaining the old one ) and they require that you hold the GIL to be used .
This is important , and serves as an example of CPython ’s lack of thread safety ( a rather simple one , others are hairier ) .
If two threads are running and there was no GIL , to which thread would this variable point ?
“ The thread that holds the GIL ” is an easy answer , and indeed , the one that ’s used .
_PyThreadState_Current is set during Python ’s initialization or during a new thread ’s creation to the thread state structure that was just created .
When a Pythonic thread is bootstrapped and starts running for the very first time it can assume two things : ( a ) it holds the GIL and ( b ) it will find a correct value in _PyThreadState_Current .
As of that moment the Pythonic thread should not relinquish the GIL and let other threads run without first storing _PyThreadState_Current somewhere , and should immediately re-acquire the GIL and restore _PyThreadState_Current to its old value when it wants to resume running Pythonic code .
This behaviour is what keeps _PyThreadState_Current correct for GIL - holding threads and is so common that macros exist to do the save - release / acquire - restore idioms ( Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS ) .
There ’s much more to say about the GIL and additional APIs to handle it and it ’s probably also interesting to contrast it with other Python implementation ( Jython and IronPython are thread safe and do run Pythonic threads concurrently ) .
But we ’ll leave all that to a later post .
We now have all pieces in place , so here ’s a little diagram I quickly jotted1 which shows the relation between the state structures within a single process hosting Python as described so far .
We have in this example two interpreters with two threads each , you can see each of these threads points to its own call stack of frames .
Lovely , is n’t it .
Anyway , something we did n’t discuss at all is why these structures are needed .
I mean , what ’s in them ?
The reason we did n’t discuss the contents so far and will only briefly mention it now is that I wanted the structure to be clear more than the features .
We will discuss the roles of each of these objects as we discuss the feature that relies on that role ; for example , interpreter states contain several fields dealing with imported modules of that particular interpreter , so we can talk about that when we talk about importing .
That said , I would n’t want to leave you completely in the dark , so we ’ll briefly add that in addition to managing imports they hold bunch of pointers related to handling Unicode codecs , a field to do with dynamic linking flags and a field to do with TSC usage for profiling ( see last bullet here ) , I did n’t look into it much .
Thread states have more fields but to me they were more easily understood .
Not too surprisingly , they have fields that deal with things that relate to the execution flow of a particular thread and are of too broad a scope to fit particular frame .
Take for example the fields recursion_depth , overflow and recursion_critical , which are meant to trap and raise a RuntimeError during overly deep recursions before the stack of the underlying platform is exhausted and the whole process crashes .
In addition to these fields , this structure accommodates fields related to profiling and tracing , exception handling ( exceptions can be thrown across frames ) , a general purpose per-thread dictionary for extensions to store arbitrary stuff in and counters to do with deciding when a thread ran too much and should voluntarily relinquish the GIL to let other threads run .
I think this pretty much sums up what I have to say about the general layout of a Python process .
I hope it was indeed simple enough to follow , I plan on getting into rough waters soon and wanted this post to sink in well with you ( and me ! ) .
The next two ( maybe three ) posts will start chasing a real heavyweight , the frame object , which will force us to discuss namespaces and code objects .
Engage .
I would like to thank Antoine Pitrou and Nick Coghlan for reviewing this article ; any mistakes that slipped through are my own .
Sotheby 's said the Polaroid picture heralded a change " not only in technology and aesthetics , but a change in expectations .
To see a photograph moments after it is taken is an unchallenged right of our digital age .
But in 1948 , the hours it took to make prints from rolls or sheets of film were the tedious norm . "
By the 1960s , half of all US homes had a Polaroid .
But the instant cameras fell out of fashion as consumers switched to digital photography

Every war must end , instructed the U.S. strategist Fred Ikle .
But leftover unexploded ordnance can be a war 's legacy , particularly when small and unstable munitions lay around areas where civilians rebuild their lives after the fighting stops .
That 's why a new international ban on cluster munitions will take effect on Saturday .
The U.S. , however , is n't part of the accord .
More than 30 countries have ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions – the threshold for it entering into force – and over 100 have signed it since 2008 .
Holdouts include Russia , Israel and the United States .
All three of those countries have used cluster bombs in the past decade : Russia during its conflict with Georgia in 2008 ( Georgia also used cluster munitions against Russia ) ; Israel during its conflict with Hezbollah in 2006 ( Hezbollah also used cluster munitions against Israel ) ; and the U.S. during the initial phases of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars .
( Neither the Taliban nor Saddam used cluster bombs against U.S. troops . )
There are a variety of cluster bombs , but they generically work like this : the munitions spray out smaller bombs across a given target , so you can cover a wide area and take out enemy vehicles , weapons , and , of course , fighters with a single , relatively small burst .
Some versions , like the Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser , equip the bomblets with tech to control their trajectory , making them more like smart bomblets .
The case against their use is well known : cluster sub-munitions are , in effect , the world 's deadliest duds .
The bomblets have a failure rate of up to ten percent by some estimates – and can act as unexploded ordnance , going off in civilian areas after a battle has concluded , similar to landmines .
The Cluster Munition Coalition , a group opposed to the weapons , estimates that 60 percent of cluster - bomb casualties are injured " while undertaking their normal activities . "
In 2008 , the Pentagon agreed to scale back its use of cluster weapons , pledging not to use any bomb with a failure rate higher than 1 percent after 2018 .
So why is n't the U.S. on board with an outright ban ?
According to the Pentagon 's 2008 policy , cluster munitions are actually humane weapons .
" Because future adversaries will likely use civilian shields for military targets – for example by locating a military target on the roof of an occupied building – use of unitary weapons could result in more civilian casualties and damage than cluster munitions , " the policy claims .
" Blanket elimination of cluster munitions is therefore unacceptable due not only to negative military consequences but also due to potential negative consequences for civilians . "
In other words , it 's better to use a cluster bomb on enemies using a building than to blow up the entire building .
Cluster opponents do n't buy it .
" The vast majority of U.S. allies have banned this weapon , " Thomas Nash , the coordinator of the Cluster Munition Coalition , said in a statement e-mailed to Danger Room .
" In line with his rhetoric on multilateralism , Obama needs to bring the U.S. in line with other nations that respect international law and the protection of civilians in armed conflict . "
While the Pentagon argues against ruling out the use of cluster bombs , the military is experimenting with potential replacements .
For instance : a warhead that sprays tiny darts called " kinetic energy pellets " at a target .
These pellets act like bullets , not explosives , so there is n't a danger of delayed blast if civilians later come into a pellet - littered area .

Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated .
Processing the ever - growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications .
Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today 's multi-core CPUs and GPUs .
In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups ( between 10X and 1000X ) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels .
To understand where such large performance difference comes from , we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7 - 960 processor narrows to only 2.5 x on average .
In this paper , we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU , analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures , and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels .

Australia 's minister for broadband , and censorship , Stephen Conroy has delayed the switch - on of its Chinese - style national firewall until after the election .
Conroy 's moves have been criticised on technical , practical , economic and moral grounds to no avail .
But it seems the danger of losing votes has focused his mind .
Trials of the initial system , which claimed only to block child sex abuse images , hit controversy when the secret blacklist of sites was leaked and found to contain a variety of other content - from vanilla porn to a site for a Tasmanian dentist .
Conroy said the filter would be delayed until a proper definition of Refused Classification could be found .
He said : " Some sections of the community have expressed concern about whether the range of material included in the RC category ... correctly reflects current community standards , " according to the Sydney Morning Herald .
The Aussies are already partial to a fair bit of censorship - American Psycho is banned in parts of the country and only available for over - 18s elsewhere .
Adult video games are also currently refused classification and cannot be sold anywhere in Australia .
Conroy also promised to introduce a route to appeal if your site is unfairly included on the list which will be reviewed annually .
Conroy 's own website , which has been a victim of hackers before , is unavailable at the time of writing . ®
Image caption The King 's Troop fire the Royal Salutes in Hyde Park on Royal Anniversaries and State Occasions
The manure from horses in the King 's Troop will be used to heat and light its new headquarters in south London .
The dung from the 170 animals of the Royal Horse Artillery will be made into pellets to generate bio-fuel , a Ministry of Defence spokesman said .
The regiment will use the fuel when it moves from St John 's Wood to its new headquarters in Woolwich in 2011 .
The MoD said the sustainable move was in line with the new government 's target to reduce carbon emissions .
Promoting sustainability
The King 's Troop are a part of the Household Troops
Their duties include the firing of Royal Salutes in Hyde Park on both Royal anniversaries and State occasions as well as performing at ceremonies for the Queen 's Life Guard at Horse Guards .
The regiment 's new home in Napier Lines will provide stables and indoor and outdoor training facilities for the 170 horses .
The new building will also have a viewing gallery , regimental offices , a museum , gun park and forge and will house the troop 's historic gun carriages which are used for royal ceremonies .
Both horse manure and bedding from the stables will be processed into bio-fuel .
A MoD spokesman said : " The MOD encourages innovation by our people and suppliers , including measures to promote sustainability wherever possible .
" The MOD is fully committed to the government 's sustainable development agenda and to aggressive reductions in carbon emissions .
In 2008/09 the MOD met the goal to reduce emissions by 12.5 % , compared to 1999/00 levels , two years ahead of the target date . "

" One reason that Texas did so well is that it fully escaped the “ housing bubble ” that did so much damage in California , Florida , Arizona , Nevada and other states ( see chart above ) .
One key factor was the state ’s liberal , market oriented land use policies .
This served to help keep the price of land low while profligate lending increased demand .
More importantly , still sufficient new housing was built , and affordably .
By contrast , places with highly restrictive land use policies ( California , Florida and other places , saw prices rise to unprecedented heights ) , making it impossible for builders to supply sufficient new housing at affordable prices .
Speculation is often blamed as having contributed to the higher house prices that developed in California and Florida .
This is correct .
Moreover , with some of the strongest demand in the United States , Texas would seem to have been a candidate for rampant speculation .
After all , it happened back in the 1970s when a huge oversupply of housing , industrial , retail and office space collapsed in the face of falling energy prices .
Yet the speculators were not drawn to the metropolitan areas of Texas .
This is because speculators or " flippers " are not drawn by plenty , but by perceived scarcity .
In housing , a sure road to scarcity is to limit the supply of buildable land by outlawing development on much that might otherwise be available .
However , the speculators did not miss California and Florida .
Nor did they miss Las Vegas or Phoenix , where the price of land for new housing rose between five and 10 times as the housing bubble developed .
Despite their near limitless expanse of land , much of it was off limits to building , and the exorbitant price increases were thus to be expected . "
MP : The graph above shows that Florida ,
The graph above shows that Texas never had a real estate bubble like those in California Arizona or Nevada .
Consequently , Texas never had the real estate crash like in the other states .
This article presents an interesting perspective about how restrictive land use policies contributed to the real estate bubbles around the country , and how Texas may have escaped the Great Recession at least partly due to more liberal land use policies .

Need a friend ?
Instead of wasting time trying to meet someone the old - fashioned way , why not just pay someone to spend time with you ?
RentAFriend.com offers up friends for hire with prices ranging from $ 10 to $ 150 .
If you need someone to go to a movie with , go for dinner with or be a wingman on a night out with , you can just search the site and connect with someone who ’s willing to do it with you — for a fee .
The site , which has been around for six months , already has a reported 200 , 000 members .
Although the site says that it ’s not a dating or escort site , one of the most offered services , according to the homepage , is renting a friend to be a prom date ( oh , that has teen - angst movie plot written all over it , does n’t it ? ) .
While some of the suggested uses for the site do seem pretty practical ( having someone show you around town or teach you a skill ) , many of them seem a bit like a crutch .
Has social networking changed real - life interaction to the point where we need to pay someone to be a real - time friend ?
Is this the next step in social networking fads that continue to kill , you know , being social ?
Next up : Have no friends ?

True Blood
She can read minds , sling beers and toss back shots with werewolves .
Not to mention work a pair of short - shorts across two states .
No wonder True Blood 's Sookie Stackhouse ( Anna Paquin ) is the dream girl for three guys who put the super in supernatural .
So far she 's been loyal to her first love , Civil War-era vampire Bill Compton ( Stephen Moyer ) , but a heartrending breach of trust will soon tear the two apart , leaving an opening for calculating Viking bloodsucker Eric Northman ( Alexander Skarsgård ) and sensitive werewolf bodyguard Alcide Herveaux ( Joe Manganiello ) .

" It will shake the very core of their relationship , " says executive producer Alan Ball of the shocking incident that wounds the couple in Season 3 .
" Bill and Sookie 's love for each other is authentic and they want to make it work .
But it might get harder and harder . "
Sookie 's love life is a huge reason viewers are sucking up True Blood by the gallon .
The Emmy - nominated drama , based on the best - selling book series by Charlaine Harris , is HBO 's biggest hit since The Sopranos .
Set in backwater Bon Temps , La. , and surrounds , it 's a Southern Gothic gumbo of hot sex , deep love and vampire politics , with enough story lines to choke a gator .
But underneath it all is the battle for Sookie 's heart that 's been raging since Season 1 .
Fans have chosen sides , and it's on for Team Bill versus Team Eric ( unofficial team T - shirts are available online ) , with new rival Alcide now running as a dark horse , er , wolf .
Team Bill diehards held their breath in the Season 2 finale when Bill was kidnapped just after proposing to Sookie .
This season kicked off with Bill being hauled away by werewolves working for vampire king of Mississippi Russell Edgington ( Denis O'Hare ) .
Sookie 's search for her intended landed her in Russell 's clutches , too , and she might have died along the way if not for Alcide 's protection .
Add to that the conniving Eric ; Bill 's maker and ex , Lorena ( Mariana Kleveno ) , who 's said she 'd like to wear Sookie 's rib cage as a hat ; the dangerous vampire queen Sophie - Anne ( Evan Rachel Wood ) ; and you 've got one bloody mess .
Still , Moyer ( Paquin 's real - life fiancé ) believes that , when it comes to true love , all the mayhem is manageable .
" I can't get into slinging matches about who 's better for Sookie because it 's just ridiculous , " he laughs .
" Bill is for Sookie , the love of her life . "
Moyer makes a good case for why on a moonless night in an outdoor scene that will air in the Aug. 8 episode .
We wo n't reveal too much , but we will say he 's ready to fight Russell , who has put Bill 's progeny , teenage vamp Jessica ( Deborah Ann Woll ) , in danger .
Bill 's all passion and protectiveness , and definitely someone you want in your corner — or any room of the house .
Score one for Team Bill .
But during the escape from Russell 's mansion that eventually leads to this moment , Moyer hints , " Sookie does something we have n't seen her do yet for Bill .
It being the roller - coaster ride that their relationship is , something happens immediately that makes things go awry . "
For more on the other men in Sookie 's life , including bad boy vamp Eric and hot werewolf Alcide , pick up this week 's issue of TV GUIDE MAGAZINE , on newsstands Thursday , July 29 !
A year ago this week , I wrote about how China was cracking down on social media sites in preparation for the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square .
This year , government censors are taking a different tack , making a flood of previously blocked sites accessible .
The twist : the majority of these sites appear to be pornography .
The move directly contradicts the government 's previous opposition to pornographic content online : Chinese filtering software Green Dam ostensibly exists to protect children from such content , including nude photos .
Despite this , Taiwan News reports that many Chinese and foreign - language pornography sites became accessible over the past week .
Why the policy shift , and why now ?
The obvious answer is that the government is trying to distract Internet users from today 's anniversary , though Newser 's Rob Quinn reports that some believe the move may be an attempt at " calming discontent among the country 's increasingly male - heavy population . "
Given the number of social media sites China has blocked and its efforts to prevent discussion of the anniversary online this week , the distraction theory makes the most sense .
Facebook and Twitter , which China blocked temporarily during last year 's anniversary , are less of a concern this year .
Both sites have been largely inaccessible within the country since they were used to spread information about the riots in Urumqi last July .
YouTube is also blocked , according to a recent flood of reports from Herdict .
This year China 's decided to add location - based social networking application Foursquare to the list of blocked sites .
Forbes reports that the the block came in response to the number of users who set their location to Tiananmen Square as a way of paying their respects online :
The keepers of the Great Firewall of China acknowledged the day in their own way by blocking the social networking site Foursquare .
It seems that Foursquare users observed today 's 21st anniversary of the massacre by telling the site in numbers that they were " checking in " at Tiananmen Square .
The Great Firewall , not amused , has conferred on Foursquare its own version of the " overshare " badge .
The article also claims that Chinese social network Sina is taking candle and flower emoticons , likely posted in remembrance of the events at Tiananmen , off of its microblog .
Interestingly , among the list of newly accessible sites is video sharing site Vimeo .
This has prompted some analysts to speculate that the unblocking may be a fluke .
Even if it is intentional , others have noted that visits to the unblocked sites have not increased since the sites became accessible , suggesting that those who wanted to access porn from China have simply been using proxies .
Republicans came to President Obama ’s rescue Tuesday , providing him the votes needed for quick passage of a $ 59 billion emergency war - spending bill to fund his 30,000 Afghanistan troop surge .
The bill cleared the House by a vote of 308 - 114 , or well more than the two - thirds needed under expedited rules .
It now heads to Mr. Obama for his signature after House Democratic leaders acceded to the administration ’s demand for action and gave up their hopes of tacking on billions of dollars in new stimulus spending .
Handing Mr. Obama another victory just before approving the war spending , the House overwhelmingly rejected a measure introduced by Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , Ohio Democrat , to remove any U.S. armed forces operating in Pakistan .
“ Denying terrorists a safe haven in Iraq and Afghanistan is critical to the safety and security of our country .
As our troops continue their fight , it is imperative that Congress continue to provide the resources they need and support their mission , ” said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .
Lawmakers were not swayed by the recent publication of a trove of leaked documents depicting a tough slog in the war in Afghanistan .
But it took the strength of Republican votes to deliver the money — one of just a few times Mr. Obama has had to rely on his political opponents .
Voting for the bill were 160 Republicans and 148 Democrats , while 102 Democrats and 12 Republicans opposed it .
Mr. Obama first requested the money in February , but for months the House , Senate and administration have been sparring over the size and shape of the package .
On Tuesday , though , Democrats said they needed to “ get this behind us ” and move on to the rest of their agenda , including the regular spending bills to keep the government running in the next fiscal year , which begins Oct.
1 .
Republicans said the bill could have been passed two months ago but for Democrats ’ desire to add more domestic stimulus spending to the measure .
“ Our first job as members of Congress is to support our troops and the men and women who are in harm ’s way protecting our country , ” said Rep. Jerry Lewis of California , the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee .
Ahead of the vote , Mr. Obama made his own plea , telling the House to follow the lead of the Senate , which passed the bill unanimously last week .
Still , the bill deeply split House Democrats .
The chairman of the Appropriations Committee , Rep. David R. Obey , Wisconsin Democrat , voted against it , saying he does n’t have confidence that the war is still the right solution .
He pointed to a recent statement by the CIA director that fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda are still in Afghanistan as evidence that the war effort there is wasted .
“ I cannot look my constituents in the eye and say this operation will hurt our enemies more than it hurts us , ” he said .
But one of his chief deputies , Rep. Norm Dicks , Washington Democrat and chairman of the defense spending subcommittee , said the administration needed the money , and urged his colleagues to support it .
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri , also backed the spending , saying without it , the Defense Department could have to furlough employees and cut programs just to keep paying the troops .
The bill became a lightning rod for various fights , including war policy and stimulus spending .
Emergency spending bills are considered must - pass legislation and are considered to be good vehicles to tack on other priorities .
Mr. Obey ’s initial version of the bill included tens of billions of dollars in stimulus spending , including money for states and localities to keep or hire teachers .
He proposed redirecting some of last year ’s $ 862 billion stimulus package to pay for the new spending , but that prompted a veto threat from the White House , which said the original Recovery Act should not be altered .
Mr. Obey ’s version also included hundreds of millions of dollars to fund Mr. Obama ’s pledge to send National Guard troops to the U.S. - Mexico border , and to pay for more technology to catch illegal immigrants .
Congressional aides said that money might be passed as a stand - alone bill .
Democrats accused Republicans of blocking the extra funding .
“ They need to understand that they are obstructing our economic recovery , as well , ” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat .
“ However , because it is so important to fund our troops before leaving for the August district work period , I am pleased that a majority of my colleagues chose to vote yes . ”

Im not sure if this has been covered in a thread yet ( I searched , all i could find was offhand comments ) so i apologize if this is old news .
I was bored , and i was wondering what the specific conversion is between in - game APM ( The little box that appears when pressing M when watching a replay ) and real APM ( Your actions per minute ) , I thought they may have fixed that discrepancy by now ( I 'm fairly sure Dustin Browder mentioned working on a fix to it at some event day [ 9 ] and losing ID8 went to )
Well , as the thread title suggests , they did n't .
Using a metronome i clicked once per second , and watching the replay my APM was consistently 40 .
So for those of you who enjoy the manhood measuring contest that is APM , just multiply your in game APM by 1.5 .
As a side - note , this all started because I was worried that I was playing with similar APM than when i used to play brood war .
I was a fairly lackluster Broodwar player , rocking a cool - headed 100 - 110 apm , But now it turns out my SC2 APM is actually 160 - 170 on long games , which i never expected to be able to reach .
Also APM= / skill , it is merely loosely correlated with it .
EDIT : I realise that this has nothing to do with strategy , i just posted it in the wrong place . ( im sleepy ) , surely a benevolent mod could help a brother out .

The APM meter on replays is actually measuring actions per game minute is why there is a discrepancy , ( You 're playing on fastest )
I kinda doubt they will fix this because they 're maintaining consistency with all the measurements of time as game time ,
The unfortunate thing is that they did n't make fastest 1:1 game time to real time since it is the standard play speed .

Kind of ridiculous that this still hasnt been fixed .
I 'm kind of astonished that they have n't bothered to change this .
Perhaps this also makes the income tab completely whacked .
This means , instead of 160 apm im probably sitting over 200 over 30 minute games ( Which is what I should be at ) .

What I want to know is why is normal considered normal when everyone plays on fastest .
The whole conversion between game time and real time can be confusing and Im just wondering why it exists , is it just a legacy artifact from BW , and if so why was it that way in BW

I tried calculating it myself but always ended up with a multiplier of around 1.33 .
Your method sounds a bit more precise so I 'll just go with the 1.5 value .
Also , I 've had the same experience with moving from BW to SC2 in terms of my APM being a lot higher .

Are you sure it is 1.5 ?
I have heard it is 1.4 exactly ( the speed of the game on faster ) .

SC2 APM * 1.38 = SC : BW APM
So , someone with 150 apm according to the counter in the game is really playing at 200 apm in actual minutes instead of " game minutes " .
Or , alternatively , the game is n't calculating apm , but rather action per " 43 seconds " )
On that note , why does blizzard count seconds on a speed no one plays at ?
It 's true for build times too and everything , and it 's confusing .
It 's not even a nice ratio you can do in your head .
From the liquipedia article , " faster " is 38 % faster than normal , which is how APM is calculated .

TL ;DR : the fastest speed setting is at least 36 % faster than the reference speed ( build time numbers ) and it might even reach something like 40 % considering that the normal speed setting is 3 % slower than reference - I think a good average approximation would be 38 % , that means if your APM displayed in the replay is 100 , your actual APM was more around 135- 140
I will probably redo the tests when I will get a new comp , as I feel that simply running the game in windowed mode in background induced some discrepency - hopefully that will disappear when I get a much better comp I made some tests on the actual " time rate " conversions , you can find the full results in this thread : http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=117215

A month or two ago Day9 said he brought up this issue to the developers , who were apparently not aware of it , and they promised that they 'd fix it to be more accurate with real time .
I have n't really looked at APM since then , but it 's possible that the old experimental data is now outdated .

It should n't really matter because everyone has the same timing so the apm will still be the right differential .

From what I understand , real APM in SC2 is slightly higher than the indicated amount , but how does it translate to BW APM calculations ?
( No , I am not trying to say SC2 APM is the same as BW APM gameplay wise , I am merely asking concerning the technical side of calculating the APM itself timewise )
How was the APM calculated in BW in comparison to the current APM calculation in SC2 ?

The question is whether all the right wing causes ranging from ex-Resident Bush to tea party political action groups will return the millions they received from the brothers .
Time for political watchdogs on the left to draw up a list of those who profited from the Bros ' financial largess .
From NYT -
" Samuel and Charles Wyly , the billionaire brothers from Dallas who are large donors to conservative causes , were charged Thursday with conducting an extensive securities fraud that the Securities and Exchange Commission said reaped them $ 550 million in undisclosed gains . "
" The brothers , who founded Sterling Software , a business software and services company that was sold for $ 4 billion in stock to rival CA in March 2000 , were also charged with insider trading violations that reaped more than $ 31 million in gains , the S.E.C. said .
" The ill - gotten gains , according to the S.E.C. , were used to buy tens of millions of dollars of art , collectibles and jewelry ; $ 100 million of real estate , including two ranches in Aspen , Colo. , and a 100 - acre horse farm near Dallas ; and to make charitable contributions , including $ 10 million to the business school at Sam Wyly ’s alma mater , the University of Michigan .
Samuel
Wyly is also known for his political affiliations , including financing a group that paid for ads in 2000 praising the environmental record of George W. Bush during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination . "

Here are some of their politcal actions according to Wikipedia -
" In March 2007 , commenting on a purchase of a local bookstore by Wyly and his wife Cheryl , the Aspen Times noted that the Wyly family " has been known not only for its philanthropic efforts , but also its large contributions to conservative political campaigns and candidates . "
Wyly and his brother Charles have personally given about $ 10 million to Republican causes and candidates between the early 1970s and 2006 , they say ; both are Bush Pioneers .
In 2000 , Sam Wyly contributed $ 2.5 million to a group called " Republicans for Clean Air " , which ran ads praising George W. Bush 's environmental record and criticizing that of John McCain .
The ads ran in New York , Ohio , and California in advance of early March primaries , at a time when Bush and McCain were locked in a tight struggle for the Republican presidential nomination .
It initially was unclear who was behind the group or who paid for the ads until Wyly stepped forward to take the credit .
In 2004 , Wyly also donated $ 20,000 to the Swift Boat campaign that raised questions about Sen. John Kerry 's military record in Vietnam , helping scuttle Kerry 's challenge to Bush .
Wyly said he is neither leaning toward McCain nor Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign , and wo n't get involved in the race .
The Anarcho - Statists of Spain
The Anarcho - Statists of Spain : An Historical , Economic , and Philosophical Analysis of Spanish Anarchism by Bryan Caplan
In the spirit of F.A. Hayek 's The Road to Serfdom , I dedicate this essay to anarcho - socialists of all factions .
In " Looking Back on the Spanish War , " George Orwell writes , " I have little direct evidence about the atrocities in the Spanish civil war .
I know that some were committed by the Republicans , and far more ( they are still continuing ) by the Fascists .
But what impressed me then , and has impressed me ever since , is that atrocities are believed in or disbelieved in solely on grounds of political predilection .
Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side , without ever bothering to examine the evidence . "
The same remark applies with equal force to much of the recent debate about the behavior of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Civil War .
Seeing that it was very difficult to unravel the truth behind the conflicting accounts and citations , I decided to look at the evidence for myself .
The following essay is the product of my investigations .
Quotations may sometimes seem overlong , because I avoided cutting them whenever possible to eliminate any suspicion of creative editing .

1. Introduction
The Spanish fascists used barbaric methods throughout the Spanish Civil War in order to establish a brutal dictatorship .
[ 1 ]
The Spanish Communists used similar wartime measures in their failed effort to give birth to an even more totalitarian regime .
[ 2 ]
But many discussions of the Spanish Civil War overlook , minimize , or apologize for the atrocious behavior and tyrannical aspirations of perhaps the most powerful faction of the Spanish Republicans : the Anarchist movement .
The present essay aims to redress the balance .
It first summarizes the historical details of the Anarchists ' behavior during the Spanish Civil War , scrutinizing both the behavior of the upper echelons of the Anarchist movement as well as the rank - and - file militants .
The essay then examines the economics of Anarchist - controlled Spain , focusing on both the policies adopted , their aims , and the results .
I conclude with a philosophical dissection of the Spanish Anarchist movement , showing that their horrific behavior was largely the result of their incoherent view of human freedom , their unsuccessful attempt to synthesize socialism and liberty , and their uncritical and emotional way of thinking .
2. History and the Spanish Anarchists
Many recent discussions of the Spanish Anarchists center around Ronald Fraser 's Blood of Spain [ 3 ] .
While the present essay uses Fraser as a source , there is always a concern in a work of oral history that the experiences of the ( necessarily small ) number of people interviewed may not be representative .
Instead , my primary reference source for the history of the Spanish Anarchists is Burnett Bolloten 's The Spanish Civil War [ 4 ] .
Bolloten 's objectivity and clarity enjoy widespread approbation , even by many informed individuals highly sympathetic to the Spanish Anarchists .
Noam Chomsky praises Bolloten 's work in " Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship , " and relies heavily upon Bolloten 's earlier , less developed work throughout that essay .
[ 5 ]
Bolloten was moreover the key historian who documented the Communists ' atrocities against the Spanish Anarchists , and one of the first historians to demonstrate that contrary to the propaganda of the Republican government , the Spanish Anarchists experimented with radical social changes on a vast scale during the war .
Finally , Bolloten 's objectivity speaks for itself , for he takes painstaking effort to confirm every fact and carefully note the existence of any conflicting evidence .
A. The Militants and Terror
In July of 1936 , officers throughout Spain tried to orchestrate a coup detat against the Republican government . [ 6 ]
In Catalonia , Aragon , and other areas , Anarchist militants defeated the military uprisings .
Finding themselves more powerful than the regional governments and possibly the central government , the Spanish Anarchists seized the moment to implement some radical changes in those regions of Spain where they had a large following .
One of these radical changes was the beginning of large - scale murders of people believed to be supporters of the Nationalists .
In most cases , these supporters had taken no specific action to assist the Nationalist rebellion ; they were singled out for their beliefs , or what people guessed their beliefs were .
As Bolloten explains :
" The courts of law were supplanted by revolutionary tribunals , which dispensed justice in their own way .
' Everybody created his own justice and administered it himself , ' declared Juan Garcia Oliver , a leading Anarchist who became minister of justice in November 1936 .
' Some used to call this " taking a person for a ride , " [ paseo ] but I maintain that it was justice administered directly by the people in the complete absence of regular judicial bodies . ' " [ 7 ]
This distinction no doubt escaped the thousands of people who were murdered because they happened to have political or religious beliefs that the Anarchists did not agree with .
" ' We do not wish to deny , ' avowed Diego Abad de Santillan , a prominent Anarchist in the region of Catalonia , ' that the nineteenth of July brought with it an overflowing of passions and abuses , a natural phenomenon of the transfer of power from the hands of privileged to the hands of the people .
It is possible that our victory resulted in the death by violence of four or five thousand inhabitants of Catalonia who were listed as rightists and were linked to political or ecclesiastical reaction . ' " [ 8 ]
De Santillan 's comment typifies the Spanish Anarchists ' attitude toward his movement 's act of murder of several thousand people for their political views : it is a mere " natural phenomenon , " nothing to feel guilty over .
Bolloten 's account of the Anarchist militants ' wave of murders is well - corroborated by other sources .
Thus , Hugh Thomas ' The Spanish Civil War ( a work which Bolloten takes issue with on a number of points ) explains that : " All who could conceivably be suspected of sympathy for the nationalist rising were in danger .
As among the nationalists , the irrational circumstances of a civil war made it impossible to lay down what was or was not treason .
The worthy died , the unworthy often lived .
In East Andalusia , lorries manned by the CNT drove into villages and ordered mayors to hand over their fascists .
The mayors had often to say that they had all fled but the terrorists would often hear from informers which of the better off people were still there , arrest them and shoot them in a nearby ravine . " [ 9 ]
Thomas adds that , " In the vast majority of cases , the murders were of the rank and file of the Right .
Often members of the working class would be killed by their own acquaintances for hypocrisy , for having kow - towed too often to their social superiors , even simply for untruthfulness .
In Altea , near Alicante , for example , a cafe proprietor was killed with a hatchet by an anarchist for having overcharged for stamps and for the glass of wine that buyers of stamps were forced to take while waiting . " [ 10 ]
Political belief was not the only kind of heterodoxy which the Spanish Anarchists refused to tolerate .
Mere acceptance of theism , typically in its Catholic variant , provoked many of the Anarchist militants to violence .
The burning of religious buildings , from cathedrals and churches to convents and monasteries was widespread , as was the murder of priests and nuns .
This might puzzle the naive observer ; after all , is not the Catholic church a perfect example of a communal , non-profit organization ?
Is not church property " held in common " by its adherents ?
At least in theory , the clergy 's vow of poverty obliges them to hand over all of their personal property to the Church , which then provides for their needs out of the communal stockpile .
The Catholic church seems to satisfy many of the social postulates that the Spanish Anarchists embraced .
This did not save the lives of the unfortunate clergy , since militant atheism had been a feature of European anarchism at least since the time of Bakunin , and because the Catholic church had historically allied itself politically with conservative monarchism .
As Bolloten states , " Hundreds of churches and convents were burned or put to secular uses .
' Catholic dens no longer exist , ' declared the Anarchosyndicalist organ , Solidaridad Obrera .
' The torches of the people have reduced them to ashes . '...' For the Revolution to be a fact , ' ran an Anarchist youth manifesto , 'we must demolish the three pillars of reaction : the church , the army , and capitalism .
The church has already been brought to account .
The temples have been destroyed by fire and the ecclesiastical crows who were unable to escape have been taken care of by the people . ' " [ 11 ]
As Bolloten sums matters up : " Thousands of members of the clergy and religious orders as well as of the propertied classes were killed , but others , fearing arrest or execution , fled abroad , including many prominent liberal or moderate Republicans . "
Thomas amply confirms Bolloten 's description of the Anarchists ' religious persecution and intolerance .
" ' Do you still believe in this God who never speaks and who does not defend himself even when his images and temples are burned ?
Admit that God does not exist and that you priests are all so many hypocrites who deceive the people ' : such questions were put in countless towns and villages of republican Spain .
At no time in the history of Europe , or even perhaps of the world , has so passionate a hatred of religion and all its works been shown .
Yet one priest who , while 1,215 monks , nuns , and priests died in the province of Barcelona , managed to escape to France through the help of President Companys , was generous enough to admit that ' the reds have destroyed our churches , but we first had destroyed the church . ' " [ 12 ]
Fraser documents many other instances of the Anarchists ' religious intolerance , but also brings out an interesting case in which the Anarchist leader Carod forbade violence against religious buildings and personnel .
" ' You are burning the churches without thinking of the grief you are causing your mothers , sisters , daughters , parents , in whose veins flows Christian , Catholic blood .
Do not believe that by burning churches you are going to change that blood and that tomorrow everyone will feel himself , herself an atheist .
On the contrary !
The more you violate their consciences , the more they will side with the church .
Moreover , the immense majority of you are believers at heart . '
He demanded that all lives and all property - not only religious - be respected . " [ 13 ]
Note that Carod merely appeals to the strategic folly of persecuting religious believers , since it leads people to " side with the church " ( and presumably to side with the Nationalists as well ) .
Carod 's argument typifies the Spanish Anarchists ' half - hearted self - criticism .
One waits in vain for an Anarchist to defend freedom of thought , the individual 's right to believe what he chooses ; to say , in short , that mere belief is not a crime , but killing someone for his beliefs is .
None of this implies , of course , that similar atrocities were not committed by the Nationalists and by non-Anarchist forces on the Republican side .
It is to be expected that Communists , fascists , and the other bloodthirsty zealots of the 20th century would brutally murder people for their beliefs .
One would be surprised if moderate Republicans , moderate Socialists , and moderate monarchists restrained themselves from widespread murder in the midst of a fratricidal civil war .
But one would hope that a movement condemning the state for its age - old brutality , and advocating an end to all human domination , would have behaved differently .
Instead , it is clear that Anarchist militants were at the vanguard of the murder squads on the Republican side . [ 14 ]
Apologists for the Spanish Anarchist movement often claim that the aforementioned killings simply represent the individual decisions of unorganized groups of Anarchist militants , rather than any sort of a party - line policy organized and desired by the Anarchist leadership .
Stanley Payne finds the facts of the Republican repression to be rather more complex : " A common distinction between the Red and White terrors in Spain that has sometimes been made by partisans of the left is that the former was disorganized and spontaneous , while the latter was centralized and systematic , continuing throughout the war and long afterward .
This distinction is at best only partially accurate .
In the early months the Nationalist repression was not at all centrally organized , whereas that in the Popular Front zone had more planning and organization than it is given credit for .
This is indicated by the many executions in areas where social conflict was not particularly intense , and by the fact that many of the killings were done by revolutionary militia coming in from other districts .
Nor did the political executions in the Republican zone end after the close of 1936 , though they did diminish in volume . " [ 15 ]
In any case , whether the murders were centrally ordered , completely decentralized , or ( as is most likely ) somewhere in between , what difference does it make ?
Does it matter if the widespread Nazi attacks on Jews known as the Kristallnacht were centrally organized or " spontaneous " ?
No ; if an ideology categorizes many people as sub - human , urging ever greater brutality , and recommending restraint only when it is tactically convenient , it is perfectly reasonable to castigate the entire movement centering around that ideology , whether that movement be Nazism or Spanish Anarchism .
It is quite clear that the rhetoric of the Spanish Anarchists focused on crushing the enemies of the workers by any means necessary ; safeguarding the rights of innocent people who happened to despise everything Anarchism stood for was simply not on their agenda .
Fraser 's interview of Juan Moreno , a CNT day - laborer , merits notice : " ' We hated the bourgeoisie , they treated us like animals .
They were our worst enemies .
When we looked at them we thought we were looking at the devil himself .
And they thought the same of us . ' " [ 16 ]
Bolloten similarly notes , " According to Perez - Baro [ a former member of the CNT who played a prominent role in the collectivization movement in Catalonia ] , thirty to forty years of revolutionary propaganda had made employers appear in the eyes of the workers not as ' class enemies , ' but as ' personal enemies , ' which resulted in a series of abuses against them . " [ 17 ]
In short , it is perfectly just to impugn the Anarchist movement as a whole for the numerous atrocities of its members , because these actions flowed logically from the central ideas of the movement rather than their misinterpretation by extreme fringe groups .
B. The Leaders and Collaboration
The complicity of the Spanish Anarchist leadership in the aforementioned atrocities is sometimes hard to untangle ; obviously , most of the murder orders were not publicly recorded .
However , public records concerning the Anarchist leadership 's record of collaboration with the central and regional governments throughout Spain provides ample documentation of a long series of abuses and betrayals of whatever good principles the Anarchist movement held dear .
At the outset it is necessary to give some background on the pre-war organization of the Anarchists , which its supporters frequently claim was extraordinarily democratic .
From at least 1927 on , the democratic procedures of the CNT were frequently compromised by a special faction known as the FAI , which Bolloten describes as the CNT's " ideological guide , whose mission was to protect the CNT from deviationist tendencies and to lead the trade - union federation to the Anarchist goal of libertarian communism . " [ 18 ]
Bolloten properly notes that many of the Spanish Anarchists would violently dispute this claim , but insists that the facts do not support them .
" The FAI attempted to accomplish its directive mission by virtue of the fact that its members , with few exceptions , belonged to the CNT and held many positions of trust .
It was an established principle that any person belonging to a political party should not occupy any official position in the trade - union organization .
The FAI , moreover , kept a close and constant supervision over the unions of the CNT , often threatening to use force to prevent deviationist trends when argument failed .
To be sure , this domination - or at least attempted domination - by the FAI was not always openly acknowledged by the CNT and FAI and indeed was at times emphatically denied , but it was frankly admitted after the Civil War by other leaders of the CNT . " [ 19 ]
Fraser corroborates Bolloten 's remarks .
Josep Costa , a CNT textile worker explains , " ' The FAI was acting like a political group within the CNT , talking of liberty and acting like dictators ... ' " [ 20 ]
Sebastia Clara , a dissident treintista CNT member , adds , " ' Before the 1920's , the CNT was an organization in which the masses could express themselves democratically .
Afterwards , this was no longer the case .
Things changed with the creation of the FAI in 1927 .
It was they who now imposed their decisions ... ' " [ 21 ]
While this burgeoning authoritarianism in the guise of democracy makes it easy to understand how the Anarchist leadership often deviated from the viewpoint of the rank - and - file , the fact that the FAI was noted for its ideological purism makes its numerous deviations all the more puzzling .
While the CNT and especially the FAI repeatedly condemned political participation before the Civil War , it was simple to induce CNT leaders to accept ministerial positions in the central government .
Initially , Prime Minister Caballero offered the CNT a single seat , which the CNT national plenum rejected .
This was no principled rejection , however ; the Anarchist put forward a compromise resolution according to which " ' auxiliary commissions ' were to be set up in each ministry comprising two representatives of the CNT , two of the UGT , two of the Popular Front parties , and one government delegate .
This project would have spared the CNT the embarrassment of direct participation in the cabinet , but would nonetheless have given it representation in every branch of government . " [ 22 ]
This proposal failed ; the next Anarchist initiative was to advocate " that the government should be replaced by a national council of defense composed of five members of their organization , five of the UGT , and four members of the Republican parties . " [ 23 ]
Bolloten cites one Anarchist 's acerbic critique of this Orwellian attempt to avoid joining the government by calling it something different : " ' The purpose of this purely nominal change was to reconcile their fervent desire to enter the government with their antistate doctrine .
What childishness !
A movement that had cured itself of all prejudices and had always scoffed at mere appearances tried to conceal its abjuration of fundamental principles by changing a name ...
This behavior is as childish as than of an unfortunate woman , who , having entered a house of ill fame and wishing to preserve a veneer of morality , asks to be called a hetera instead of a whore . ' " [ 24 ]
The Anarchists tried this tactic for about a month until CNT national secretary Horacio Prieto , who favored direct participation in the Popular Front government , prevailed .
" Horacio Prieto decided to ' put an end to the last elements of opposition , ' within the CNT and convoked a plenary session of the regional federations for 18 October .
This time his arguments prevailed .
The plenum accorded him full powers to conduct negotiations ' in his own way ' in order to bring the CNT into the government .
' I was convinced , ' he wrote after the war , 'of the necessity of collaboration , and I smothered my own ideological and conscientious scruples . ' " [ 25 ]
The end result of Prieto 's dealings with the government was that the CNT won control of the ministries of justice , industry , commerce , and health .
Bolloten notes and amply documents his remark that , " Not only did this decision represent a complete negation of the basic tenets of Anarchism , shaking the whole structure of libertarian theory to the core , but , in violation of democratic principle , it had been taken without consulting the rank and file . " [ 26 ]
This violation would not be the last one , as shall be seen .
The Anarchists were even more eager to assume governmental powers in Catalonia , where they were strong enough to overshadow the regional Catalonian government , the Generalitat .
Rather than officially enter the Catalonian government , the Anarchists chose to retain the Generalitat as a legal cover ; but real power shifted into the hands of the Anarchist - controlled Central Anti-Fascist Militia Committee .
Bolloten indicates that for all practical purposes this Committee was the government of Catalonia under a new name : " the committee immediately became the de facto executive body in the region .
Its power rested not on the shattered machinery of the state but on the revolutionary militia and police squads and upon the multitudinous committees that sprang up in the region during the first days of the Revolution .
The work of the militia committee , attests Abad de Santillan , himself a member , included the establishment of revolutionary order in the rear , the creation of militia units for the front , the organization of the economy , and legislative and judicial action . " [ 27 ]
After a few months the Anarchists formally entered the Generalitat , mainly because the central government seemed unwilling to provide weapons to any other Catalonian organization .
It should be further noted that these Anarchist - run councils and committees were not mild - mannered minimal states , maintaining order while allowing the workers to organize themselves as they pleased .
They were " modern " states , concerning themselves with the economy , education , propaganda , transportation , and virtually everything else .
The Anarchists ' position in both the central government and in Catalonia slowly but surely declined after they entered into coalition governments with the other anti-Franco factions .
A common pattern was for the non- Anarchists to push for some measure that the Anarchists opposed ; the Anarchists would resist for a brief period ; and finally , the Anarchists would agree to the original measure after changing some of the labels and minor details .
By May of 1937 , after a mere ten months in power , the Anarchists found themselves out - maneuvered on the national and regional levels by the Communists and other political enemies .
There were a series of cabinet crises in the regional Catalonian government ; the resentment of the non-Anarchists , especially the Communists , against the continued de facto Anarchist control of Barcelona burnt ever brighter .
While the members of the CNT who held positions in the Catalonian government kept trying to reach an understanding with their fellow ministers , the rank and file Anarchists seem to have become increasingly alienated from their leaders .
A raid on the Anarchist - controlled telephone company brought these feelings to the surface .
( The non-Anarchists objected to the Anarchists ' use of wiretaps to listen in on important conversations . )
The CNT ministers merely demanded the removal of the main people responsible for the raid ; but hundreds of the rank - and - file Anarchists responded with rage , setting up barricades .
As Bolloten describes matters , " That same night [ May 3 - B.C. ] the executive committee of the POUM met with the regional committees of the CNT , FAI , and the Libertarian Youth .
Julian Gorkin , a member of the executive [ of the POUM - B.C. ] , recalls : ' We stated the problem in these precise terms : ' Neither of us has urged the masses of Barcelona to take this action .
This is a spontaneous response to Stalinist aggression ... [ The regional committees ] made no decision .
Their maximal demand was the removal of the [ police ] commissioner who had provoked the movement .
As though it were not the various forces behind him that had to be destroyed !
Always the form instead of the substance ! " [ 28 ]
The Anarchist leadership was , as this quote indicates , out of step with the rank - and - file ; they urged the militants to stop the fighting .
Their requests were not heeded , as Bolloten notes : " [ T ] here were forces intent on stoking the conflict .
Not only were Rodriguez Salas 's men initiating new offensive actions , but the tiny Trotskyist group of Bolshevik Leninists and the dissident Anarchist Friends of Durruti , joined by some of the more militant members of the POUM , were extremely active .
While the activists ignored the Anarchist leadership , the CNT ministers desperately tried to hammer out a deal with their fellow ministers in the Generalitat , who were by this point willing to endanger Catalonian autonomy by allowing the armed forces of the central government to re- establish order .
All the Anarchists managed to do was to obtain a few delays and haggle over the formation of a new government , while they cajoled the rank - and - file to fall into line .
" CNT secretary Mariano Vasquez again begged workers to leave the streets .
' We tell you that this situation must end ...
We do not want this stigma to fall upon the Spanish Anarchists ...
This is not the moment , in front of piled - up corpses , to discuss who is right .
It is essential that you disappear with your weapons from the streets ...
We must not wait for others to do so .
We must do so ourselves .
Afterward we shall talk .
If you decide , when you discuss our conduct at our next assembly , that we deserve to be shot , then you may shoot us , but now you must obey our slogans . ' " [ 29 ]
The end result was that the reinforcements from the central government arrived and firmly placed power into the hands of the Generalitat .
The power of the Communists was greatly enhanced at both the regional and national levels .
A new central government was formed with Juan Negrin as Prime Minister .
Bolloten amply documents that Negrin was a willing tool of the Communists , so it should be no surprise that the Anarchists lost all of their positions in the central government .
One might think that by this point they would be thoroughly disillusioned with power , but the Anarchists now assumed the degrading role of the political beggar they held for the rest of the war .
While condemning Negrin 's government as counterrevolutionary , the CNT leadership tried to strike a new deal .
When Negrin formed his second government , he threw the CNT a bone by giving them the ministry of education and health .
This was enough to retain the CNT 's collaboration until the Republic 's defeat .
Soon after Negrin 's appointment , the CNT lost all its seats in the Catalonian regional government .
Making a virtue out of necessity , Bolloten notes Tierra and Libertad announced that , " ' The CNT , with more than a million affiliates in Catalonia , is no longer with the government .
This is because Anarchosyndicalism cannot get involved with professional politicians and cannot humble itself before anyone ... [ I ]t refuses to defile itself with this kind of dirty politics . ' " [ 30 ]
In reality , the hangers - on of the CNT tried repeatedly to regain some role in the Catalonian government even as Franco 's forces prepared to capture Barcelona .
Once the CNT left the government , the Communists intensified their persecution and terrorization of the Anarchists .
Moreover , while the Anarchists made up a very large percentage of the Republic 's soldiery , the Communists had a vastly disproportionate representation in the officer corps .
Thus , the Anarchists allowed themselves to become cannon fodder for the Communists at the front , while the Communist secret police unleashed its hatred against the Anarchists in the rear .
As Bolloten describes it , " The spontaneous , undirected terror of the CNT and FAI during the height of the Revolution had now given way to the more sophisticated , centrally directed , and , hence , more fearful terror of the Communists . " [ 31 ]
Of course , one might wonder how it was possible for Anarchists to have joined forces with the Communists to begin with .
How could the avowed opponents of the very existence of the state join forces with the pawns of the most murderous , totalitarian dictatorship that the world had ever known ?
Even if moral principle did not deter them , at least the Bolsheviks ' propensity to exterminate their Anarchist allies might have given them pause .
Even though many Anarchists eventually realized that the defeat of Franco would lead to the establishment of a Soviet satellite state , they kept fighting .
Clearly the Anarchists ' opposition to the Nationalists dwarfed their distaste for Leninist totalitarianism .
Then again , perhaps the CNT yearned so strongly for power that they were willing to sacrifice many principles for limited authority .
After May 1937 , they endured considerable humiliation in exchange for a paltry role in the Republican government .
Were there any limits to what principles the Anarchists would sacrifice in order to be minor political players ?
Apparently not .
Stanley Payne indicates that the CNT leadership actually tried to strike a deal with the fascists in 1945 and 1946 .
As Payne explains , a Falangist leader " began negotiations that summer with the new clandestine secretary general of the CNT , Jose Leiva , in Madrid .
His goal was to rescue the Falange by gaining the support of opposition anarchosyndicalists for a broader , stronger , and more popular national syndicalism .
Franco eventually rejected the CNT 's demands , and the negotiations foundered the following year .
Suppression of the CNT leadership was renewed . " [ 32 ]
What was the nature of the deal that the CNT sought with the Falange ?
" According to a report presented to Franco in May 1946 , the CNT leadership offered a policy of cooperation , proposing to withdraw from the Giral Republican government - in - exile and accept three Falangists on their national committee , but in return insisted on freedom to proselytize . " [ 33 ]
This was the Anarchism of the CNT : an Anarchism which not only allied with the Communist totalitarians , but attempted to strike a power - sharing deal with the fascist totalitarians six years after the end of the civil war .
C. The Urban Collectives
Burnett Bolloten was the first mainstream historian to document the radical social changes that occurred in Republican Spain ; most earlier historians took the disclaimers of the Republican government at face value , in spite of the fact that the Republicans had every reason to conceal this radicalism in order to win military assistance from Britain and France .
Bolloten explains that the CNT and to a lesser extent the UGT took advantage of the chaos to seize control of the means of production :
" In Valencia , a city of over 350,000 inhabitants , nearly all plants , both large and small , were sequestered by the CNT and UGT , as were those in the province of Alicante , while in the region of Catalonia , where the Anarchosyndicalists were in almost unchecked ascendancy during the first months of the Revolution , collectivization in many towns was carried out so thoroughly that it embraced not only the large factories but the least important branches of handicraft .
The collectivization movement also infringed upon another preserve of the middle classes .
In Barcelona , the capital of Catalonia , with a population of nearly 1.2 million , the Anarchosyndicalist workers collectivized the wholesale business in eggs and fish and set up a control committee in the slaughterhouse , from which they excluded all intermediaries ; they also collectivized the principal market for fruit and vegetables and suppressed all dealers and commission agents as such , permitting them , however , to join the collective as wage earners .
The milk trade in Barcelona was likewise collectivized .
The Anarchosyndicalists eliminated as unhygenic over forty pasteurizing plants , pasteurized all milk in the remaining nine , and proceeded to displace all dealers by establishing their own retail outlets . " [ 34 ]
In fact , this policy of shutting down factories seems to have been as important to the CNT program as collectivizing the remainder .
These factory closures were justified by several arguments : they were unhealthy for workers , or unhealthy for consumers , or just plain " inefficient . "
As Bolloten explains , " after the first few weeks of widespread and uncoordinated seizures , some of the unions began a systematic reorganization of entire trades , closing down hundreds of small plants and concentrating production in those with the best equipment . " [ 35 ]
It is worth noting that Spain was still in the midst of the Great Depression , with overall Spanish industrial production in 1935 about 13 % below the 1929 level .
Production in July of 1936 was itself about 18 % below the January 1936 level , so the existence of unused capacity is no surprise . [ 36 ]
What is odd is that in the midst of massive unemployment the Anarchists closed down a large percentage of the remaining firms instead of inviting unemployed workers to join them .
Initially , the workers ( rather than an Anarchist nomenklatura ) usually assumed control over their places of employment .
Quoting Fraser , " one thing dominated the libertarian revolution : the practice of self - management - the workers ' administration of their factories and industries . " [ 37 ]
Yet government control quickly followed , or at least tried to .
In October , the government of Anarchist - dominated Catalonia passed the Collectivization and Workers ' Control Decree , which legally recognized many of the de facto collectivizations .
With government recognition came government regulation , as Fraser indicates : " Works councils , elected by an assembly decision of the workers and representing all sectors of the enterprise , were to administer the collectivized factory , ' assuming the functions and responsibilities of the former board of directors . '
A Generalitat representative was chosen , in agreement with the workers , to sit on each council .
Collectivized enterprises ( and private firms under workers ' control ) in each sector of industry would be represented in an Economic Federation , in turn topped by a general industrial council which would closely control the whole industry .
Fifty percent of a collectivized firm 's profit would go to an industrial and commercial credit fund which would have to finance all Catalan industry ; 20 per cent was to be put to the collective 's reserve and depreciation fund ; 15 per cent to the collective 's social needs , and the remaining 15 per cent to be allocated by the workers as they decided in a general assembly . " [ 38 ]
Bolloten reports that this measure was " sponsored by the CNT and signed by its representative in the government , Juan P. Fabregas , the councilor of the economy . " [ 39 ]
Thus , the principle of genuine worker control was quickly cast aside in favor of something much more similar to state - socialism ; a mere 15 % of the profits were , under the law , under the discretionary control of the workers .
There was some internal opposition to these measures ; Fabregas ' successor de Santillan indicated hostility to some features , and did not strictly enforce the law .
More importantly , there was a huge loophole - firms had to pay a percentage of their profits .
To eliminate the exaction , one merely need eliminate the profits .
With worker control , there is a simple way to do this : keep raising wages until the " profits " disappear .
Taxes on profits - which is what the Decree amounted to - will raise revenue if the workers and the owners are different people ; but with worker control such taxes are simple to evade .
Witness after witness reports the abolition of piece - work , improvement of working conditions , lavish non-wage compensation , and so on .
This is initially surprising ; if the workers run the factory , do n't they pay the price of hampering production ?
Not if the government taxes away most of the workers ' profits .
As Thomas states , " [ T ] he industrial syndicalism of Barcelona kept , unlike the rural anarchists , to individual wages , and did not experiment with family wages .
These wages probably increased , it is true , in late 1936 by about a third over July .
But the effect was ruined by the inflation , due to a fall in production , shortage of credit , as well as an influx of refugees from Castille and Aragon . " [ 40 ]
Thus , due to the weak enforcement and easy evasion of government regulations and taxes , it appears that some workers found themselves the new co-owners of their former employers ' property .
This created vague apprehension among many Anarchists , and experience soon enabled them to articulate their concerns .
The Anarchist Jose Peirats aptly described their essential worry : " Fortified in their respective collectives , the industries would merely have replaced the old watertight compartments of capitalism and would inevitably lapse into bureaucracy , the first step in a new society of unequals .
The collectives would end up waging the same commercial war against each other with the same combination of zeal and mediocrity that characterized the old bourgeois businesses .
And so they attempted to expand the notion of collectivism to include , in a structural and permanent way , all industries in one harmonious and disinterested body . " [ 41 ] Joan Ferrer , secretary of the CNT commercial employees ' union , was able to confirm Peirats ' fear up close .
" ' It came as a psychological shock to some workers to find themselves suddenly freed from capitalist tutelage .
Exchanging one individualism for another , they frequently believed that , now that the owners were gone , they were the new owners .
Though affecting white - collar workers in this instance , the problem was by no means confined to them ... ' " [ 42 ]
In short , after being told that the workers now owned the means of production , the workers often took the statement literally .
What is the point of owning the means of production if you can't get rich using them ?
But of course if some workers get rich , they are unlikely to voluntarily donate their profits to the other members of their class .
This seems elementary upon reflection , but only practical experience was able to reveal this to the economic reformers of the Spanish Revolution .
Fraser explains that at a joint CNT - UGT textile union conference , " The woodworkers ' union weighed in with its criticism of the state of affairs , alleging that , while small , insolvent workshops were left to struggle as best they could , the collectivization of profitable enterprises was leading to ' nothing other than the creation of two classes ; the new rich and the eternal poor .
We refuse the idea that there should be rich and poor collectives .
And that is the real problem of collectivization . ' " [ 43 ]
Bolloten repeats a remark of CNT militia leader Ricardo Sanz : " ' [ T ] hings are not going as well as they did in the early days of the [ revolutionary ] movement ...
The workers no longer think of workings long hours to help the front .
They only think of working as little as possible and getting the highest possible wages . ' " [ 44 ]
Bolloten attributes this decline in enthusiasm to Communist repression , but it is at least as consistent with the simple observation that people often prefer improving their own lot in life to nourishing revolution .
In short , practical experience gradually revealed a basic truth of economics for which theoretical reflection would have sufficed : if the workers take over a factory , they will run it to benefit themselves .
A worker - run firm is essentially identical to a capitalist firm in which the workers also happen to be the stockholders .
Once they came to this realization , however dimly , the Spanish Anarchists had to either embrace capitalism as the corollary of worker control , or else denounce worker control as the corollary of capitalism .
For the most part , they chose the latter course .
As Bolloten writes , " [ T ] he Anarchosyndicalists , contrary to common belief , were not without their own plans for the nationwide control and rationalization of production .
Rootedly opposed to state control or nationalization , they advocated centralization - or socialization , as they called it - under trade - union management of entire branches of production .
' If nationalization were carried out in Spain as the Socialists and Communists desire , ' said one Anarchist newspaper , 'we should be on the way to a dictatorship , because by nationalizing everything the government would become the master , the chief , the absolute boss of everyone and everything . ' " [ 45 ]
The Anarchist solution for this danger of absolute dictatorship was to call absolute dictatorship by a different name .
" In the opinion of the Anarchosyndicalists , " explains Bolloten , " socialization would eliminate the dangers of government control by placing production in the hands of the unions .
This was the libertarian conception of socialization , without state intervention , that was to eliminate the wastes of competition and duplication , render possible industrywide planning for both civilian and military needs , and halt the growth of selfish actions among the workers of the more prosperous collectives by using their profits to raise the standard of living in the less favored enterprises . " [ 46 ]
Of course , one could refuse to call a union with such fearsome powers a " state , " but it would need all of the enforcement apparatus and authority of a state to execute its objectives .
The " more prosperous collectives , " for example , would be unlikely to submit voluntarily to industrywide planning funded by their profits .
The Nationalists conquered Catalonia before the government made any concerted , official effort to nationalize the workers ' factories .
But it is doubtful that the government would have met much resistance from the CNT if and when the nationalization occurred .
Describing the CNT conferences of September 1937 and January 1938 , Thomas states : " Although suggestions for reform were canvassed , most ideas put forward sought the improvement of the existing state of affairs ; the millenarian aspect of anarchism had almost vanished .
What was left seemed no more than a federalist movement , without effective national organization , which gave general , if grudging , support to the government .
Under the influence of the realistic ex-secretary - general of the CNT , Horacio Prieto , anarchists were persuaded to accept the idea of nationalization of large industries and banks in exchange for collectivization of small ones , and on the land , as well as the ' municipalization ' of local services . " [ 47 ]
While the formal expropriation of the workers did not occur , the government frequently used its control over the Spanish money and banking system to quietly nationalize the means of production .
For ideological reasons , Anarchists had always avoided working in the banking industry , so insofar as workers did control banks , they were members of the Socialist UGT rather than the Anarchist CNT .
To obtain credit , Anarchists either had to get a loan from the Socialist - controlled banks , or else receive a bail - out from the central government .
Bolloten explains the dilemma of the workers ' collectives :
" Another obstacle to the integration of industry into a libertarian economy lay in the fact that a large number of firms controlled by the CNT were in a state of insolvency or semi-insolvency and were compelled to seek government intervention to secure financial aid ...
Both in Catalonia and in the rest of Republican Spain , this situation created grave economic problems for the CNT collectives .
So desperately did some of them require funds that Juan Peiro , the Anarchosyndicalist minister of industry , openly recommended intervention by the central government , having received in his department eleven thousand requests for funds in January 1937 alone . " [ 48 ]
Fraser and Thomas corroborate Bolloten 's analysis .
" [ T ] here were the committees , " explains Fraser , " which ... simply continued to present their weekly wage list to the Generalitat , which went on paying them , instead of seeking to get their businesses going . " [ 49 ]
In the footnote , Fraser adds , " This later became institutionalized as the ' pawn bank , ' through which the workers of the deficitary enterprises received their wages in return for ' pawning ' their company 's capital equipment and inventory to the Generalitat - a measure which resulted in giving the latter virtual control of the enterprise . " [ 50 ]
Along similar lines , Thomas writes that , " In all large industries , and in industries important for the war , a state representative sat on the committee .
He would be responsible for controlling credit , and sometimes raw materials .
His role became more and more important , so that , in some enterprises ( particularly the munitions factories ) , something close to nationalization would soon be achieved . " [ 51 ]
" Outside of Catalonia , the central government ... sought to bring all major factories under state supervision , whether nationalized or privately managed .
To ensure this , credit was made difficult for anarchist factories , and many other difficulties were put in their way by the government ...
This occurred even though an anarchist , Peiro , was nominally at the ministry of industry . " [ 52 ]
Peiro initially tried to push through a decree collectivizing all industry , but Prime Minister Caballero squelched the idea since it would alienate foreign capitalists and their governments .
Next , Bolloten explains , " Peiro then redrafted his decree ...
From the cabinet the decree went to a ministerial commission that , according to Peirats , converted it into a skeleton .
' But the calvary is not over .
To put the decree into effect money is necessary , that is , credit must be granted by the minister of finance [ Juan Negrin ] .
He haggles like a usurer and finally grants an insignificant sum ...
Finally , the Industrial Bank intervenes , which reduces the amount still further . ' " [ 53 ]
The simplest way that the collectives could have avoided dependence on the government would have been to issue debt ; in short , to borrow from the general public rather than the government .
But undoubtedly the fear of revealing surplus wealth to lend would make such a scheme impossible .
Even if their physical safety were not their concern , investors could hardly expect to ever get their money back .
The insecurity of property rights thus made it very difficult to borrow from the public , so the collectives mortgaged themselves piece by piece to the government until finally the government rather than the workers owned the means of production .
Fraser argues that , " These difficulties might have been palliated if the industrial and commercial fund foreseen by the decree had been rapidly set up , for one of its purposes was to channel funds from the wealthier to the poorer collectives .
It was to be financed by a levy of 50 per cent of a collective 's profits . " [ 54 ]
Even if enforced , though , almost all sources indicate that profits were almost non-existence ; possibly , as I have indicated , because workers were smart enough to realize that raising their wages and improving working conditions was an easy route to avoid any profits tax .
Even if this could have prevented the collectives from becoming dependent on the central government , the end result would have been to make them dependent on a union so powerful that it would be a state in everything but name .
Fraser quotes Albert Perez - Baro , a civil servant and a former CNT member : " ' This truly revolutionary measure [ the 50 per cent profits tax ] - though rarely , if ever , applied - was n't well received by large numbers of workers , proving , unfortunately , that their understanding of the scope of collectivization was very limited .
Only a minority understood that collectivization meant the return to society of what , historically , had been appropriated by the capitalists ... ' " [ 55 ]
In other words , most workers assumed that worker control meant that the workers would actually become the true owners of their workplaces , with all the rights and privileges thereof .
Only the elite realized that worker control was merely a euphemism for " social control " which in turn can only mean control by the state ( or an Anarchist " council , " " committee , " or " union , " satisfying the standard Weberian definition of the state ) .
D. Militarization
In the early stages of the war , the militant members of various left - wing parties and unions often did battle with members of the rebel Nationalist army .
There is no doubt that the CNT 's militants stifled military coups in several regions , and were initially the vanguard of the anti-Franco forces .
" [ T ] here was no central military body that could review the situation on all the battlefronts , formulate a common plan of action , and decide on the allocation of available supplies of men , munitions , arms , and motor vehicles in such a way as to produce the best results on the most promising front , " explains Bolloten .
" Nor could such central control be expected in the early days of spontaneous activity and individual initiative .
' We all remember , ' writes a Republican sympathizer , ' how we began to wage the war .
A few friends got together , jumped into a truck or car that they owned or confiscated , one with a rifle , another with a revolver and a few cartridges and took to the highway to look for fascists .
When we reached a point where we encountered resistance , we fought , and , when the munitions were exhausted , we generally retreated not to a defensive position ... but to our point of departure . ' " [ 56 ]
Bolloten adds the observation that , " To make matters worse , each party and labor union had its own military headquarters that , in most cases , attended to the requirements of its own militia without any knowledge of or regard to the needs or military plans of other units on the same or neighboring sector , least of all distant fronts ... " [ 57 ]
While all of the militias resisted military discipline to some degree , Bolloten affirms that at first the Anarchist militias resisted it vigorously because they took their ideals seriously :
" The CNT - FAI militia reflected the ideals of equality , individual liberty , and freedom from obligatory discipline integral to the Anarchist doctrine .
There was no officers ' hierarchy , no saluting , no regimentation . " [ 58 ]
Unfortunately for the Anarchists , this lack of discipline made their militia rather ineffective in spite of their frequent numerical superiority .
It did not take long for the Anarchist leadership to decide that military success was more important than the voluntaristic notions of the rank - and - file .
Solidaridad Obrera soon wrote in favor of the strictest discipline : " ' To accept discipline means that the decisions made by comrades assigned to any particular task , whether administrative or military , should be executed without any obstruction in the name of liberty , a liberty that in many cases degenerates into wantonness . ' " [ 59 ]
While many of the rank - and - file resisted , military discipline swiftly became common in the Anarchist militias .
It soon became clear that the Republican government intended to form its own national army .
The Anarchist ministers objected ; Bolloten notes that in addition to ideological scruples , the Anarchists wanted to keep military dominance in their own hands , and out of the hands of the Communists .
To counter this move towards a national army , explains Bolloten , " The CNT - FAI leaders had proposed in September 1936 that a ' war militia ' be created on the basis of compulsory service and under the joint control of the CNT and the UGT ... " [ 60 ]
It thus took scarcely two months for the Anarchists to openly advocate conscription - enslaving young men to kill or be killed - so long as the conscripts were forced to risk their lives for the cause of the CNT .
( Since the UGT held the loyalty of a far smaller proportion of the working class at this stage , the joint control of the CNT and UGT clearly would have amounted to a junior role for the UGT at best . )
In spite of their presence in the national government , explains Bolloten , " the libertarian movement was unable to use its participation in the government to increase its say in the military field or even curb the progress of the Communists , but rather was obliged in the end to circumscribe its efforts to maintaining control of its own militia units and securing arms from the war ministry . " [ 61 ]
The war ministry had many levers to secure compliance from the Anarchist militias .
Not only could they give or deny weapons , supplies , and so on .
The government also put the Anarchist militias on the government payroll , and could then threaten to withhold money from any unit that resisted the government 's decisions .
The most important decision the government made was to " militarize " the militias : in short , to absorb them into the government 's army and subject them to standard military rule .
Most of the militia columns swiftly fell into line , although it is unclear to what extent this was because they were following the orders of the Anarchist leadership , or enticed by the central government 's money and weapons .
One notable exception was the so - called Iron Column .
" No column , " explains Bolloten , " was more thoroughly representative of the spirit of Anarchism , no column dissented more vehemently from the libertarian movement 's inconsistencies of theory and practice and exhibited a more glowing enmity for the state than the Iron Column ... " [ 62 ]
Bolloten quotes one of the members of the Iron Column , in whose words there is clearly a strong undertone of criticism of the Anarchists working with the government : " ' We accept nothing that runs counter to our Anarchist ideas , ideas that must become a reality , because you cannot preach one thing and practice another . ' " [ 63 ]
Lest one praise their idealism too highly , it should be noted that the Iron Column apparently saw no contradiction between Anarchism and terrorism and robbery .
" In the early months of the war , " states Bolloten , " it had been able to rely upon its own recruiting campaigns and upon confiscations carried out with the aid of Anarchist - controlled committees in villages and towns behind the lines .
' [ During ] our stay in Valencia , ' ran a manifesto issued by the column , 'we noticed that , whereas our negotiations for the purchase of arms had failed , because of the lack of hard cash , in many shops there was a large quantity of gold and other precious metals , and it was this consideration that induced us to seize the gold , silver , and platinum in several jewelers ' shops . '
' Around October [ 1936 ] , ' recounts one historian [ Rafael Abella - B.C. ] , ' the column abandoned the front ... and went on an expedition in Valencia [ which was under Republican control - B.C. ] spreading panic in its path .
Its goal was to " cleanse the rear of all parasitic elements that endangered the interests of the revolution . "
In Valencia , it stormed hotels and restaurants , terrifying the city .
In a raid on jewelry stores , it seized all the gold and silver it could find . ' " [ 64 ]
As the central government re-affirmed its authority , such raids on Republican towns became too dangerous ; but because the Iron Column continued to lambast Anarchist collaboration with the Popular Front government , the Iron Column found itself unable to obtain resources legally either .
The Iron Column continued to refuse militarization , but the central government intensified its pressure on dissenting militias .
" [ T ] he war ministry had not only decided to withhold arms from all militia units declining to reorganized themselves along the prescribed lines , but had decreed , although in carefully selected language , that the pay of all combatants - which in the case of the militia had previously been handed to each column in a lump sum without supervision and irrespective of structure - would henceforth be distributed through regular paymasters stationed only in battalions .
As the decree made no mention of paymasters in units that had not adopted a military framework , it was clear that if the Iron Column were to hold fast to its militia structure the time would soon arrive when all pay would be suspended . " [ 65 ]
In the end , some members of the Iron Column deserted rather than face militarization ( ninety - seven men were denounced as deserters by their fellow Anarchists ) , while the others caved in and joined the regular army .
To be more precise , most of the Iron Column joined units which , while nominally part of the army of the central government , were actually part of the private fiefdom of the CNT .
While the Communists did their best to establish ideologically " mixed " units ( hopefully with Communist officers ) , the Anarchists tried very hard to keep Anarchist soldiers together .
So eager was the Anarchist leadership to build up armed forces under its de facto control , that the CNT national congress freely gave its approval to conscription - on one condition :
" Although a CNT national congress decided to agree to the mobilization of the two classes announced by the government , it did so on the understanding that all men with Anarchosyndicalist membership cards should be drafted by the CNT for service in its own militia units .
In Catalonia , the regional committee of the CNT stated with reference to this decision : ' As it would be very childish to hand over our forces to the absolute control of the government ... the national congress has decided that all persons in the [ two mobilized ] classes who belong to our trade - union organization should present themselves immediately to the CNT barracks or , in the absence thereof , to the trade - union or [ CNT ] defense committees [ of their locality ] , which will take note of their affiliation , their age , their employment , the class to which they belong , their address , and all the necessary facts ...
This committee will issue militia cards that will be sent to the inscribed comrades , who , of course , will henceforth be at the disposal of the Regional Committee , which will assign them to the column or front selected . ' " [ 66 ]
In this manner , the Spanish Anarchist abandoned even the pretense of voluntary service in the armed forces .
Rather than defend the right of the individual to choose whether or not he wished to join the army at all , the CNT merely did its best to get its fair share of the hapless conscripts .
As the remarks about the Iron Column make clear , the CNT made no attempt to subsist merely on voluntary donations of time and resources .
It readily accepted government hand - outs .
More importantly , the Spanish Anarchists missed no opportunity to seize needed resources .
In most cases , the Anarchists did so in areas where they were the dominant power ; the chaotic looting of the Iron Column was dwarfed by the official looting of the various Anarchist committees and councils .
Eventually , though , there is little precious metal and hard currency left to steal , at least in plain sight ; the real source of wealth is human beings .
As the next section reveals , when the Anarchists realized that food and valuable agricultural commodities could be extorted from forced collectives of terrorized peasants , they saw an opportunity that was simply too good to refuse .
E. The Rural Collectives
In August of 1937 , Prime Minister Juan Negrin secretly ordered government forces under the direction of the Communists to dissolve the Council of Aragon , the Anarchist body which exercised de facto rule over Republican - controlled Aragon .
One of the primary actions of this Communist - led operation was to break up the Anarchist - controlled rural collectives .
To justify their action , the Communists accused the Anarchists of imposing forced collectivization on a hostile peasantry .
Considering Stalin 's forced collectivization and terror - famine in the Soviet Union only a few years before , this was a curious accusation to make . [ 67 ]
But make it they did , while the beaten Anarchist movement denounced the Communists for their brutality in the service of counterrevolution .
As Bolloten writes :
" ' The population of Aragon , especially the peasants , ' recounts the official Communist history of the Civil War , ' acclaimed the dissolution of the council with indescribable enthusiasm , ' but Ricardo Sanz , the Anarchosyndicalist commander of the Twenty - sixth Division , paints a less radiant picture .
The Eleventh Division , he claims , took by assault the official centers in Caspe and arrested the majority of the office workers , dissolving the Council of Aragon by force .
' It took harsh measures against all the villages , attacking the peasant collectives .
It despoiled them of everything - work animals , foods , agricultural implements , and buildings - and initiated a fierce repression and persecution of the members of the collective . ' " [ 68 ]
One would have to be a fool to take Communists at their word .
Still , the fact that an accusation originated with the Communists is no reason to bar objective research from verifying the truth of their claims .
The Communists were often the originators of reports of German atrocities during World War II ; does this mean that any historical study of Nazi concentration camps is suspect ?
Of course not .
It merely means that one must take extra care to find independent sources untainted by the Communists ' propaganda machine .
( Thus , since Thomas ' evidence for the involuntary nature of the collectives comes almost entirely from Communist sources , I omit it . )
With this in mind , I now review the history of the Anarchists and rural collectivization .
As before , Burnett Bolloten 's The Spanish Civil War , widely acclaimed for its objectivity and comprehensiveness , is my most frequent reference .
On this particular issue , Bolloten 's words carry if possible even greater weight , for it was Bolloten , more than any other historian , who documented the deceptive propaganda and drive for total power of the Spanish Communist movement .
After the attempted military coup in July 1936 , there was a revolution in many rural areas somewhat similar to that in urban areas .
It should be noted , however , that the power of the CNT was centered in the cities rather than the countryside , so it would be extremely surprising if the rural revolution were as " spontaneous " as the urban revolution .
" Very rapidly collectives , in which not only the means of production but also of consumption were socialized , began to spring up , " explains Fraser .
" It did not happen on instructions from the CNT leadership - no more than had the collectives in Barcelona .
Here , as there , the initiative came from CNT militants ; here , as there , the ' climate ' for social revolution in the rearguard was created by CNT armed strength : the anarcho - syndicalists ' domination of the streets of Barcelona was re- enacted in Aragon as the CNT militia columns , manned mainly by Catalan anarcho - syndicalist workers , poured in .
Where a nucleus of anarcho- syndicalists existed in a village , it seized the moment to carry out the long - awaited revolution and collectivized spontaneously .
Where there was none , villagers could find themselves under considerable pressure from the militias to collectivize ... " [ 69 ]
Note well Fraser 's point that the anarchists in rural Aragon relied heavily on urban Catalonian anarchists to get off the ground .
However over - stated the Anarchists ' claim to represent " the people , " was in Barcelona , in rural Aragon such a claim was absurd .
Bolloten gives more details about the initial stages of the rural revolution .
" Although no hard and fast rules were observed in establishing libertarian communism , the procedure was more or less the same everywhere .
A CNT - FAI committee was set up in each locality where the new regime was instituted .
This committee not only exercised legislative and executive powers , but also administered justice .
One of its first acts was to abolish private trade and to collectivize the soil of the rich , and often that of the poor , as well as farm buildings , machinery , livestock , and transport .
Except in rare cases , barbers , bakers , carpenters , sandalmakers , doctors , dentists , teachers , blacksmiths , and tailors also came under the collective system .
Stocks of food and clothing and other necessities were concentrated in a communal depot under the control of the local committee , and the church , if not rendered useless by fire , was converted into a storehouse , dining hall , cafe , workshop , school , garage , or barracks .
In many communities money for internal use was abolished ... " [ 70 ]
It barely took a month for Anarchists to set themselves up as the government of those parts of Aragon under their control , euphemistically dubbing themselves the " Regional Defense Council of Aragon . "
As Thomas explains , " The collectives established in Aragon - the CNT later claimed that there were 450 of them - held a conference in late September ...
They set up a regional ' Council of Defense , ' composed of CNT members , and presided over by Joaquin Ascaso , a cousin of the famous anarchist killed in July .
This had its seat at Fraga , and thence exercised supreme power over the whole of revolutionary Aragon . " [ 71 ]
The Anarchists angered the other Republican factions by excluding them from the Council of Aragon , but there was little they could do .
Thus , while the behavior of the government of Catalonia was a compromise between the Anarchists and other parties , the actions of the government of Aragon reveal the proclivities of undivided Anarchist rule .
Many people fled for fear of their lives .
Their land was seized almost immediately .
After all , who but a " fascist " would flee ?
The expropriation of land from anyone too terrified of the new regime to even wait to see what their new life would be like provided the nucleus for the collectives .
Bolloten quotes one authority , who explains that , " ' [ A ] pproximately one - third of all lands and ( since collectivization occurred mainly on arable land ) between half and two - thirds of all cultivated land in Republican Spain were seized .
By a cruel irony , the victims were predominantly small and medium holders , since most of the latifundio districts had fallen to the Nationalists ... ' " [ 72 ]
While the Anarchists occasionally spoke of overthrowing feudalism , they did no such thing ; feudalism had been largely abolished in Spain by the late 19th - century , as Fraser points out .
" In the course of a century , the bourgeoisie continued to extend its holdings until , by the 1930's , approximately 90 per cent of Spain 's farm land was in its hands , the rest being owned by the upper nobility . " [ 73 ]
Farmers who fled for their lives were obviously not voluntary participants in the Anarchists ' collectivization experiment .
What about the remainder ?
One of the persistent claims of defenders of the Anarchists ' collectives was that the farmers were usually " free to choose " : they could either join the collective , or continue to farm individually so long as they hired no wage labor .
The overwhelming majority of the evidence reveals that the collectives ' defenders are simply wrong .
Bolloten tells us that :
" Although CNT - FAI publications cited numerous cases of peasant proprietors and tenant farmers who had adhered voluntarily to the collective system , there can be no doubt that an incomparably larger number doggedly opposed it or accepted it only under extreme duress . " [ 74 ]
Bolloten goes on to explain that it was the presence of the Anarchist militia which made collectivization possible .
The Anarchist militants , convinced of their superior wisdom , arrived carrying a plan for a new way of life for the farmers :
" 'We militiamen must awaken in these persons the spirit that has been numbed by political tyranny , ' said an article in a CNT newspaper , referring to the villagers of Farlete .
' We must direct them along the path of the true life , and for that it is not sufficient to make an appearance in the village ; we must proceed with the ideological conversion of these simple folk . ' " [ 75 ]
The arrogance and paternalism of these remarks is clear ; is there no possibility that the farmers might be right and the Anarchists might be wrong ?
Bolloten gives further details ; due to the presence of the Anarchist armed forces , " [ T ] he fate of the peasant owner and tenant farmer in the communities occupied by the CNT - FAI militia was determined from the outset ; for although a meeting of the population was generally held to decide on the establishment of the collective system , the vote was always taken by acclamation , and the presence of armed militiamen never failed to impose respect and fear on all opponents . " [ 76 ]
In answer to the Anarchists ' claims that they respected the right not to join the collective , Bolloten answers that , " The fact is that many small holders and tenant farmers were forced to join the collective farms before they had an opportunity to decide freely .
Although the libertarian movement tended to minimize the factor of coercion in the development of collectivized agriculture or even to deny it altogether , it was , on occasions , frankly admitted .
' During the first few weeks of the Revolution , ' wrote Higinio Noja Ruiz , a prominent member of the CNT , ' the partisans of collectivization acted according to their own revolutionary opinions .
They respected neither property nor persons .
In some villages collectivization was only possible by imposing it on the minority . ' " [ 77 ]
Fraser amply confirms Bolloten 's allegations .
" There was no need to dragoon them at pistol point : the coercive climate , in which ' fascists ' were being shot , was sufficient .
' Spontaneous ' and ' forced ' collectives existed , as did willing and unwilling collectivists within them . " [ 78 ]
Fraser goes on to explain that rural collectivization was very different from urban collectivization ; while the latter was indeed typically carried out by the workers , the former was not .
" The collectivization , carried out under the general cover , if not necessarily the direct agency , of CNT militia columns , represented a revolutionary minority 's attempt to control not only production but consumption for egalitarian purposes and the needs of the war .
In this , agrarian collectives differed radically from the industrial collectives which regulated production only . " [ 79 ]
Bolloten makes a few statements about the voluntary character of the Anarchist collectives which can be taken out of context to make it appear that Bolloten accepts the apologists ' view that rural collectivization was " voluntary . "
" While rural collectivization in Aragon embraced more than 70 percent of the population in the area under left - wing control , and many of the 450 collectives of the region were largely voluntary , it must be emphasized that this singular development was in some measure due to the presence of militiamen from the neighboring region of Catalonia , the immense majority of whom were members of the CNT and FAI . " [ 80 ]
It is important to realize that Bolloten rightly regards the " voluntary " collectives to have been nearly as coercive as the " forced " collectives :
" However , although neither the UGT nor the CNT permitted the small Republican farmer to hold more land than he could cultivate without the aid of hired labor , and in many instances he was unable to dispose freely of his surplus crops because he was compelled to deliver them to the local committee on the latter 's terms , he was often driven under various forms of pressure , as will be shown latter in this chapter , to attach himself to the collective system .
This was true particularly in villages where the Anarchosyndicalists were in the ascendant . " [ 81 ]
While the illegality of hiring wage labor seemed perfectly fair to the Anarchist militants , this fact plainly demonstrates that the mere existence of collectives cannot ensure that no one will voluntarily contract to work for a wage - paying capitalist .
Fraser provides evidence that the prohibition against hiring wage labor was often even stricter than it seems .
As he summarizes the testimony of one farmer , " But it was the republicans and socialists who did not join the collective whom he pitied most .
As long as they worked their land on their own they had no problems , but if they as much as got their brother or a neighbor to lend them a hand , then the trouble started .
The ' individualists ' were supposed to have only as much land as they could work on their own , and any infringement by calling on outside labour was leapt on . " [ 82 ]
Plainly it is possible to preserve a nominal right to be an " individualist , " while in practice imposing so many unreasonable restrictions on them that the independent farmers break down and join the collective .
What were the " various forms of pressure " to which Bolloten alludes ?
" Even if the peasant proprietor and tenant farmer were not compelled to adhere to the collective system , life was made difficult for recalcitrants ; not only were they prevented from employing hired labor and disposing freely of their crops , as has already been seen , but they were often denied all benefits enjoyed by members .
In practice , this meant that in the villages where libertarian communism had been established they were not allowed to receive the services of the collectivized barber shops , to use the ovens of the communal bakery and the means of transport and agricultural equipment of the collective farms , or to obtain supplies of food from the communal warehouse and collectivized stores .
Moreover , the tenant farmer , who had believed himself freed from the payment of rent by the execution or flight of the landowner or of his steward , was often compelled to continue such payment to the village committee .
All these factors combined to exert pressure almost as powerful as the butt of the rifle and eventually forced the small owners and tenant farmers in many villages to relinquish their land and other possessions to the collective farms . " [ 83 ]
It is especially strange that anarcho - socialists , who frequently claim that superficially voluntary interaction ( such as the capitalist - worker relationship ) is really coercive , so credulously accept the voluntarist credentials of the Anarchist - run rural collectives .
At least the worker can try to find another employer ; but how " voluntary " was the decision of a farmer to join the collective when he had to sell his crops to a legally protected Anarchist monopsony anyway ?
If the middlemen and speculators had not been banned by the Anarchists , an independent farmer could always have sold to them if the Anarchists ' price was too low .
Even Graham Kelsey , an historian with unbridled sympathy for the Anarchist movement , reluctantly reveals an important prod used to push the hapless peasantry into the collectives .
" The military insurrection had come at a critical moment in the agricultural calendar .
Throughout lower Aragon there were fields of grain ready for harvesting ...
At the assembly in Albalate de Cinca the opening clause of the agreed programme had required everyone in the district , independent farmers and collectivists alike , to contribute equally to the war effort , thereby emphasizing one of the most important considerations in the period immediately following the rebellion . " [ 84 ]
The independent farmer , in short , had no option to remain aloof from the Anarchists ' cause and do his own thing ; even if he could keep his land , a large part of his product belonged to the CNT .
The fact that only a small percentage of the Anarchist collectives were called " total , " cannot alter the fact that aside from the intense monopolistic pressure wielded by the CNT through its stranglehold over the economy and agricultural markets , an independent farmer still had to " contribute equally to the war effort . "
Fraser relays the testimony of Fernando Aragon and his wife Francisca , " both staunch CNT supporters , " which concretizes the overwhelming monopolistic power of the Anarchists over the economy .
" Three or four of the peasants with larger holdings tried to leave the collective , but the committee controlled all the sources of seed and fertilizer and there was nowhere , now that money had been abolished , where they could buy what they needed .
They had to remain in ...
But soon he saw that it was not only the reluctant peasants who had no desire to work : it was the twenty - odd committee members - ' where three or four would have been enough , ' - of the village committee .
The younger men went round with pistols stuck in their waistbands , looking - ' but not working ' - like revolutionaries ...
The collective produced considerable quantities , all the village 's needs were met , except when the committee refused to distribute stocks . " [ 85 ]
Francisca Aragon tells
Fraser that when one of their twin infants fell sick , the committee refused her transport to see a doctor .
" ' There was great discontent .
The women talked about it .
We went out to work in the fields - and it was right that we should .
But why did n't the wives of the committee members have to go ?
If things went on like this , we would have to get rid of the committee .
I wanted to leave , but I could n't .
We had no money , no means .
Moreover , the committee had guards posted on the roads .
It was terror , dictatorship ... ' " [ 86 ]
In a footnote , Fraser insightfully explains that once the CNT engineered the abolition of money ( no one even tries to explain how the abolition of money could be voluntary ) , the peasants were helpless .
A poor person with a little money has options ; the Aragonese peasantry did not .
" The problem of the collectivists ' freedom to leave villages - permanently or on trips - exercised the imagination of observers from the start .
With the abolition of money , the collective held the upper hand since anyone wishing to travel had to get ' republican ' money from the committee .
This meant justifying the trip . " [ 87 ]
Needless to say , there was little or no freedom of religion in the Anarchist collectives .
While many accounts praise the Anarchists ' lavish educational spending , they rarely point out that a major goal was to brainwash the next generation .
As Thomas describes , " Church schools were shut : ' The revolutionary will of the people has suppressed schools of confessional tendency .
Now is the turn of the new school , based on rationalist principles of work and human fraternity . ' " [ 88 ]
The despotism of the Anarchists sometimes even extended to the pettiness of prohibiting not only alcohol but coffee and tobacco .
" In the libertarian village of Magdalena de Pulpis , for example , the abolition of alcohol and tobacco was hailed as a triumph .
In the village of Azuara , the collectivists closed the cafe because they regarded it as a ' frivolous institution . ' " [ 89 ]
Bolloten quotes Franz Borkenau , an eyewitness .
" ' I tried in vain to get a drink , either of coffee or wine or lemonade .
The village bar had been closed as nefarious commerce .
I had a look at the stores .
They were so low as to foretell approaching starvation .
But the inhabitants seemed to be proud of this state of things .
They were pleased , they told us , that coffee drinking had come to an end ; they seemed to regard this abolition of useless things as a moral improvement . ' " [ 90 ]
As one peasant put it , " ' [ T ] here is no money for vice . ' " [ 91 ]
Thus , the freedom of the Aragonese peasantry was the Orwellian freedom to live precisely as the Anarchist militia deemed right .
The typical objective of forced agricultural collectivization , in both Communist and Third World countries , has been to fund centrally planned industrialization .
The ugly secret of the Anarchists is that the underlying objective of forced collectivization was to fund their military and cement the power of their councils and committees .
Part of the seized agricultural product was used to feed the troops ; the rest was sold on international markets for gold and hard currency , which in turn could buy armaments .
For once in the literal sense , the peasants were " exploited , " deliberately cut off from competing purchasers , left with no choice but to sell to the CNT for a pittance , which could in turn either use the product itself or re-sell at normal world prices .
Graham Kelsey , a fervent admirer of the Spanish Anarchists , tries his best to portray this naked exploitation favorably .
" To organize the provisioning of the front - line volunteers as rapidly and as equitably as possibly was to be more than merely an aim in itself .
One of the most common corollaries of war in a capitalist system is the development of such social and economic evils as black - marketeering , profiteering , and , as a consequence , arbitrarily imposed shortages and serious inflation .
The villages from which large numbers of volunteers had joined the columns had immediately organized the despatch of supplies to the front .
These villages , however , were but a handful , chiefly those with strong anarchosyndicalist traditions .
Evidently the situation had to be regularized , particularly as the initial insurrection had begun to assume all the characteristics of a prolonged military confrontation .
Agricultural collectivisation , therefore , became both a way of ensuring the equal contribution of all villages to the burden posed by the conflict and also a way of making it impossible for those who possessed the means or the inclination to profit from the exigencies placed upon the regional economy by the presence of civil war .
It was not just a libertarian theory ; it was also the only way to ensure the maximum agricultural production with the minimum economic corruption . " [
92 ]
Kelsey is virtually the only academic historian who attempts to affirm the voluntary character of the Anarchist collectives .
Among his many puzzling statements , one that stands out is his attempt to prove that the collectives must have been voluntary because everyone supported them , regardless of party .
" Another sign of the acceptance of agricultural collectivisation was the adherence of the members of other trade - union and political groups all of which , nationally , maintained a hostile stance towards collectivisation . " [ 93 ]
Normal people see an unnatural degree of unanimity and infer that such agreement could only be the result of extreme coercion .
Kelsey sees an unnatural degree of unanimity and infers that such agreement could only be the result of the extraordinary goodness of the collectives .
( Similarly , a band of well - armed conquistadors could attribute the sudden conversion of pagans to the inescapable truth of the Catholic faith , and deny that their firearms had anything to do with the pagans ' decision . )
Fraser , relying on the testimony of CNT leader Macario Royo , confirms this seldom - mentioned motive .
" [ Royo ] believed that collectives were the most appropriate organization for controlling production and consumption , and ensuring that a surplus was made available for the front .
' Everything was disorganized .
The columns depended on the villages , they had no other source of supply .
If there had been no collectives , if each peasant had kept what he produced and disposed of it as he wished , it would have made the matter of supplies much more difficult ... ' " [ 94 ]
Indeed it would have ; if there had been a free market , the farmers would be paid the value of their labor .
There is much irony in Royo 's tacit admission that the " problem " with the free market is that it prevents exploitation , ensuring that everyone gets paid for the product of their labor .
" By abolishing a free market and in effect rationing consumer goods , mainly food , the collectives controlled the local economy .
Feeding the columns without payment became a source of pride or resentment , depending on the villager 's ideological commitment .
But for Royo , as for most Aragonese libertarians , the matter did not end there .
The fundamental purpose of founding the collectives was social equality .
' That each should produce according to his ability , each consume according to his need .
Equality in production , equality in consumption .
To supply everyone equally in the collective as well as the columns at the front - this was the principle and usefulness of the collectives . ' " [ 95 ]
Presumably the poor workers of the villages did not realized that " equality " would also guarantee an equal share for Anarchist soldiers who never set a foot in the village .
The necessities went to feed the troops ; the agricultural luxuries were taken to be sold on international markets .
" A more genuine grievance against the CNT by its opponents was its control of the main ports and the Franco - Spanish border , a control that enabled it to ship abroad through its own export entities valuable agricultural products that yielded large quantities of foreign exchange .
Whereas the Anarchosyndicalists regarded this control as an inalienable conquest of the Revolution , the central government viewed it as an impingement on the indefeasible power of the state ...
Julian Zugazagoitia , the moderate Socialist , who became interior minister under Negrin in May 1937 , claims that the premier and finance minister ' preferred not to have Anarchists in the government ' because he wished ' to dismantle all the export organizations created by the CNT , ' and ' to end once and for all ' the loss of foreign exchange resulting from the shipment abroad of almonds , oranges , and saffron . ' " [ 96 ]
In July of 1937 , the Aragonese Anarchists were desperately trying to avoid the fate of their Catalonian comrades .
The Communists had replaced the Anarchists as the dominant force in Catalonia .
Was Aragon next ?
Jose Peirats , the Anarchist historian , provides the setting .
" In his commemorative speech on July 19 , 1937 , the President of the Council of Aragon was extremely pessimistic ... ' it would be regrettable if anyone tried to make trouble for [ the Council of Aragon ] , for that would force [ the Council ] to unsheathe its claws of iron and teeth of steel . ' " [ 97 ]
In December of 1936 , the Council agreed to share some of its power with members of other Republican parties , but the dominant position of the Anarchists remained .
" Subsequently the President reported on the accomplishments made over the first year : speculation and usury had been suppressed ; roads and highways had been constructed with the disinterested help of the militia ... ; and the Aragonese collectives , in spite of their deficiencies , were the wonder the revolution . " [ 98 ]
Clearly in a conciliatory mood , the President emphasized that the right to farm individually would be protected ( thus implicitly admitting widespread violation of this right ) .
Moreover , the President could point to an agreement signed by all of the Republican factions of Aragon , which read in part : " ' The Council of Aragon , which will collaborate enthusiastically with the legitimate government of the Republic , will increase production in the rearguard , mobilize all the region 's resources for the war effort , arouse the antifascist spirit of the masses ... and undertake an intense purge in the liberated zones ; it will impose unrelenting order and hunt down hidden fascists , defeatists and speculators . ' " [ 99 ]
The totalitarian tone of these words is hard to overlook .
The Council 's protestations of its loyalty and ecumenical spirit did not save it from an invasion of Communist - led forces under the orders of the central government .
The Communists broke up many collectives , even voluntary ones ( although as noted the " voluntarism " of the collectives was universally questionable ) .
Bolloten summarizes a report of the Aragon CNT : " the land , farm implements , horses , and cattle confiscated from right - wing supporters were returned to their former owners or to their families ; new buildings erected by the collectives , such as stables and hen coops , were destroyed , and in some villages the farms were deprived even of seed for sowing , while six hundred members of the CNT were arrested . " [ 100 ]
After their initial onslaught , the Communists backed off somewhat ; so long as the Anarchists were out of power , the Communists were generally willing to accept a milder form of collectivization .
Apologists for the Anarchists frequently point to the fact that many collectives persisted even after the Communist - led forces destroyed the Council of Aragon .
For example , Peirats tells us that " The Penalba collective which , at the beginning of the revolution , was composed of the entire village of 1500 people was reduced to 500 members .
It is very possible that in this second phase the collectivization better reflects the sincere convictions of the members .
They had undergone a severe test and those who had withstood it were proven collectivists .
Yet it would be facile to label as anticollectivists those who abandoned the collectives in this second phase .
Fear , official coercion and insecurity weighed heavily in the decisions of much of the Aragonese peasantry . " [ 101 ] Peirats ' double - standard is worth contemplating .
While he is extraordinarily sensitive to hidden coercion undermining the voluntariness of the de-collectivizations , the enormous economic bludgeon used to form the collectives in the first place barely bothers him .
Even after the destruction of the Council of Aragon , might not some farmers have remained within the collectives out of fear of later persecution if the CNT regained power ?
The interview of Juan Martinez ( a " medium - holding peasant ... who had thought the collectives were not a bad idea " ) with Fraser confirms that such was indeed the case .
" ' Most of the people left , and were happy to do so .
Those who remained - about a quarter of the original number - were under no pressure to do so ; nobody bothered them , nobody tried to break up their collective .
In fact , one or two of the peasants with bigger holdings left their land in because they were frightened the situation might change again ... ' " [ 102 ]
Bolloten aptly sums up the ironclad case against the Anarchist rural collectives , a case which need not rely on Communist - tainted testimony or sources :
" If , theoretically , during the Spanish Revolution , the CNT and FAI were opposed to the state dictatorship established by the Marxists , they nevertheless established a form of parochial dictatorship in many localities , with the aid of vigilance groups and revolutionary tribunals .
While these fell far short of the ' scientific concept ' of totalitarian dictatorship defined by Lenin , the CNT and FAI exercised their power in a naked form not only against priests and landowners , moneylenders and merchants , but in many cases against small tradesmen and farmers . " [ 103 ]
This dictatorship would undoubtedly have become even more egregious if the Anarchists had ever become the dominant power in Spain ; Bolloten cites numerous Anarchist publications explaining that the concessions to voluntarism and individualism were merely temporary expedients which would be withdrawn as soon as the Anarchists were too powerful to be challenged .
3. Economics and the Spanish Anarchists
A. Background for the Civil War : The Great Depression and the Labor Market
It is impossible to understand the economics of the Spanish Civil War without realizing that in 1936 , Spain remained in the midst of the international Great Depression .
If Spanish industrial production in 1929 is set equal to 100 , then in 1935 it remained at a stagnant 86.9 in spite of six years ' worth of population growth .
In Catalonia , if one indexes industrial production in January 1936 at 100 , one finds that by July of 1936 output was lower still at 82 .
In short , production at the start of the revolution was an additional 18 % below the depression - level output of January 1936 .
Unemployment by all accounts was correspondingly high . [ 104 ]
What was the reason for the pre-war depression anyway ?
A large consensus of economic historians argues , persuasively in my view , that the essential cause of the Great Depression was the international monetary contraction of the late 20's and early 30's .
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's A Monetary History of the United States [ 105 ] was the seminal academic work which established the magnitude and importance of the monetary contraction in the United States .
Barry Eichengreen 's Golden Fetters [ 106 ] largely extends Friedman and Schwartz 's argument to the international economy , showing how the gold standard re-established after World War I was very shaky and wound up yielding an international monetary contraction .
Spain was not itself on the gold standard , but bank notes had to be backed by a fractional reserve of gold so many of the same forces would be at work . [ 107 ]
Monetary contraction is thus the first symptom to look for ; but by any measure , it did not occur .
Spain devalued the peseta ( a move which makes it much easier to avoid deflation ) to 79.5 % of parity in 1930 , and continued to devalue it until by 1935 the gold content of the peseta was a mere 55.3 % of par .
Looking at combined savings bank deposits ( a standard component in most measures of money supply provided by Thomas ) , it can be seen that the peseta quantity of deposits constantly increased over the period for which data is available : from 1847 million pesetas in 1928 , to 4116 million pesetas in 1934 .
Similarly , the number of pesetas it took to buy one British pound ( N.B. The Bank of London was noted for its swift devaluation . ) increased from 25.22 in January of 1930 to 36.00 in January of 1936 .
In short , there was a large decline in the international value of the peseta , reflecting large money supply increases uncharacteristic of other countries during this era .
A final clue which confirms the fact of high money supply growth in Spain is that Madrid in 1936 was estimated to have one of the largest gold reserves in the world - precisely what one would expect in a nation which had repeatedly cut the gold content of the peseta in order to remove any institutional constraints on rapid money supply growth .
[ 108 ]
If the standard monetary explanation fails to explain the Spanish depression , what other factors might be involved ?
The preponderance of the evidence indicates that the Spanish labor unions , of which the CNT was foremost , through their intransigent militancy and activism , succeeded in raising real wages approximately 20 % from 1929 to 1936 .
[ 109 ]
Tortella and Palafox 's calculations reveal a 20.5 % real wage increase in mining , a 17.6 % increase in metallurgy , a 19.9 % increase in textiles ( 22.3 % for women ) , and a 23.7 % increase in agriculture ( 35 % increase for women ) over the 1929 - 1936 period .
In their ignorance of and emotional hostility to classical economic theory , the trade - unionists probably did not realize that the necessary consequence of pushing real wages so far above the market level would be massive unemployment ; but massive unemployment was indeed the result .
The mounting hostility to employers , sabotage , and so on undoubtedly decreased the expected marginal productivity of labor , leaving the prevailing union wage scale even farther above the market - clearing level .
The unions enjoyed ample assistance from the government .
Paul Preston sums up Caballero's labor decrees , many of which greatly improved the labor unions ' bargaining position .
" The so - called ' decree of municipal boundaries ' prevented the hiring of outside labor while local workers in a given municipality remained unemployed .
It struck at the landowners ' most potent weapon , the power to break strikes and keep down wages by the import of cheap blackleg labor . " [ 110 ]
Thus even the trade unions realized on some level , however rudimentary , that raising the price of labor would reduce the quantity demanded .
Moreover , on some level the unionists realized that unions benefit their members at the expense of other ( preferably non-union ) workers priced out of a job .
Preston continues , " Largo Caballero did something that Primo de Rivera had not been able to do : he introduced arbitration committees for rural wages and working conditions , which had previously been subject only to the whim of the owners .
One of the rights now to be protected was the newly introduced eight - hour day .
Given that , previously , the braceros had been expected to work from sunup to sundown , this meant that owners would either have to pay overtime or else employ more men to do the same work .
[ Or produce less output , which was probably the most important response .
- B.C. ]
Finally , in order to prevent the owners from sabotaging these measures by lock - outs , a decree of obligatory cultivation prevented them from taking their land out of operation . " [ 111 ]
Thus , while it avoided the monetary contraction which plagued other nations in the early 30's , Spain enjoyed a depression courtesy of its militant labor unions , assisted by the labor laws of the Republican government .
Disturbed by the plight of the workers , the unions and the government simple - mindedly tried to make matters better by pushing up wages and improving working conditions .
The necessary and empirically observed result was massive unemployment ; many workers were simply not worth the higher price , and so no one chose to hire them .
Rather than blame the unions and the " pro-labor " government , many unemployed workers turned to ever greater militancy and hatred of the capitalist system . [ 112 ]
Perhaps the most plausible criticism of capitalist economies is that they sometimes allow useful labor and capital to go to waste .
Under the circumstances , one might expect that the workers ' revolutionary takeover of their employers ' property in 1936 would have to make matters better .
With all these idle workers seizing the empty factories , would n't production have to increase ?
It did not ; after the establishment of worker control , unemployment became even more severe despite the wartime economy 's massive monetary growth and conscription .
The next section investigates this puzzle in detail .
B. The Economics of the Civil War : Collectivization , Inflation , and the Black Market
The puzzle of urban collectivization begins at the outset .
With massive unemployment still prevailing , the CNT began closing plants and concentrating workers in the most " modern " firms .
The obvious measure would have been to open the doors of every collective to the mass of unemployed workers and invite them to select their new workplace .
But the unions insisted that in some sense the older plants were not " efficient . "
No effort was made to analyze the coherence of this view ; in particular , the unions showed no understanding of the difference between average and marginal productivity .
( The superiority of the average productivity of the modern plants in no way shows that marginal productivity was greater , and it is marginal productivity that matters for " efficiency " decisions . )
Bolloten describes this massive shut down decision at length : " ' Those small employers of labor who are a little enlightened , ' declared Solidaridad Obrera , the principal Anarchosyndicalist organ in Spain , ' will easily understand that the system of producing goods in small plants is not efficient .
Divided effort holds back production .
Operating a tiny workshop with handicraft methods is not the same as operating a large plant that utilizes all the advances of technology .
If our aim is to do away with the contingencies and insecurities of the capitalist regime , then we must direct production in a way that ensures the well - being of society . ' " [ 113 ]
Apparently the well - being of unemployed workers was of no concern ; in spite of its high levels , the issue never even arises .
Bolloten gives the details of the wave of business closings .
" In accordance with this outlook , the CNT workers , sweeping along with them those of the UGT , closed down more than seventy foundries in the region of Catalonia and concentrated their equipment and personnel in twenty - four ...
In Barcelona , the CNT and UGT woodworkers ' unions - which had alrea
Perhaps now we can put the manufactured controversy known as Climategate behind us and turn to the task of actually doing something about global warming .
On Wednesday , a panel in Britain concluded that scientists whose e-mail had been hacked late last year had not , as critics alleged , distorted scientific evidence to prove that global warming was occurring and that human beings were primarily responsible .
It was the fifth such review of hundreds of e-mail exchanges among some of the world ’s most prominent climatologists .
Some of the e-mail messages , purloined last November , were mean - spirited , others were dismissive of contrarian views , and others revealed a timid reluctance to share data .
Climate skeptics pounced on them as evidence of a conspiracy to manipulate research to support predetermined ideas about global warming .
The panel found no such conspiracy .
It complained mildly about one poorly explained temperature chart discussed in the e-mail , but otherwise found no reason to dispute the scientists ’ “ rigor and honesty . ”
Two earlier panels convened by Britain ’s Royal Society and the House of Commons reached essentially the same verdict .
And this month , a second panel at Penn State University exonerated Michael Mann , a prominent climatologist and faculty member , of scientific wrongdoing .
Dr. Mann , who was part of the e-mail exchange , had been accused of misusing data to prove that the rise in temperatures over the last century was directly linked to steadily rising levels of carbon dioxide .
His findings , confirmed many times by others , are central to the argument that fossil fuels must be taxed or regulated .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Police say one thing was clear when authorities showed up at a house in Arizona looking for a California girl who had been missing for seven years .
The family inside was hiding something .
They were " evasive and untruthful , " said Capt .
Patrick Maxwell of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department 's Norwalk Station .
When family members were asked to produce a birth certificate or adoption papers for Amber Rose Nicklas , they could not .
Maxwell says that is when they admitted the 7 - year - old girl was not theirs .
The child had been missing since September 2003 .
She was in the care of foster parents in Norwalk , California , when she was snatched by three of her aunts .
Two of the aunts were caught at the time but a third got away with the infant .
Maxwell says it appears Amber had been living with the same family in Phoenix , Arizona , for most of the time she was missing , but police are still investigating how she ended up with people who are not her biological family .
Authorities got a tip that Amber could be at a home in Phoenix and went there with a court order Wednesday afternoon .
When investigators tried to serve the court order , they found that a woman in the home had hidden the child in a shower under a pile of clothes and towels , said Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump .
Amber 's identity had been changed , including her name and date of birth , police said .
Authorities confirmed Amber 's real identity through footprints , photographs and DNA swabs .
The child is in state custody in California and prosecutors will file charges , Crump said .
CNN 's Nick Valencia and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report .

Story
OldCmp was built because there was no decent way to find / report on / delete old computers in Active Directory .
You can use dsget combined with dsrm but you are really taking your life in your hands .
OldCmp has all sorts of safeties built in to try and prevent you from shooting your own foot .
Note that you can still shoot yourself in the foot , it just takes more work .
This appeals to the paranoid , scared , admin in myself .
The tool will work with a Windows 2000 AD as well as a Windows 2003 AD .
It can key off the pwdLastSet attribute or in a Windows 2003 Domain Functional Domain on lastLogonTimestamp .
This means you are going after IDs that have not had their password reset in x days or you can go after accounts that have n't logged on x days where by default x , is 90 days .
I chose 90 days because computers should change their password at least every 30 days unless they have had their registries modified to prevent that password change .
There are exceptions like when a mobile user goes away and does n't log into the network for a long time or for some poorly written SAN / NAS solutions that do n't change the password on the machine accounts on a regular basis .
Generally , however , if the password on a computer account is between 90 - 120 days , you can safely remove it .
OldCmp also is flexible enough to add your own components to the filter so if you want to only find disabled computer accounts or computer accounts in the xx dept or whatever , you have the ability to add any standard LDAP queries onto the base filter generated .
OldCmp as mentioned above has some safeties built in , the list is :
You can not delete a machine account that is n't already disabled .
You must specify a safety limit of how many machines it can manipulate at once if you want more than 10 .
By default it will only affect up to 10 accounts .
If you want to work up to 50 machines you can say 50 , if you want up to 100 , specify 100 .
You must specify the FORREAL option if you really want it to make changes , otherwise it will just report what it will try to do ...
I.E . It will be toothless .
It will not modify domain controller accounts at all .
Period .
Just too many dangers there .
Say what you like about Viscount Monckton , he never fails to entertain .
His response to the devastating critique of his claims about climate change by the physicist John Abraham is magnificently bonkers .
To give you a flavour of Monckton 's reasoning , here are some examples of what he cites as evidence of Abraham acting out of malice :
• Abraham pointed out that Monckton " has not written a single peer - reviewed science paper on any topic " ;
• Abraham stated that Lord Monckton " presented a lot of data with no citations or no explanation " ;
• He pointed out that " if you do n't tell us where it 's from we can't assess the data " ;
• He explained that a graph displayed by Lord Monckton was " almost off by 100 % " .
These are all straight statements of fact .
It is impossible to see how they could be construed as malicious , unless you regard all criticism of your views and credentials as illegitimate .
Throughout these 99 pages , Monckton ducks , dives and , like Ian Plimer , avoids answering Abraham 's questions by asking questions of his own : Monckton asks almost 500 of them .
As far as I can see , he fails to provide a straight or convincing refutation of any of Abraham 's criticisms , and succeeds only in throwing a great deal of dust into the air .
All this is accompanied , like so many of Monckton 's responses , with a demand for money ( in this case $ 110,000 to be paid to a charity of Monckton 's choice ) , an apology and retraction and an insistence that Abraham 's critique be removed from all public places .
Reading these ravings , I 'm struck by two thoughts .
The first is how frequently climate change deniers resort to demands for censorship or threats of litigation to try to shut down criticism of their views .
Martin Durkin has done it , Richard North has done it , Monckton has done it many times before .
They claim to want a debate , but as soon as it turns against them they try to stifle it by intimidating their opponents .
To me it suggests that these people can give it out , but they can't take it .
The second thought is as follows : is this the man who was invited to testify before Congress ?
Who has become deputy leader of the UK Independence party ?
Who has been cited all over the internet as having proved that manmade climate change is n't happening ?
One of the characteristics of the foot - soldiers of climate change denial seems to be their startling inability to spot a wrong 'un .
As well as publishing a long series of falsehoods about climate change , Monckton has falsely claimed to be a member of the House of Lords ( although you can read his explanation here ) ; falsely claimed to be a Nobel laureate ; falsely claimed to have won the Falklands war ( by suggesting to Margaret Thatcher that the SAS introduce a mild bacillus into the water supply in Port Stanley ) ; maintained that he has invented a cure for HIV , multiple sclerosis , influenza and other diseases ; and grossly exaggerated his role in shaping Margaret Thatcher 's views .
Yet none of this seems to have discouraged his disciples one jot .
There 's a pattern here too .
Those who insist that sea levels are not actually rising , for example , often cite the work of Nils - Axel Morner , who maintains that his work in the Maldives proves that it 's all a false alarm .
Our old friend Christopher Booker claimed that Morner " knows more about sea levels than anyone else in the world " , that he " has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe " and that his findings demonstrate that " all this talk about the sea rising is nothing but a colossal scare story . "
Morner 's work in fact consists of indirect measurements in just a few locations , which reveal the sum total of zilch about recent changes in sea level and have not been published in a peer - reviewed journal .
But the interesting thing , which connects this to the Monckton issue , is that Morner has also made a series of wild claims about other matters .
He maintains that he possesses paranormal abilities to find water and metal using a dowsing rod .
He also insists that he has discovered " the Hong Kong of the [ ancient ] Greeks " in Sweden .
Working with a homeopath called Bob Lind , Morner inflicted unauthorised damage on an Iron Age cemetery in order to try to prove his thesis .
Similarly , Peter Taylor 's claims that the planet is in fact cooling down have been given prominence by the Daily Express and other outlets , though they are unfounded in science .
His book Chill has been a hit in the denier community .
Taylor has also claimed to have uncovered toxic dumping by venturing into the astral realms .
He has speculated that a Masonic conspiracy was tuning into his thoughts , and had sent a " kook , a ninja freak , some throwback from past lives " to kill him .
He has also maintained that plutonium may " possess healing powers , borne of Plutonic dimension , a preparation for rebirth , an awakener to higher consciousness " .
As these examples suggest , those who lead the movement which claims that manmade climate change is n't happening often seem to entertain a number of other irrational beliefs .
In May , New Scientist interviewed the social psychologist Seth Kalichman , who has studied HIV denialist groups .
He found that the leaders of these groups " display all the features of paranoid personality disorder " .
These features include an intolerance of criticism and an inflated sense of their own importance .
They succumb to what psychologists call " suspicious thinking " .
The cognitive style of the denialist represents a warped sense of reality , which is why arguing with them gets you nowhere …
All people fit the world into their own sense of reality , but the suspicious person distorts reality with uncommon rigidity .
I 'm no psychologist , but the wide range of crazy beliefs the gurus of climate change denial entertain suggests that something of the kind that Kalichman identifies is likely to be at play .
The question which bugs me is this : why , when it seems so obvious that men like Monckton , Morner and Taylor have serious issues with reality , are so many people prepared to follow them ?

There lurks on the London Underground network a tube station that wont appear on any tube map , past , present or indeed future .
In use on most days , yet no trains ever call there and no passengers ever use it .
Fully fitted out with Oyster card readers , signalling and display boards , it is n’t an old abandoned station .
Welcome to West Ashfield Tube Station .
This is in fact a fully fitted out fake tube station built by London Underground on the 3rd floor of an office block in West Kensington and is used to teach new employees what goes where and when .
It is slightly surreal to go into a fairly generic office building , then on the third floor , find the entrance to a tube station – complete with fake newspaper stall and wire mesh grills .
The whole floor is used for training staff , and I was able to attend a tour of the facilities thanks to the The Institution of Engineering and Technology – The IET .
Despite the presence of the mocked up tube station , the rest of the floor is made up of conventional office rooms , although in a nice touch , each room is also named after a former tube train stock number .
Our group was broken up into four groups for convenience , and the tour covered the tube station , the new S - Stock simulator and a fully functioning model railway .
We also got to play with some of the “ big boys ” toys .
The tube station is probably the highlight for any visitor and in addition to looking like a tube station , it also behaves a bit like one .
When a train is due to arrive , although no physical train appears , the platform rumbles , speakers drown out conversations and there is even a fan in the corner blowing to simulate the wind blast that heralds the arrival of the train .
We were given a quite in - depth introduction to how the signalling systems work based on the “ moving block ” system the tube uses at the moment , with a brief overview of the system being introduced on the Jubilee Line at the moment .
Most pertinent was how the tube network deals with faults – and what causes them .
For example , there is a small break in the running rails which acts as a signal isolator , but over time that gap gets filled in with metal filing from trains , and the signal breaks .
Sometimes , simply scuffing the surface with your shoe is what it takes to fix a signal .
Which is why sometimes signal failures last just a few minutes before magically vanishing .
However , as we were to later learn , sometimes a signal failure in the wrong place can be a nightmare and totally screw up the network for several hours .
Incidentally , West Ashfield station is indeed in the western wing of the office block .
Maybe there ’ll be an East Ashfield station sometime in the future ?
One floor down is the BIG BOYS TOY writ large , as there is a fully functioning training simulator for the forthcoming S - Stock trains that will be appearing on the Metropolitan Line next year ( and Circle / District later on )
After a quick overview of the trainers own operations desk , it was time to play with the train itself .
Several members of the group got to play at being train driver – driving through Red Lights at Danger ( SPADS ) with alarming regularity .
I did n’t actually get to drive the train , but ( in my opinion ) probably got the better part of the deal by standing outside and chatting to the instructor and getting much more background information .
Quite interestingly , although a SPAD is not a good thing , in of itself it is n’t mission critical .
Due to the nature of the tube network signalling systems , SPADS are almost guaranteed , and the tube network only takes action if someone is rather incompetent and keeps passing red signals .
As a SPAD could be a signalling failure and not the drivers fault , the driver seeks permission to drive carefully after each incident and after 3 minutes , returns to driving at normal speed .
The new S Stock automatically limits the speed for three minutes , then releases the driver to go at full speed again .
The new trains also have some interesting improvements , such as if someone has got a bag jammed in a door because they jumped on when the doors are closing , then the train will only open that one door rather than all the doors on the train – which usually results in more people leaping on ( and getting stuck between closing doors ) .
Incidentally , standing outside the simulator as the train starts moving forward is a very unsettling experience as you see the scenery moving , but do n’t feel the usual sensation of a train accelerating .
Takes a bit of getting used to as your brain gets confused by the illusion of moving without moving .
A brief talk about how they use a static model railway to set up possible scenarios and teach tube staff how to handle situations .
Then on to the ultimate model railway .
This is a fully functioning model railway that was only recently built to replace an older model based in White City many years ago .
That older model used signalling systems that were so close to the live kit , that sometimes an engineer would run in and nick a component to fix a broken signal at White City !
That ’s not going to happen with the new model train set .
In addition to being configured with a selection of more modern signalling systems as used on the London Underground , they also have a lovingly recreated old lever based signal network which is used to show staff how things worked in the past .
We were then let loose on the system and told to basically run the the network , getting trains into platforms , slidings etc without causing traffic jams and the like .
The true purpose of the model train set though is to train staff on dealing with problems , and a simple flick of a switch can simulate any sort of network failure you care to imagine .
It was here that we leant why it can sometimes take ages to get trains out of tunnels when things go wrong .
For example , a train is stuck at a platform – maybe someone decided that 5 pm was the best time to kill themselves – and there is a train behind it in the tunnel .
Not only does that train now have to reverse back down the tunnel – but do so safely .
In ye olde days ( aka , 2008 ) the station staff at the previous station would have to manually check any points junctions were safe , but then walk down to the stranded train and hand over a paper form granting authority for the driver to drive backwards down a tunnel .
Today they can grant authority over a secure radio link , but that only became possible 18 months ago .
Indeed it does seem that the Evening Standard headlines of people being stuck in tunnels for an hour or more have dried up since this was introduced .
So , a change that many people wont have even known has happened has already had a positive impact on reducing delays on the network .
Oh , and I slightly squealed when I noticed one of the stations is called Hobbs End .
Sci-Fi film geeks may get the reference .
Overall , a fascinating visit and I am deeply grateful to both the staff at London Underground for taking us around ( and letting us take photos ! ) , and also to the IET for organising another excellent event .
More of my photos from the visit here .

Britain will not follow France in introducing a ban on the burkha , a minister has said .
Immigration minister Damian Green called a ban on Muslim women being allowed to wear the burkha " un-British " in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph newspaper .
The introduction of the French ban , a move supported by the right - wing UK Independence party but largely opposed by Britain 's mainstream parties , has raised the issue 's profile in recent weeks .
And an attempt by Tory backbencher Philip Hollobone to make it illegal for people to cover their faces in public has ensured the issue gets scrutiny in parliament in the coming months .
Now Mr Green has turned against Mr Hollobone by outlining the reasons why the coalition government will not be following his - or France 's - lead .
" I stand personally on the feeling that telling people what they can and can't wear , if they 're just walking down the street , is a rather un - British thing to do , " he said .
" We 're a tolerant and mutually respectful society .
" There are times , clearly , when you 've got to be able to identify yourself , and people have got to be able to see your face , but I think it 's very unlikely and it would be undesirable for the British parliament to try and pass a law dictating what people wore . "
Mr Green said the French political culture was very different to Britain , contrasting the religious - run schools in Britain with the ban on crucifixes in schools across the Channel .
He accused French politicians of introducing the ban " for demonstration effects " and added : " I think there 's absolutely no read - across to immigration policy from what the French are doing about the burkha . "
McGill - UBC project creates mouse grimace scale to help identify pain in humans and animals
A new study by researchers from McGill University and the University of British Columbia shows that mice , like humans , express pain through facial expressions .
McGill Psychology Prof. Jeffrey Mogil , UBC Psychology Prof. Kenneth Craig and their respective teams have discovered that when subjected to moderate pain stimuli , mice showed discomfort through facial expressions in the same way humans do .
Their study , published online May 9 in the journal Nature Methods , also details the development of a Mouse Grimace Scale that could inform better treatments for humans and improve conditions for lab animals .
Because pain research relies heavily on rodent models , an accurate measurement of pain is paramount in understanding the most pervasive and important symptom of chronic pain , namely spontaneous pain , says Mogil .
" The Mouse Grimace Scale provides a measurement system that will both accelerate the development of new analgesics for humans , but also eliminate unnecessary suffering of laboratory mice in biomedical research , " says Mogil .
" There are also serious implications for the improvement of veterinary care more generally . "
This is the first time researchers have successfully developed a scale to measure spontaneous responses in animals that resemble human responses to those same painful states .
Mogil , graduate student Dale Langford and colleagues in the Pain Genetics Lab at McGill analyzed images of mice before and during moderate pain stimuli – for example , the injection of dilute inflammatory substances , as are commonly used around the world for testing pain sensitivity in rodents .
The level of pain studied could be comparable , researchers said , to a headache or the pain associated with an inflamed and swollen finger easily treated by common analgesics like Aspirin or Tylenol .
Mogil then sent the images to Craig 's lab at UBC , where facial pain coding experts used them to develop the scale .
Craig 's team proposed that five facial features be scored : orbital tightening ( eye closing ) , nose and cheek bulges and ear and whisker positions according to the severity of the stimulus .
Craig 's laboratory had previously established studying facial expression as the standard for assessing pain in human infants and others with verbal communication limitations .
This work is an example of successful " bedside - to - bench " translation , where a technique known to be relevant in our species is adapted for use in laboratory experiments .
Continuing experiments in the lab will investigate whether the scale works equally well in other species , whether analgesic drugs given to mice after surgical procedures work well at their commonly prescribed doses , and whether mice can respond to the facial pain cues of other mice .
LONDON - A treasure hunter has found about 52,500 Roman coins , one of the largest such discoveries ever in Britain , officials said Thursday .
The hoard , which was valued at 3.3 million pounds ( $ 5 million ) , includes hundreds of coins bearing the image of Marcus Aurelius Carausius , who seized power in Britain and northern France in the late third century and proclaimed himself emperor .
Dave Crisp , a treasure hunter using a metal detector , located the coins in April in a field in southwestern England , according to the Somerset County Council and the Portable Antiquities Scheme .
The coins were buried in a large jar about a foot ( 30 centimeters ) deep and weighed about 160 kilograms ( 350 pounds ) in all .
Crisp said a " funny signal " from his metal detector prompted him to start digging .
" I put my hand in , pulled out a bit of clay and there was a little radial , a little bronze Roman coin - very , very small , about the size of my fingernail , " Crisp said in an interview with the BBC .
He recovered about 20 coins before discovering that they were in a pot , and realized he needed expert help .
" Because Mr. Crisp resisted the temptation to dig up the coins it has allowed archaeologists from Somerset County Council to carefully excavate the pot and its contents , ensuring important evidence about the circumstances of its burial was preserved , " said Anna Booth , of Somerset Council .
Somerset Coroner Tony Williams scheduled an inquest Thursday to formally determine whether the find is subject to the Treasure Act , a formal step toward determining a price to be paid by any institution which wishes to acquire the hoard .
The hoard is one of the largest ever found in Britain , and will reveal more about the nation 's history in the third century , said Roger Bland , of the British Museum .
The find includes more than 760 coins from the reign of Carausius , the Roman naval officer who seized power in 286 and ruled until he was assassinated in 293 .
" The late third century A.D. was a time when Britain suffered barbarian invasions , economic crises and civil wars , " Bland said .
" Roman rule was finally stabilized when the Emperor Diocletian formed a coalition with the Emperor Maximian , which lasted 20 years .
This defeated the separatist regime which had been established in Britain by Carausius .
" This find presents us with an opportunity to put Carausius on the map .
School children across the country have been studying Roman Britain for decades , but are never taught about Carausius our lost British emperor . "
The discovery of the Roman coins follows last year 's discovery of a hoard of Anglo - Saxon coins in central England .
The so - called Staffordshire Hoard included more than 1,500 objects , mostly made from gold .
The Portable Antiquities Scheme is a department of the British Museum which deals with treasure finds .
“ My sense is that they believe that events are proving they were right all along , ” Jonathan D. Sarna , a historian at Brandeis University and author of the seminal book “ American Judaism , ” said in a telephone interview .
“ Everything they prophesied  dual loyalty , nationalism being evil  has come to pass . ”

“ I would be surprised if vast numbers of people moved over to the A.C.J. as an organization because of its reputation , ” he continued .
“ But it ’s certainly the case that if the Holocaust underscored the problems of Jewish life in the diaspora , recent years have highlighted the point that Zionism is no panacea . ”
Mr. Naman grew up in a Texas family deeply involved in the council , and as a result he has lived through the swings of the political pendulum .
“ We were ostracized and maligned , ” he said .
“ But we felt back then , and we feel now , that our positions are credible .
They ’ve been justified and substantiated by what has occurred . ”
On that matter , to put it mildly , there is disagreement .
If American Zionists who oppose the West Bank occupation face withering criticism from the conservative part of American Jewry , which has tended to dominate the major communal and lobbying groups , then the unapologetic foes of Zionism in the council are met with apoplexy and indignation .
The rejection of Zion , though , goes back to the Torah itself , with its accounts of the Hebrews ’ rebelling against Moses on the journey toward the Promised Land and pleading to return to Egypt .
Until Theodore Herzl created the modern Zionist movement early in the 20th century , the biblical injunction to return to Israel was widely understood as a theological construct rather than a pragmatic instruction .
Most Orthodox Jewish leaders before the Holocaust rejected Zionism , saying the exile was a divine punishment and Israel could be restored only in the messianic age .
The Reform movement maintained that Judaism is a religion , not a nationality .
A nanomaterial originally developed to fight toxic waste is now helping reduce debilitating fumes in homes with corrosive drywall .
Developed by Kenneth Klabunde of Kansas State University , and improved over three decades with support from the National Science Foundation , the FAST - ACT material has been a tool of first responders since 2003 .
Now , NanoScale Corporation of Manhattan , Kansas -- the company Klabunde co-founded to market the technology -- has incorporated FAST - ACT into a cartridge that breaks down the corrosive drywall chemicals .
Homeowners have reported that the chemicals -- particularly sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide -- have caused respiratory illnesses , wiring corrosion and pipe damage in thousands of U.S. homes with sulfur - rich , imported drywall .
" It is devastating to see what has happened to so many homeowners because of the corrosive drywall problem , but I am glad the technology is available to help , " said Klabunde .
" We 've now adapted the technology we developed through years of research for FAST - ACT for new uses by homeowners , contractors and remediators . "
The new cartridge , called OdorKlenz® , takes the place of the existing air filter in a home .
The technology is similar to one that NanoScale adapted in 2008 for use by a major national disaster restoration service company for odors caused by fire and water damage .

In homes with corrosive drywall , the cartridge is used in combination with related FAST - ACT - based , OdorKlenz® surface treatments ( and even laundry additives ) to remove the sulfur - bearing compounds causing the corrosion issues .
Developers at NanoScale tested their new air cartridge in affected homes that were awaiting drywall removal , and in every case , odor dropped to nearly imperceptible levels within 10 days or less and corrosion was reduced .
The FAST - ACT material is a non-toxic mineral powder composed of the common elements magnesium , titanium and oxygen .
While metal oxides similar to FAST - ACT have an established history tackling dangerous compounds , none have been as effective .
NanoScale 's breakthrough was a new method to manufacture the compound as a nanocrystalline powder with extremely high surface area -- only a few tablespoons have as much surface area as a football field .
The surface area allows more interactions between the metal oxides and the toxic molecules , enabling the powder to capture and destroy a large quantity of hazardous chemicals ranging from sulfuric acid to VX gas -- and their hazardous byproducts -- in minutes .
" The concept of nano - sized adsorbents as both a cost - efficient , useful product for first responders and an effective product for in - home use illustrates the wide spectrum of possibilities for this technology , " said NSF program director Rosemarie Wesson , who oversaw NanoScale 's NSF Small Business Innovation Resarch grants .
" It is great to see the original work we supported to help reduce the toxic effects of hazardous spills now expand into other applications . "
In coming months , the company is proposing its technology for use in Gulf Coast residences affected by the recent oil spill and other hazardous situations where airborne toxins are causing harm .
In addition to extensive support from NSF , the development of FAST ACT and NanoScale 's technology has been supported by grants from the U.S. Army , DTRA , Air Force , DARPA , JPEO , MARCORSYSCOM , the CTTSO , USSOCOM , NIOSH , DOE , NIH and EPA .
The position of trade unions has deteriorated significantly in Iraq .
Unions in the electricity sector have been banned in a move that echoes Saddam Hussein 's old ways .
The Iraqi police raided and shut down trade union offices following a draconian ministerial decree .
The order , issued on 20 July , " prohibits all trade union activities at the [ electricity ] ministry and its departments and sites " .
It orders the police " to close all trade union offices and bases and to take control of the union 's assets , properties and documents , furniture and computers " .
It also instructs the ministry to take legal action against trade union officials under anti-terrorism laws .
This decree follows an earlier one that means that Iraqi trade unionists who travel abroad to international events could face jail when they return .
I have tabled several commons motions alerting MPs and others to these developments and have joined forces with Tony Baldry , the chairman of Conservative Friends of Iraq .
Our joint motion recalls the near - liquidation of a once strong and non-sectarian trade union movement by the dictatorial regime of Saddam and salutes those who have devoted themselves to rebuilding a labour movement in Iraq .
It congratulates the TUC and others for their important moral and material support for the Iraqi unions .
We believe that the right to free association is a key element of a vibrant democracy and social justice , and back a labour code that would enshrine such rights .
We join the International Trade Union Confederation in criticising the Iraqi ministerial decision to prohibit all travel by trade union delegations to international meetings or conferences without official approval .
I have directly raised labour rights in Baghdad with the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , and his party colleagues , and I have also tabled parliamentary questions encouraging the British government to lobby for free unions , which the previous Labour government often did .
A cross-party approach is necessary in exposing this scandalous attack on free trade unionism in a country with a proud and long tradition of labour movement activity .
The Iraqi movement was once the biggest between Europe and Australia .
In 1959 the May Day march in Baghdad brought together at least half a million people out of a population of about 10 million .
Saddam 's Ba'athist dictatorship liquidated the movement and banned public - sector unions in a country dominated by the public sector .
Iraqi activists have been rebuilding the movement since Saddam 's overthrow , from a base of just a few hundred to many hundreds of thousands .
Iraq 's non-sectarian unions have the ability to bring working people together despite sharp tensions between different parts of the country .
They also emphasise the need for women 's involvement in public affairs .
Their brave and hard work has been complemented by moral and material support from the TUC and British unions including Unison .
In 2006 a Labour Friends of Iraq delegation , including myself , met 22 union leaders who had come from all over Iraq for a summit with us in Kurdistan .
They outlined their hopes and asked us " to help us stand on our two feet " .
The British labour movement remains divided over the military intervention in 2003 but those differences can be parked in favour of helping the unions , women 's groups and other civil society bodies in Iraq .
The main priority is to persuade the new Iraqi government , when it is finally formed , to overturn Saddam 's laws and end meddling in internal union affairs .
Together with the TUC and other national and global union federations , the Kurdistan United Workers ' Union and the General Federation of Iraqi Workers have launched a campaign for labour rights .
This is also personally backed by President Talabani .
Earlier this year , the Iraqi labour minister published a draft law that went in the right direction .
However , in May the hardline civil society minister announced a new approach that keeps the public - sector union ban .
It also prohibits travel by trade union delegations to international meetings or conferences without approval .
The conflict between the two ministers ' approaches has been amplified by the power vacuum in Baghdad as the parties move at a snail 's pace to form a new coalition .
This is an opportunity to maximise support for the Iraqi labour movement .
The basis of liberal democracy is not just representative government but also a vibrant civil society .
Iraq is a rich country and will become more and more prosperous .
It may become the world 's largest oil and gas producer .
Experience elsewhere in the Middle East shows that such wealth can be hoarded by autocratic elites with a well - oiled military and security apparatus but without much benefit for working people or civil society .
A strong trade union movement in Iraq could help ensure that Iraq does not follow or rather revert to that pattern .
It could make sure that social justice in health , education and pensions are part of the new Iraq .
This can help Iraq provide a positive example to other countries .
But that means Iraqi unions have to be free and independent .
This cause should be taken up by all .
A decent democracy in Iraq is in everyone 's interests .
â€ œAn intuitionistic logic that proves Markov 's principleâ€ , Hugo Herbelin , LICS 2010 .
We design an intuitionistic predicate logic that supports a limited amount of classical reasoning , just enough to prove a variant of Markovâ€™s principle suited for predicate logic .
At the computational level , the extraction of an existential witness out of a proof of its double negation is done by using a form of statically - bound exception mechanism , what can be seen as a direct - style variant of Friedmanâ €™s A - translation .
Markov 's principle is an axiom of " Russian constructivism " .
It says that if P is a decidable predicate ( i.e. , the formula ∀x. P( x ) or ¬ P ( x ) is constructively provable ) , then if we know that P is not always false ( ie ¬( ∀x . ¬ P( x ) ) ) , then there exists an x such that P holds ( ie ∃x. P( x ) ) .
One operational way of understanding this axiom is that it says is that if we know P is not always false ( on , say , the natural numbers ) , we can find an element for which it is true with a while - loop : check to see if 1 is true , and then check to see if 2 is true , and so on , stopping when you hit a number for which it holds .
This means that Markov 's principle is a principle of unbounded search , and as a result it has controversial status in intuitionistic mathematics -- should we regard a program with a non-constructive termination proof as a constructively terminating program ?
( The answer is , as usual , " it depends " : in different applications you can want it or not . )
However , just chucking an axiom like ¬( ∀x . ¬ P( x ) ) → ∃x. P( x ) into your proof rules is not very nice from a proof - theoretic perspective .
It mixes up a bunch of different logical connectives , and adding it as an axiom will break things like the cut-elimination theorem for sequent calculus .
In this paper , Herbelin exploits ( a ) the fact that Markov 's principle is a ( mildly ) classical principle of reasoning , and ( b ) the fact that classical logic is connected with control operators like continuations , to give a logic which is proof - theoretically well - behaved , but which supports Markov 's principle .
The trick is to add first - class continuations , but only for value types ( ie , you can throw products and sums , but not functions ) .
What I find surprising is that this same class of restriction also arises in another paper on control operators at LICS -- Noam Zeilberger 's paper " Polarity and the Logic of Delimited Continuations " uses it too .
( This paper deserves a post here too . )
Hip - hop has produced plenty of great music over its 40 - plus - year history .
Few albums are worthy of the title " greatest , " while others are good enough to make the list .
These albums were picked on the basis of creativity , originality , replay value , and overall cultural impact .
100 of 100 Run the Jewels : ' Run the Jewels ' Courtesy Fools Gold Killer Mike is really good at rapping .
El - P is really good at rapping and excellent at making beats .
Put these two together and nobody could screw it up .
98 of 100 Too Short : ' Born to Mack ' Jive Records Raw , uncut , and X - rated tales of female conquests abound .
At a mere eight tracks , " Born to Mack " was indeed too short .
97 of 100 MF Doom : ' Operation Doomsday ' Metal Face Records
Doom 's off - kilter rhymes , scenic skits , and soul - inspired production made " Operation Doomsday " a unique set worthy of multiple spins .
96 of 100 Pharoahe Monch : ' Internal Affairs ' Priority Records " Internal Affairs " was Pharoahe Monch 's Rocky Balboa moment .
Most of the album was recorded in a closet without air conditioning , which imbues it with a raw feeling .
The gritty production comes from now - vintage equipment such as SP - 12s and AKAI 2000s .
95 of 100 Jeru the Damaja : ' The Sun Rises in the East ' Payday Records Fame proved elusive for the Brooklyn emcee , but Jeru 's talent and Premier 's mind - blowing compositions made his debut one of the quintessential '90s hip - hop albums .
94 of 100 Kendrick Lamar : ' Good Kid , m. A.A.d City ' Top Dawg Entertainment
There 's a lot to love about Kendrick Lamar 's " Good Kid , m. A. A.d City . "
For starters , it 's a remarkable rap album in every way rap can be remarkable .
It 's a portrait of the jungle through the eyes of the prey .
Despite a Grammy snub , it was well received by fans , critics , and peers .
93 of 100 Juvenile : ' 400 Degreez ' Cash Money Records
A combination of Juvie 's melodic flow and Cash Money 's high - end production made " 400 Degreez " a Southern rap favorite in 1998 .
92 of 100 The Roots : ' Things Fall Apart ' MCA
This mid-career success for The Roots was a huge step forward from the righteous fury of their first three LPs .
91 of 100 Del : ' I Wish My Brother George Was Here ' Elektra Records
While his cousin Ice Cube was busy stirring up the gangsta rap scene , Del was laying the foundation for what would become a healthy alternative - hip - hop landscape .
90 of 100 Xzibit : ' 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz ' RCA Records Xzibit molds his voice into a gruff instrument , overpowering the beats when necessary .
It 's a brilliant gambit when it works .
89 of 100 Reflection Eternal : ' Train of Thought ' Rawkus Super lyricist Talib Kweli and super producer Hi-Tek join forces on a masterwork that underlined the Rawkus era in hip - hop .
88 of 100 Slum Village : ' Fantastic Volume II ' GoodVibe
Two of the three masterminds behind " Fantastic Volume II " are no longer alive , but this album left an indelible mark on hip - hop .
SV 's experimentation with neo-soul and quirky raps flung the door open for groups such as Little Brother and Tanya Morgan .
87 of 100 Black Moon : ' Enta Da Stage ' Wreck Records
Unlike most hip - hop albums of its era , " Enta Da Stage " eschewed confrontational raps and opted for a brooding , electrifying brand of hip - hop .
86 of 100 Wyclef Jean : ' The Carnival ' Sony
This is where it all began .
Wyclef 's debut set the bar high for the rest of the Fugees ' solo efforts .
" The Carnival " was a masterful piece that combined Clef 's smart songwriting with excellent beatsmithing .
It was a critical and commercial smash .
85 of 100 Scarface : ' The Fix ' Def Jam " The Fix " was one of those albums that came out of nowhere and made you forget everything else going on in Southern rap .
With robust beats by Mike Dean and a young Kanye West and Scarface in peak form , " The Fix " was an instant hit and a Southern rap classic .
84 of 100 The Roots : ' Illadelph Halflife ' Geffen
The year is 1996 and hip - hop heads are n't so sure about live instrumentation .
So The Roots flip the script and sample themselves in a brave artistic endeavor .
83 of 100 Busta Rhymes : ' When Disaster Strikes ' Elektra Records Busta 's second album is arguably his most consistent work .
It definitely contains his most memorable singles : " Dangerous " and " Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See . "
80 of 100 2 Pac : ' All Eyez on Me' Death Row Records Tupac Shakur was fresh out of jail when he released " All Eyez on Me , " and you could hear the raw thoughts of a man grappling with his inner conflict .

79 of 100 Diamond and the Psychotic Neurotics : ' Stunts , Blunts & Hip - Hop ' Mercury Records " Stunts , Blunts & Hip - Hop " announced Diamond D as one of the best producers on the mic .

78 of 100 Kanye West : ' The College Dropout ' Roc - a - Fella / Def Jam Kanye 's first album , " The College Dropout , " was one for the ages .

77 of 100 DMX : ' It 's Dark and Hell Is Hot ' Def Jam DMX 's debut album , " It 's Dark and Hell Is Hot , " arrived in May 1998 and established him as the hottest thing in rap .
At a time when bad boy stars such as Mase and Diddy ruled radio with a pop-friendly sound , X took the dark route .
He barked ( literally ) his way to the top of the charts , thanks to key singles " Get at Me Dog " and " Ruff Ryder 's Anthem . "
And " How 's It Goin ' Down " with Faith Evans showed this dog was n't all bark .
76 of 100 Eminem : ' The Slim Shady LP ' Aftermath A 24 - year - old bleached - blond rapper from Detroit was n't anyone 's image of a hip - hop artist at the turn of the decade .
But once Eminem opened his mouth , no one could question his skill .

75 of 100 Jungle Brothers : ' Straight Out the Jungle ' Warlock Records 1980s hip - hop is colored by drum breaks , bad fashion , and Afrocentrism .

73 of 100 Pharcyde : ' Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde ' Delicious Vinyl Records While De La Soul was brewing Daisy Age rap on the East Coast , Pharcyde was diligently paying attention out West .
" Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde " has many fun , irreverent moments ( " Oh S **t " ) and angst ( " Officer " ) and mush ( " Passin ' Me By " ) , but not once do the zany fellas on the mic compromise passion for a bitter whine .
72 of 100 Kendrick Lamar : ' To Pimp a Butterfly ' Aftermath " To Pimp a Butterfly " is a concept album with a convoluted arc that Kendrick follows with rare discipline .
It retains vestiges of " Good Kid , m. A. A.d City " themes , with Lucy ( Lucifer ) supplanting Sherane .
It deserves a seat alongside timeless works such as " Fear of a Black Planet " and " AmeriKKKa 's Most Wanted . "
71 of 100 Mobb Deep : ' The Infamous ' Sony One of rap 's greatest duos , Mobb Deep brought QB dun talk to hip - hop audiences in the '90s .
East Coast hip - hop was a competitive space in the '90s , and Mobb 's first album , " Juvenile Hell , " flew under the radar .
In 1995 , Havoc and Prodigy made huge creative leaps with " The Infamous . "
With Havoc serving up hardbody beats and Prodigy thrilling listeners with cinematic crime rap , " The Infamous " became one of the most influential gangsta rap albums .
70 of 100 Biz Markie : ' Goin ' Off ' Cold Chillin ' Records
The Human Beatbox came onto the scene with jokes in his veins and a boogers - out attitude on the mic .

69 of 100 Kanye West : ' Late Registration ' Roc- A - Fella

" Late Registration " not only built on his previous sound palette , but it also packed even more lyrical punch than his debut .
West was rewarded with a Grammy for his effort .
68 of 100 Geto Boys : ' We Can't Be Stopped ' Rap - A - Lot Records
It 's hard for those who were n't there to understand , but the Geto Boys were rap heroes to every little ghetto boy and girl on the Gulf Coast who dared dream of counting bars at a time when East Coast and West Coast were vying for rap supremacy .
It 's a great album full of raw tales every hood can relate to , from Houston to Haiti .
67 of 100 Queen Latifah : ' All Hail the Queen ' Tommy Boy Records Latifah 's debut showcased her Grade A rapping chops , with songs such as " Wrath of My Madness " and " Ladies First " announcing the Jersey native as rap 's new royalty .
66 of 100 DJ Shadow : ' Endtroducing ' Island " Endtroducing " is one of the most influential hip - hop albums of all time .

65 of 100 AZ : ' Doe or Die ' Capitol Records After his star turn on Nas ' " Life 's a B***h , " AZ launched his solo career with the arrival of " Doe or Die . "
Nas returns the favor on " Mo Money , Mo Murder , " while songs such as " Rather Unique " and " Gimme Yours " hark back to the street spirit of " Illmatic . "
64 of 100 Boogie Down Productions : ' By All Means Necessary ' Jive
If you 're one of those glass - half - full people , you 'll note that the only positive side of Scott La Rock 's unfortunate murder was in the direction of " By All Means Necessary . "
KRS - One found himself denouncing black - on - black violence and railing against injustice on the classic BDP album .
La Rock would have approved .
63 of 100 UGK : ' Ridin ' Dirty ' Sony " Ridin ' Dirty " is UGK 's most important album and one of the best rap albums ever recorded .
The album gets its unique identity from Bun and Pimp 's yin and yang connection .
Bun is the surgical emcee , while Pimp is the flamboyant philosopher .
Everyone should buy two copies .
62 of 100 GZA / Genius : ' Liquid Swords ' Geffen " Liquid Swords " introduced GZA as the cerebral swordsman .
RZA 's serene , atmospheric board work helps transform the album from alt - rap bravery to a Wu masterpiece .
61 of 100 Mos Def : ' Black on Both Sides ' Rawkus Mos Def 's solo debut , " Black on Both Sides , " scores major points in key categories : aesthetics , substance , and production .
It knocks from end to end .
Whether kicking rhymes about his personal politics or painting a portrait of a plump backside , Mos does it with vivid skill .
60 of 100 Nas : ' Stillmatic ' Sony Nas could spend the rest of his career chasing a shadow named " Illmatic . " 2001 's " Stillmatic " was the closest he came to capturing the angst and paranoia of his boyhood self .
Standouts include the scathing Jay - Z diss " Ether " and the time - bending classic " Rewind . "
59 of 100 Nas : ' It Was Written ' Columbia " It Was Written " is Nas ' attempt to match the grit and glory of " Illmatic . "
Highlights include " The Message , " " I Gave U Power , " and " If I Ruled the World ( Imagine That ) " with Lauryn Hill .
58 of 100 OutKast : ' Stankonia ' LaFace Creative ebullience abounds , but three of 2002's best rap songs are all here : " B.O.B. , " " So Fresh , So Clean , " and the baby mama drama jama " Ms. Jackson . "
57 of 100 De La Soul : ' De La Soul Is Dead ' Tommy Boy Entertainment De La Soul reinvented its sound on " De La Soul Is Dead . "
After being derided as hippies , they shifted away from the Daisy Age image of the first album and returned with a poker - face album that retained some of the early zaniness .
56 of 100 OutKast : ' Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik ' LaFace OutKast 's debut is as much a triumph for Andre 3000 and Big Boi as it is for production outfit Organized Noize .
One part Southern - fried beatsmithery and one part poetic sorcery , Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik is 100 percent dope .
55 of 100 Jay - Z : ' The Blueprint ' Roc- A - Fella
It 's an album so great not even Osama bin Laden could stop its flight to the top on 9/11/01 .
" Blueprint " solidified Jay 's place as a GOAT contender .
It 's one of the best hip - hop albums of the 2000s .
54 of 100 Kool G Rap & DJ Polo : ' Road to the Riches ' Warner Bros .
Records Marley
Marl supplies the cold beats , DJ Polo provides the cuts , and Kool G Rap attacks every track with the nastiest lisp in the five boroughs .
53 of 100 Madvillain :' Madvillainy ' Stones Throw Records Prime poets MF Doom and Madlib joined forces to create this enduring masterwork in 2004 .

46 of 100 Organized Konfusion : ' Stress : The Extinction Agenda ' Elektra Records " Stress : The Extinction Agenda , " Organized Konfusion 's second album , is more ambitious and exceptionally well written compared to the first .
Highlights include the title track and " Let 's Organize . "
45 of 100 LL Cool J : ' Radio ' Def Jam LL
Cool
J released a ton of clunkers in the latter part of his career , but " Radio " stands testament to his days as a great emcee : tough , def , and jingling , baby .
44 of 100 Brand Nubian : ' One for All ' Elektra Records Grand Puba , Sadat X , Lord Jamar , and DJ Alamo brought social commentary and spirituality to the forefront of '90s rap with gems such as " Slow Down " and " Wake Up . "
43 of 100 Lauryn Hill : ' The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill ' Sony Lauryn Hill 's " The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill " offered the best blend of rap and R&B in hip - hop history .
Her stellar songwriting flourished from song to song , whether grappling with spirituality ( " Final Hour , " " Forgive Them , Father " ) or stroking sexuality without exploiting it ( " Nothing Even Matters " ) .
42 of 100 EPMD : ' Unfinished Business ' Priority Records
At a time when hip - hop was dominated by rage , Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith slowed things down with the decidedly smooth , fresh , and exciting " Unfinished Business . "
41 of 100 Ice - T : ' Power ' Warner Bros
The one gangsta rap album to rule them all , " Power " portrayed inner-city street life in graphic detail while sending an anti-crime message to the hood .
40 of 100 The Notorious B.I.G. : ' Life After Death ' Bad Boy Records Biggie must have known this would be his last album .
He stuffed it with as many songs as he could muster : street anthems , radio hits , comedic skits , and a wide cast of co-stars .
" Life After Death " is certified diamond for sales totaling over 10 million units .
39 of 100 Gang Starr : ' Hard to Earn ' Chrysalis Records " Hard to Earn " varied from Gang Starr 's previous albums :
It was harsher and more insular .
It also captured Guru and Premier 's growing frustration with sucker emcees .
38 of 100 A Tribe Called Quest : ' People 's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm ' Sony Records Authentic , fun , and beautifully produced , Tribe 's stunning debut appealed to lovers of alternative hip - hop and still inspires .
37 of 100 Pete Rock & CL Smooth : ' Mecca and the Soul Brother ' Elektra Records Pete Rock and CL Smooth helped usher in a pivotal point in hip - hop with their mix of smooth , horn - heavy beats and sophisticated rhymes .
36 of 100 Dead Prez : ' Let 's Get Free ' Columbia Records
The most revolutionary hip - hop group since Public Enemy , Dead Prez helped revive the consciousness movement with this powerful debut LP .
35 of 100 Public Enemy : ' Fear of a Black Planet ' Def Jam Dark , raw and provocative , " Fear of a Black Planet " produced classic cuts such as " 911 Is a Joke " and " Who Stole the Soul . "
34 of 100 Ghostface Killah : ' Ironman ' Sony Records Backed by RZA 's slick and somber beats , Ghostface dropped a combustive debut rife with rich stories and wild metaphors .
33 of 100 Ice Cube : ' AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted ' Priority Records
After a messy breakup with NWA , Ice Cube filled his debut album with dark stories of manic frustration .
32 of 100 Redman : ' Whut ?
Thee Album ' Def Jam Redman 's wild sense of humor is the main star of " Whut ?
Thee Album , " but it 's also notable for its rousing energy , funky party jams , and ferocious boasts .
31 of 100 Beastie Boys : ' Paul 's Boutique ' Capitol Records
As critics were writing off Beastie Boys as a one - album wonder , Ad- Rock , Mike , and MCA went back to their L.A. studio and worked feverishly on their follow - up to the monumental " Licensed to Ill . "
The result was " Paul 's Boutique , " an album that packed a combination of creative depth and layered production .
30 of 100 LL Cool J : ' Mama Said Knock You Out ' Def Jam Striking a balance between pleasant and pugnacious , " Mama Said Knock You Out " marked Uncle L's growth as a rapper .
The hard - edged songs are here ( " Murdergram , " " Mama Said Knock You Out " ) , but they 're perfectly complemented by smooth , accessible jams ( " Around the Way Girl " ) .
Marley Marl 's excellent production helps make " Mama " a masterpiece .
29 of 100 Makaveli : ' The Don Killuminati : The 7 Day Theory ' Death Row Records
Some say " Makaveli " is 2 Pac 's best album .
It 's certainly his hardest and most surreal .
Released less than eight weeks after Pac 's death , the album further eternalized Pac 's enigma .
The album 's best songs include the street anthem " Hail Mary " and the ( adoptive ) hometown tribute " To Live and Die in LA . "
28 of 100 Scarface : ' The Diary ' Rap - A - Lot Records
The third time was the charm for Brad " Scarface " Jordan .
His third solo foray , " The Diary , " immediately established the Houston rapper as the South 's answer to Rakim , thanks to his smart storytelling and inimitable flow .
27 of 100 Big Daddy Kane : ' Long Live the Kane ' Cold Chillin ' Records Big Daddy
Kane wrote the manuscript for braggart rap on " Long Live the Kane . "
Marley Marl 's sparse production and Kane 's slick wordplay are worth noting .
Like Tony the Tiger , he 's GRRRRREAAAT .
26 of 100 A Tribe Called Quest : ' Midnight Marauders ' Jive Records Tribe 's third disc is a collection of melodic , Crisco - slick sizzlers .
You 'll love " Electric Relaxation , " " Award Tour , " and " Oh My God . "
25 of 100 Ultramagnetic MC's : ' Critical Beatdown ' Next Plateau " Critical Beatdown " is important for three reasons :
It 's arguably the best album of 1988 ; it revolutionized the art of hip - hop sampling thanks to Ced - Gee 's brilliant use of the E- mu SP - 1200 sampler ; and it introduced the world to the exceptionally creative weirdo known as Kool Keith .
24 of 100 Run-DMC : ' Raising Hell ' Profile Records " Raising Hell " was the most uncompromising Run DMC album , and also the most accessible .
It has this gloriously invigorating feel that resonated with audiences old and new .
" Raising Hell " is important for its originality as well as its influence .
" My Adidas " is still an anthem for hip - hop fashion , while " Walk This Way " helped started a trend of rock - rap fusion .
23 of 100 D.O.C. " ' No One Can Do It Better ' Ruthless Records Before a car crash wrecked D.O.C.'s larynx , he made an undeniable hip - hop classic .
" No One Can Do It Better " sidestepped West Coast gun talk in favor of East Coast lyricism and featured some of Dr. Dre 's finest production .
22 of 100 EPMD : ' Strictly Business ' Priority Records EPMD is the most sampled group in hip - hop for good reason :
Their production is a thing of beauty .
Combine that with Erick and P's laid - back rhymes and you get strictly dopeness .
21 of 100 Afrika Bambaataa : ' Looking for the Perfect Beat ' Tommy Boy Records Afrika Bambaataa was a trailblazer , an innovator of the hip - hop aesthetic .
" Looking for the Perfect Beat " is a good place to start if you 're seeking to familiarize yourself with his most significant works , including " Planet Rock " and " Unity Pt. 1 , " a collaboration James Brown .
20 of 100 Main Source : ' Breaking Atoms ' Wild Pitch Records
The sample - heavy " Breaking Atoms " was one of the most influential albums ever , in that it helped launch the careers of Nas , Akinyele , and others .
It also inspired a production technique that 's still widely emulated .
19 of 100 Common : ' Resurrection ' Relativity Records 1994 was a flagship year for hip - hop , with " Illmatic " and " Ready to Die " arriving .
Yet Chicago rapper Common ( then known as Common Sense ) still managed to stand out with his smart , jazz - tinged sophomore LP , " Resurrection . "
18 of 100 Cypress Hill : ' Cypress Hill ' Columbia Records
Aside from being the first popular Latino rap group , Cypress Hill also did a respectable job of bridging the gap between rock and hip - hop on its self - titled debut album .
Highlights include " How I Could Just Kill a Man " and " The Phunkcy Feel One . "
17 of 100 Snoop Doggy Dogg : ' Doggystyle ' Death Row Records " Doggystyle " kicked the door wide for many West Coast emcees .
Dr. Dre 's finesse aside , Snoop 's piquant delivery and melodic flow were equally crucial to the success of " Doggystyle . "
16 of 100 Fugees : ' The Score ' Columbia Records Fugees ' second album , " The Score , " was so remarkable that most fans forgot about the less memorable debut .
Truth be told , " The Score " was a huge improvement over the lackluster " Blunted on Reality . "
15 of 100 Beastie Boys : ' Licensed to Ill ' Def Jam
There are two stars on " Licensed to Ill , " and both deserve equal credit .
Rick Rubin , the true pioneer of rap rock , is the one pulling the musical puppet strings on this thing .
But the album would be nothing without the Beasties destroying every track with their unbridled passion .
14 of 100 Boogie Down Productions : ' Criminal Minded ' B - Boy Records KRS - One was the dreaded poet , Scott La Rock the musical visionary .
Together they cooked up an album that shook up the landscape of hip - hop .
" Criminal Minded " should be studied in college .
13 of 100 OutKast : ' Aquemini ' LaFace Records " Aquemini " is evidence of just how often Boi and Dre loved to reinvent their sound .
They abandoned everything that had worked in the past and went straight for harmonica , acoustic guitar , and even a tinny splice of electro .
12 of 100 Ice Cube : ' Death Certificate ' Priority Records Cube 's debut , " AmeriKKKa 's Most Wanted , " was outstanding , but his follow - up was even better and more venomous than the first .
The thing is named " Death Certificate , " after all .
The album 's " Death " side presented an image of the present , while the " Life " side offered a vision of the future .
11 of 100 Jay - Z : ' Reasonable Doubt ' Roc - A - Fella Before " Reasonable Doubt , " mafioso rap lacked nuance .
Jay studied his peers and perfected their template , bringing a vulnerable side that personified the usual street characters .
The outcome was an album that served both as an honest narrative of the ills of street life and an unrepentant defense of it .
10 of 100 2 Pac : ' Me Against the World ' Interscope " Me Against the World " is 2 P ac at his best .
No thug core tracks , no name - inscribed missiles aimed at East Coast rappers .
Simply Pac at his most poignant and most defiant , the duality in all its brilliance .
09 of 100 A Tribe Called Quest : ' The Low End Theory ' Jive Records " The Low End Theory " is Tribe at its best .
Ali Shaheed , Q - Tip , and Phife Dawg became one of the greatest rap groups of all time by trafficking in smart lyrics drizzled over smooth , jazz - rap layers .
08 of 100 N.W.A. : ' Straight Outta Compton ' Priority Records Eazy , Dre , Cube , and the rest of 'em had to fight for their right to party .
No one — not even the alphabet people — could stop them from publicly , viciously and explicitly indicting the powers that be .
It 's a true West Coast masterpiece .
07 of 100 Dr. Dre : ' The Chronic ' Death Row Records 1991 produced many great albums : Pete Rock & CL Smooth 's " Mecca and the Soul Brother , " Pharcyde 's " Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde , " and Diamond D's " Stunts , Blunts & Hip - Hop . "
But it was Dr. Dre 's " The Chronic " that towered over hip - hop that year and for many years to come .
Dre 's G - funk basslines , bolstered generously by Snoop 's slick flow , announced the new name running the game .
06 of 100 Wu - Tang Clan : ' Enter the Wu - Tang ( 36 Chambers ) ' Loud Records " 36 Chambers " is one of the greatest debuts hip - hop has ever seen .
The 12 - song spectacle barely gave the nine original swordsmen enough room to stretch out their eccentricities .
Highlights include " C.R.E.A.M. , " " Protect Ya Neck , " and the pragmatic life hack " Wu - Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F** k' Wit . "
05 of 100 Raekwon : ' Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ...'
Loud Records " Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... " is a journey through the thrills , the violence , and the rote regimen that constitute a New York drug kingpin 's life .
It 's a crime - rap manifesto that shaped the course of mafioso rap throughout the '90s .
04 of 100 Eric B. & Rakim : ' Paid in Full ' Island Records
While his peers bragged about the size of their manhood , Rakim styled on them with peculiar precision .
The man loves painting pictures with words , and " Paid in Full " is his ultimate canvas .
03 of 100 Public Enemy : ' It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back ' Def Jam Public Enemy challenged everything that posed an obstacle to the oppressed : racism , injustice , crooked cops , profiling , everything .
P.E. 's second album is an undeniable hip - hop classic .
02 of 100 The Notorious B.I.G. : ' Ready to Die ' Big Beat Records Biggie 's ability to coolly captivate an audience with his storytelling chops , capture a difficult emotion ( e.g. , suicidal thoughts ) , or mine comedy from the most serious of subjects ( e.g. , robbery ) are skills rarely seen in the same package .
Biggie Smalls is the illest .
Superman , Batman , and Max Mercury have all been cited as giving comic - book speedster Bart Allen the name Impulse .
Batman most famously in Impulse # 50 , and Superman in the previews for All - Flash # 1 .
( The final lettering simply said “ He was code - named Impulse , ” sidestepping the issue ) .
But who named him originally ?
The name first appears on the cover of Flash # 93 ( August 1994 ) , with an out - of - control Bart Allen fighting the Flash .
The cover is captioned , “ Brash Impulse ! ”
Over the next few issues , Wally West ’s inner monologue refers to Bart as being impulsive , or ( at one point ) as “ Mr. Impulse . ”
It first appears on - panel as a name in Zero Hour # 3 ( September 1994 ) , when Bart meets Superman for the first time , but Bart introduces himself as Impulse .
Dan Jurgens writes .
Superman arrives in Keystone to see Velociraptors chasing Bart .
Superman : Dinosaurs from the merging timelines !
Need a hand , kid ?
Bart : Call me Kid Flash — and get your big “ S ” handed to you !
The name ’s Impulse !
After the events of Zero Hour , the name is explained in Flash v.2 # 95 ( November 1994 ) , written by Mark Waid .
Wally and Bart are running through the city .
Wally :
If we ’re going to do this hero thing , let ’s do it right .
You need a code name .
Bart : How about “ Kid Flash ? ”
Wally : Huh , well …
Bart : Pfffft !
Just kidding .
“ Kid Flash . ”
Yeah , right … .
Save yourself the brainpower .
You already gave me a name .
Repeatedly .
Bart stops and kisses a random woman on the street ( yes , Bart ) .
Bart : I ’m Impulse !
Wally :
How terrifyingly accurate .
And the mask ?
Bart :
Are you kiddin’ me ?
I saw so many guys wearing ’em , I just figured it was a law .
Fast forward several years .
( Thanks to Crazy Penguin for pointing this one out and scanning it ) Secret Origins 80 - Page Giant ( December 1998 ) tells the origins of the members of Young Justice .
In the Mark Waid–written Impulse story , the following exchange appears :
Carol :
So who named you Impulse ?
Bart : Batman .
I have no idea why .
Was he being funny ?
Eight months later , Todd Dezago had just taken over as the third regular writer on Impulse .
He started out with an unusual team - up in Impulse # 50 ( July 1999 ) : Impulse and Batman against the Joker .
At the end of the issue , Impulse asks Batman a question :
Impulse : Wally said that you named me “ Impulse ” … what ’s up with that ?!
Batman : Wally misunderstood .
I never meant for Impulse to be your name … .
It was meant to be a warning .
Oddly enough , I do n’t recall much complaining about the retcon .
Jump forward another half - decade , to the beginning of Bart ’s brief career as the Flash .
Danny Bilson and Paul Demeo have just taken over as series writers .
A dream / origin sequence in Flash : The Fastest Man Alive # 2 ( September 2006 ) states , “ It was Max who first dubbed me ‘ Impulse . ' ”
Fans across the Internet raged at this retcon , even asking about it at conventions , complaining about the “ poor research . ”
A year later , a 6 - page preview of All - Flash # 1 ( September 2007 ) has Mark Waid back as writer .
In it , Wally West thinks back on Bart ’s life :
“ The boy was flaky , unpredictable , and had the attention span of a bullet .
Superman code - named him Impulse , and it was probably the first thing that ever stuck to him . ”
The funny thing is , all that fans seemed to remember at the time about Impulse ’s naming was Batman .
Not the name he chose himself .
Countdown # 43 reiterates the Batman version as Robin speaks at Bart ’s funeral : “ I remember it was Batman who first called him Impulse … and for a while , the name stuck .
I never thought he ’d take things seriously enough to be the Flash . ”
Finally , in the published art for All - Flash # 1 , the wording has been altered from what was in the preview .
It now simply says , “ He was code - named Impulse , ” rather than “ Superman code - named him Impulse , ” side - stepping the question entirely .
So in the final tally , we have 3 votes for Batman , 1 for Bart himself , and 1 for Max .
Part of me ( the part that spent two years as an English Literature major ) still thinks I should have titled this , “ Today we Have Namings of Bart , ” but I ’m not sure how many people would get the reference .

( CNN ) --
It was unlike Stephany Flores Ramirez not to come home on time .
An avid poker player , the Peruvian 21 - year - old lived with her father and knew he was expecting her after a night at a Texas Hold 'em tournament on May 30 in Lima .
" My father called me and said Stephany did n't come home , help me , " Stephany 's older brother Enrique Flores told CNN on Sunday .
" So I went to the house and we started calling all the numbers of my sister 's friends that I had and we called the police . "
Eventually , authorities found surveillance video of the young woman at the hotel where the tournament was held .
They found footage of Joran van der Sloot sitting next to Stephany , he said .
" At first , it was a relief because I saw her and that gave me hope , " Enrique Flores said .
" The people at the hotel told us , ' Yeah , she was with this guy .
He seemed nice .
He looked like Brad Pitt . ' "
Van der Sloot is widely known as a suspect in the high - profile 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba .
The Dutch 22 - year - old has repeatedly denied involvement in that case .
He has twice been arrested and released but has not been charged .
Late Monday , Peruvian government authorities said Van der Sloot confessed to Flores ' murder .
He will likely be held at one of three maximum security prisons -- Castro Castro , Piedras Gordas and Lurigancho , authorities said .
Flores ' battered body was found last week in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot .
Hotel videotape clearly shows the two entering a room together May 30 at 5:16 a.m. local time .
Three hours and 20 minutes later , he left the hotel by himself carrying a backpack , telling the hotel staff not to bother " his girl , " police said .
The Flores family is well known in Peru .
Patriarch Ricardo Flores is a politically connected former race car driver .
The four Flores sons , including Enrique Flores , run a successful event - planning business .
After police showed Enrique and his father the surveillance tape , they again began trying to find out more from people at the hotel , and obtained information about the man on the tape .
" They gave us his social security number and his name , " the brother told CNN .
" We came back home and searched his name on the Internet .
I can not tell you the shock we felt . "
" My wife typed ' Joran van der Sloot ' into Google and started screaming for me to see , " Enrique Flores told CNN on Sunday .
" I could n't believe it .
How could it be that guy ? "
" All I have been doing is reading about Natalee Holloway and what her family has gone through , " Flores said .
Stephany Flores was a trusting young woman , her family said .
" My sister is very friendly ... always smiling , always nice to everyone , " said Enrique Flores .
" I think about how she felt with him , that she probably did not think ... and it is ... so hard to think about that . "
" My sister was the only girl in our house , the queen of our family , " he continued .
" What she wanted , she got .
She loved to play soccer " and would organize matches with her friends in the family 's backyard .
She was in her third year studying business administration at University of Lima , and ran the merchandising arm of the family entertainment and event - promotion business , Enrique Flores said .
" She had a lot of friends , " he said .
" A lot of people are crying . "
About an hour after Enrique Flores found out who the man on the videotape was , police called to say they had found his sister 's body .
Investigators believe a tennis racquet found in the room was used in the killing , said Carlos Gonzalo , a spokesman for Peru 's Interior Ministry .
When authorities knew who they were looking for , they found van der Sloot traveling alone in a taxi in Chile .
Authorities said he had bloody clothes with him .
He was taken into custody and transported to Peru where he remains jailed .
Before van der Sloot 's confession Monday night , a Peruvian judge extended for another week the investigation into the killing , and the Dutch suspect was to remain jailed in Lima , Gonzalo said .
In Alabama on Thursday , the FBI announced van der Sloot is being charged in the United States for allegedly trying to extort $ 250,000 from someone related to the Holloway case .
Van der Sloot allegedly promised to disclose the location of Holloway 's body .
In the hours after his sister 's wake , Enrique Flores is gripped with grief , sadness and determination .
He can not stand to talk for long about his sister until his voice cracks and he asks if the interview can please end .
One sentence , though , before it does .
" We just want justice , " he said .
CNN 's Rafael Romo contributed to this report .
Bob Herbert explains that NY governor David Paterson is being pressured by NYC officials including Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to veto a law that would ban the NYC police from maintaining a database of the personal data of those stopped by police for questioning for any or no reason whatsoever .
Herbert says it ’s an easy call — do n’t do it Dave ! — but the data he uses to back up his argument is downright damning :
Allowing the police to continue accumulating these permanent files on the innocent , an abomination in and of itself , would also encourage the cops to continue their Jim Crow stop - and - frisk policy , which has led to the systematic harassment and humiliation of young black and Latino residents who have done absolutely nothing wrong .
This racist policy needs to stop — and stop now .
As Al Baker reported in The Times two months ago , black and Latino New Yorkers were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped by the police in 2009 .
But once stopped , they were no more likely than whites to actually be arrested .
An overwhelming majority of the people stopped , questioned and searched by the police are innocent of any wrongdoing and are sent on their way after the encounter .
This illegal and inhumane policy has gotten completely out of control .
From 2004 through 2009 , police officers stopped people on the street and checked them out nearly three million times , an astounding figure .
Nearly 90 percent were completely innocent , minding their own business .
Here ’s Baker ’s story detailing the data .
Recently I quoted Douglas A. Blackmon , author the Pulitzer prize winning book Slavery by Another Name – The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II .
Blackmon documented how the legal system in the South was systematically used to coerce tens of thousands of Black men into brutal forced labor ( what Blackmon calls “ neoslavery ” ) .
I quoted him to illustrate why blacks in the South might not trust the legal system .
Blacks in the South ?
Herbert ’s characterization of a “ Jim Crow stop - and - frisk policy ” is dead - on , but he ’s not talking about the South :
That most New Yorkers do not seem to care about the way young black and Latino New Yorkers are treated by the police does not make that treatment any less noxious or vile .
Stopping and searching people without good reason is unconstitutional .
Apparently the constitution - carrying originalists are unconcerned about this clear violation .
The legislation allows the police department to keep the data it has already compiled but would stop them from adding informationthat would identify people who have done nothing wrong .
It would not end the department ’s stop - and - frisk policy .
It ’s a paltry , but necessary , first step to righting a horrible wrong .
Stop , Karl , you 're killin' me .
I mean it .
This stuff is hilarious .
Your latest column in The Wall Street Journal is a masterpiece of postmodern satire .
You make Swift look slow .
You make Twain look plain .
You make Colbert and Stewart look like Huntley and Brinkley .
In case you missed it , The Architect 's latest missive excoriates the fiscal irresponsibility of the Bush era through the satirical device of pretending to call Barack Obama fiscally reckless .
He quotes a 16 - month - old speech by a European leader ( Get it ?
Rove citing a Eurocrat with approval .
Oh , it is savagely self - hating . ) saying Obama is on the road to " fiscal hell . "
In a sentence whose every syllable is pregnant with irony — mordant , burlesque , self - flagellation — Rove writes : " Deficit spending did not begin when Mr. Obama took office . "
No shit , Sherlock .
Karl Rove lecturing Barack Obama about fiscal responsibility is like Lizzy Borden campaigning against elder abuse .
It must be satire .
Even Mr. Rove is not so intellectually dishonest , so brazenly hypocritical as to accuse anyone else of fiscal imprudence .
Do I really need to repeat the indictment ?
Oh , OK :
When President Clinton took office , the federal budget deficit was $ 290 billion — the largest deficit in American history .
In January 1993 , the Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit would grow to $ 513 billion by 2001 .
Instead , President Clinton and Democratic economic policies balanced the budget .
Clinton and his Democratic allies — ( not one Republican voted for the Clinton economic plan in 1993 ) — turned the projected $ 513 billion deficit into a $ 281 billion surplus .
We lifted 7 million people — including 4 million children — out of poverty and up into the middle class , producing the lowest poverty rate in a quarter - century .
We created 22.5 million private - sector jobs , lifted the wages of working people and left Social Security with a projected $ 2.49 trillion surplus .
Democratic economic policies under Clinton reduced the federal civilian payroll by 377,000 employees — the lowest level since the Kennedy administration .
Under Clinton , federal spending as a percentage of GDP dropped from 22.2 percent to just 18.5 percent — the lowest level since 1966 .
Had we simply continued Clintonomics , we would have paid off the national debt .
Not the annual deficit — we 'd already eliminated that — but the entire national debt , in 2009 .
For the first time since Andrew Jackson ( a Democrat , too , by the way ) was president , in 1833 .
But now President Obama struggles mightily with staggering deficits — at a time when our economy is teetering on the brink of a double - dip recession .
Something must have happened .
Hmm ...
What could it have been ?
What fiscal disaster intervened between Presidents Clinton and Obama ?
Oh , right .
I remember : The worst presidency of my lifetime .
Or my father 's lifetime .
Or my late grandfather 's lifetime ( and he fought in World War I ) .
Bush and Rove inherited the largest surplus in history .
And they squandered it .
Which surprised even me .
I thought if Bush would be good at anything it would be inheriting things .
It takes something special for the Architect of the Bush presidency , which caused the greatest fiscal reversal in American history , to accuse anyone else of profligacy .
In Texas , we call it chutzpah .
Others might say rank hypocrisy .
But it 's more than that .
Mr. Rove , like so many Republicans , is a fiscal sociopath .
Either that or the greatest parody artist of our time .
So let 's reach into our bag of metaphors in what I fear will be a vain attempt to put Karl 's column into context .
Karl Rove lecturing Barack Obama about fiscal responsibility is like what ?

If you 're on Windows , need to use OS X , but do n't want to buy or build a new computer , reader Bobby Patton shows us how to run Snow Leopard in a virtual machine on Windows with just a few tweaks .
UPDATE : This guide is now out of date .
If you want to run OS X inside VirtualBox on Windows , check out our new guide here .

We 've shown you how to install Snow Leopard in VMWare , but if you have n't purchased VMWare , you can now do it using previously mentioned , free program VirtualBox .
Apart from VirtualBox , you 'll also need an OSX86 ISO .
The group Hazard has put out a good patched Snow Leopard installer that should do fine ( just search for it on Google ) .
Of course , if you feel bad about downloading the ISO of Snow Leopard , you could always go buy a copy to feel a bit better , karmically .

After you have them both , install Virtualbox .
Open up Virtualbox and click on New at the top left .
At the Create New Virtual Machine window , click Next .
At this window type OSX as the name and it will automatically change the system and version .
The next window will let you choose your RAM amount :
If you can spare it , crank it up as far as you can go , but 1024 MB should be sufficient .

This is where you 'll make your hard disk .
20 GB should be enough so what it comes down to is dynamic or static .
Dynamic will expand on use and Static will be a fixed 20 GB no matter how much data is actually in it .
Dynamic is better for not taking up your hard drive but static should give you better performance .
I normally use dynamic .
Click next unless you want to change it from dynamic or if you want to increase the disk size or file location .
It will show a summary of your settings .
Click Finish , then click Settings at the top .
At this window click on System in the left pane and uncheck Enable EFI .

Now click on the Storage button on the left .
From there click on Empty under the OSX.vdi , then click the folder with the green arrow on the right ( next to " CD / DVD Device " ) .
At this window click the Add button at the top .
Then find and add the OSX86 ISO you downloaded earlier .
Then highlight it and click Select at the bottom .
Then click OK , and hit the Start button on the left side of the main VirtualBox window .

As it starts up , click inside the window and hit F8 .
Then at the boot : prompt type –v so you can see what exactly went wrong if something does go wrong .
All the services will run and eventually you should come to the language screen .
Choose your language then click next .
If you are unable to move your mouse around then hit Right - Ctrl + I. Click Continue and Agree .
Next , start up Disk Utility by going to Utilities in the menu bar .
At this screen highlight 20 GB VBOX HARDDISK .
Then click the Erase tab , name it what you want in the name box and click the Erase button on the bottom right of the window .
It should n't take long .
Then click Disk Utility in your menu bar and quit it .
Now you 're back at the installer .
Highlight the drive that is now showing up and click Continue .

Then go to Machine > Reset and click Reset at the prompt .
Next you 'll see the Chameleon loader and then OS X will begin to boot .

After it boots you will see the setup screens for OS X !
You 're good to go .
The only hiccup I 've found is that it can only be virtualized with one core .
It could be the OSX disc I was using or it might not be .
And I have yet to find the right kext that will allow audio to work and the resolution is limited also .
But other than that you 'll have a fully functioning OSX virtualized !
Update : I 'd like to post some answers to the resolution and audio .
I should have looked around before posting this but I just did n't have the time .
So anyways heres what you can do :
To fix the resolution issue , open Finder and go to the OS X drive on the left .
Open the folder called Extras .
Right Click on the file com .
Apple .
Boot.plist and open it with TextEdit .
Under the first insert this :
Graphics Mode < br /> 1280x1024x32
or another compatible resolution .
Select " Save As " at the top and save it to the desktop , unchecking the check under Unicode and then save it as com.apple.boot.
plist .
After that drag and drop it into the extras folder and overwrite the original file , entering your password when prompted .

Instructions for the sound issue can be found here .
Do n't install system updates .
If you want updates you 'll have to install another iso distribution with the updates on it .
If you install the updates directly from apple it messes with the custom kexts and chameleon .
Just a forewarning .
Advertisement
And for those of you getting boot issues try choosing a different version of Chameleon or a different kernel .
Sometimes that seems to help .
And If your getting one of the USB errors then try disabling USB in the VirtualBox settings and see if that helps .

More than three - quarters of all alcohol sold in Scotland costs less than 50 p a unit
Scottish adults buy a quarter more alcohol than the rest of Britain , according to an NHS study .
The extra intake equated to about two more pints of beer or two glasses of wine a week , compared to other Britons .
A second NHS report examining off - trade sales and the link between price and over - consumption , found 77 % of drink was sold at less than 50 p a unit .
The Scottish government is proposing a minimum price per unit in legislation being considered by the parliament .
The NHS Health Scotland report examined alcohol sales between 2005 and 2009 .
It found that Scots have a preference for drinking at home - with one factor being that alcohol sold in off - licences and supermarkets is three times cheaper per unit than that sold in pubs .
Alcohol sales in the off - trade were double those of licensed premises , accounting for 68 % of all Scottish drink sales and retailing at around 43 p per unit .
Drink sold in pubs and restaurants was charged at £ 1.31 per unit and accounted for 32 % of all alcohol sales north of the border .
These reports confirm what we already know - Scotland has a drink problem Nanette Milne MSP , Scots Tory health spokeswoman
NHS Health Scotland 's director of public health science , Dr Laurence Gruer , said raising the price of alcohol in shops and supermarkets would help address the problem of over - consumption .
The second NHS report looked at off - trade sales and the correlation between price and over - consumption .
It revealed that a man only had to spend £ 4.40 on cider to exceed the government 's recommended weekly limit of 21 units .
A woman had to spend just £ 3 to exceed their recommended 14 units .
Researchers found that 77 % of all drink was sold at less than 50 p a unit , 51 % at 40 p or less and 16 % at 30 p or less .
' Harmful amounts '
There were also variations in the price per unit according to the type of beverage , with 59 % of vodka selling at less than 35 p per unit , and 26 % of cider for less than 20 p per unit .
We are clear that selling alcohol at below cost prices must end Ross Finne MSP , Scots Lib Dem health spokesman
Dr Gruer said : " We know there are strong links between lower price and increased consumption - and between increased consumption and more alcohol - related problems of all sorts .
" In recent years , alcohol from off - sales has become relatively cheaper , encouraging many more people to drink harmful amounts . "
He said the findings underlined the need for action on cheap off - sales alcohol in Scotland .
" It 's by no means the only action needed , but the research shows clearly that nothing else is as effective as raising the price of alcohol , " he added .
The Scottish government has not yet detailed the price per unit it would introduce under its plans , which are supported by the BMA in Scotland .
However , the measure has been rejected by Labour and Conservative MSPs .
' Not the answer '
Richard Simpson , Scottish Labour 's public health spokesman , said : " We support the end of heavy discounting and irresponsible sales of alcohol as loss leaders , but minimum unit pricing is not the answer .
" It would put more than £ 113 m into the pockets of big retailers instead tackling the causes and effects of alcohol misuse . "
He said all parties had to work together to find " credible alternatives " .
The Scottish Conservative public health spokeswoman , Nanette Milne , said : " These reports confirm what we already know - Scotland has a drink problem and urgent , effective action is required to tackle it .
" But indiscriminate blanket minimum pricing has no evidence base , would penalise responsible drinkers , harm the Scotch whisky industry , cost jobs and is probably illegal . "
She said her party believed the tax and duty system had a major part to play in increasing the price of " problem drinks " .
The Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman , Ross Finnie , said : " We are clear that selling alcohol at below cost prices must end . "
War - Film ` Hero' Is A Rapist
by Megan Turner , New York Post , 18 Dec 2001
December 18 , 2001 --
The Army pressured the filmmakers of Black Hawk Down to change the name of the war hero portrayed by Ewan McGregor -- because the real - life soldier is serving a 30 - year prison term for rape and child molestation , says the man who wrote the book that spawned the movie .
In Ridley Scott 's highly anticipated movie , McGregor plays Ranger John Grimes , a desk jockey who is called into battle during the botched Army operation in Somalia in 1993 .
The character is based on real - life Ranger John " Stebby " Stebbins , but Pentagon officials asked his name be changed in an attempt to keep his shame a secret , claims author Mark Bowden , who also penned the original screenplay for the movie .
Stebbins ' embittered ex-wife , Nora Stebbins , complained in an e-mail to The Post : " They are going to make millions off this film in which my ex-husband is portrayed as an All - American hero when the truth is he is not . "
Army sources confirmed to The Post that Stebbins -- who was awarded the Silver Star , one of America 's highest honors , for his bravery in the bloody Battle of Mogadishu -- was court - martialed and sentenced on June 8 , 2000 .
Janet Wray , a spokeswoman for Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas , confirmed yesterday : " We have a John Stebbins here .
He arrived on June 9 last year and is serving a 30 - year sentence for sodomy with a child under 12 and rape . "
Black Hawk Down , the Jerry Bruckheimer - produced movie which opens Dec. 28 , is based on Bowden 's best - selling book of the same name .
In the book , Bowden refers to Stebbins by his real name and says he surprised everyone with his heroics .
" He was a changed man , a wild animal , dancing around , shooting like a madman , " wrote Bowden , who also penned the original draft of the screenplay .
But Stebbins will not get to see McGregor 's portrayal of him in the $ 95 million film , which was filmed in Kenitra , Morocco , in March this year .
" As it happened , Stebbins got in trouble with the law , " Bowden was quoted as saying recently .
" The Army asked us to change the name . "
A Revolution Studios spokeswoman would say only that the name - change was " a creative decision made by the producers . "
" There were 100 men in the battle and only 40 speaking parts , so we had to condense some of the characters , " she said .
" [ Grimes ] is one who is a compilation of a number of soldiers who fought in that battle so his name was changed . "
Stebbins , 36 , a former baker from upstate Ithaca , had tried and failed to join the Army three times during the Persian Gulf War and finally made it into the crack Rangers unit , Bowden 's book says .
But he worked as a company clerk , and was ribbed by his fellow soldiers as " chief coffee maker " and " paper pusher . "

It ’s always good to hear about BitTorrent trackers teaming up instead of having online flame wars and hostility towards one another .
BTN and TehConnection ( TC ) are two latest private trackers to enter such partnership deal – this was officially announced on both sites roughly 6 hours ago ( at time of this post ) .
BTN is a feature rich tracker for TV shows and TehConnection is an equally good resource for downloading movie torrents .
The said partnership is primarily based on invites to each site being offered on the other .
Ultimately , it ’s a win - win situation for users of both trackers - if you have an account on one of these sites , getting into the other just became a whole lot easier .
Both BTN and TehConnection are closed for public signup and the only way into either one of these sites right now is through recruitment partnerships such as the one just announced .
TehConnection
TehConnection , a project started by the crew behind SceneTorrents ( ScT ) was launched to the public back in 2008 .
It ’s a specialized movie tracker which allows its members to download a ton of movies both old and new ( in SD / HD formats ) , at pretty good download speeds .
Based on a customized version of What .
CD ’s Gazelle codebase , TC sports an elegant look and feel which is a pleasure to navigate .
During it ’s early days , TC did open signups to the public several times but later this was limited to invites being offered through their IRC channel .
Now , even the invites channel has been closed down and the only way you can become a member is through recruitment threads on other trackers such as What .
CD , StB and BTN ( unless you know someone who can invite you ) .
If you are an existing member on any one of these trackers , obtaining a TehConnection invite could just be a PM away .
The announcement on BTN is quoted below :
We believe that relationships with other trackers is always a good thing , so we have partnered with TehConnection to help our communities grow !
TC is one of the best , if not the best , film sites in the torrenting world .
Going with quality over quantity , they have a great selection of high quality movies for everyone to enjoy .
Boasting an epic site design and code , great selection of movies and awesome community , I 'm sure any movie lover would enjoy this site !
That said , if you want to get in over there , its easy ; send a PM to ONE of these users
[ List of usernames ]
Make sure you give it at least a day or two to get a response , these guys are busy running a tracker so spare time is n't always easy to come by .
Beware , if you do n't put your email in the PM , your PM will be ignored !
Tehconnection currently tracks over 13600 active torrents .
There are 10500 + movies indexed which involve over 200000 + actors , 6500 + directors and 13000 + writers .
The site ’s active user base as at 10/7/2010 was 11500 .
For more information on TC please read this post .
BTN
BTN , a much younger tracker than TehConnection , started off its operations in early 2010 .
The site was an instant hit among the BitTorrent community thanks to it ’s impressive set of features and it ’s ‘ ratio free ’ download system .
Based on a heavily customized version of Gazelle codebase , BTN made discovering and downloading TV shows a pleasure with it ’s great design .
The site constantly kept improving and is now packed with seedbox hosted torrents , autouploader bots and great organizational features such as separate pages for each TV series .
( for detailed list of features including a comparison between leading TV trackers , read our full BTN review here ) .
Ever since its inception , BTN has never had an open signup and registration was only possible through invite applications or IRC invites ( both of which have now closed ) .
However if you are an existing Tehconnection member , you now have the chance to join BTN just by sending a PM to one of the BTN reps on TC .
The announcement on TehConnection is as follows :
In the past we had a partnership with What.cd , invites to each site being offered by the other .
That line is still intact , and now we offer another line : BTN !
BTN is a ratio - free TV tracker running on a well customized Gazelle base .
Lots of good content , good pretimes and good speeds , this tracker is the up and coming rookie to keep your eye on .
That said , if you want to get in over there , its easy ; send a PM to ONE of these users :
[ List of usernames ]
If you do not include your email , your PM will be ignored !
Make sure you give it at least a day or two to get a response , these guys are busy running a tracker so spare time is n't always easy to come by .
BTN currently tracks over 13300 active torrents .
This includes ~ 8000 different TV shows and 2500 + TV series .
The site ’s active user base hovers somewhere around 5000 .

Here 's how we make money
I want to be a smarter investor .
In my continued effort to be a more intelligent investor and to know more about investing outside of the 401K , I ’m tackling the subject of exchange traded funds ( more commonly referred to by their acronym , ETFs ) .
Most novice investors have heard of stocks and mutual funds ( a combination of stocks ) .
Some may even be familiar with index funds , the mutual fund that mirrors a stock market index .
But ETFs are still a mystery to most .
This makes sense too because most people never get beyond investing within their 401K .
So if you ’re thinking of opening a Roth IRA , you should definitely consider learning about ETFs .
Exchange Traded Funds ( Definition )
Generally speaking , ETFs are a group of investments put together and usually tied to an index ( like index funds ) that you can buy shares in and trade like stocks .
So basically , you get the diversification that comes with grouped investments , the low - cost that comes with “ passive ” funds , and the flexibility of someone trading in stocks .
ETFs have been around since the early nineties , but came on strong in the last 10 years .
I suspect the creation of the Roth IRA had much to do with this growth .
Exactly how ETFs are different from mutual funds from a composition ( how they ’re put together ) stand point is a bit over my head .
If you want further reading on these exact differences , I suggest you read Investopedia ’s explanation of how ETFs are constructed .
List of Popular Exchange Traded Funds
There are almost a thousand ETFs available now .
There were only 2 in 1997 .
Crazy .
Some of the more popular funds are some of the older , broad - based funds .
And this makes sense because people typically invest in what they understand .
Here are the top ten ETFs based on volume :
SPY – SPDR S&P 500
XLF – Financial Select Sector SPDR6
QQQQ – PowerShares QQQ
EEM – iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index
IWM – iShares Russell 2000 Index
FAS – Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares
FAZ – Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares
SDS – ProShares UltraShort S&P500
TZA – Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares
FXI – iShares FTSE / Xinhua China 25 Index
In addition to these broad funds , you can invest in commodity ETFs ( i.e. Copper ETF ) , small - sector ETFs , foreign ETFs , etc .
Not all ETFs are created equal .
Some are more actively managed and thus , more expensive .
ETF Trading
You can purchase shares in ETFs at one of the discount online stock brokers or at a mutual fund company like Vanguard .
Keep in mind that at a place like Vanguard you ’ll have to commit several thousand to a brokerage account before you can participate .
Also , keep in mind that not all firms charge a commission for trading ETFs .
So be sure to compare trading costs .
ETFs vs Index Funds
For the long - term investor looking for diversified , low - cost investments , the ETF makes a lot of sense versus the normal mutual fund .
However , when you compare ETFs with index funds , it gets a little harder to choose .
At the end of the day , it ’s not going to matter a great deal which route you choose .
They are both great products , generally speaking .
But just for comparisons sake , keep in mind these factors :
ETFs can be traded like a stock .
ETFs usually require you to pay a broker commission .
ETFs usually do n’t allow for an automatic investing plan .
ETFs come in many more varieties .
ETFs have fewer “ internal ” expenses .
ETFs can help you avoid capital gains taxes in taxable accounts .
ETFs can usually be purchased in smaller amounts .
Noting those points , I ’d say that an ETF is for someone who is into low - cost , active , taxable investing , OR the beginning low - cost , tax - deferred investor who does n’t have a lot to invest .
What do you think ?
Do you invest with ETFs ?
Why ?
It has long been the stuff of drug - trafficking legend , but federal authorities announced on Saturday that they have helped seize the first known and fully operational submarine built by drug traffickers to smuggle tons of cocaine from South America toward the United States .
The diesel - electric powered submarine was captured in an Ecuadorian jungle waterway leading to the Pacific Ocean , according to the Drug Enforcement Administration .
The sub , which is about 100 feet long and equipped with a periscope , was seized before its maiden voyage by Ecuadorian authorities armed with DEA intelligence .
The discovery is seen by authorities as a game - changer in terms of the challenge it poses not only to fighting drugs but to national security as well .
" The submarine 's nautical range , payload capacity , and quantum leap in stealth have raised the stakes for the counter - drug forces and the national security community alike , " said DEA Andean Regional Director Jay Bergman .
It is unclear how far the camouflage - painted submarine could have traveled , but it is believed to be sophisticated enough to cover thousands of miles — and certainly to make it to the North American coast .
" There is a sense of urgency for naval engineers and submariners to take a look at this thing and dissect it and take it apart and figure out what its real capabilities were , " Bergman said .
" The police have seized this structure , but the people that need to get on there are naval engineers . "
Bergman noted that traffickers have used speed boats , sail boats , fishing boats and specialized craft that float low in the water , but this is the first true submarine discovered .
" Now that the Loch Ness Monster has been found , the interdiction community is going to retool their search patterns and how they conduct business , " he said .
Back in 2000 in a Bogota , Colombia , warehouse authorities thought they 'd found the first ever narco submarine , but it turned out to be an enclosed boat that floated low in the water , rather than completely under the surface .
The final frontier
The submarine seized in Ecuador was built in what was described as a clandestine dry dock of industrial proportions and even had housing for dozens of workers .
It marks what could be argued as the final frontier for traffickers who have squared off against law enforcement on the land , in the air and on the sea , and now look to go beneath the waves to reach lucrative drug markets .
" There is no place else they can go in terms of maritime , " Bergman said .
" The traffickers have now exhausted every possibility . "
Among the questions is who could have designed such a sophisticated machine , as well as piloted it .
But the biggest issue haunting federal agents is this :
How many more might be out there ?
" The DEA is very good , " Bergman said , " but what are the odds of us detecting the first one ever built before it got underway ?
I 'd say this is the first one we caught . "
Larry Karson , a retired Customs Service agent who is a criminal justice lecturer at the University of Houston Downtown , said the DEA very well could have found the only real narco sub .
Hard to hide
He noted that it is n't easy to keep a dry dock covert , let alone all the people involved .
" It is feasible , " said Karson , who noted that for years authorities have heard rumors of drug traffickers getting a submarine .
But most figured traffickers would most likely buy a used one , not make their own .
" I think everybody has been looking for it , it has been a matter of time , " he said .
" There was a rumor somebody would find a used one on the market .
We 've been using them since the Civil War . "
He noted that the former Navy P - 3s that now are used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to search for sea and airborne traffickers sneaking loads toward the United States might have to revert to their old submarine hunting mission .
Finding the sub comes as part of a long - term cat and mouse game in which authorities have combed jungles and flown over thousands of miles of open ocean each week in an attempt to deny traffickers easy access to their U.S. markets .
As Bergman put it : " This is the final frontier for the maritime drug traffickers .
We remained completely incredulous until the last minute . "
" Good cops never underestimate their enemy or the ingenuity of the adversary , " he said .
" But seeing is believing and that is what this day is . "

July 12 , 2010  --
Bucking a national trend toward more tolerance for firearms , Chicago today begins enforcing the toughest gun law in the nation -- and it 's already under fire .
Two lawsuits have already been filed against the ordinance , which bans gun shops in the city and limits permit holders to one ready - to - fire weapon inside the home -- excluding the porch , the garage or the yard .
People are allowed to own more guns , but they can not be loaded .
Legal experts say the law is not bulletproof and could be headed toward the U.S. Supreme Court , which ruled in June that Americans have the right to possess handguns for self - defense .
That ruling made the Chicago 's existing gun ban , which had been in effect for 28 years , unenforceable .
In its place Mayor Richard M. Daley and the City Council created the new law that goes into effect today .
" This law is most vulnerable on the broad general ban on carrying guns in public , " said Eugene Kontorovich , assistant professor at Northwestern University Law School .
" The Second Amendment allows Americans to ' keep and bear arms ' and ' bear ' means carry and ' arms ' means more than one .
It 's not about being able to defend your home , it 's about being able to defend yourself .
It seems the city misread ' to keep and bear arms ' as ' to keep arm . ' "
Chicago City Law Department spokeswoman Jennifer Hoyle said the Supreme Court allowed for " reasonable restrictions " and that is exactly what the local law provides .
" We think it 's constitutional and there is nothing to stop us from enforcing it .
We are allowing people to keep a handgun in their home for self defense .
The definition of a home is the livable section of the property , not the back yard or the porch or the garage .
Our concern is the safety of the general public who can be more exposed in those areas . "
Today the Chicago Police Department will begin detailing on its website steps to becoming a legal gun owner .
The first step is to get a permit , which requires range and classroom training , decent eyesight , a fingerprint background check and other elements .
Once the permit is obtained , all guns must be registered .
That includes the single loaded gun in the house , as well as an unlimited supply of unloaded rifles and shotguns allowed under the law .
Residents are allowed to buy one additional handgun every month but are prohibited from owning assault weapons , sawed - off shotguns , laser sites , mufflers and other accessories , Hoyle said .
Chicago 's Strict New Gun Law -- Is It Bulletproof ?
" Only one gun can be ready to use at a moment 's notice , " said Hoyle .
" All the others need to be in something like a lockbox . "
Both lawsuits challenging the gun law were filed in federal court .
One was filed on behalf of Joe Franzese , who owns one gun store in the northern suburbs and wants to open another in Chicago , and said Mayor Daley is infringing on citizens ' rights .
The other lawsuit was filed by four individuals who say they need guns for protection including a financial trader , an educator who lives near a high - crime neighborhood , a veterinarian who owns an animal clinic and her husband , who 's self - employed in the aircraft restoration business .
The difference between " sexting " and " child pornography " might seem obvious , but it 's not .
Take one common metric for labeling something " child porn " — was it produced voluntarily ?
That question has its limits .
Adults can ( and do ) convince minors to take sexually explicit pictures by webcam , for instance .
Or they acquire pictures of kids that were created voluntarily for a boyfriend or girlfriend but were later forwarded to others or posted on the ' Net ( after a bad breakup , say ) .
Though the image might look exactly like child pornography , asking " how was this produced ? " might make it difficult to prosecute those who collect and view child porn .
As a recent Harvard overview of sexting and the law notes , " Every adult who possesses or trades in child pornography could claim that the images are protected by the First Amendment , unless the government can prove they were not taken voluntarily by minors , for minors . "
The paper , " Sexting : Youth Practices and Legal Implications " ( PDF ) , was authored by Dena Sacco , the former Assistant US Attorney for Massachusetts who took the lead on child porn and obscenity cases in the states .
It looks at how states might respond ( and have responded ) to sexting , and it cites plenty of complicated cases that go far beyond the typical " high school girl sends topless photo to boyfriend " routine .
For instance :
" In Massachusetts , police were considering criminal charges after an eighth grade girl sent pictures of herself to her eighth grade boyfriend , who then sold the images to other children for $ 5 . "
" In Virginia , two male high school students , aged 15 and 18 , were charged with possession of child pornography and electronic solicitation for nude and semi‐nude images of minor girls contained on cell phones after they actively solicited the photos from younger female students for trade among themselves . "
In Florida , " an 18 ‐ year ‐old high school senior who had recently broken up with his 16 ‐ year ‐old girlfriend e-mailed everyone on his ex‐girlfriend ’s email contact list nude images that she had originally e-mailed only to him .
He was convicted under state child pornography law and required to register as a sex offender . "
" In Wisconsin , a 17 ‐ year ‐old boy was charged with possession of child pornography after posting naked pictures of his 16 ‐ year ‐old ex‐girlfriend online with captions [ crude captions deleted ] . "
" Also in Wisconsin , an 18 ‐ year ‐old was sentenced to 15 years in prison for an extortion scheme in which he tricked male classmates into sending him nude photos of themselves and then blackmailed them with exposure if they refused to have sex with him . "
Given the diversity of sexting practice , what 's a government to do ?
Three approaches
New Jersey is considering a pair of bills that focus on education , both at school and at ... cell phone stores ?
The state might " prohibit the sale of cell phones in retail stores that do not provide pamphlets on sexting to customers , " according to the Harvard paper .
In 2009 , Missouri decided to make it a misdemeanor for anyone to use a " telecommunications device knowingly or recklessly to create , receive , exchange , send or possess sexually explicit images of a minor — themselves included . "
Colorado decided that people would be in the clear unless " the offender [ knew ] or believed that the child was younger than 15 years old at the time of the offense and the offender must have been at least 4 years older than the child . "
Sacco outlines three basic legal strategies that states can pursue .
First , they could simply redefine child porn to exclude voluntarily produced sexting .
As noted above , this is tricky because " once it is out of the hands of the minors involved , a sexted image is indistinguishable from any other sexually explicit image of a minor . "
Focusing on the production of the image does nothing to address distribution and consumption , and it's easy to imagine those with a hunger for child porn sating themselves through galleries of sexted images .
Second , states can roll sexted images into the " child pornography " category .
Sacco outlines some thoughtful reasons for doing this based on the harm to children caused by even voluntary images that will exist " for years to come . "
She also notes several surveys that show girls often feel pressure to provide sexually explicit photos to boys in a way that boys do not feel in return .
But stepping in to prevent kids from doing stupid and harmful things can also be an overreaction , especially in the less - controversial cases where material is kept between romantic partners .
Should they really be exposed to the full power of the law for taking photos of behavior that is itself legal ?
Just being registered as a sex offender can have significant impacts on one 's life .
Third , there 's a " middle way " approach in which the government can criminalize all such images as child pornography , thereby avoiding all the hassle about " production " and " intent " and " coercion , " and focusing only on the final product .
At the same time , the law can grant " affirmative defenses " to those accused of such behavior .
This could allow those who take pictures of themselves or who intentionally transmit pictures to particular people to escape prosecution , and it's an approach already under consideration in several state legislatures .
The savage 1920 purge of suspected homosexuals from Harvard University .
In the winter and spring of 1920 , Harvard University ’s Perkins Hall — then the largest dormitory on campus , boasting spacious rooms , brick corridors , and iron staircases — was home to some of the brightest , most promising young men in America .
As Harvard students , they were expected to continue the tradition of the country ’s oldest university , leading America with moral and intellectual clarity in a time of tremendous change and uncertainty .
In other circles , though , the boys of Perkins Hall were better known for their “ bitch parties . ”
These raucous all - nighters featured drunken sailors , horny Harvard boys , men dressed as women , and what one student then described as “ the most disgusting and disgraceful and revolting acts of degeneracy and depravity ” he had ever seen .
The parties were usually held in the second - floor room of Ernest Weeks Roberts , the handsome , brown - haired young son of a conservative Massachusetts congressman .
Roberts had a girlfriend in the nearby town of Brookline , but what he really liked was partying and chasing boys .
He skipped so many classes , in fact , that he landed on academic probation after receiving several near - failing grades .
His father came to the rescue , securing promises from the school that Roberts would be admitted to Harvard ’s Medical School as long as he showed some improvement .
Roberts put on a serious face for his family , but in reality he was at the center of a wild gay crowd at Harvard .
When the boys were n’t cavorting in Perkins Hall , they were gallivanting around Cambridge and Boston , dancing with gay men in bars like the Lighted Lamp and the Golden Rooster .
Though many “ proper Bostonians ” perceived their city as a bastion of purity and decency ( and took pride in the fact that most theatrical and literary works that dealt even marginally with sexuality were banned from the city ) , Boston had a vibrant and youthful Bohemian scene dating back to the second half of the 19th Century , one inspired greatly by English writer Oscar Wilde , who came to visit several times in 1882 .

Boston was no New York — where in 1920 , gays opened up twenty restaurants and “ personality clubs , ” many of which were later raided and closed — but it had plenty of its own opportunities for debauchery .
In a 1914 letter , an anonymous Bostonian wrote , “ And how many homosexuals I ’ve come to Know !
Boston , this good old Puritan city , has them by the hundreds . ”
There may have been hundreds at Harvard alone .
In May of 1920 , Roberts wrote a giddy , gossip - filled letter to his friend Cyril Wilcox , who was taking time off from Harvard to recover from a case of hives brought on by an academic crisis ( he had failed to take the April exams his future depended on ) .
In his letter , Roberts recounted his recent sexual escapades and updated Wilcox on all he had missed while recuperating at home .
“ I have n’t made Bradlee yet , but when I do it will last for 2 days and 2 nights without taking it out , ” Roberts wrote .
But Wilcox never read the letter .
He had committed suicide the day after Roberts sent it .
The suicide — and the incriminating letter , which was opened by Wilcox ’s brother and made clear that homosexuality was rampant at Harvard — sparked a secret investigation at the school : Fearing an “ outbreak ” of homosexuality , Harvard hastily convened a five - member panel of school officials they referred to as The Court .
Over the next two weeks ,
The Court interrogated dozens of students and handed down guilty verdicts against Roberts , six other students , a philosophy assistant , a dental school student , and an alumnus .
The students were expelled — and , remarkably , ordered to leave the city of Cambridge .
For many , it was the end of their promising academic careers , as Harvard took further measures to keep them from attending other schools .
For more than eighty years , this remarkable story , recounted in some five - hundred pages of typed and barely legible handwritten letters and school documents , sat untouched in a locked filing cabinet at University Hall .
Then Amit Paley , a Harvard student and an editor of the student - run Harvard Crimson , came upon a strange reference to Court documents while working on another assignment .
Paley was eventually granted access to the files and wrote of their existence in the Crimson .
( Though Harvard blocked out the names of the students involved , Paley was able to identify them after six months of research ) .
A further examination of the five - hundred pages of files , which now reside in the Harvard Archives , along with old yearbooks , freshman - student reports , and 25th - and 50th - anniversary class reports , tell a fascinating , tragic story about gay life at Harvard in 1920 and the administration ’s ferocious response to the discovery of homosexual “ degenerates ” on its campus .

Kenneth
Day did n’t think of himself as queer , but the blond , athletic Harvard sophomore was n’t opposed to letting guys go down on him .
And Harvard ’s gay boys found Day endlessly appealing :
He had a muscular body ( Day liked to box and run track ) , masculine credentials ( like Ernest Weeks Roberts , he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity ) , and an innocent look about him that invited corruption ; one student described Day in a letter as being “ young in sin . ”
Roberts liked Day , too , and in his fateful letter to Wilcox , he wrote that he had sex with Day “ every once in a while , for diversion , ” and that soon after he introduced Day to Harvard ’s gay scene , the sophomore was “ being sucked foolish by anyone and everyone he can get his hands on . ”
Day ’s sexual adventures were in stark contrast to his attitude the prior year , when he complained about his roommate , Cyril Wilcox , who often invited men from Boston to spend the night in their dorm room .
“ I am so disgusted with him that I cannot bring myself to talk to him , ” an aggravated Day wrote in a 1919 letter to his cousin , complaining that their room was turning into a brothel .
The roommates soon made up , though , with Day telling his cousin , “ Perhaps he ca n’t help being a little queer . ”
While Day concentrated on his studies , Wilcox struggled academically in 1920 , spending much of his free time at the Beacon Hill apartment of his older lover , Harry Dreyfus .
“ Wilcox seems to be a bright enough chap , but he does n’t study apparently , ” his adviser wrote on March 3 , 1920 .
Harvard told him that he would have to do well on his April exams , and when he did n’t take them , the school told him that he would not receive credit for much of that academic year .

When Wilcox committed suicide , his family initially thought it was because of Harvard ’s decision .
But then his brother opened Roberts ’ letter and a second letter from a recent Harvard graduate that referred to Wilcox as “ Salome ’s Child ” and made references to recent police raids on gay clubs .
Wilcox ’s brother tracked down Cyril ’s lover , Harry Dreyfus , and beat him up .
He then met with Harvard dean Chester Greenough , informing him about his brother ’s suicide , the letters , and the names of several students and other men he had extracted from Dreyfus .
Soon after , Greenough received an anonymous letter from someone who identified himself only as a member of the class of 1921 .
The letter mentioned the names of Roberts and Day , among others , and offered a shocking explanation for Wilcox ’s suicide : “ While in his freshman year he met in college some boys , mostly members of his own class , who committed upon him and introduced him to commit on them ‘ Unnatural Acts , ' ” read the letter .
“ [ The ] habit so grew on him that realizing he did not have strength of character enough to brake [ sic ] away from it concluded suicide the only course open to him …
Is n’t it about time an end was put to this sort of thing in college ? ”
Harvard hastily convened the secret Court .
The initial evidence pointed mostly to Roberts , but The Court wanted more proof before accusing such a politically connected student .
The Court called Day as its first witness , and according to handwritten notes taken by members of The Court , he admitted to having sex with Roberts but denied Roberts ’s claim that he had sex with “ everyone who came along . ”
Day told The Court he was drunk the first time he had sex with Roberts , and that he had n’t been with him sexually in more than a month .
A member of The Court wrote that Day “ admits he is probably a little tainted .
Mind poisoned . ”
When asked about his masturbation practices ( The Court was obsessed with the subject ) , Day said he had n’t done that in seven years .
Finally ,
The Court wanted names of other students involved , which Day — disgusted by his involvement in the affair — offered with little resistance .
The next day , Roberts appeared before The Court .
After initially denying any homosexual activity , he eventually confessed to sexual relations with five male Harvard students .
But Roberts also claimed he had no homosexual activity in three months and that he ’d been “ led astray ” by Wilcox .
The Court did n’t believe Roberts to be a credible witness , labeling him “ certainly the ringleader in the homosexual practices in college . ”
After interrogating several other students , the investigation quickened when Nathaniel Wollf , a Harvard freshman , casually mentioned to an assistant Harvard dean that he knew something about Wilcox ’s suicide .
The Court immediately summoned Wollf to testify , where he confessed to occasional homosexual activity that began at a prestigious boarding school that was “ permeated with homosexuality ” and “ mutual masturbation . ”
Wollf told The Court that his first homosexual experience at Harvard was with Keith Smerage , a name The Court had not yet heard .
Wollf said he met Smerage at the Dramatic Club and realized Smerage was gay at an ensuing dinner .
He told The Court he accompanied Smerage to his dorm room after dinner , where the two “ took off all their clothes ” and mutually masturbated each other .

It had , until then , been a good year for Smerage , a transfer student from Tufts who loved drama and English .
“ I have made the Dramatic Club ! ” he wrote to his mother that spring .
“ I am fully beyond words .
And as is usual with me I wept just a little .
It ’s silly , weak , kiddish and all that , I know ; but gee , to have done something real …
This year I am sure is the most glorious in my college so far .
If only I could find a girl , now . ”
When the Court summoned him , Smerage confessed to having many homosexual experiences , rouging his nails , and having heard of Havelock Ellis , whose 1897 book Sexual Inversion examined homosexuality in America .
He also told The Court that he had conquered masturbation about nine months prior .
Finally , he gave The Court names of other guilty students but stopped short of naming them all .
“ Said he knows fifty names but wo n’t tell , ” The Court noted in its files .
♦♦♦
By early June , The Court handed down fourteen guilty verdicts .
One of the accused , Harvard Dental School student Eugene Cummings , committed suicide on June 11 .
The story got big play in the Boston American .
“ According to friends of the two in Fall River , Cummings , who was said to have been mentally unbalanced , told a story of an alleged inquisition which he claimed was held in the college office following Wilcox ’s death , ” read the article .
“ He said that he was taken into the office , which was shrouded in gloom , with but one light dimly burning , and there questioned exhaustively .
This story , which was denied by the college authorities , was said to have sprung from his disordered mind . ”
That same month , Dean Chester Greenough , under orders from Harvard president Lawrence Lowell , told Roberts and the other guilty students to withdraw from the school immediately and leave the city of Cambridge .
“ I am greatly distressed and embarrassed to have to tell you that your son has involved himself in difficulties so extraordinarily grave that the President has instructed me to advise your son to leave the University at once , ” Greenough wrote to Congressman Roberts .
“ His offense has nothing to do with low scholarship ; it is not gambling , or drink , or ordinary sexual intercourse .
If he does not confess to something worse than any of these things , he will not have told you the whole truth …
The matter is altogether the most distressing that has occurred since I have been in this office . ”
On June 8 , Congressman Roberts replied to Greenough .
“ If you are a parent , you will understand how this dreadful news has upset me , far more on the boys ’ account than my own , ” he wrote . “…
I would further like to be informed if this most deplorable affair has been or will be made public . ”
( Greenough assured him it would n’t . )
Meanwhile , in a letter to his cousin , Day again insisted that he was n’t as guilty as his Harvard classmates .
“ I have been asked to leave for what I consider an unjust cause , ” Day wrote .
“ I could not tell the whole story to the Board .
The only thing I can say is I am the least involved of any , and the Board seems to realize that . ”
Indeed , Greenough held out the possibility of readmitting Day in the future and was in favor of doing so a year later , but he was overruled by Harvard president Lowell .
“ When I said goodbye to him this morning , I told him that he must not despair , that he must reconstruct his life , and keep up his courage , ” Greenough wrote to Day ’s cousin .
( Day ’s parents had died when he was young , and he was in the care of his grandmother . )
Day ’s cousin wrote many letters to Greenough asking the board to consider readmitting him .
In one , he appealed to Greenough ’s sense of sympathy .
“ The loss of a year to a boy in ordinary conditions , with his parents to fall back upon , might not be so serious a matter , but in the present matter it seems a very high price to pay , as it will mean I fear the end of his education . ”
In another letter , he tried , like Day had , to differentiate him from the other Harvard students involved .
“ He was interested in swimming , track and boxing , ” he wrote , “ which are not sports that interest a degenerate who associates with degenerates . ”
Of all the dismissed students , Smerage went the least quietly .
His mother wrote numerous letters to Greenough , saying “ you men could have done much good had you had perhaps a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts . ”
And in a June 15 letter to Greenough , Smerage claimed that the school was responsible for his supposed crime .
“ Mother says she was warned never to send me to Harvard , but no specific reason was given .
Now we know !
Harvard has a reputation for this sort of thing that is nationwide .
I have heard a more uncomplimentary song Princeton sings of Harvard and along this same theme .
Through Roberts I met the leader of a similar act to his at Dartmouth .
When I asked an acquaintance of mine there if he knew the lad , he said yes , and added , ‘ He and his gang should have gone to Harvard . ' ”
Smerage ’s rant did little to help him get into Rutgers , as Harvard promised to tell the school the circumstances of his dismissal .
Other expelled students — including one who was essentially found guilty for being the roommate of a homosexual — faced similar treatment .
“ You have given me just the information we needed , and it goes without saying that we shall inform him that we do not care to consider his application for admission , ” a Brown University official wrote to Greenough .
“ How frequently we uncover in the undergraduate population messes of this sort , and how disagreeable it is to deal with such matters ! ”
How frequently they uncover such matters ?
While it ’s unclear just how many similar purges occurred at other schools , historians suspect that Harvard was n’t alone .
“ A case like Harvard ’s is shocking to some people , but it should n’t be , ” says George Chauncey , a history professor at the University of Chicago and the author of Gay New York : Gender , Urban Culture , and the Making of the Gay Male World , 1890 - 1940 .
“ This kind of thing certainly happened more than we realize .
I think the Harvard case got so much attention partly because it ’s Harvard , partly because people have forgotten how virulent anti-homosexual policing was in those days , and partly because people assume that gay life was virtually nonexistent or that gay people were invisible or isolated during that time .
But it was n’t . ”
For Day , Smerage , and Roberts , their expulsion from Harvard was the end of their academic careers .
Smerage managed a tea room for three years and soon adopted the stage name Richard Keith , performing in many New England theater productions .
He later moved to New York City and worked as the assistant manager of a restaurant before committing suicide in 1930 .
Day , who worked in banking after leaving Harvard , never told his two children why he left college .
He married three times and was known as a skirt - chaser .
In his Harvard 50th - anniversary class report ( Harvard Students remain part of their year ’s class , even if they are expelled ) , Day wrote from Florida that he was “ very happily married and living on the sun coast . ”
For Roberts , who married his Brookline girlfriend less than a year after being expelled from Harvard , there was to be no following in his father ’s footsteps .
He worked most of his life as an interior designer .
Six years before his death in 1958 , Roberts — a loyal Republican — opened an antique shop that he ran with his wife out of their home in Wellesley Hills , Massachusetts .
In his class ’s 25th - anniversary report , Roberts wrote that he was “ blessed with the happiest of marriages . ”

Less than 24 hours after saying that the Jews control Washington 's foreign policy and the media , and that Hitler 's actions should be " put into context , " Hollywood director Oliver Stone issued an apology on Monday , saying he " made a clumsy association about the Holocaust . "
Open gallery view Oliver Stone Credit : AP
Stone had told British publication The Sunday Times that U.S. public opinion was focused on the Holocaust as a result of the " Jewish domination of the media . "
The remarks sparked a massive backlash , with a large number of Jewish organizations and Israeli officials publicly condemning the director 's comments .
In a statement released Monday , Stone said that , " In trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people , I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust , for which I am sorry and I regret . "
Stone added that he did not believe that Jews control the media , or any other industry , and that the fact that the Holocaust was still an important and current topic is actually a great achievement and a credit to those committed to perpetuating the memory of the atrocities commited during that period .

Senate candidate Ken Buck is apologizing for a degrading remark he made about the Tea Party movement last month .
Buck regrets disparaging tea partiers
Insurgent Colorado Senate candidate Ken Buck is apologizing for a degrading remark he made about the Tea Party movement last month that was caught on tape by a Democratic tracker .
The Denver Post and 9 News is expected to report Sunday night that Buck referred to the members of the Tea Party as " dumbasses " after a campaign event in Crowley , Colo . last month .

" Will you tell those dumbasses at the Tea Party to stop asking questions about birth certificates while I 'm on the camera ?
God , what am I supposed to do ? "
Buck says on the tape , according to his campaign .
Buck campaign spokesman Owen Loftus told POLITICO that the candidate spent Sunday explaining and apologizing for the remark in interviews with the state 's two dominant news outlets .
" Ken points out he does gets frustrated at times with those individuals pushing those issues .
He should n't have cussed .
He regrets the remark .
He was venting his frustration to a Democratic tracker and he should n't of , " said Loftus .
Loftus said that Buck , whose candidacy has been fueled in part by Tea Party members uninspired by one - time GOP frontrunner Jane Norton , was aware he was speaking to a Democratic tracker and simply made a mistake .
The birther issue has been a tricky one for Buck to navigate :
While he signaled he would support legislation to ensure a presidential candidate has U.S. citizenship at a meet - and - greet in June , he has also stressed it is not a priority for his campaign .
" They 're following him for over a year now and they 're bound to catch somethings .
And out of frustration , he said this , " explained Loftus .
" I do n't blame them .
I think they 're much more afraid to go against Ken . "
The Norton campaign leaped on the remark , calling Buck , " two - steps short of a fraud . "
" He 's a self - proclaimed tea partier who trashes tea partiers when he thinks no one is looking .
He 's an alleged fiscal conservative who increased his budget by 40 percent .
He 's a Tom Tancredo disciple who trashes Tancredo when he thinks the mic is off .
Ken says he can appeal to swing voters and beat Michael Bennet , and then trashes the roughly 50 percent of voters who wear high heels .
Bottom line :
The voters of Colorado ca n’t trust Ken Buck , " said Norton spokeswoman Cinamon Watson .
The Weld County district attorney is in an increasingly negative primary contest with Norton , the former lieutenant governor who squandered an early double - digit lead despite high name recognition and backing from national Republicans .
While Buck 's opponents were expected to hop on the verbal slip , the campaign said it was confident most Tea Party members would respect his explanation .
" He 's referring to those small groups that really are just missing the bigger picture here .
I think the Tea Partiers are looking at the much bigger picture and the issues of the deficit and health care and that we need to stand up to the establishment and change Washington , " said Loftus .
Buck got into hot water last week for being caught on camera saying that voters should choose him over Norton because " I do not wear high heels . "
The comment was in response to a Norton ad that accused Buck of not being " man enough " to launch attacks against her himself -- a reference to the outside groups who have spent millions on television targeting her record .
To stem the tide of bad press , the Buck campaign released an internal poll conducted by Magellan Strategies that showed him leading Norton 46 percent to 37 percent .
The winner of the Aug. 10 primary will go on to face appointed Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet or his primary rival , former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff .
Prime Minister Julia Gillard says she will ask for the people 's trust to move Australia forward and plans to detail challenges facing the nation in the next few days .
" In the days to come I will be putting forward more detailed arguments about some of the biggest challenges facing our nation , " Ms Gillard told the Per Capita Circle in Adelaide today .
" I will be explaining the steps I think we need to take and asking for people 's consideration of those steps .
" I will ask for the Australian people 's trust to move Australia forward . "
Well , this is genuinely awesome : it seems AT&T is pulling back from its ban on third - party sideloaded apps on its Android devices , because HTC has just released an Aria update that enables them ( either that or HTC just went rogue here , but we highly doubt it ) .
While that does n't have much practical implication for your typical smartphone user , it 's a strong sign that AT&T might be ready to take a more reasonable stance on the openness of its branded devices that would put it inline with the attitudes Sprint , Verizon , and T - Mobile have all taken with their Android phones so far .
Additionally , the update includes " the Mobile Network sharing function , " which we take to mean a mobile hotspot app in the same vein as the one that 's shipping with Froyo -- if we had to guess , it probably requires AT&T 's 2GB DataPro plan plus the tethering add - on , which would put it in line with what they 're charging on the iPhone .
Onward and upward , AT&T . :
We got downright excited for a second there , but an HTC spokesman just called to inform us there 's been a mistake -- this download is only for the desktop HTC Sync client and does n't actually enable anything on the phone .
We 're working to get more information right now , but it sounds like the sideloading ball is still squarely in AT&T 's court . : HTC apologizes for the confusion , saying the update description was in error -- it was merely supposed to read that the Aria now works with the company 's desktop sync client .
On Monday , the text will be updated to remove every last ounce of false hope .
Sideloading works after all !

Here at Beeriety we ’ve often expressed our frustrations with the biggest American brewers .
Folks like Anheiser - Busch and MillerCoors , who collectively make up almost 95 % of the US beer market .
Generally we champion craft beer because we feel the little guys offer superior beer , and more honesty of what their beer is .
While we strongly favor craft beer over the other stuff we would be amiss if we here at Team Beeriety were n’t honest about how much cheap industrial beer we drink .
It ’s not something we ’re proud about , but we ’re do n’t feel guilty about it either .
One of the greatest strengths of beer is its unparalleled adaptability .
It ‘s equally at home at the ball game with a box of cracker jacks as it is a fancy meal at an expensive restaurant .
While the former situation is more closely associated with the beverage , thanks to the efforts of the craft beer movement that image is slowly changing , and people everywhere are coming to recognize that there is no meal or situation beer can’t handle .
Here at Beeriety we want to celebrate all of the roles beer is able to play , from low brow to high brow .
That means celebrating the beers both by Dogfish Head and by Miller .
We may be most excited about the beers of craft brewers but we still regularly partake in cheap light lager like High Life , Pabst Blue Ribbon and the like , and we are n’t ashamed to admit it .
Sometimes you ’re not able to enjoy a nice craft brew , for reasons of availability , price or situation .
Some may forsake beer all together if they ca n’t get a nice craft beer , but not me .
I ’m interested in beer in all it ’s forms , and sometimes that means something watery , thin and tasteless .
If it ’s all I can get my hand on at the moment I ’m happy to have it .
When other people know you ’re passionate about craft beer they may be a bit intimated by what that means .
They may think you only drink expensive , imported beer in crystal chalices .
I know that I ’ve had of plenty of friends say they feel guilty drinking cheap beer around me , but the fact is I really do n’t care , and frequently will gladly join them in a glass of whatever thin lager they ’re drinking .
It may not be my favorite , but I ’m always happy the share a beer with someone , regardless of what it is .
There is no beer that ’s ‘ right ’ for a time , place or meal , only the beer you want to drink .
Do n’t let anyone stop you from enjoying the beer you want to enjoy .
I ’ll continue to educate people about the beers beyond the light stuff , and drink craft beer when I can , but I ’ll never dismiss someone based solely on what their drinking , or refraim from trying every beer I can get my hands on .
That kind of snobbery and elitism is best left to wine drinkers .

BOSTON — A U.S. judge in Boston has ruled that a federal gay marriage ban is unconstitutional because it interferes with the right of a state to define marriage .
U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro on Thursday ruled in favor of gay couples ' rights in two separate challenges to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , known as DOMA .
The state had argued the law denied benefits such as Medicaid to gay married couples in Massachusetts , where same - sex unions have been legal since 2004 .
Tauro agreed , and said the act forces Massachusetts to discriminate against its own citizens .
" The federal government , by enacting and enforcing DOMA , plainly encroaches upon the firmly entrenched province of the state , and in doing so , offends the Tenth Amendment .
For that reason , the statute is invalid , " Tauro wrote in a ruling in a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Martha Coakley .
Ruling in a separate case filed by Gays & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , Tauro found that DOMA violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution .
" We 've maintained from the very beginning that there was absolutely no basis for this law treating one class of married Massachusetts couples different from everybody else and the court has recognized that , " said Gary Buseck , GLAD 's legal director .
The Justice Department argued the federal government has the right to set eligibility requirements for federal benefits — including requiring that those benefits only go to couples in marriages between a man and a woman .
The law was enacted by Congress in 1996 when it appeared Hawaii would soon legalize same - sex marriage and opponents worried that other states would be forced to recognize such marriages .
The lawsuit challenges only the portion of the law that prevents the federal government from affording pension and other benefits to same - sex couples .
Since then , five states and the District of Columbia have legalized gay marriage .

The last little while I ’ve begun to notice that some front end designers and developers seem to have a view of themselves as less then back end programmers or designers .
I went through this too when I first graduated from school and started to become a part of web design community .
All the popular blogs were by guys building web apps using Ruby or Python .
I actually remember going to a blog of a HTML / CSS expert and actually thinking to myself , “ All this guy does is HTML and CSS ? ”
Now , of course , I realize how hard it is to make a lot of the designs I get in HTML and CSS .
I really wish I could remember who that guy was because his blog looked pretty cool , well , at least in my memory .
Front end web people are just as important to the whole process as anyone else in the loop .
We are the people that make the part that people see and interact with .
In a lot of cases , you ’re also the person that has to take what the designer has given you and make it work with the functionality that the programmer has created .
Sometimes it seems half my job is explaining to designers why something is n’t possible and the other half usually ends up making it possible .
Front end web designers are the people that take flat designs and turn them into something interactive and that can be a lot harder than most people think .
Front end developers should never sell themselves short with what they can do .
Especially now with browsers speeding up their JavaScript adding HTML5 support , the things front end developers can do is jumping by leaps and bounds .
A few years ago , I became obsessed with learning Flash and ActionScript and the more I learned , the more I started hearing about Flex Builder .
It seemed to me at the time if you were doing serious Flash work and you wanted the rest of the community to take you seriously , you had to be building everything using Flex Builder .
But FB is n’t built to do the simple stuff and as I figured out , it does n’t really matter what you use to build your project but how it looks and works in the end .
I work with HTML / CSS / JS and Flash .
Those are the only things I have time to do .
We have a couple of guys that do the back en programming .
Their HTML skills reside somewhere in 1997 and they ’ve barely heard of CSS .
It takes a lot of skill to be able to rebuild a design in pixels .
If that ’s your skill , you should be proud of it .
With the upcoming advances in web technology , front end developers are going to be even more important .

Neuropol is a wide , starkly futuristic typeface which was created in 1996 .
The design is based on rounded squares which were popular in earlier techno fonts such as Microgramma , Digital and Chimes .
The superelliptical stroke ends give Neuropol a harmonized appearance .
Truncated horizontal strokes suggest lasers or vector - beam traces .
Over the last few decades , several Neuropol related font families have been released .
Neuropol had been redrawn and expanded into Neuropol X in 2004 .
The original Neuropol font was discontinued at that time but some people still pref the 1996 version .
In 2015 , the original 1996 Neuropol was restored and re-released .
Changes include : better kerning , higher dots on i and j , cleaner curves , heavier accents , more languages , more punctuation , the latest monetary symbols and a better @ symbol .
If your application supports OpenType stylistic alternates , you can access a complete Z , similar to the one in Neuropol X . This font includes a license that allows free commercial use : sometimes referred to as a desktop license .
This allows you to install the font on a computer and use it to create posters , web graphics , game graphics , t- shirts , videos , signs , logos and more .
Read the license agreement for details .
If you 'd like to embed this font in an app , ebook , on the web or anything that 's not covered by the desktop license agreement , visit the link below .
You 'll find distributors who offer different types of licenses or you can contact me for help .

Trouble is , no one knows - or can say who he even is for that matter .
Wikipedia says Banksy is " believed to be a native of Yate , South Gloucestershire , near Bristol and to have been born in 1974 , but his identity is unknown . "
Another important part of the story is the shit hole .
It 's the Packard Plant on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit .
And it was n't always a shit hole .
At one time , the Packard Plant was the pride of the Midwest .
Not only did the Packard facility crank out some of the finest automobiles the country ever built , it employed tens of thousands of people from the day it opened in the last year of the 19th century , to the year of my birth 52 ago .
Unfortunately ... stuff happened .
And for the last 5 decades this concrete leviathan has been steadily eroding , crumbling , cracking and falling into what it has become today .
Looking over 19 year old photographer , Amanda Pascuzzi 's shoulder you can see up close what once was a sprawling compound of iron , sweat and brains ... is today a haunted shell that bakes in the sun and is a home fit for only the least discriminating creatures .
Nothing attracts an artist quite like neglect , pain , regret and nostalgia .
Enter Banksy .
Let me tell you a little about Banksy if you do n't already know .
He 's often referred to as a " Graffiti Artist " .
You can't look at two or more pieces of his work without wrinkling your nose at that completely inadequate title .
If anything , Banksy takes graffiti and makes it into something most real graffiti artists wish they could do .
What Banksy does is appear in the night or in the most secreted places , without pronouncement or fanfare , and leaves his mark .
Sometimes he 'll take some existing graffiti and give it a breathtaking sense of collision between art and life , and sometimes he just does something nice to help tidy up a spot .
You often do n't know if you 're looking at life or art with a Banksy work .
And then again you might stumble across a piece that is so ridiculous , and so out of context that you just have to sit down on a park bench and laugh .
So it was n't any big surprise as much as it was an utter thrill ... and an honor ... when Banksy showed up at the old Packard Plant on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit .
A simple depiction in typical Banksy style .
A young , mischievous , African American boy dressed for a downpour with the expression of a rascal without an explanation , a bucket of red paint and the pure , innocent statement :
" I remember when all this was trees . "
Word of the precious mural on the dilapidated concrete wall in the middle of a shit hole quickly spread .
Quite honestly , it 's amazing that it even got spotted , let alone be identified so quickly in such a decrepit , god forsaken labyrinth .
And even more precarious was the place Banksy chose to leave his latest statement .
Because once Banksy paints something , the next thing that happens if you do n't photograph it is that the elements win out and take the art piece to that great blank canvas in the sky .
And if you tried to move a Banksy ...
Banksy , in whatever coded , relayed message he can send out , will deny ever having anything to do with it - severely devaluing the work .
But that did n't stop the art purveyors at 555 Gallery and Studios .
A Banksy work in our humble little town , even from atop the piles of rock and rat feces in the center of the biggest shit hole in the city of Detroit , was just too precious to leave to the rain , the rats , and the rapscallions .
They took it .
Yep .
You betcha they did .
Without batting an eye , the Gallery just came and cut the Banksy down , wrapped in saran , and carted it off to a quiet , cool , dry place with the care and curatory skill given the Shroud of Turin , the remains of Tut , and the broken hand of Michelangelo 's David .
That might be well where the story would end .
But that mural is worth money .
Some say even without any further big tadoo , it would be worth a hundred K right out of the box .
On an auction podium it could fetch more .
And of course the more the story heats up , the higher the price goes .
And would n't you know , as soon as a price is mentioned , that 's when someone comes out of the mist to stake their claim .
Bioresource Inc. , the company owned by land speculator Romel Casab , filed suit this week in Wayne County Circuit Court to regain possession of the mural by the internationally known British graffiti artist called Banksy .
The painting — a forlorn boy with a can of red paint and the words " I remember when all this was trees " affixed to an 8 - foot tall cinder block wall — was removed by artists of 555 Nonprofit Gallery and Studios , where it remains on display in southwest Detroit .
Now you and I both know there ain't no " land speculator " that has any wherewithal to have any kind of notion as to what 's art and what is n't , least of all land speculators who also happen to own the biggest shit hole in the city of Detroit .
But now , think about it .
It 's their property !
555 Gallery came along and took a piece of it !
There is a twist however .
When the Gallery came to retrieve the highly prized Bansky , there was a foreman of a working crew , employed by Bioresource Inc who spoke with them , and eventually gave the Gallery permission to cut the wall down and carry the mischievous boy and his can of red paint away .
Of course , Bioresource , in its law suit to get back the valuable work , insists it never gave the foreman authority to provide any such permission .
And now it all has to be sorted out by a Detroit judge .
Who should get the painting ?
The Packard Plant owners , who before this Banksy was found , never said a word in public ?
And in fact , they were such a well hidden outfit , no one even knew who owned the biggest shit hole in Detroit , for sure anyway .
Or should it go to 555 Gallery , who saw a thing of beauty and value , who had the expertise to retrieve it safely , and who know how to care for it ?
And that 's where the story ends .
Oh .
Wait .
There is one more thing .
Hours after the story broke in the Detroit News that the owners of the Old Packard Plant had come forward and identified themselves in order to file a lawsuit to stake their claim on the Banksy , resting comfortably inside of a climate controlled room in a gallery somewhere ... there was another announcement .
Action Planned Against Old Packard Plant
Plant Abandoned For More Than 50 Years POSTED : Thursday , July 8 , 2010 DETROIT --
Detroit officials say they finally know who owns a long - abandoned car plant and are going to demand something be done about the eyesore .
The city wants the long - abandoned Packard plant demolished and has spent years trying to establish ownership .
That job got easier this week when Bioresource Inc. sued operators of the 555 Arts gallery for the return of an 8 - foot section of wall featuring artwork and a message by elusive British graffiti artist Banksy .
Hope they do n't settle this too quickly .
Because no sooner did the paint dry , and the attorneys sign , that a brand new Banksy appeared not far from the first , just as mischievous , and just as beautiful as the boy who remembered fondly the poplars and oaks that once filled this spot on East Grand Boulevard .
A single yellow bird , in a tiny gilded cage clinging to an antique stand , behind a small hill of clutter , and shit .
So .
The story continues .
It 's crazy when you think that if it were n't for a mysterious , upstart artist sneaking in and scribbling on a wall somewhere inside the biggest shit hole in Detroit , we might never have known who let it get that way .
And a few years from now ... where the city 's biggest shit hole now stands , there might be all trees !

If you 'd like to see more wildlife of the feathered kind in your backyard but had written off attracting birds as too time - consuming , expensive , or complicated , this simple guide will help you get started without much fuss or cost .

You do n't need to spend lots of money , effort , and time to attract birds to your yard , as a bird can hardly tell the difference between $ 5 DIY bird feeder and a $ 75 sculpted copper one .
This guide will help you get started quickly and inexpensively , and you can decide later if you want to open a bird hotel with heated baths and a rotating buffet of handmade treats .

A few notes : Nearly every tip in this guide applies to apartment dwellers who have a balcony or permission of their landlord to put bird feeders outside .
Also , for ease of use when referring to things related to bird size ( types of feeders , types of housing , etc. ) , we 'll be using common birds for reference .
Everybody knows about how big a sparrow is but not everybody knows how big a Redpoll is .
Why Bother Attracting Birds to Your Yard ?
Among the multitude of reasons you might choose to attract birds to your yard , the principle — and most rewarding one — is that you enjoy the sight and sound of them .
All other reasons largely pale in comparison to the amount of enjoyment you 'll get from simply having interesting bird species visiting your yard .
Photo by wjkos .
That said , birds are voracious pest eaters .
While birds are happy to alight on a feeder you 've placed out for them and eat on your dime , many species are just as happy to hop about your yard picking off slugs , bugs , and other crawlies while they 're waiting in line .
Even better , species of birds that may not be attracted to the type of feeder or the type of feed you have out will stop by because the presence of other birds gives them a sense of safety .
Advertisement
On top of enjoying their song and the fruits of their bug - snatching labors , you also get a chance to participate in the ecosystem of the birds .
Most of the birds you 'll feed and see will be fairly common to your locale , but every so often you get the reward of seeing something unusual — like an endangered Kirtland 's Warbler — stop in your yard to fuel up on its incredible journey away from cold Canadian winters down to the Bahamas .
So where should you get started ?
Birds have really basic needs , and providing for even a few of them will ensure you 've got quite an audience .
Birds need food , water , shelter , and — in the springtime — nesting materials .
These things can be provided in as simple a fashion as a tray of sunflower seeds , a pan of water , a bush to hop into , and an old plastic strawberry basket full of goose down and twine ( for nest building ) .
If your tastes or your budget are so inclined , you can go wild buying all manner of fancy feeders , nesting boxes , bathes , and professionally - blended nesting materials , but it 's not strictly necessary .

Types of Feeders and Feed
Advertisement
You 'll find quite a variety of bird foods and a more diverse array of feeders in even the smallest of home and garden aisles .
Generally the type of food is paired with a type of feeder that best dispenses it and attracts the kind of birds you 're interested in .
The name of each bird feeder type below links to commercial versions of that bird feeder on Amazon — mostly for reference .
You 'll likely find them much cheaper and sans shipping at your local home and garden stores — and at the end of each entry are links to DIY versions .
It 's worth noting that bird feeders , as long as you 're not buying some fancy all - copper model with hand - sculpted leaves on it , are really cheap .
You can buy perfectly serviceable bird feeders of all shapes and sizes for under $ 20 .

Tube Feeders :
Tube feeders are the most common kind of bird feeder .
They 're inexpensive , easy to hang , provide multiple feeding stations , and can be used with a wide variety of seeds .
You can fill a tube feeder with black sunflower seeds to attract everything from chickadees to woodpeckers or use millet to attract varieties of sparrows and finches .
A tube feeder with a small feed tray on the bottom automatically boosts the number of birds it will attract as large birds such as cardinals , jays , and crossbills will have space to land .
If you 're only going to buy — or only have the space for — one feeder , a decent sized tube feeder with a tray is your best value .
For the DIY - inclined here is a Flexi - Perch style DIY tube feeder intended to keep squirrels away from your feed .
Advertisement
Thistle Feeders :
Thistle feeders are designed for finches .
Other birds will occasionally land on them , but the majority of use will come from finches carefully picking the thistle seeds out of the tiny holes .
You can even buy thistle feeders designed especially for American Gold Finches with inverted perches — the finches have no problem eating upside down .
This DIY model is quite polished looking and this DIY model boasts squirrel resistance .

Peanut Feeders : Peanut feeders look like mesh tube feeders .
Many species of birds love peanuts , like woodpeckers , cardinals , titmice , and jays .
If you have a problem with invasive bird species like European starlings , you can usually seduce them away from the rest of your feeders by putting a peanut feeder in an out of the way area .
Peanut feeders are essentially just tubes of hardware mesh with a top and bottom .
Making one yourself is n't hard if you 've got the supplies on hand from another project , but if you 'll need to go buy hardware mesh , wire , and PVC caps to make one you might as well spend $ 10 - 15 to buy a commercial one .
Advertisement
Hopper Feeders :
If you 've ever seen a bird feeder that looked like a little house or barn with a rail running along the edge for birds to land on , you 've seen a hopper feeder .
They 're great for larger birds like cardinals that would feel cramped clinging to a tube feeder , and you can get models that hold quite a bit of feed , cutting down on refill frequency .
Advertisement
Platform and Ground Feeders :
Many birds prefer sticking close to the ground or landing on an open platform where they can keep an eye out for predators .
A platform feeder will attract a wide variety of birds dependent on what you stock it with .
A platform filled with cracked corn will attract everything from jays to pheasants , mixing in millet and sunflower seeds will attract cardinals , sparrows , doves , juncos , and more .
DIY platform feeders are dead simple .
I made one last week with stuff just laying around my garage from prior projects — 1x2 " pine boards and heavy duty window screen remnants .
As long as you have scrap wood and very basic tools you can build one .
Read more about DIY models here .

Nectar Feeders : Nectar feeders , frequently called hummingbird feeders , are a niche bird feeder that can attract more than just hummingbirds .
When shopping for one , skip the models without perches .
Perch - less nectar feeders will only attract hummingbirds and very pleased bees .
A nectar feeder with a sturdy perch , however , will attract orioles , cardinals , tanagers , finches , thrushes , and other nectar - loving birds .
Also , never buy commercial nectar for your nectar feeder .
It 's a rip off and usually has unnecessary dye in it .
You can find DIY hummingbird feeders here and a speedy DIY nectar recipe here .
It 's worth noting that , while they attract some really beautiful and interesting birds , nectar feeders require the most work as you 'll need to wash and refill them every few days to keep them safe for the birds .

Suet Feeders :
Suet is rich beef fat , a by product of meat processing .
It offers , in winter especially , a rich source of fat and protein for birds .
Suet feed is traditionally packaged in cakes roughly 5 " on a side but they 're easy enough to cut and reposition .
You can make your own suet and your own suet cages , but we 'd recommend skipping both unless you really want to do it yourself .
Both suet and suet cages are dirt cheap , cages usually run $ 5 - 8 , and a box of suet cakes that will last you months runs around $ 20 .
It 's worth the money just to save yourself the swearing and bleeding you 'll be doing when you stab yourself with heavy gauge wire trying to make a suet cage that 's significantly worse than the $ 5 one you left at the store .
That said , if you skip using the cage and just melt a heavy piece of twine right into the block of suet you can get away with DIY hanging feeders like these ones .
If you 're debating putting up a suet feeder , keep in mind that the birds most attracted to the high fat content of the suet are also ravenous bug eaters and worth drawing into your yard .
The variety of bird feeders might seem overwhelming — and if you visit a large wild birds store you 'll be amazed at the sheer number and variety of them — but you do n't need to run out and purchase one of every make , model , and color .
Start small and you 'll be amazed at how many different birds come to investigate your feeders .
A tube feeder with a large base - tray and a large hopper feeder with a suet cage on the side will attract a huge spectrum of birds with little investment on your part .
If you have any Quality Farm and Fleets , Tractor Supply Stores , grain co-ops , or other farm - centric stores around , try those first .
Bird feed purchased from a specialty bird store or even the garden section of your local big box store is almost always a huge rip off .
Why buy a $ 10 five - pound bag of fancy - pants sunflower seeds at the specialty shop when a 40 - pound bag of sunflower seeds is $ 20 at the farm store ?

Bird - Friendly Water Features : They Get Their Baths for Nothing and Their Drinks for Free

Birds love water .
Once they figure out you 've got some sort of water source in your yard , they 'll be there every day drinking , splashing , and preening in it .
You do n't need a backyard pond or a massive water fountain to attract birds to your yard .
Even a modest source of water will do just fine as long as you do the right things to grab their attention .
Photo by JB London .
Nearly anything can serve as a birdbath as long as you keep a few design elements in mind .
Your bird bath should be shallow .
It can have a " deep end " but most of the bath should be shallow enough for small birds like sparrows to stand comfortably .
The bath should be located with plenty of escape routes nearby .
Bathing makes it harder for a bird to make a speedy escape and increase the chance a predator will snatch them .
Make sure to put the birdbath in a location that is either safe from most predators — as it would be high up on an apartment balcony — or provides plenty of low hanging branches or other easy to reach roosts in case the birds need to bolt .
Advertisement
In addition to proper size and placement , you need to make the water active .
Birds tend to ignore standing water but are drawn quickly to moving water .
If you 'd like to use a traditional bird bath you can use what are commonly called " water wigglers " , little battery powered domes you set in the water to keep the surface agitated .
They run around $ 30 , but this DIY model will cost you about $ 10 .
For even more bird - attracting power an actual outdoor fountain with bubbling and trickling water is even better .
For more DIY creations , consider turning an IKEA candle plate into a bird bath or building this beautiful recycled glass bowl bath .

Even if a fancy bird bath is n't in your budget something as simple as suspending a bucket with a small hole in it over a shallow pan of water can do the trick .
You would n't believe it but birds can hear that faint dripping from quite a distance .
Shelter From Storms , Startles , and Sneaky Cats
Advertisement
Compared to providing food and water , providing any sort of elaborate shelter is significantly less important .
You can attract plenty of birds to your yard with some cheap feeders , inexpensive feed , and a source of water .
That said there are two kinds of shelter you should keep in mind when planning on drawing birds into your yard .
Photo by virtualphotographystudio .
As we mentioned above in the section on bird baths , birds need immediate shelter like dense bushes , low - hanging branches , and first story eaves to flit up to .
Unless you 're going all out with this bird project , nobody expects you to start planting your yard just for birds .
( Although planting for native birds and butterflies is an awesome thing to do . )
Still , when selecting where you 'll be placing your bird feeders , baths , and other bird - friendly items , make sure to look around and check the escape routes .
It 's cruel to make your yard a bird haven just to draw them to a location that best serves the hunting habits of neighborhood cats .

If you 're looking to help birds become not just diners but permanent residents of your budding bird sanctuary , some sort of shelter beyond just bushes and accessible overhangs is in order .
You can buy bird houses or make them yourself .
The key thing to keep in mind regarding bird houses is that birds really do n't care what the bird house looks like .
All a bird needs is a hole just the right size for it to wiggle in and a decent sized inner-cavity once it gets inside .
Whether that cavity in inside an old tree or a gaudy birdhouse shaped like a pink Cadillac is n't of any interest to the bird .
Whether you plan on building a bird house or buying one , print off this handy chart that lists the proper dimensions and entrance hole sizes for a variety of birds .
Armed with the proper dimensions and a DIY spirit , you might want to check out this guide to building simple and cheap birdhouses .
If you 're feeling extra ambitious you can try these nest and roost box plans from Cornell University .
One fun thing you can do to encourage birds to use your bird houses , especially in the spring , is to provide nesting materials .
Birds use everything from hay and small twigs to feathers , human hair , wool , cattail down , moss , and pine needles in their nests .
As long as what you 're offering is n't synthetic or has been exposed to harmful chemicals it should work .
An unused suet cage or a mesh produce bag are great containers to hold the nest building materials .
Check out this guide for more ideas on providing nest materials .

Geeking Out with Your New Backyard Companions
It would n't really be a Lifehacker project — or a project I 'd gotten my hands on !— if there was n't some geek - out component to it .
You can end your foray in attracting birds with just putting out the food and water for them and leaving them be , but what fun is that ?
Birds are fascinating and you can up your enjoyment with some geeky tools and knowledge .

You can learn about the kind of birds that visit your locale and even participate in tracking the population grown and movement at eBird , a previously reviewed site dedicated to bird observation .
While you 're at it you can even set up a bird feeder webcam — or even wire it into a nest box so you can monitor your feathered residents .

As much fun as observing birds through the window or with a pair of binoculars is , you earn extra geek points when you can identify them by song alone .
The Peterson audio guides are especially well designed and how I learned to identify birds by their song .
While the tips and tricks we 've shared here will get you started , a trip to your local library or to some of the great resources online like the Ornithology Lab at Cornell University and the Audubon Society can give you even more ideas and tips .
If you have experiences of your own turning your space — be it a balcony or massive backyard spread — into a a bird sanctuary , we want to hear all about it in the comments .
Sorting algorithms Heapsort
With its time complexity of O ( n log( n ) ) heapsort is optimal .
It utilizes a special data structure called heap .
This data structure is explained in the following .
Definition : Let T = ( V , E ) an almost complete binary tree with a vertex labelling a : V M that assigns to each vertex u a label a ( u ) from an ordered set ( M , ) .
A vertex u V has the heap property if it has no direct descendant with a greater label , i.e. v V : ( u , v ) E a ( u ) a ( v )
T is a heap if all vertices have the heap property , i.e. ( u , v ) E : a ( u ) a ( v )
We call T a semi- heap if all vertices except possibly the root r have the heap property , i.e. ( u , v ) E , u ≠ r : a ( u ) a ( v )
Example : Figure 1 : Heap with n = 10 vertices
Observe that each leaf automatically has the heap property regardless of its label , since it has no descendants .
The data structure of the heapsort algorithm is a heap .
The data sequence to be sorted is stored as the labels of the binary tree .
As shown later , in the implementation no pointer structures are necessary to represent the tree , since an almost complete binary tree can be efficently stored in an array .
Heapsort algorithm
The following description of heapsort refers to Figure 2 ( a ) - ( e ) .
( a ) ( b ) ( c )
(d ) ( e ) Figure 2 : Retrieving the maximum element and restoring the heap
If the sequence to be sorted is arranged as a heap , the greatest element of the sequence can be retrieved immediately from the root ( a ) .
In order to get the next - greatest element , the rest of the elements have to be rearranged as a heap .
The rearrangement is done in the following way :
Let b be a leaf of maximum depth .
Write the label of b to the root and delete leaf b ( b ) .
Now the tree is a semi-heap , since the root possibly has lost its heap property .
Making a heap from a semi- heap is simple :
Do nothing if the root already has the heap property , otherwise exchange its label with the maximum label of its direct descendants ( c ) .
Let this descendant be v .
Now possibly v has lost its heap property .
Proceed further with v , i.e. make a heap from the semi- heap rooted at v ( d ) .
This process stops when a vertex is reached that has the heap property ( e ) .
Eventually this is the case at a leaf .
Making a heap from a semi- heap can conceptionally be implemented by the following procedure downheap :
procedure downheap ( v ) Input : semi-heap with root v Output : heap ( by rearranging the vertex labels ) Method : while v does not have the heap property do choose direct descendant w with maximum label a ( w ) exchange a ( v ) and a ( w ) set v := w
Procedure downheap can be used to build a heap from an arbitrarily labelled tree .
By proceeding bottom - up , downheap is called for all subtrees rooted at inner vertices .
Since leaves are already heaps they may be omitted .
procedure buildheap Input : almost complete binary tree T of depth d ( T ) with vertex labelling a Output : heap ( by rearranging the vertex labels ) Method : for i := d ( T ) – 1 downto 0 do for all inner vertices v of depth d ( v ) = i do downheap ( v )
A call of buildheap is the first step of procedure heapsort , which can now be written down as follows :
procedure heapsort Input : almost complete binary tree with root r and vertex labelling a Output : vertex labels in descending order Method : buildheap while r is not a leaf do output a ( r ) choose leaf b of maximum depth write label a ( b ) to r delete leaf b downheap ( r ) output a ( r )
This simulation illustrates the process of building a heap from an arbitrarily labelled tree .
( Java applet for simulation of function buildheap )
An almost complete binary tree with n vertices has a depth of at most log( n ) .
Therefore , procedure downheap requires at most log( n ) steps .
Procedure buildheap calls downheap for each vertex , therefore it requires at most n ·log ( n ) steps .
Heapsort calls buildheap once ; then it calls downheap for each vertex , together it requires at most 2· n ·log ( n ) steps .
Thus , the time complexity of heapsort is T ( n ) O ( n ·log ( n ) ) .
The algorithm is optimal , since the lower bound of the sorting problem is attained .
An almost complete binary tree with n vertices and vertex labelling a can be stored most efficiently in an array a :
the root is stored at position 0
the two direct descendants of a vertex at position v are stored at positions 2 v +1 and 2 v +2
All vertices at positions 0 , ... , n /2 - 1 are inner nodes , all vertices n / 2 , ... , n - 1 are leaves ( integer division / ) .
The heap with n = 10 vertices of Figure 1 is shown in Figure 3 as an example .
Figure 3 : Array representation of the heap of Figure 1
Using this array representation of the heap , heapsort can be implemented as an in - place sorting algorithm .
In each step of heapsort , the root label a ( r ) is not output but stored at the position of the leaf b that is deleted in the following .
Deleting leaf b means to consider just the array elements left of b as the remaining heap .
In other words : the four steps
output of the label of the root a ( r )
( ) choose leaf b of maximum depth
of maximum depth write label of b to the root
to the root delete leaf b
are replaced by an exchange of the root label and the label of b :
exchange the label of the root with the label of the last leaf and do not consider that leaf anymore
The following Java class HeapSorter encapsulates the functions downheap , buildheap and heapsort .
In order to sort an array b , Heapsort is called with the statement HeapSorter. sort ( b ) .
public class HeapSorter { private static int [ ] a ; private static int n ; public static void sort ( int [ ] a 0 ) { a=a0 ; n=a.length ; heapsort ( ) ; } private static void heapsort ( ) { buildheap ( ) ; while ( n > 1 ) { n--; exchange ( 0 , n ) ; downheap ( 0 ) ; } } private static void buildheap ( ) { for ( int v=n /2- 1 ; v>=0 ; v--) downheap ( v ) ; } private static void downheap ( int v ) { int w=2*v+1 ; while ( w < n ) { if ( w+1 < n ) if ( a [ w+1 ] > a[ w ] ) w++ ; if ( a [ v ] > =a[w ] ) return ; exchange ( v , w ) ; v=w ; w=2*v+1 ; } } private static void exchange ( int i , int j ) { int t=a [ i ] ; a [ i ] =a[j ] ; a[j ] =t ; } }
With its time complexity of O ( n log( n ) ) heapsort is optimal .
Unlike mergesort , heapsort requires no extra space .
On the other hand , heapsort is not stable .
A sorting algorithm is stable , if it leaves the order of equal elements unchanged .
The heap data structure can also be used for an efficient implementation of a priority queue .
A priority queue is an abstract list data structure with the operations insert and extractMax .
With each element in the list a certain priority is associated .
By insert an element together with its priority is inserted into the list .
By extractMax the element with the highest priority is extracted from the list .
Using a heap , both operations can be implemented in time O ( log( n ) ) .
Heapsort was originally published by J.W.J. Williams as Algorithm 232 in the journal Communications of the ACM [ Wil 64 ] .
