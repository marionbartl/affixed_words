Declan Whelan ’s presentation at Agile Testing Days focused on promoting learning in software teams .
“ Delivering long - term value to our organisation is gated by our ability to learn ” , said Whelan , presenting several great ideas how to ensure that teams keep learning and improve .
A key take - away idea from this for me was setting up a pet project for the team to try out new things .
Teams can often only try out new things for real on the all - important production code .
The only way you can see how it really works and how easy it is to maintain , how many bugs it has and how quickly they get solved , the experiment really has to go live .
Unless it does , you ca n’t really tell if it is going to work or not .
Sometimes things turn out to be great and you decide to keep the experiment there , sometimes they turn out to be sour and you want to take it out .
For example , I was very impressed by Grails several months ago and my team decided to build a back - office web application with it .
Initial development was fine but it turned out to be a complete disaster later with ORM bugs not being fixed , upgrades breaking backwards compatibility and too much hassle to maintain the application .
The problem with something like this is that it takes time to show how something behaves long - term and the world does n’t stand still while you ’re doing it .
At the point where you decide to take something out , the project moved on and other components depend on the one you ’re now dropping .
This is especially true if you want to try out a new infrastructural tool .
To solve this problem , Whelan suggested creating “ practice fields ” - have a code base that is set to play .
This might be a pet project that the team is working on when there is slack , where they can experiment and learn new toolkits separate from the real production project .
For this to work , at least in my case , the pet project should be something released into the wild so that you really feel the relief or pain that the new framework or tool bring after a few months .
If it turns sour , it ’s a pet project so you can afford to make it unstable for a while .
Maintaining a pet project brings additional work and cost , but this should be budgeted from R&D , as it helps teams learn and does n’t increase the risk in production .
The Learning Culture Map
Whelan focused his presentation around the Learning Culture Map , effectively key things which organisations have to do in order to promote learning .
The areas on that map are Intentional , Infrastructure , Incremental and Individual Safety .
Learning has to be intentional .
” Do n’t expect learning to just happen ” , said Whelan , “ We need to set out to learn ” .
Teams and organisations can use retrospectives , bringing in coaches and doing research ( sending people to conferences , reading blogs , mailing lists .. ) to promote learning .
They should also promote a culture where asking questions is OK and exercising the R brain ( a concept taken from Andy Hunt ’s Refactor your Wetware book )
Learning also requires special infrastructure .
Whelan advised setting up a workspace that promotes learning ( information radiators , e-mail lists … ) and creating special learning sessions ( road trips , etudes , study groups ) .
As one of tricks that help learning , Whelan suggested “ do food ” ( taken from Linda Rising ’s book Fearless Change ) .
Another helpful idea is to integrate learning and working with pair programming , planning sessions , stand - ups and demos .
As a constant activity , learning should be incremental
Finally , Whelan said that individual safety is crucial to learning .
In this context , individual safety means that people have to feel safe to expose their mental model to the world and ask questions .
Part of the safety is giving people a chance to opt out of any activity that they do n’t feel safe about or do not want to participate in without consequences .
Further reading
Whelan suggested quite a few books for further reading :
He also suggested Thiagi Training Games , a web site with games teams can use to improve their learning skills .
Rays of light from the sun have taken many different paths to compose this image of Saturn and its rings .
This view looks toward the unilluminated ( north ) side of the rings and , at the top of the image , the night side of Saturn .
Sunlight has been reflected off the illuminated side of the rings to light the planet 's southern hemisphere , seen here as a bright band of yellow - orange .
The northern hemisphere , in the top left corner of the image , is dimly lit by light diffusely scattered through the rings .
The planet 's shadow cuts across the rings , but light reflected off the southern hemisphere backlights parts of the C ring , making them visible in silhouette .

Amphibians around the world are in trouble .
Nearly one - third worldwide are threatened with extinction , according to the Global Amphibian Assessment .
And in the face of massive die - offs in the wild , scientists are scrambling to preserve what they can in captivity .
A network of zoos and laboratories operating under the moniker " Amphibian Ark " is laboring to save amphibians with the aim of one day reintroducing them to the wild .
Scientists often liken amphibians to the proverbial canary in the coal mine .
Human activity on earth is causing a mass extinction , and amphibians are among the first species to begin disappearing en masse .
( The last mass extinction occurred when an asteroid slammed into earth 65 million years ago , ending the dinosaurs ' reign . )
That 's partially because amphibians , who interface with their surroundings through highly permeable skin , are extremely sensitive to pollutants and to changes in the environment .
And so scientists are n't sure which of several possible culprits -- more ultraviolet light from a thinner ozone layer , pesticides , habitat loss , global warming -- is most responsible for the observed amphibian die - offs .
Most likely , all of them contribute .
Nonetheless , a prime suspect is a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , or chytrid for short .
Scientists are n't sure where it came from exactly , but they suspect that it was accidentally spread around the world from Southern Africa in the early 20th Century .
At that time , African clawed frogs were in demand for pharmaceutical uses .
Many were captured in Southern Africa and exported .
Perhaps tellingly , South Africa is one of few regions where amphibians have n't recently declined .
That suggests that native species tolerate the fungus with no problem .
And that , in turn , indicates that amphibians and chytrid co-evolved there .
Elsewhere , especially in the New World , amphibians populations have crashed , experiencing dramatic and rapid reductions in both numbers and species diversity .
( Here 's a story on the golden toad disappearing in Costa Rica , and a story on efforts to save the Golden Frog in nearby Panama .
In Central America , chytrid has progressed some 28 - 100 kilometers per year since first appearing in the late 1990s .
Scientists estimate that wherever chytrid appears , 50 percent of amphibian species disappear soon thereafter .
On average , 80 percent of amphibian individuals disappear within one year of chytrid 's first appearance .
Now , a new study in the journal Ecology Letters tells us what happens in the wake of these amphibian disappearances in Central America .
As you might predict , the die - offs cause a massive loss of diversity .
But the loss is not evenly spread .
The amphibian communities left in chytrid's wake tend to look the same more than before the fungus ' arrival .
The frogs that made each community unique have a higher chance of succumbing to chytrid .
The fungus thrives in moist and cool conditions .
Amphibians that inhabit that niche tend to disappear more than those inhabiting other niches .
Relatively speaking , frogs living on dry land have a better chance of making it through .
Chytrid , the authors say , is a great ecosystem homogenizer .
In a press release , Kevin Smith , associate director of the Tyson Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis , and a co-author on the study , calls it " the McDonaldization of the frog communities . "

But consumer advocates say the lack of regulation means that prepaid card users can continue to be blindsided by hidden fees , and have few legal protections to recover their money if a card is lost or a charge disputed .
Mike Henry , who owns a small print shop in California , had not been able to recover $ 50 stuck on his Only 1 Visa prepaid card after it stopped working .
He gave up after numerous calls to customer service  at 95 cents each  went unresolved .
Only 1 , meanwhile , continued to send daily updates of his balance as it was eaten away by monthly fees .
His account was finally whittled to zero .
“ For the last six months , I turn on my computer and check my e-mail and get slapped in the face , ” he said .
Only 1 officials said they regretted his inconvenience and were refunding Mr. Henry ’s money .
Among the beneficiaries of these cards are Visa , MasterCard and Discover , which receive about a nickel to 20 cents each time a credit or debit card emblazoned with their logo is swiped .
While the companies do not disclose income from prepaid cards , their efforts to add tens of millions of users represents a potentially significant source of new revenue .
Financial firms that issue the cards are often little - known companies with names like Green Dot , NetSpend and AccountNow .
Since they get money upfront from the consumer , there is relatively little risk with prepaid debit cards , compared with credit cards and other loan - making products .
Given the number of people who have little or no relationship with a bank , both in the United States and abroad , the financial industry is betting on a boom .
In 2008 , for instance , customers loaded about $ 8.7 billion onto prepaid cards , a 125 percent increase over the previous year , according to the Mercator Advisory Group .
The industry is expected to balloon to $ 119 billion by 2012 , Mercator predicts .
“ Every year we ’ve seen big growth , ” said Steve Streit , the founder of Green Dot , now one of the largest reloadable prepaid card companies .
“ There ’s a part of me that believes we are just at the entry ramp to growth right now . ”
The Soyuz TMA - 16 spacecraft launched today at 07:14 GMT ( 2:14 CDT ) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
On board were Soyuz Commander Max Suraev , NASA Flight Engineer Jeff Williams and spaceflight participant Guy Laliberte , founder of Cirque du Soleil .
They will arrive at the International Space Station on Friday .
If you ’ve ever wondered about some of the unusual rituals the Russians partake in before a launch , an article on Discovery Space outlined the following traditions witnessed over the years by reporters for The Associated Press , or reported in the Russian media :
CARNATIONS FOR YURI : Before leaving for Baikonur , crew members lay red carnations at the monuments of the first Soviet cosmonauts in Star City outside Moscow and visit the office of Yuri Gagarin , the first human in space , and write their names in the visitors ’ book .
ARRIVAL : Cosmonauts arrive in Baikonur on different planes and without their spouses .
They check into the Kosmonaut hotel and walk down the alley where every tree was planted by cosmonauts who successfully returned from space .
MOVIE NIGHT : On the night before the launch , the cosmonauts watch “ The White Sun of the Desert , ” a 1969 comedy about a Russian soldier fighting in Central Asia .
MUSIC : Before leaving for the launch , the cosmonauts sip champagne and leave their signatures on the doors of their hotel rooms .
Then they ride aboard a minibus to the launch pad listening to “ Grass Near Home , ” a 1983 hit of Soviet rock band The Earthlings .
BLESSING : After the Soviet era , black - robed Orthodox priests began to bless each rocket before launch .
SOAKING THE STAND - INS : 30 minutes before the launch , when the main crew is sealed in the spaceship , the cosmonaut ’s stand - ins , who act as backup for the regular crew , are “ soaked ” by gulping vodka shots with journalists at a shabby cafeteria near the launch pad .
SOILING THE WHEEL :
The cosmonauts get out of the bus near the rocket and urinate on its right rear wheel .
The rite dates back to Gagarin himself , who reportedly did not want to soil his space suit during the takeoff .
MASCOT : A mascot , usually a stuffed animal named “ Boris , ” hangs in front of the crew .
When the toy begins to float , the cosmonauts know they are approaching near zero gravity .
LANDING : After the landing in Kazakh steppe , the cosmonauts sign their capsule , which is charred by the heat of re-entry , and drink a bottle of vodka stashed before the launch .
After a helicopter ride to Baikonur , they plant a tree near the Kosmonaut hotel .
RETURN TO MOSCOW : Upon their return to Star City outside Moscow , they pay a final visit to Gagarin ’s monument and go to the church of St. Prince Daniil of Moscow , where they kiss the saint ’s relics .

For those who are already familiar with Nathan Drake – his charm , his style , his ass — this game begins in the most dire of circumstances .
The beloved hero has somehow , to everyone ’s complete surprise , screwed up royally .
You can surmise that much when you ’re hanging over the side of a cliff in a tattered rail car .
This segment alone managed to tickle me endlessly .
Someone at Naughty Dog must really hate Drake .
When you ’re first given the task of getting back to solid ground your first reaction might be to await some epic cutscene .
Unfortunately for Drake he needs your help .
As impossible as the task seemed at the onset you will not believe how hair raising the journey will get towards its end .
That statement sums up the entire game in a nutshell .
I know that there are scholars who have researched the boring aspects of archeology and world history and never found anything quite so fantastic as the basis of this game .
That said I challenge them to close their mouths long enough to form a rebuttal against this game ’s subject .
Drake is now focused on the lost fleet of Marco Polo and the infamous Chintamani Stone .
A relic world renowned mercenary and terrorist Zoran Lazarevic has his eyes and infinite number of goons set on .
The story in this game may take a few liberties but it is a very exciting ride .
It never feels forced no matter what the characters seem set to do .
Drake will find himself in a variety of environments on his quest , each one unique and explained believably .
The main strength of the journey is those who accompany Drake .
We ’re introduced to new romantic interest Chloe who manages to mix sensuality with back stabbing and betrayal .
Just when you think you have her figured out , she ’ll surprise you .
Sullivan and Elena return as well and provide back up for when Drake needs it most .
The banter through out the game will become just as addicting as the gameplay .
This game is all about set pieces .
In the first game a lot of the major story changes and obstacles were handled by unplayable cutscenes .
This game features a minority of those .
You will directly control Drake during most every action scene and even the ones you do n’t will require your complete focus .
I predict this will become a staple of other games as they easily enhance the gameplay beyond its own merit .
Not to say that the gameplay is weak .
Everything mixes together quite nicely .
Several improvements are made to the first game ’s weakest areas .
Gunplay is tightened and the kickback on automatic weapons creates a good dynamic between just holding down the trigger and timing your shots .
Grenades are removed from a dedicated weapon slot and mapped to the R2 trigger .
Cover is a bit improved from the first , and firing from a cliff face as well as other moves make for a savior in tough binds .
Hand to hand combat is handled really creatively .
You can counter an enemy ’s attacks which avoid you from getting too beat up when things get tough .
Do n’t get crazy with that however .
While it does look cool it leaves you open to get shot , particularly in the back .
The enemy variation is a touch you might not expect .
You ’ll become instantly aware of how much damage certain enemies can take at a point .
From juggernauts draped in Kevlar from head to toe wielding shotguns , to faster moving light troops that want you dead more than you know , this game has a multitude of soldier types .
For a game without aliens this is pretty rare .
Whoops , I guess that might be a spoiler .
No aliens .
Take joy in knowing that while you may find some crystal carved skull it wo n’t summon a Spielbergian mothership .
A big complaint fans of the first and those skeptical on the sequel had was undeniably the platforming .
In this it ’s fair and balanced , the FOX news of tomb raiding .
As much as you ’re shooting you ’re constantly traversing the game ’s environments .
Platforming is even more a part of the combat than the first .
You can run and gun in some situations , but in others stealth will be a key portion of the game .
This will have you leaping across balconies , snatching and dropping guards to the ground below as well as snapping their necks before their buddies realize what ’s happened .
This game is all about moving , and you never stop doing that .
I was a bit put off at the idea of stealth in this game but it works beautifully .
Think of the silent predator strategies you learned from Batman : Arkham Asylum and you ’ll be fine .
The puzzles themselves are not very deep .
Although they ’re interesting they ’re also pretty obvious .
However I did n’t necessarily say they were n’t fun .
Like the set pieces , the traversal is made more exciting than you would think .
When debris is crashing all around you and you ’re close to falling to your doom , you ’ll be surprised at how that menial and clear cut objective became a highlight of the game .
The trickiest ones require memorization , and not even real memorization .
You can either get it right , or open Drake ’s journal to figure it out again .
The Nepalese symbols do all look alike , so do n’t feel too bad that you need to look back and forth to figure out patterns .
As I said before the banter in this game is exceptional .
There is a lot of dialogue in this game and an hour and twelve minutes of cutscenes ( note : I counted them up in the main menu , and it was late ) .
The main villain Lazerevic is not too impressive however .
You will become afraid of him , believe me on this , but he ’s not all that special .
There are some great scenes with portraying him as a hated guy , and as tough as his minions are at some stages they only allude to your inevitable encounter with the big dog .
The main issue with Zoran as a villain is just that he seems like the hired muscle .
We ’ve seen mercs as the middle men in games / movies for years , so basing your main villain as one , no matter how big a douche he is just does n’t set right .
A small oversight for otherwise wonderfully crafted characters .
You really see the motivations of Drake and his friends as well as learn something about each of them by the time the game ends .
As much as Grand Theft Auto IV prided itself on having good story - telling , this game trounces it convincingly .
Not to mention the performances by everyone .
There ’s no character that seems out of place in this game making the entire world , as crazy as it may be completely believable .
A class act by the cast as well as the animators .
Just taking a look at these screens you can tell this game looks amazing .
Best looking console game by far .
There ’s a portion where you are traveling across the battered rooftops of Nepal and the splendor of the lighting hits on all fronts .
The graphics are n’t realistic , but they ’re not overly cartoony either .
It ’s a very unique look that matches everything well in a visual style all to its own .
Then there are those segments of rock face or ruin that just make you ask how the hell they could make it look that good .
Naughty
Dog has been known to share its development tools with first and second party developers , and with technology like this in play it just begs the question of how good they can get games to look .
For the duration of the ride I was completely soaking in the experience .
I was agreeing with every positive review I read , and Adam Sessler was being undeniably right for once .
But then I hit the wall .
Readers , when you finally reach the City of “ You ’re Going To Crap Yourself When You See It , ” pick up every Crossbow you find .
They ’ll make your journey a lot easier .
But it ’s a shame that the game tries so hard to break itself at the end of the journey .
I guess Naughty Dog felt the need to make the last hour or so incredibly difficult to prolong the climax .
While it only takes a few tries to overcome the sequences , you will fail in the most frustratingly annoying ways that will defeat you temporarily .
If they ’d just maintained the same enemy balance as they had throughout the game this could have been avoided .
I may be in the majority here , but I was shocked when my clear time clocked in at around 10hrs .
That was only a mere 2hrs more than it took me to blow through the first game , but the substance of the game made it feel far longer for me .
There ’s a difference between a solid experience that you enjoy thoroughly and one you just breeze through .
This is easily a solid singelplayer experience that makes many games look less fulfilling regardless of length .
On the plus side there ’s a lot of incentive to keep playing .
You ’ll unlock character skins , weapons and cheats , modes and rendering styles .
It really does lend itself to that time in gaming where developers used to throw in bonus stuff that they fooled around with while they were bored .
Playing the game over again with Donut Drake is a must do .
Not only does his appearance change but his voice does as well .
You can tell the developers knew what they were doing with some weight sensitive dialogue in certain spots .
Also if you ’re anal about replays and how they ’re never unique the second time , you can enhance this with Mirror World .
It flips the game from right to left .
You ’ll really be surprised how that messes with your memory .
It makes a lot of areas feel new .
That said , you always have a sense of urgency throughout the game .
A lot of times in the progression of games I find myself second guessing the choices of the cast .
Why is the enemy doing this , why am I doing this .
You do n’t really feel that way throughout this game .
You really feel like Drake knows what he ’s doing , even when he does n’t .
No matter how incredibly crazy his obstacles are and how he chooses to face them , you ’re willing to go with him every step of the way .
That ’s a rare attachment that you get to a video game character .
One that translates into a resoundingly well crafted experience .
It keeps you on your toes , keeps you centered around the main character , and makes you laugh in the end when you somehow got out of that awful mess .
You feel complete at the end of the game .
No cheap sequel setups , just a great ride that was immersive from start to finish .
Although Drake ’s body count is high enough to keep him in the ranks of Rambo and he gets out of more bad situations than John McClane , he still feels like a regular guy .
This game has some generation defining moments .
It redefines how a game has to engage its players .
You ’ll have to judge for yourself if it ’s the best game ever .
It ’s an amazing experience that has more great moments in a single level than most games do in their entire experience , but that ’s totally dependent on the gameplay clicking in the first place .
I can say from everything I ’ve gotten out of this that Uncharted 2 is the best game I ’ve played on the Playstation 3 , maybe even this generation .
Naughty
Dog put a lot of polish into this game to make sure it was better than the first , and it shows .
As much as I liked the first game , this is better in all the right ways .
I had a few front runners for my GOTY pick , but this game would have to win in my book .
If you have a Playstation 3 and do not check this game out then you ’re doing a great disservice to yourself , not me .
Oh , and before we end , check Drake ’s journal .
You ’ll find a few treats inside that will reveal the secret origins of Victor Sullivan , the one responsible for that awesome quote in the review title .
Yes , he is a dirty old man .
Here are the
on the use of Haskell for constructing EDSLs for high performance computing , along with a 10 minute overview of Haskell support for multicore programming , presented at the LACSS 2009 Workshop on Non-Traditional Programming Models .
Abstract
As the complexity of large - scale computing architecture increases , the effort needed to program these machines efficiently has grown dramatically .
The challenge is how to bridge this “ programmability gap ” , making the hardware more accessible to domain experts .
We argue for an approach based on
executable embedded domain specific languages ( EDSLs ) — small languages with focused expressive power hosted directly in existing high - level programming languages such as Haskell .
We provide examples of EDSLs in use in industry today , and describe the advantages EDSLs have over general purpose languages in productivity , performance , correctness and cost .
Researchers reported the presence of bacteria on gold surfaces but have never clearly elucidated their role .
Now , an international team of scientists has found that there may be a biological reason for the presence of these bacteria on gold grain surfaces .
“ A number of years ago we discovered that the metal - resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans occurred on gold grains from two sites in Australia .
The sites are 3500 km apart , in southern New South Wales and northern Queensland , so when we found the same organism on grains from both sites we thought we were onto something .
It made us wonder why these organisms live in this particular environment .
The results of this study point to their involvement in the active detoxification of Au complexes leading to formation of gold biominerals ” , explains Frank Reith , leader of the research and working at the University of Adelaide ( Australia ) .
Frank Reith looking for samples in Australia .
The experiments showed that C. metallidurans rapidly accumulates toxic gold complexes from a solution prepared in the lab .
This process promotes gold toxicity , which pushes the bacterium to induce oxidative stress and metal resistance clusters as well as an as yet uncharacterized Au-specific gene cluster in order to defend its cellular integrity .
This leads to active biochemically - mediated reduction of gold complexes to nano - particulate , metallic gold , which may contribute to the growth of gold nuggets .
This image shows maps of pure gold with other elements .
By determining what elements there are , scientists can see where the gold is located in relation to the cells .
These maps are quantitative X - ray fluorescence maps showing the distribution of gold , calcium , copper , iron , sulphur and zinc in an individual cell after a minute exposure to Au( III ) at pH 7.0 ( the quantified area is marked in the image , and concentrations are in the image ) .
Credits : Reith et al , PNAS 5 - 9 October 2009 .
For this study scientists combined synchrotron techniques at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) and the Advanced Photon Source ( APS ) and molecular microbial techniques to understand the biomineralisation in bacteria .
It is the first time that these techniques have been used in the same study , so Frank Reith brought together a multinational team of experts in both areas for the success of the experiment .
The team was made up of scientists from the University of Adelaide , the Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization ( CSIRO ) , the University of California ( US ) , the University of Western Ontario and the University of Saskatchewan ( Canada ) , Martin - Luther - Universität ( Germany ) , University of Nebraska - Lincoln ( US ) , SCK.CEN ( Belgium ) and the APS ( US ) and the ESRF ( France ) .
This is the first direct evidence that bacteria are actively involved in the cycling of rare and precious metals , such as gold .
These results open the doors to the production of biosensors :
“ The discovery of an Au-specific operon means that we can now start to develop gold - specific biosensors , which will help mineral explorers to find new gold deposits .
To achieve this we need to further characterize the gold - specific operon on a genomic as well as proteomic level .
If funding for this research is granted I believe we can produce a functioning biosensor within three to five years ” , concludes Reith .

Based solely on distortions made by examiners during my polygraph at the NSA in March of 2000 , the FBI had initiated an investigation of me for possible espionage with Taiwan .
The investigation took close to a year , and cost quite a bit of money and valuable time and agent resources .
The case was found to be baseless , and was finally closed with a phonecon between myself with the FBI 's Honolulu office nearly a year after the investigation had started !
If only they had called me earlier , I could have cleared up the matter with them , and saved the taxpayers $ $ !
As for the " distortions " .
I served 20 years as a military linguist ( Mandarin Chinese ) .
Two years before retiring ( still on active duty ) I attended a seminar in Taiwan .
My command knew all about it ( they even wanted to pay for it due to the language training value ) .
Anyway , I had to go to the Taiwan Coordination Counsel in Honolulu to apply to attend the seminar , get a visa ..etc .
During one of the trips I got to chatting with the Officer - in - Charge .
It 's not often I got to practice my chinese with a native speaker .
Anyway , he ended up suckering me into translating for free ( Chinese to English ) a 20 page directive just faxed in from Taipei which set forth new rules for americans wanting to work in Taiwan .
I guess he was too cheap to pay a actual translation service !
He asked me if I would be interested in working for them part time .
Since I was still on active duty , I had to decline .
The job would have entailed acting as a liaison between the local community and the Taiwan office .
Pretty innocuous , and a valid need on their part .
They can easily communicate with me since I am bilingual , and of course , being an american , I can communicate better with locals coming into their office .
But not so innocent according to the ever vigilant dickhead polygraphers at the NSA who see a spy behind every bush ...
During my polygraph , the examiner claimed I was being " deceptive " on the " foreign contacts " question .
I told them all about the above contact with Taiwan .
They evidently did n't buy it , convinced their polygraphic contraption was indicating I was spying for taiwan .
I failed the test , and an FBI investigation was initiated !
I post this as an example of how information volunteeered during a polygraph can be distorted .
It is amazing , and a bit funny , that they would waste the FBI 's resources and time on such nonesense !

Buffalo Blue Burger
As Labor Day sneaks up on us we decided to say goodbye to summer with a week of burger posts .
Enjoy !
~ Mary ~
Usually Red
Hot sauce is just that RED HOT , but I ’ve got a little trick up my sleeve that gives these burgers a more mellow heat .
OPEN WIDE !
I tried these with the blue cheese , honey and red hot also mixed into the burger on a few and they did not turn out as well as the plain seasoned burger – they kind of fell apart on the grill .
Other Burgers you might enjoy :

Sergei Kostitsyn a décidé de ne pas se rapporter aux Bulldogs de Hamilton .
Pire encore , le joueur bélarussien a fait savoir à la direction de l'équipe - par l'intermédiaire de son agent Don Meehan - qu'il désirait être échangé .
« Il nous a envoyé le message qu'il ne veut pas se rapporter aux Bulldogs » , a confirmé le directeur général Bob Gainey .
« Pour le moment , il est suspendu et il aimerait être échangé à une autre équipe . »
Rappelons que le cadet des frères Kostitsyn a connu un camp difficile , marqué notamment par un retard en vue du match préparatoire à Québec .
Il a été cédé aux Bulldogs de Hamilton la fin de semaine dernière .
« À court terme , on aimerait qu'il se présente à Hamilton .
Il doit reprendre la forme qu'il avait il y a environ lorsqu'il jouait bien dans la Ligue nationale avec nous .
Quand il sera de retour à ce niveau , je crois qu'il pourrait se retrouver un poste dans la LNH » , a expliqué le directeur général du CH .
Cette situation est délicate pour le Tricolore , mais Gainey n'est pas trop inquiet pour son grand frère Andrei .
« Nous sommes passés par la même situation l'an dernier quand Sergei a été rétrogradé alors je ne crois pas que ça affecte Andrei » , affirme - t - il .
Sergei Kostitsyn a réclamé une transaction et il pourrait peut - être songer à retourner en Europe même s'il possède un contrat de la LNH pour la saison 2009 - 10 .
« Nous n'avons pas la garantie qu'il souhaite rester en Amérique du Nord » , a brièvement commenté Gainey à ce sujet .
Kostitsyn avait également été renvoyé aux Bulldogs , la saison dernière , à cause de la qualité inégale de son jeu .
Il avait par ailleurs fait l'objet d'une controverse , en compagnie de son frère Andrei , à cause de leurs relations avec un prétendu membre du crime organisé .
L'hiver dernier , Sergei Kostitsyn a été limité à huit buts et 15 aides en 56 rencontres avec le Canadien .
Il a disputé 16 matchs avec les Bulldogs .
En 108 matchs en deux saisons dans la LNH , il a 17 buts et 33 aides .
Gordon Brown today moved to lift Labour 's depressed morale on the first day of its pre-election conference by mounting a populist warning to reckless banks that he will use new laws , and unprecedented ministerial pressure , to demand they rein in bonuses .
As party officials tried to portray the conference as the start of a concerted fightback , Brown insisted in an interview : " I do not roll over " – but admitted he had thought privately as to whether he was the right man to lead Labour .
In a move to pitch Labour on the side of the middle classes , and portray the Tories as once again the unreconstructed allies of the rich , Brown is attempting to capture a bash - the - bankers mood in the country at large .
But as senior ministers lined up in weekend interviews to demand that the party finally takes the fight to the Tories , Brown , on - air on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show , suffered the indignity of being forced to deny that he was on anti-depressants .
The line of questioning infuriated Downing Street aides already angry that a denied rumour in the rightwing blogosphere had been pursued by the mainstream media .
Meanwhile , the chancellor , Alistair Darling , in common with the French finance minister , Christine Lagarde , will call in bankers this week to issue his toughest warning yet that he will act against bonuses and will have public backing to do so .
Both claim they now have the support of G20 leaders , who met in Pittsburgh last week to demand collectively that banks focus on rebuilding their capital base , rather than paying out unjustified bonuses .
Ministers want action to rein in what is expected to be a bumper round of bonuses at Christmas .
Regulators will have the power to force individual banks to build their capital base if they continue to pay excessive bonuses .
It is also likely Darling will demand greater transparency , with boardrooms required to do more to publish salaries below boardroom level .
He will promise " legislation to end the reckless culture that puts short - term profits over long - term success " .
He will tell the conference : " It will mean an end to automatic bank bonuses year after year .
It will mean an end to immediate payouts for top management .
Any bonuses will be deferred over time , so they can be clawed back if they are warranted by long term performance .
" We wo n't allow greed and recklessness to ever again endanger the whole global economy and the lives of millions of people . "
He will also stress that the bankers do not have to wait for legislation to act responsibly this Christmas .
Although Labour is not going to back caps on individual bonuses , the rhetorical shift is important , with the party moving from a mainly managerial critique of the risk structure of bonuses to a wider criticism of their absolute level .
Labour has been given polling advice that the public still responds to the idea that the Conservatives are led by privileged public schoolboys .
In another populist move , Brown is on the brink of committing himself to giving voters the power to recall MPs found to have broken parliamentary rules on expenses or standards .
The prime minister was still debating whether to include the plan in his conference speech as part of a wider theme of increasing the accountability of politics .
Brown , who will offer himself to voters as a man who has overcome political and personal adversity all his life , is desperate to come out of the conference season with a lift in the polls .
He fears that if Labour remains 15 points behind the Conservatives at Christmas he will face calls from within the cabinet to stand aside .
A ComRes poll for the Independent showed the Tories on 38 % and Labour neck - and - neck with the Liberal Democrats on 23 % .
It also showed that Labour would do better with any one of eight other possible leaders than with Brown .
Brown told the BBC : " I 've become utterly convinced as I 've talked to my fellow colleagues at Pittsburgh , just how far we all have to go because they 're all reporting to me that the banks are just anxious to return to the bad old days .
Some of them are ready to announce big bonuses that are completely unacceptable " .
Brown also moved to restore faith in his ability to bring the deficit under control by saying he will introduce a law requiring the Treasury to halve the deficit by 2014 .
It was not clear what sanctions could be imposed if it missed the target .
Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , was one of an array of ministers to defend Brown 's leadership and judgement .
He said : " As to the prime minister , I 'd rather have a man who knows his own mind , grasps the picture and sticks to his guns , rather than a shallow flibbertigibbet who has not had the guts to take on his own party , let alone find any ideas to change the country . "
The Labour conference is being billed as " operation fightback " with cabinet ministers admitting they are the underdogs , but insisting that if the party can regain its will to win , the election need not be lost .
The Welsh secretary , Peter Hain , said : " We must not behave as if a Tory win is inevitable , " and argued that unless the party picked itself up " we might as well wrap conference up now , go home and wait for David Cameron to give that smarmy smile of his from the steps of No 10 " .
Many ministers were also privately pressing Brown not to dwell on his record in handling the recession , but instead on offering an optimistic prospectus for the future .

After successfully overturning a ban on his presence in the country , Geert Wilders was never going to slip quietly into the UK .
Geert Wilders was at the centre of a media scrum
The controversial Dutch politician sent a text message to Associated Press as he cleared customs at Heathrow to ensure the world 's media had got the message .
But even he cannot have anticipated the scenes waiting for him in Westminster , as he swept into a side street opposite the Houses of Parliament .
His plan to stage an open - air news conference around the corner on College Green had to be abandoned when about 40 protesters arrived on the scene chanting " Wilders go to hell " and waving placards saying " Sharia for the Netherlands " and " Islam will be superior " .
The MP , who is an outspoken critic of Muslim ideology and has called for the Koran to be banned , was bundled through a gate in the high stone wall surrounding Abbey Gardens , an outpost of the House of Lords which was to be the venue for his hastily rearranged conference .
The young Muslims outside , held in check by a line of police officers , chanted " Wilders running scared " and " Wilders come out " - but they were far outnumbered by reporters and photographers , many from the MP 's native Netherlands , who seemed even more desperate to get into the overcrowded venue .
Insulted
They also proved an eager audience for the protesters ' claims that " the Muslims will be dominant " and " we want Sharia law " .
The protesters ' main complaint against Mr Wilders was that he had insulted the Prophet Muhammad .
I think being here today in the UK is a victory
Geert Wilders
The group dismissed suggestions they were playing into his hands with their chants of " free speech go to hell " , arguing they had a right to counter his " rubbish " .
Asked if they were representing the views of other Muslims , one replied : " It is not about representing Muslims .
It is about representing Islam . "
But Sayful Islam , who was leading their anti-Wilders chants , said he believed Mr Wilders ' views on Islam were shared by " every Western government " .
" He is just the open voice of the Western governments .
This is exactly what they wish to follow , " he said .
Protesters were held back by a line of police officers Mr Islam told reporters Mr Wilders was a " dog " who should be " tried by an Islamic court " for insulting the Prophet but he refused to say what he thought the MP 's punishment should be .
" I am not silly , " he grinned , hinting that he was aware where the media were trying to lead him .
" Do your research , " added another protester .
Asked if he was representing a particular group , Mr Islam smiled again and said : " I am with the Muslims , man . "
After about half an hour , the protesters disappeared as quickly as they had arrived , their point seemingly made .
' Voice of reason '
Meanwhile , inside the building , Mr Wilders was telling reporters : " I think being here today in the UK is a victory .
It 's not so much a victory for myself .
I am not that important .
It is a victory for freedom of speech . "
The Freedom Party MP then did his best to sound like the voice of reason , saying that although he would have preferred to stage his news conference on College Green as planned , he was pleased the young Muslims had exercised their democratic right to demonstrate , something he said would be denied them in an Islamist state .
Pressed further on the purpose of his visit to the UK , given that he was not going to screen the film that had caused him to be banned in February , he said it would allow him to speak to his lawyers and friends face - to - face rather than over the internet but really it was a " token of victory " .
You can be as rude as you like about Jesus Christ , the Virgin Mary , anything you want and you do not inspire the violent hatred
Lord Pearson , UK Independence Party
He was quizzed about his views on Islam and his unsuccessful attempt in the Dutch parliament to get the Koran banned , using the same laws under which Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf was outlawed .
He had been defeated in a vote , he said , and as a democrat he had accepted that .
There was then a heated exchange with reporters standing on chairs at the back of the room , craning to get a look at him over the forest of microphones , about whether he should also have called for the Bible to be banned , given that some Christians were terrorists .
That was not his argument at all , he told the reporters , although his attempt to elucidate further was drowned out by more questions .
He denied his call for the Koran to be banned had been an affront to free speech .
" Even in the United States , where they have a first amendment , there is one red line , which is the incitement of violence and this was exactly my point , " he told reporters .
His host , the UKIP peer Lord Pearson claimed that if Mr Wilders had called for the Bible to be banned , " none of this would have happened " .
" You can say ban the Bible .
You can be as rude as you like about Jesus Christ , the Virgin Mary , anything you want and you do not inspire the violent hatred which is coming from them towards us .
We do not hate them .
We do not hate them .
We fear them . "
Did the peer also want to outlaw the Koran ?
" I do n't agree with that at all .
I want the Koran discussed very much more and I want it particularly discussed by the 98 % or whatever it is of the Muslim community who are mild , peace - loving people .
" But what I want them to do is to get up off their bottoms and take on their violent co-religionists who do base these acts of evil on the Koran . "

The Container Crisis Shipping Industry Fights for Survival
The global economic crisis is wreaking havoc on shipping : Demand and prices have collapsed and ports are filling up with fleets of empty freighters .
The crisis has fueled cut - throat competition and not all companies will survive .
Germany 's Hapag - Lloyd alone needs 1.75 billion euros to stay afloat .
Having agreed with almost everyone else on Friday that the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Obama makes him look ridiculous , we would now like to take exception from several points of conventional wisdom about the award .
The first point , offered by fair - minded critics and embarrassed supporters of the president , is that he is not to blame for the Norwegian Nobel Committee 's decision : " President Obama has won the Nobel Prize for Peace - - but that 's not his fault , " declares a Washington Post editorial .

The sale also includes a total transfer of technology , which would enable Brazil to assemble most of the Rafale jets itself and sell them regionally .
The contract might rise to 120 aircraft .
The terms illustrate the pressures on Dassault and a handful of other military companies competing in a tightening global market .
Not only are advanced new American and European jets coming to market , but also looming on the horizon are the prospect of advanced unmanned fighters and even competition from China , using technology from Israeli and Russian jets .
Jean - Paul Hébert , a strategic expert at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris , says Dassault is facing “ an appallingly hard decision ” as it debates the post - Rafale era .
“ Long - term research costs are very heavy , and the French arms industry has not been that commercially very successful alone , ” he said .
The Rafale was conceived in the mid-1980s and first test - flown in 1991 as a successor to a series of aircraft that included the Mirage , which earned its stripes during the Six - Day War in the Middle East .
Some 2,800 Mirages were delivered , more than half  57 percent  for export .
But the French military wanted new capabilities , and so Dassault turned to the Rafale .
The first prototype was built in 1986 , and it entered service in 2001 .
Its sleek twin - or single - seat jets are recognizable by their main Delta wings and mini-canard wings below the cockpit ; land and sea versions have been built .
Its engine is made by the French company Snecma , and Dassault expects the plane to be enhanced by an upgraded RBE2 radar from Thales , in which Dassault took a 26 percent stake this year .
Dassault has come close to exporting the Rafale before , notably to Morocco in 2007 and Singapore and South Korea previously , but those governments chose American hardware instead .
The disappointments were blamed on bureaucratic problems in Paris and Washington ’s greater clout .
In 1961 , New York Post columnist Leonard Lyons contacted John F. Kennedy after seeing Presidential autographs for sale in a store and informed him of the prices .
At the time , George Washington ’s was priced at $ 175 , Ulysses S. Grant ’s at $ 55 , Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s at $ 75 , Teddy Roosevelt ’s at $ 67.50 , and JFK ’s at $ 75 .
Below is the response mailed to Lyons .

Dear Leonard :
I appreciate your letter about the market on Kennedy signatures .
It is hard to believe that the going price is so high now .
In order not to depress the market any further , I will not sign this letter .

As the comments go back and forth and the sparks fly , there are occasional moments when a fundamental truth is illuminated .
Take this comment from mothballs I came across on a thread in the Daily Mail .
( Presumably the MMGW stands for man-made global warming . )
To MMGW zealots answer the following :-
ALL man produced CO2 ends tomorrow : -
The Gobi and Sahara deserts bloom ?
Fish stocks in the North Sea regenerate ?
All people in Africa no longer starve ?
All disease is ended ?
The Arctic and Antarctic ice fields refreeze ?
All hurricane and flood activity ends ?
The Earth becomes a paradise where all 7 billion of us live in harmony with no deprivation ?
All wars and religious hatred cease ?
In formulating this rather eloquent list of humanity 's failings and failures , mothballs unwittingly perhaps makes the case for those who argue that climate change is part of a much bigger set of problems that all feed on each other .
As this blog has repeatedly tried to emphasize , climate change is about more than climate .
It is about people and places , politics and power .
But mostly it is about people , all 7 billion of us .
Thanks to all 7 billion of us , mankind has outrun the planet 's ability to sustain us .
Thanks to all 7 billion of us , we are forced to live in threatened habitats .
Thanks to all 7 billion of us , we can't adjust to changes as rapidly as we need to .
Thanks to all 7 billion of us , governments are under growing pressures to keep their share of the pie and let the other fellow worry about his .
As a believer , I am convinced that climate change acts as a multiplier and forcing agent on a whole range of issues , not just climate .
In other words , it makes them worse and it makes them happen faster than they otherwise might have .
So no , ending all man produced CO2 tomorrow wo n't make the deserts bloom , it wo n't usher in an era of prosperity and the brotherhood of man .
But it is a part of the problem and it does need to be a part of the solution .
That much I do believe .
This essay first appeared in Planet Restart .

One day while digesting the latest piece of bad news about the economy , I thought about my grandchildren and wondered what they would be worrying about when they were adults .
I decided that economic downturns come and go , but CLIMATE CHANGE is here ( more ...

Windows 7 Ultimate has been cracked .
The pirate milestone , reached almost three months before Windows 7 is set to hit General Availability on October 22 , 2009 , was achieved via OEM instant offline activation that passes Windows Genuine Advantage validation and keeps the operating system permanently activated .
Previous cracks were n't as solid : while they may be working now , they can easily be disabled by Microsoft .
This one wo n't be so easy .
Both 32 - bit and 64 - bit Windows 7 Ultimate can now easily be activated , according to My Digital Life .
For Windows 7 Professional , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows 7 Home Basic , and Windows 7 Starter , the OEM - System - Locked Preinstallation ( SLP ) keys have n't been leaked , so they can not be OEM - activated yet .
It wo n't be long before easy - to - use Windows 7 activation toolkits start appearing in the wild .
The story begins with a Windows 7 Ultimate OEM DVD ISO from Lenovo leaking to a Chinese forum .
The boot . wim file was then used to retrieve the OEM - SLP product key and OEM certificate for Windows 7 Ultimate .
The SLP is a procedure used by Microsoft to preactivate the Windows operating system for mass distribution by major OEMs .
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 use SLP version 2.1 , which is backwards - compatible with version 2.0 , the version Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 use .
As such , after the OEM certificate and OEM product key were extracted , it was discovered that Windows 7 uses the same digitally signed OEM certificate , which has an .xrm - ms extension , that Vista uses .
The extracted Windows 7 Ultimate OEM -SLP product key can be used to activate an installed Windows 7 Ultimate system , and since the product key appears to be a master OEM - SLP product key for Windows 7 Ultimate , it can activate Windows 7 Ultimate from any OEM .
Furthermore , even if the user already has a retail version of Windows 7 Ultimate installed , it can be converted to an OEM version with two simple commands , and then activated .
This is a major breakthrough for the Windows piracy world and a huge blow to Microsoft .
Even if it was imminent , the fact that it has occurred so soon means pirates will have activated copies of Windows 7 a good week before even MSDN and TechNet subscribers get their hands on the RTM build on August 6 , not to mention all the other groups Microsoft plans to give the build to .
The Windows 7 RTM and Windows Server 2008 RTM build was compiled on July 13 , 2009 and the official announcement was made on July 22 , 2009 .
Update
" We ’re aware of reports of activation exploits that attempt to circumvent activation & validation in Windows 7 , and we can assure customers that Microsoft is committed to protecting our customers and partners from counterfeit and pirated software , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" Microsoft strongly advises customers not to download Windows 7 from unauthorized sources and downloading Windows 7 from peer - to - peer Web sites is piracy , and exposes users to increased risks - such as viruses , Trojans and other malware and malicious code — that usually accompany counterfeit software .
These risks can seriously harm or permanently destroy data and often expose users to identity theft and other criminal schemes . "
A group of organizations that support religious liberty sent a letter ( PDF ) to Attorney General Eric Holder yesterday .
The coalition includes the American Humanist Association , Americans United for Separation of Church and State , American Civil Liberties Union , Interfaith Alliance , Center for Inquiry , and the Secular Coalition for America .
The issue at hand is an Office of Legal Counsel memo from 2007 that states the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ( “ RFRA ” ) allows for religious discrimination .
The coalition says the memo was wrong , adding that it “ threatens core civil rights and religious freedom protections . ”
The OLC Memo wrongly asserts that RFRA is “ reasonably construed ” to require that a federal agency categorically exempt a religious organization from an explicit federal nondiscrimination provision tied to a grant program .
Although the OLC Memo ’s conclusion is focused on one Justice Department program , its overly - broad and questionable interpretation of RFRA has been cited by other Federal agencies and extended to other programs and grants .
The guidance in the OLC Memo is not justified under applicable legal standards and threatens to tilt policy toward an unwarranted end that would damage civil rights and religious liberty .
…
The OLC Memo… stands as one of the most notable examples of the Bush Administration ’s attempt to impose a constitutionally questionable and unwise policy — RFRA should not be interpreted or employed as a tool for broadly overriding statutory protections against religious discrimination or to create a broad free exercise right to receive government grants without complying with applicable regulations that protect taxpayers .
The coalition wants the Obama administration to review the memo , withdraw it , and then disavow it .
Of course , this group is right .
You ca n’t give federal money to religious groups and then allow them to fire gays , atheists , and anyone else they deem unworthy .
If they accept the money , they need to abide by the law , and the law does n’t allow for that type of discrimination .
Will the administration pay any attention ?
Obama ’s track record on progressives ’ issues has n’t been what I had hoped it would be .
But these organizations represent a huge segment of the people who voted for him — liberals are members or supporters of many of the groups on this list .
In any case , it is very cool to see so many organizations working together on this shared agenda item .
The more we can stick together , the more affect we ’ll have on the political process .
The Wi-Fi Alliance has announced a new way for WiFi- enabled devices to connect to one another , even in the absence of a WiFi base station .
The new protocol , dubbed " Wi - Fi Direct , " will allow any device that implements the standard to connect directly to another device to send and receive data .
Previously codenamed " Wi - Fi peer to peer , " the technology allows any device with WiFi to easily connect to another , such as a cell phone or camera to a printer , or even a keyboard or mouse to a computer .
Devices can connect one - to - one or in a group .
According to the Wi-Fi Alliance , devices implementing the new standard will even be able to connect to legacy WiFi devices in most cases .
" Wi - Fi Direct represents a leap forward for our industry , " said Wi -Fi Alliance executive director Edgar Figueroa in a statement .
" Wi - Fi users worldwide will benefit from a single - technology solution to transfer content and share applications quickly and easily among devices , even when a Wi -Fi access point is n't available .
The impact is that Wi-Fi will become even more pervasive and useful for consumers and across the enterprise . "
The technology seems to compete directly with Bluetooth , which has been the most common standard for direct peer - to - peer device connections .
The new Bluetooth 3.0 standard even includes the ability to switch to WiFi protocols for large , sustained data transfers .
Like Bluetooth , Wi -Fi Direct devices can discover each other automatically and " advertise " available services .
Given these features , Wi-Fi Direct could potentially eliminate the need for implementing both standards in most devices .
A side benefit of Wi-Fi Direct is that it can operate at higher speeds and greater distances than Bluetooth , though Bluetooth typically uses far less power than WiFi .
Furthermore , the standard is aimed at enterprise use as well as consumer use , with the inclusion of enterprise management features and WPA2 security .
The Wi-Fi Direct specification is expected to be published as soon as it is finalized and approved by the Wi-Fi Alliance members , and certification will begin in 2010 .
BALTIMORE | A 17 - year - old sex offender escaped from a juvenile treatment program in Baltimore County while on a group outing to the movies and spent the night at the home of a female counselor at the facility , where the pair had sex , police said Thursday .
The youth was arrested Wednesday in Laurel , Del. , police said .
The 26 - year - old counselor , Tyra M. Greenfield , was taken into custody Wednesday at her home near the juvenile facility .
Miss Greenfield was charged with sexual child abuse and harboring a fugitive .
While the age of consent for sexual intercourse in Maryland is 16 , it is a crime for an adult to have sex with a minor who is in the adult ’s custody or care .
The circumstances of the escape were surprising to police , said Lt. James DeWees , commander of the Golden Ring state police barracks , who investigated the incident .
“ Very rarely do you ever think that someone inside a facility like that would go to the lengths that they went to , to assist him in escaping and then harboring and to ultimately be charged with a sex crime at the end of it , ” Lt. DeWees said .
“ It ’s a bit shocking . ”
Miss Greenfield has been fired from the privately - run New Directions program , which is the only secure treatment facility in Maryland for juvenile sex offenders , said Tammy M. Brown , a spokeswoman for the Department of Juvenile Services .
The department ’s inspector general will investigate the incident and evaluate the program , and child advocates will interview youths , Ms. Brown said .
While the escape itself is not likely to lead to sanctions against the program , the department could stop referring youths there if broader problems are uncovered , she said .
Ms. Brown and Lt. DeWees both said they could not recall any major incidents in recent years at New Directions , which sits on the Parkville campus of a larger juvenile facility , the Charles H. Hickey School .
While the residential treatment program at Hickey was closed in 2005 , a detention center remains .
About 20 youths are enrolled in the New Directions program and are kept separate from the other youths at Hickey , Ms. Brown said .
Youths in the program can earn the privilege to leave the facility for group outings , and between 10 and 12 youths went to a movie Monday night at the AMC Loews White Marsh multiplex , accompanied by several counselors .
The teen ran off when the group was in the parking lot after the movie .
Miss Greenfield was waiting for him in a car parked nearby , Lt. DeWees said .
The two went to Miss Greenfield ’s home , where they spent the night and had sex , Lt. DeWees said .
Miss Greenfield told police that her relationship with the youth was not sexual before the escape , he said .
On Tuesday night , she drove the youth to a relative ’s home in Delaware , then returned home .
The youth used Miss Greenfield ’s cell phone to call the family member , and that led police to discover her involvement , Lt. DeWees said .

Robot - maker Boston Dynamics showed for the first time on Tuesday a new prototype robot that walks upright like a human .
Wired.com reported :
“ Petman will balance itself and move freely ; walking , crawling and doing a variety of suit - stressing calisthenics during exposure to chemical warfare agents , ” the company promises .
“ Petman will also simulate human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature , humidity and sweating when necessary , all to provide realistic test conditions .
” Like Boston Dynamics ’ BigDog robo-mule , Petman stays upright , even when it ’s shoved .
And the thing walks heel - to - toe at 3.2 miles per hour , just like a flesh - and - blood person .
Petman may be just one of a number of attempts by robot - makers to build a simulated set of biped legs .
But I have n’t seen one that gets closer to the real deal .

“ I , for one , like that the torso section of PETMAN looks like a sweet boom box and I hope that someday Boston Dynamics sees fit to let the robot loose in the business district of a small town , just walking around and taking in the scenery while pumping out some old - school rap , ” quipped Doug Aamoth at CrunchGear .
Boston Dynamics is also the creator of the “ Big Dog , ” a four - legged pack mule of sorts that follows soldiers carrying gear .
Video of both robotics breakthroughs are below .

Apple today announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter ( third calendar quarter ) of 2009 .
Apple posted revenue of $ 9.87 billion and net quarterly profit of $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.82 per diluted share , compared to revenue of $ 7.9 billion and net quarterly profit of $ 1.14 billion , or $ 1.26 per diluted share , in the year - ago quarter .
Gross margin was 36.6 percent , compared to 34.7 percent in the year - ago quarter , and international sales accounted for 46 percent of the quarter 's revenue .
The numbers represent the most profitable quarter in Apple 's history and include record - breaking Mac and iPhone quarterly sales .
Using non-GAAP data , which eliminates subscription - based accounting for the iPhone and Apple TV , Apple would have had $ 12.25 billion revenue and $ 2.85 billion of net income .
The subscription - based accounting used for Apple 's official results parcels out income from iPhone and Apple TV sales over a 24 - month period from the date of sale , whereas the non-GAAP results count the entire revenue from these sales in the quarter they were made .
Apple shipped 3.05 million Macintosh computers during the quarter , a unit increase of 17 percent over the year - ago quarter .
The company also sold 10.2 million iPods during the quarter , representing 8 percent unit decline over the year - ago quarter .
Quarterly iPhone unit sales reached 7.4 million , up 7 percent from the year - ago quarter .
Apple 's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 includes expected revenue of $ 11.3 billion to $ 11.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $ 1.70 to $ 1.78 .
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2009 financial results conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific , andwill update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights .

A former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor who founded the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch alleges Rupert Murdoch ’s publishing company , HarperCollins , killed his autobiography because he criticized Fox News in the book .
Murdoch is chairman of News Corp. , which owns both Fox News and HarperCollins , as well as the New York Post , the Wall Street Journal and numerous other media outlets .
ADVERTISEMENT
Larry Klayman , who led Judicial Watch in numerous lawsuits against then President Bill Clinton , is the author of “ WHORES : Why and How I Came to Fight the Establishment . ”
The book was scheduled to be published by HarperCollins , but met difficulties when Judith Regan , the HarperCollins representative on the deal , left the company .
Klayman said he noticed the company was doing pre-sales for the book last year , but was subsequently informed the project had been dropped .
He alleges the company declined to publish his work because he criticized Fox News in the book .
“ They were skittish about my criticism and tried to censor me on that and I would n’t do it , ” Klayman told Raw Story .
“ Fox would do things like call my clients and try to put them on TV , without letting me know –which jeopardized their legal cases , ” Klayman said .
He added that Fox host Sean Hannity had once tried to book Klayman ’s female clients who were involved in a string of lawsuits against former President Bill Clinton .
When the women declined to appear on his show , Klayman alleges Hannity called him and told him they had agreed to go on and asked for his help in getting them there .
A HarperCollins spokeswoman told Raw Story that Rubert Murdoch was not involved with decisions about the book .
“ Rupert Murdoch had nothing to do with this book , ” spokeswoman Erin Crum said .
“ Over three years ago we rejected a manuscript submitted by Mr. Klayman–we had the specific right to do that under our contract .
We did not deem it acceptable . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Klayman , who has sued people at The Washington Post , the National Law Journal and even his own mother , disagrees and says he believes one reason the project may have been killed is that he calls Fox “ the Al Jazeera of network news ” in the book .
He told Raw Story that “ Fox News says they are fair and balanced , but they ’re not .
They ’re propaganda , I may agree personally with their political slant but I do n’t want propaganda given to me as news , I really do want fair and balanced coverage . ”
The former prosecutor also says he believes Murdoch was nervous about his book ’s criticisms of Judge Denny Chin , of the U.S. District Court for Southern New York , who has heard cases involving Fox News .

Klayman points to previous reports of HarperCollins canceling book deals that could jeopardize other Murdoch projects .
The New York Times reported in 1998 that HarperCollins executives had canceled a book written by the last British governor of Hong Kong that was critical of China because Murdoch is heavily invested in China .

“ Worried that the book would jeopardize Mr. Murdoch ’s relationship with China ’s leadership , ” the New York Times reported HarperCollins executives ordered a top editor at the company and the person editing the book to inform the author it “ was being dropped because it was below standard . ”
“ Mr. Murdoch ordered that the book be canceled because of its highly critical stance toward China , a country in which he has considerable business interests and even more considerable financial ambitions , ” the paper said .
Klayman ’s book is now available in stores after being published by New Chapter Publishers .
He said it discusses “ how corrupt the government , legal and media systems are . ”

Editor 's note : GlobalPost 's correspondent John Otis had a rare opportunity to embed with the Colombian army during a mission against the FARC .
This two - part series details his time in the battle zone and the rise in rebel deserters .
LA MACARENA , Colombia — Accompanying frontline Colombian soldiers is not something I would have tried when I first arrived here 12 years ago .
At the time , the army was getting chewed up by Marxist rebels who overran military bases and kidnapped hundreds of troops .
Back then , it would have been safer to embed with the guerrillas .
But thanks to improved intelligence , joint operations involving the army , air force and marines , and billions in aid from the United States , the Colombian military has scored some impressive victories .
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , the nation ’s largest rebel army known as the FARC , have been reduced from 18,000 to about 9,000 fighters .
Despite the good news , the Colombian army can be gun shy around reporters .
It took me more than a year of lobbying to arrange for a three - day embed that included just three hours in the actual battle zone .
Yet that was enough time see why winning the war remains an elusive goal for the Colombian army .
Day 1
8 a.m. : A military plane deposits me in the southern town of La Macarena , home to the FUDRA , the Colombian army ’s rapid reaction force .
Over coffee , FUDRA commander Gen. Miguel Perez shows me a homemade rebel land mine built from plastic PVC tubing .
His troops are spending so much time in the jungle against a weakened FARC that most army casualties are now the result of land mines or tropical illnesses , like malaria and the flesh - eating disease leishmaniasis .
10 a.m. : Perez sends me down the road a few miles to the FUDRA training camp .
I recognize the spot , which used to be a FARC bivouac .
I spent a long afternoon here in 2001 interviewing guerrillas as they slaughtered a cow to prepare lunch .
Soldiers now use the bunkhouses , kitchens and clothes - washing facilities built by the enemy .
“ We kicked them out of a place where the rebels felt like kings , ” said Pvt. Jose Villalba , an eight - year army veteran .
“ That ’s why we feel we ’re winning the war .
The FARC thought they were untouchable . ”
Noon : Villalba is a member of Puma Company , a group of elite commandos who at the start of tomorrow ’s raid will leap out of helicopters and rappel down ropes .
Perez orders me to learn how to rappel in case there ’s no room on the ground to land a chopper .
After climbing up a 75 - foot - tall tree , the commandos practice by falling backward off a wooden platform and sliding down a rope .
I ’m scared but before I can wuss out , I ’m clipped into a harness and handed a Kevlar helmet and a pair of leather gloves .
With one hand forward and one behind my back , I grip the cord as if it were a tow rope on a ski hill .
After taking the plunge , my gloved hands serve as brakes as I slide down the rope .
I land safely on a stack of sand bags but lose style points for splaying my legs .
Press them together , I ’m told , or when it 's time to do this for real I might get snagged on tree branches .
8 p.m. :
In the FUDRA war room , Perez explains the joint military operation to two dozen officers .
The target is a FARC camp occupied by bodyguards of a rebel commander known as Mono Jojoy , who heads the FARC ’s Eastern Bloc .
A guerrilla deserter provided the camp location and the Colombian Air Force confirmed the information .
In a pre-dawn blitz , Super Tucano aircraft will pound the area with bombs , Perez says .
Then Puma Company troops wearing night - vision goggles will be airlifted to the spot to pursue any rebel survivors .
All the while , Black Hawk helicopters and an AC - 47 gunship will circle overhead providing cover .
H- Hour is 5:40 a.m .
DAY 2
7 a.m. : Perez decides that I ’ll ride along with him in a chopper to observe the initial stage of the assault from a safe distance .
But low - lying clouds delay the operation .
As we climb aboard the general ’s Huey , the sun is rising .
Under cover of the night , Perez says , “ we would have had a huge advantage .
But now the guerrillas are awake .
They ’ve had breakfast .
And they ’ve got their guns in their hands . ”
8 a.m. :
We fly toward the battlefield located just west of the butte - shaped Macarena Mountains .
The area is a historic FARC stronghold and the rugged ridges , caves and rain forest offer plenty of hiding places .
I feel like a spectator at an extreme , to - the - death sporting event .
Yet from the air , war seems distant and sterile .
The bombs from the Super Tucanos have blasted over trees and opened huge orange craters .
We watch as helicopters hover just above the jungle canopy .
One - by - one the commandos slide down ropes and disappear into the green expanse .
9 a.m. : Instead of landing , our chopper turns around and heads home .
What ’s going on ?
Noon : Back at the FUDRA base , Perez appears to be having second thoughts about this whole embedding business .
He is vague about what ’s happening on the ground , saying only that conditions are not secure enough to insert a reporter into the hot zone .
We ’ll try again tomorrow .
DAY 3 :
8 a.m. : I board a Black Hawk helicopter along with soldiers who carry aboard backpacks and gunny sacks bulging with food and camping gear .
For part of the trip , we fly just above the treetops , a maneuver that gives rebel sharpshooters little time to take aim .
We touch down in a clearing by the bend in a river .
The troops jump out and more soldiers pile aboard along with an explosives - sniffing dog that was bitten on one of its paws by a snake .
As we lift into the air , the dog whines and licks his wound .
8:30 a.m. :
The chopper touches down on a dirt road and I catch up with Puma Company .
Wearing green , brown and black face paint and with leaves protruding from their helmet netting , the commandos are almost invisible in the forest .
We use our hands to push past trees and bushes because hacking at the underbrush with machetes would leave an obvious trail .
I stumble on the vines trying to keep up .
My hands , which are my only exposed flesh , are set upon by ants whose bite feels like a hornet sting .
8:35 a.m. : Lowering his voice to a whisper , Capt .
Frank Olaya , the 30 - year - old commander of Puma Company , shows me the mission 's war trophy : a couple of rough beds made of boards and leaves .
It seems that while the guerrillas were once here , they cleared out many months ago .
Over the past 24 hours , Olaya ’s men have n’t come across a single FARC rebel .
The young officer calls it proof that the army is gaining control of the countryside .
But there ’s no disguising the fact that in a meticulously planned operation the military mobilized 11 aircraft , dropped nine bombs and inserted three dozen troops into a patch of jungle with no guerrillas .
9:30 a.m. : Finally , the troops find someone to scrutinize .
Olaya pulls over a farmer driving a pickup down the rutted gravel road .
The man seems a bit twitchy .
Maybe he ’s a FARC militiaman in civilian clothes .
Or maybe he ’s just intimidated by so many soldiers .
Either way , he refuses to speak to an army camera crew because he fears the FARC might see the footage and retaliate .
The soldiers , he points out , may be providing some temporary security but they will soon be pulling out .
He has to live here .
Noon : Back at FUDRA headquarters , Perez is in a foul mood .
I wonder if he ’ll catch hell for launching an unnecessary mission that , according to one Defense Ministry analyst , probably cost more than half a million dollars .
Later , I comment on the difficulty of tracking down every last guerrilla in the thick jungle .
Perez counters that the real goal is to score enough military victories that the rebels lose their will to fight .
One sign of success , he says , is the rising number of FARC deserters , who often provide key intelligence .
But not all their facts check out .
Indeed , Puma Company ’s failed assault was based on faulty information from a FARC informant .
4 p.m. : Olaya and the other soldiers of Puma Company regroup at their training camp .
Though they were shut out on this particular mission , they ’ll have many more cracks at the FARC .
And they ’re pleased that all of the 36 soldiers who rappelled into the jungle have made it back alive .

Meet Peyton 's Teacher
Mr. Groenewold
MTSS , or Multi -System of Support , helps us get a better understanding of where kids are at .
From there we break them down into small groups and they get individualized instruction .
If kids are excelling , they are challenged during their small group time .
When a student is struggling with concepts , they are able to receive a small group lesson at the level they are at .
We adjust the reading groups three times a year .
But in third grade , we change the math groups every two weeks .
It ’s really great because as the concept changes we can continue to meet the instructional needs at every student ’s level .
Small groups give us a chance to review the concepts without missing any classroom instruction .
We are able to keep challenging students and meeting them exactly where they are at .

La société responsable du déversement de déchets toxiques à Abidjan en 2006 a trouvé un accord d’indemnisation de 33 millions d’euros avec la plupart des victimes .
Chaque plaignant recevra 750 .
000 francs CFA , soit 1 . 150 euros .
La multinationale Trafigura a signé à Londres un accord amiable portant sur 30 millions de livres ( 33 millions d’euros ) avec les quelque 31 .
000 plaignants dans l’affaire du déversement en 2006 de déchets toxiques à Abidjan , a annoncé à l’AFP un porte - parole de la société .
" L’accord a été signé samedi soir tard " entre Trafigura et l’avocat des plaignants tout juste revenu d’Abidjan avec le feu vert d’au moins 75 % de ses clients ( seuil légal ) , a expliqué cette source , précisant que l’indemnisation totale représentait 30 millions de livres , au lieu des 180 réclamés à l’origine .
Chaque plaignant recevra 750 .
000 francs CFA , soit 1 . 150 euros , a indiqué le porte - parole .
Pas de procès à Londres
Trafigura était l’affréteur du cargo Probo Koala , dont le déversement de résidus toxiques avaient causé , selon la justice ivoirienne , la mort de 17 personnes et des milliers d’intoxications .
Cet accord met fin à la procédure engagée contre Trafigura au Royaume - Uni .
Un procès devait s’ouvrir devant la Haute cour de Londres le 6 octobre .
" Depuis août 2006 , les parties ont investi énormément de temps et d’argent afin de réaliser une analyse détaillée des événements survenus à Abidjan en 2006 " , précise la déclaration commune finale , indiquant que " plus de 20 experts indépendants " de divers domaines avaient oeuvré .
" Trafigura totalement innocentée
" Ces experts indépendants n’ont pas été en mesure d’établir un lien entre l’exposition aux produits chimiques émanant des déversements d’une part , et les décès , les fausses couches , les naissances d’enfants mort-nés , les malformations , les pertes d’acuité visuelle ou d’autres maladies graves et chroniques " , poursuit le document .
Le cabinet d’avocats des plaignants " Leigh Day and co , à la lumière des conclusions des experts , reconnaît désormais que les déversements ne pouvaient , au pire , qu’avoir provoqué des symptômes passagers semblables à ceux de la grippe et des crises d’anxiété " , ajoute - t- il .
" Trafigura est totalement innocentée par les conclusions des experts des deux parties " , a déclaré Eric de Turckheim , directeur de Trafigura , cité dans un communiqué .
Aucun représentant des plaignants n’était joignable à Londres dimanche matin .

Overdraft fees have been getting tons of attention lately , including Congressional scrutiny -- and some banks , like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) are cutting back .
That 's great .
Still , The American Banking Association defends the practice this way : “ Clearly , consumers who pay overdraft fees are the minority , and that number is shrinking .
More importantly , most consumers want banks to pay their overdrafts so they can avoid the inconvenience , embarrassment and potential costs of having a payment or transaction rejected , ” said Nessa Feddis , ABA senior federal counsel in a recent statement .
But a new report underscores just how much financial institutions are profiting from the fees and how much they hurt average Americans .
Center for Responsible Lending : Banks and credit unions collected nearly $ 24 billion in overdraft fees last year , an increase of 35 percent from just two years earlier , a new study by the Center for Responsible Lending shows .
The explosion in overdraft charges has drained the wallet of as many as 51 million Americans whose accounts become overdrawn annually .
It is particularly harmful to financially vulnerable families already hit hard by the recession .
Highlights of the report include :
Over 50 million Americans overdrew their checking account at least once over a 12 month period , with 27 million accountholders incurring five or more overdraft or non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) fees .
Banks and credit unions collected nearly $ 24 billion in overdraft fees in 2008 .
Overdraft fee income for banks and credit unions rose 35 percent from 2006 to 2008 .
" Banks and credit unions have become so sophisticated in driving up overdrafts that Americans now pay more in overdraft fees every year than they do for books , cereal , or fresh vegetables , " said CRL senior researcher Leslie Parrish .
" These billions of dollars drained from consumers each year represent lost opportunities for families to save for a rainy day or buy necessary goods and services that could help spark the economy . "

October 21 , 2009 -- Everyone listens to music at least now and then .
For many of us , music is a casual experience , a moment 's entertainment .
But for those who practiced in a school orchestra or who play a musical instrument professionally , the musical experience can be something more .
Some of the world 's leading experts on music and brain will discuss the latest scientific evidence supporting the benefits of music for the mind at the upcoming meeting of the Acoustical Society of America ( ASA ) in San Antonio , TX .
See the end of this press release for more information about the meeting itself .
Here are some of their principal findings :
TRAIN THE BRAIN
Does musical training modify the auditory cortex -- the part of the brain where the processing of sound takes place -- in a measurable way ?
The answer , based on analysis of the brain 's electrical and magnetic signals , is yes .
Laurel Trainor , a scientist at McMaster University in West Hamilton , Ontario and colleagues compared preschool children who had taken music lessons to those who did not .
Those with some training showed larger brain responses on a number of sound recognition tests given to the children .
Could one make even larger claims for musical training ?
As a separate but related question , does training change thinking or cognition in general ?
Trainor , who is the director of the McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind , again says yes .
Even a year or two of music training leads to enhanced levels of memory , attention and executive control in the same sort of tests that monitor electrical and magnetic impulses in the brain .
" We therefore hypothesize that musical training ( but not necessarily passive listening to music ) affects attention and memory , which provides a mechanism whereby musical training might lead to better learning across a number of domains , " says Trainor .
The reason for this , she suggests , is that the motor and listening skills needed to play an instrument with other people appear to heavily involve attention , memory , and the ability to inhibit actions .
Merely listening passively to music ( the " Mozart effect " ) does not produce the same changes in attention and memory .
The talk " Effects of Musical Training on Brain Development " ( 4aMU2 ) by Laurel Trainor is at 9:05 a.m. on Thursday , October 29 .

TONE DEAFNESS AND DYSLEXIA CONNECTED
Harvard researcher Gottfried Schlaug has also studied the brain and cognitive effects of musical training .
He and his colleagues also see a correlation between early - childhood training in music and enhanced motor and auditory skills as well as enhancements in verbal ability and nonverbal reasoning .
This modification of the brain is depends on the type of training .
Singing , for example , is a specialized form of music training and changes the brains of singers in locations that are slighting different from those affected by playing , say , the keyboard or a stringed instrument .
The correlation between music training and language development is even more striking for dyslexic children .
Schlaug says the results he and his colleagues have found , " suggest that a music intervention that strengthens the basic auditory music perception skills of children with dyslexia may also remediate some of their language deficits . "
Schlaug 's main report at the meeting , however , deals not with the brain and cognition so much as with the brain differences between professional singers , occasional singers , and those who are tone deaf --- that is , those who can't sing in tune and can't properly differentiate pitches .
He reports that tone - deaf individuals often have a reduced or absent arcuate fasciculus ( AF ) , a fiber tract connecting the frontal and temporal lobes in the brain .
A reduced or damaged AF has been implicated in people with various acquired language problems such as aphasia but also in children with dyslexia .

The talk " Singing in the Brain : Professional Singers , Occasional Singers , and Out - of - Tune Singers " ( 4aMU1 ) by Gottfried Schlaug is at 8:35 a.m. on Thursday , October 29 .

BRAIN CELLS PREFER MUSIC
Still more evidence that formal music training strengthens auditory cortex responses comes in a study performed by Antoine Shahin and his colleagues .
On average , musical training gives a child the same acoustic responsiveness as someone two to three years older .
At the meeting Shahin will refer to his own work and to the studies of others .
He cautions that these studies do not necessarily show that musical training leads to enhanced IQ or creativity .
How does the increased responsiveness come about ?
Shahin , who now works at Ohio State University , says that when listening to sounds over and over , especially music or speech that is harmonic or meaningful , the appropriate neurons get reinforced , responding preferentially to those sounds compared to other sounds .
This neural behavior was examined in a study by Shahin and colleagues which looked at the degree of auditory cortex responsiveness to music and non-familiar sounds as children age .
The specific tests Shahin carried out consisted of measuring the time lag between the moment a sound was made and when a population of neurons in the subject 's auditory cortex ( the part of the brain devoted to processing sound signals ) became active .
He presented a particular sound to each subject 100 times .
If the sound evoked a response after a consistent time lag , it was said to be strongly phase - locked .
If , however , the response occurs with varying lag times , then it was less phase - locked .
Phase - locking indicates how responsive neurons are to sounds .
Shahin 's main findings are that phase - locking to musical sounds grows with age for all frequency bands of the auditory response and that the greatest increase occurs between age 10 and 13 .
This most likely indicates this as being a sensitive period for music and speech acquisition .
The talk " Development of Auditory Phase - Locked Activity for Music Sounds " ( 3aMU4 ) by Anthony Shahin is at 9:45 a.m. on Wednesday , October 28 .

SO DOES MUSIC MAKE YOU SMARTER ?
In San Antonio , Glenn Schellenberg of the University of Toronto will address the question " Does musical ability makes you smarter ? "
Such assessments concerning children are always difficult because other factors , such as parental income and parental education , might play a role .
Nevertheless , some findings seem robust .
Passive listening to music seems to help you perform certain cognitive tests , at least in the short run .
Actual music lessons for kids , however , leads to a longer lasting cognitive success .
The effects of musical training on cognition for adults , Schellenberg says , are harder to pin down .
The talk " Musical Abilities and Cognitive Abilities " ( 3aMU4 ) by Glenn Schellenberg is at 9:35 a.m. on Thursday , October 29 .

ABOUT THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
Dear Fernando ,
First , thank you for publishing your book .
It was worth every penny .
I will recommend it to select family and friends .
I seek your advice on the best post - crash , white collar businesses .
I am a technical writer and trainer , specializing in software .
I have a day job as a software training manager .
I have a side job writing technical books .
I do n't get rich from them , but they take the place of my wife 's salary , now that she is a stay - at - home mom .
I am concerned that after the dollar has crashed ( notice I am saying " when " and not " if " ) , that these types of books will not sell as well .
My market is worldwide , but most of the sales come from the USA .
Also , you can't really grow a business by being a solo author .
To really grow , you need other people working for you .
This rather lengthy introduction brings me to my question :
In your experience , after the crash in Argentina , were there any kinds of consulting or teaching services that businesses suddenly needed ( and were willing to pay for ) , to help them survive the new economic conditions ?
At this point , I 'm really trying to decide between writing more books , and just letting the books go and switching to a consulting or training business .
I 'm thinking specifically of a company that would offer consulting and training in :
Using Moodle for e-learning .
This is the subject of two of my books .
Dealing with information overload .
How to be a more productive knowledge worker .
Using open source software for small - to - medium size businesses .
Office applications , human resources management , accounting , customer relationships , social media for sales and marketing .
Was there any demand for these kinds of business services and training in post - crash Argentina ?
I 'm trying to imagine the kind of consulting or training that a company will need in these difficult times to stay in business .
Something targeted specifically towards the message , " Times are tough and if you want to stay in business , we can help by teaching you how to_____ . "
It 's that blank line that I 'm having trouble filling in .
Thank you again for your book , and your blog .
I very much value your advice and hope that you can give me a little insight to help me plan for my family 's future .
Regards ,
William
Hi William .
You seem to be on the right track .
Please note I ’m not into finances , all I can give you is my humble advice based on what I ’ve seen .
As you probably read in my book , if I recommend for example , starting a daycare center or even a private school later on , its because I ’ve seen it done successfully enough times that it makes me notice that .
You know who fails after an economic crisis / collapse ?
Those that freeze and fail to act , those that stay the same waiting for things to go back to be the way they were .
To get through it you need to understand a few things .
First , the rules of engagement have changed .
You can no longer expect the old ones to apply , you ca n’t expect people to react as they did , they way they used to spend money , they way people and companies did n’t research each product or service in detail .
You need a good product / service AND good marketing .
And second , investigate and understand that new market .
Discover the new niches .
As time goes by , I firmly believe that there ’s a new , post crisis niche out there for every activity , every line of work you can think of .
Teachers for example , for years it has been a poorly paid job and still is .
Yet a teacher that finds his way into a nicer , bilingual school will do better , and in some they can send their own kids for free or considerable discounts .
It ’s no longer just the salary , you save on school payments as well .
Hey , I used to work on telemarketing .
English speaking employees got paid twice as much as those that did it in Spanish .
Same job , twice the salary because you have more tools than the other guy .
While musicians do poorly , there ’s a local kindergarten teacher here that has a nice voice and is good enough with a guitar , so she recorded CDs for babies and small children , made contacts with stores that sell baby clothes … so that these stores would play her music , and offer the CDs for sale as well .
As far as I know she ’s now got a big contract and is selling her music in every Spanish speaking country , including Spain .
Being able to sell world wide is an advantage , you can maybe aim for UK market , learn what ’s getting done there , what programs they are using .
Working from the USA and getting paid on Euros would be nice .
There ’s more than enough people in Argentina that saved their business by doing partnerships with companies form abroad , selling services to US and Europe .
Again , if there ’s an economic collapse , you ’re already ½ way there William .
When unemployment became rampant , no one was selling anything , the first few months you could see the economy was totally frozen .
I kid you not people would n’t hire the neighborhood ’s kid to paint a fence , no one wanted to spend a single buck .
After a few months when things calmed down after the initial shock , those getting laid off or getting their salaries cut to half , they all wanted to go independent .
Being already self employed , even though partially , already gives you an edge the guy that did the 9 to 5 thing all his life does n’t have and is suddenly attempting to swim in unknown waters .
I have no knowledge of your line of work , but I ’d orient it to that new guy , the guy that lost his job recently , or the one that is smelling the coffee , knowing that even though he still has a job he could be the next one .
There ’s millions of unemployed right now .
What do you think they are doing ?
Their trying to get busy !
What programs would they need , which ones are sought after ?
Again , not my thing but for example , classes , and courses that taught CAD and design programs suddenly became more popular .
Many studios were doing jobs for abroad as I mentioned before , and they needed to hire workers .
Who were they going to hire ?
Young kids who they could pay less of course .
Those young adults ( or unemployed older ones ) needed some formation .
Another example .
As prices for import goods goes up , local production gets more attention .
That means more local machinery being build , and software for CNC machines and workers is required .
Your own question has the key to the answer : help them survive the new economic conditions .
Whatever it is you offer :
* It must be useful .
Worth the little money people and companies now have .
Before , they would through money at anything , just in case .
Heck , people would even sign up for classes or courses and not even show up .
Not any more .
* The potential benefits your consulting or teaching business offers must be clear to see and understand .
Example .
If you pick the newspaper and ½ of the design related jobs are asking for people that know 3D Studio , anyone with half a brain will get it that after he / she takes your course , they are ready for a line of work in demand .
Buying books or training , they can both be profitable for you .
Personally , in your situation , I ’m slightly inclined to exploiting the training opportunities if you enjoy that more than writing .
Writing for an emerging market can work ok , but I ’d satisfy the need for training for the new employment challenges .
Explore the aspects of the new jobs on demand , what kind of training they are requiring .
The unemployed guy reads you ad , an article or finds your website or reads about you at the local paper .

Sam Watson , the deputy director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit at the University of Queensland , said the word " Creole " , often used to describe a person of mixed European and African ancestry , was a racially loaded term .
" The word Creole comes from a period when people 's humanity was measured by the amount of white blood they had in their bloodstream .
This is the same kind of thought that underpinned horrific regimes like the Nazis , " Mr Watson said .
" People need to exercise their intellect .
This so - called blending was actually the institutionalised rape of black women .
They were victims of brutal regimes of rape and victimisation . "
Mr Watson described the biscuit name as deeply insensitive and indicative of a " deep undercurrent of racism in white Australian society " .
" It virtually infects every level of Australia 's consciousness , language , culture and history , " he said .
New results are in from the Fermi Space Telescope , which settled into orbit in the summer of 2008 , and the findings seem to prove Albert Einstein right once again .
Man , that guy was good .
The telescope detected and studied a gamma ray burst , one of the massively bright and powerful explosions that occurs when stars go supernova in distant galaxies .
Astronomers were interested in the gamma rays of differing energies and wavelengths that were generated by the explosion , and that raced each other across the universe .
After a journey of 7.3 billion light - years , they all arrived within nine - tenths of a second of one another in a detector on NASA ’s Fermi Gamma - Ray Space Telescope , at 8:22 p.m. , Eastern time , on May 9 [ The New York Times ] .
The researchers were wondering if certain gamma rays with both high energies and short wavelengths would arrive last , at the back of the pack .
That would suggest that they had violated one of the principles set out in Einstein 's theory of relativity : that the speed of light is always constant .
If researchers could detect a significant lag in some gamma rays , it would also give fresh hope to those ambitious researchers searching for a theory of everything .
At present , two separate theories dominate the world of physics .
General relativity explains gravity and the motion of large objects such as planets , stars and galaxies , whereas quantum - mechanics explains the behaviour of very small things such as atoms .
Both theories do well at explaining their respective worlds , but they do n't fit together mathematically .
The problem is as fundamental as it gets : the two see space and time very differently [ Nature News ] .
Einstein 's general relativity relies on space - time being smooth and continuous , while quantum mechanics suggests that the universe is made up of countless tiny grains of space - time .
If the latter model is true , researchers theorized that the lumpy nature of space - time could interfere with the travel of some gamma rays .
In simplified terms , that ’s because higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths , which makes them more likely to bump into tiny lumps in spacetime and to be slowed by those structures .
The slowdown would be tiny , but the lower velocity of high - energy photons could in principle be detectable over a journey of several billion light - years [ Science News ] .
But the study of the Fermi Telescope 's results , published in Nature , declares that since all the gamma rays arrived within nine - tenths of a second apart , they must have all traveled at almost exactly the same speed .
That suggests either that space - time is smooth and continuous , as general relativity proposed , or that the grains of space - time are smaller than we ever thought possible , and are having only the most minuscule effect on light waves .
Researchers say the grains could theoretically
be smaller than one - hundred - thousandth of a trillionth of the size of a proton [ Science News ] .
Physicists working with the Fermi Telescope will keep looking for new evidence .
But for now , says study coauthor Peter F. Michelson ,
“ I take it as a confirmation that Einstein is still right ” [ The New York Times ] .

Gamma ray bursts are the universe 's brightest explosions .
Many persons think of women 's libbers as a bunch of over - zealous but basically well - intentioned souls .
That 's what I used to believe .
But last week news of two incidents came out that put feminism in whole different light .
First , columnist Mike Adams reported on the plight of Mark Harwood , psychology professor at Humboldt State University which is located in Birkenstock - addled northern California .
Based on extensive research , Harwood informed his students that women were as likely as men to engage in partner aggression .
Harwood probably was thinking of Sahel Kazemi who murdered former NFL star quarterback Steve McNair in July as he slept .
Or Real Housewives starlet Kelly Bensimon who was arrested for hitting her boyfriend .
But scientific truth apparently did not goose the gander of these gender guerillas .
So the women took it upon themselves to disrupt the class , taunting the good professor as a " privileged , rich , white male . "
Judge , jury , and executioner !
Then the head of the Women 's Studies program demanded Harwood be barred from ever again teaching the course .
In disgust , the professor resigned his post to go elsewhere .
An isolated incident ?
Judge for yourself .
Because a day later columnist Trudy Schuett reported on a woman named Amanda McCormick of Praxis International who blithely told a group of feminists attending an abuse conference , " I know a lot of men who deserve to be beaten . "
And exactly what is Praxis International ?
Funded to the tune of $ 1.5 million taxpayer dollars , its website is chock - full of gender liberation cant , claiming it works to " create a clear and cooperative agenda for social change in their communities . "
Is n't that what ACORN has been claiming to do all these years ?
But is it going too far to assert that feminism is a hate movement ?
After all , think of all the opportunities that feminism has opened up for women -- and what inspiring role models Hillary and Nancy have become for our daughters !
So let 's ask the good folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center who run HateWatch .
They 're the experts , they should know .
On its website HateWatch says a hate movement is " an organization or individual that advocates violence against or unreasonable hostility toward those persons or organizations identified by their race , religion , national origin , sexual orientation , gender , or disability . "
Hmmm .
When a person sees fit to entertain a group of domestic violence workers with the remark , " I know a lot of men who deserve to be beaten , " does n't that indulge in a contemptuous attitude towards members of the opposite sex ?
Does that give women a green light to be violent to their partners ?
HateWatch further defines a hate movement as one that disseminates " historically inaccurate information with regards to these persons or organizations for the purpose of vilification . "
So have you ever noticed how these women habitually pony up " statistics " that portray men in the worst possible light ?
Ever wonder why these ladies never divulge the scientific basis of their ideologically - driven claims ?
More alarming is how these scornful women have stampeded lawmakers to approve domestic abuse laws that gleefully trample on Constitutionally - mandated protections .
Probable - cause for arrest ?
Now a mere historical footnote in 22 states that have " mandatory " arrest laws for domestic violence on the books .
Equal treatment under the law ?
Not in 24 states that have " primary aggressor " laws , code language for " haul away the man " no matter what the evidence may say .
Due process ?
Not part of my living , breathing Constitution .
Innocent until proven guilty ?
Do n't be absurd , we have an epidemic of partner abuse that must come to a stop !
Each year , over one million Americans are hit with a trivial or false accusation of domestic violence .
These persons are plunged into an Alice - in - Wonderland justice system that spurns reason and fairness .
Railroaded by hearsay and circumstantial evidence , a false charge stigmatizes a man as an abuser , drains his assets , and can break up his family .
Fortunately , persons are beginning to wake up to the hellish biases that lard our partner abuse system .
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and a number of groups have banded together to reform the system .
The month 's theme is " Restore Civil Rights to the Violence Against Women Act . "
Driven by a destructive gender ideology , our domestic violence laws now represent the most breath - taking roll - back in Constitutionally - protected rights since the era of Jim Crow .

The graph below is one of transistor count , not die size .
Inevitably , on the same manufacturing process , a significantly higher transistor count translates into a larger die size .
But for the purposes of this article , all I need to show you is a representation of transistor count .
See that big circle on the right ?
That 's Fermi .
NVIDIA 's next - generation architecture .
NVIDIA astonished us with GT200 tipping the scales at 1.4 billion transistors .
Fermi is more than twice that at 3 billion .
And literally , that 's what Fermi is - more than twice a GT200 .
At the high level the specs are simple .
Fermi has a 384 - bit GDDR5 memory interface and 512 cores .
That 's more than twice the processing power of GT200 but , just like RV870 ( Cypress ) , it 's not twice the memory bandwidth .
The architecture goes much further than that , but NVIDIA believes that AMD has shown its cards ( literally ) and is very confident that Fermi will be faster .
The questions are at what price and when .
The price is a valid concern .
Fermi is a 40nm GPU just like RV870 but it has a 40 % higher transistor count .
Both are built at TSMC , so you can expect that Fermi will cost NVIDIA more to make than ATI 's Radeon HD 5870 .
Then timing is just as valid , because while Fermi currently exists on paper , it 's not a product yet .
Fermi is late .
Clock speeds , configurations and price points have yet to be finalized .
NVIDIA just recently got working chips back and it's going to be at least two months before I see the first samples .
Widespread availability wo n't be until at least Q1 2010 .
I asked two people at NVIDIA why Fermi is late ; NVIDIA 's VP of Product Marketing , Ujesh Desai and NVIDIA 's VP of GPU Engineering , Jonah Alben .
Ujesh responded : because designing GPUs this big is " fucking hard " .
Jonah elaborated , as I will attempt to do here today .

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Natural disasters in Asia over the past week highlight the growing humanitarian impacts of global warming and the urgent need for an ambitious climate pact , a relief and development group said on Tuesday .

Speaking on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in the Thai capital , World Vision said floods in India and a typhoon in the Philippines had hit the poor , who stand to suffer most from a lack of action by rich nations to fight climate change .
Developing nations and relief groups are calling on rich countries to take the lead to avert the worst of more intense droughts , floods , melting glaciers and rising seas .
“ The linkage between humanitarian impact and climate change is very much on our doorstep here in Asia , ” Richard Rumsey , director of disaster risk reduction and community resilience , told a news conference .
“ This is not just normal disasters , this is on top of existing disasters .
Across Asia , you ’ve seen other crises , you ’ve seen earthquakes and tsunamis . ”
Floods triggered by heavy rains in south India over the past week have killed some 250 people and left 2.5 million homeless .
A typhoon in the Philippines has killed 22 people .
Rumsey said resources at humanitarian groups were being stretched with the need to provide immediate disaster relief and also to help developing countries come up with longer - term solutions to deal with climate change .
For example , World Vision was helping communities in the Philippines plant mangroves to strengthen coastal defences and offer a means of fighting global warming with the soaking up of carbon dioxide from the air .
But the group called for more action from developed nations , blamed by critics for not taking the lead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and for providing insufficient financial and technological aid to poorer nations to deal with climate change .
“ It does not seem to have sunk into some negotiators that we are facing a global humanitarian emergency , ” said Brett Parris , World Vision ’s chief economist and climate change policy director .
“ Many are treating it effectively like a trade negotiation , jockeying for economic advantage .
That ’s not the situation we ’re in .
We ’re facing a global humanitarian emergency that demands serious financing and serious targets . ”

Alex Jones interviews Charlie Sheen .
Charlie Sheen ’s exclusive article today published at Prisonplanet.com and Infowars.com provides a lengthy and detailed bibliography of facts relating to the 9/11 cover up .
Back in 2006 when Sheen first went public with his views on 9/11 as an inside job an the Alex Jones show , he was subject to months of abuse and personal attacks completely unrelated to the issue he was attempting to push into the mainstream .
Sheen asked the media to “ challenge me on the facts ” , however that challenge was lost in a sea of disinformation disseminated by the corporate media .
This time Sheen has meticulously planned his approach , so as to focus the attention on the undeniable facts he presents in his open letter to the president .
Sheen told Alex Jones in a twenty minute interview last week , now available exclusively on Prisonplanet.tv , that his intention was to create “ a public document specifically rooted in fact . ”
“ The truth is unchanging . ”
Sheen added .
“ Everything in this letter will withstand the critical assault I am more than prepared to endure . ”
Since Sheen appeared on the Alex Jones show and subsequently at the national American Scholars Symposium on 9/11 in the Summer of 2006 , there is no doubt that the issue of the 9/11 cover up has shifted into mainstream consciousness .
Since that time we have seen a barrage of hit pieces from major media corporations such as The History Channel , the BBC , Popular Mechanics and the National Geographic Channel .
Each attack has fallen flat on its face , however , and has actually had the opposite effect that was intended , in waking more people up to the fraud that is the official version of events surrounding the attacks .
Now Sheen is back , in response to the call for him to stand up again and continue where he left off in 2006 .
With so many more people now awake to the whitewash that was the official 9/11 investigation , and with everything that has ensued in the fallout of the 21st century ’s defining event , Sheen can help us generate a second massive wave of public awakening .
For newer readers , uninformed media representatives , and as a way of providing more context to Charlie Sheen ’s latest efforts to push for a new investigation into 9/11 , here are links to articles and stories arising from Sheen ’s original groundbreaking effort to shatter the mainstream media silence on the official conspiracy theory .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : htzaar -0.0.1
HTZAAR is a Haskell implementation of TZAAR , a great little two - player abstract strategy game designed by Kris Burm .
TZAAR won Games Magazine 's Game - of - the - Year in 2008 .
TZAAR has some interesting game dynamics .
At each turn a player must decide whether to attack or strengthen his own pieces .
The unbalanced number of tzaars , tzarras , and totts pieces leads to several phase transitions in the game .
At first tzaars are targeted , but once they 're fortified , tzarras become the targets , then totts .
It also has a rather distinct transition from mid to end game .
Midway through , most effort is on positioning power pieces for attack .
But as more pieces come off the board , movement is restricted to the point where groups become isolated from others , which can work for or against you .
Anyway , I thought the game would be a fun AI problem .
HTZAAR comes with a very simple AI opponent ( lame ) , but I did my best to structure the interface to make it easy to create new AI strategies .
I hope a few people try to build and contribute AI strategies to HTZAAR .
And if there 's anyway I can improve the AI interface , let me know .
HTZAAR can also pit AI against AI .
The following is a game between two instances of the " lame " AI .
For an idea of the complexity of TZAAR , the number in parentheses indicates the number of possible moves at each turn .
TZAAR has a large number of choices at each turn because each turn consists of two different moves ( n ^ 2 ) .
Typical games are between 15 to 25 turns .
$ htzaar -s 22 lame lame 1 . white ( lame ) : D7 -> E7 ( 42 ) 2 . black ( lame ) : F6 -> F5 G1 -> F2 ( 6355 ) 3 . white ( lame ) : D6 -> E6 A5 -> A4 ( 5867 ) 4 . black ( lame ) : F3 -> E4 H2 -> G2 ( 5227 ) 5 . white ( lame ) : I2 -> I1 C5 -> C6 ( 4992 ) 6 . black ( lame ) : F5 -> G4 H1 -> H3 ( 4345 ) 7 . white ( lame ) : H5 -> G6 C6 -> C7 ( 4176 ) 8 . black ( lame ) : F7 -> E7 D4 -> C3 ( 4265 ) 9 . white ( lame ) : G6 -> E5 H4 -> G5 ( 3464 ) 10 . black ( lame ) : H6 -> I5 F2 -> E2 ( 2870 ) 11 . white ( lame ) : E5 -> G4 D2 -> D1 ( 2303 ) 12 . black ( lame ) : B2 -> C2 G7 -> I5 ( 2742 ) 13 . white ( lame ) : G5 -> I5 E6 -> I3 ( 1965 ) 14 . black ( lame ) : E7 -> B5 G3 -> E3 ( 2055 ) 15 . white ( lame ) : E1 -> F1 I4 -> I3 ( 1303 ) 16 . black ( lame ) : E2 -> D1 C4 -> D5 ( 1656 ) 17 . white ( lame ) : I5 -> F8 C7 -> I3 ( 913 ) 18 . black ( lame ) : B5 -> A4 E4 -> B4 ( 1480 ) 19 . white ( lame ) : D3 -> C2 B1 -> C2 ( 608 ) 20 . black ( lame ) : B4 -> B6 C3 -> C2 ( 526 ) 21 . white ( lame ) : D8 -> E8 F1 -> F4 ( 185 ) 22 . black ( lame ) : H3 -> G4 B3 -> B6 ( 314 ) 23 . white ( lame ) : C1 -> A1 F4 -> G4 ( 47 ) 24 . black ( lame ) : B6 -> E8 E8 -> F8 ( 125 ) black ( lame ) Wins !

A Unite ’09 panel focused on how to make money on the iPhone had one clear piece of advice : establish a relationship with Apple , and then embrace their feedback .
" Releasing any game onto the App Store at the moment is like a crap shoot , " said Matt Mechtley , one of the developers of popular game Touch KO .
" But there are certain things you can do to weigh the odds in your favour , and having Apple aware of your game is one of those things . "
In fact , the general consensus from the panel was that without Featured status , it ’s nearly impossible to have a runaway hit .
Getting an inside contact at the Cupertino giant is n’t easy , though , and this is where getting a publisher can help .
" While you might not need a publisher to fund your iPhone game , this is one of the things that they can bring to the table in the iPhone space , " Mechtley continued .
" Our publisher Chillingo , for example , regularly shows its upcoming stuff to Apple and gets feedback from it , so they know about the game before it ’s even submitted for approval . "
But if you do n’t want to go through a publisher , it ’s not impossible to have direct contact with the firm yourself , countered Riptide Games ’ Brian Robbins .
" I do n’t think you have to go through a publisher to get inside Apple .
Go to WWDC , go to local iPhone Tech Talks that Apple holds , and make contacts there . "
The key , said Robbins , was to listen to the feedback that Apple gives – because it appears far more likely that they ’ll feature your game if you do so .
" If Apple gives you advice , whatever it is , just do it .
You want to make them your friends .
For example , when we showed our contact our Vans advergame , iPhone OS 3.0 had just come out but there were very few games that included the new features .
They suggested we implement some , so I spent the weekend adding iPod music support to it .
Once we submitted it got approved in about two days and we were featured for a long time , because we were one of the few apps that Apple could show off as being ‘ 3.0 ’ . "
Mechtley went as far as to say that developers should " see Apple as their key customer , rather than the actual player , if money is what you ’re after " – which received agreement from the whole panel .
A pregnant woman in labour arrived at a hospital and asked for an all - white team of staff to deliver her baby , it was confirmed today .
The unnamed white woman , who was not booked to have her child at Milton Keynes Hospital , Buckinghamshire , had the request refused .
Her baby was delivered safely , but not by all - white nursing staff .

Hospital employees have now complained to the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the way the situation was handled , prompting the launch of a " full investigation " by the hospital .
A spokeswoman for the hospital said : " We take the interests and wellbeing of our staff very seriously , and any act of racial discrimination will not be tolerated .
" Discrimination and prejudice , whether from patients , visitors or staff is unacceptable , and this is a message that we will continue to communicate internally and externally . "
She added that there were medical complications during the birth earlier this month , but that mother and baby had now returned home " safe , well and happy " .
The investigation relates both to the medical complications and the concern expressed by staff " about the potential for discrimination should such demands be raised by patients in the future " , the spokeswoman said .
She added : " We have got a diverse workforce here and we are very proud of that diversity . "
Navrita Atwal of Milton Keynes Equality Council said : " I 'm absolutely surprised by the circumstances of this case .
" What if there had not been a white doctor available ?
What would have happened then ?
" I think the hospital staff should go through relevant training about how to think on their feet when this situation arises . "
The hospital said it is thought to be the first time such a request has been made to them .
They confirmed that the woman was not local to Milton Keynes , but would not say why she had made her request .
When does planting a tree become a revolutionary act – and unleash an army of gunmen who want to shoot you dead ?
The answer to this question lies in the unlikely story of Wangari Maathai .
She was born on the floor of a mud hut with no water or electricity in the middle of rural Kenya , in the place where human beings took their first steps .
There was no money but there was at least lush green rainforest and cool , clear drinking water .
But Maathai watched as the life - preserving landscape of her childhood was hacked down .
The forests were felled , the soils dried up , and the rivers died , so a corrupt and distant clique could profit .
She started a movement to begin to make the land green again – and in the process she went to prison , nearly died , toppled a dictator , transformed how African women saw themselves , and won a Nobel Prize .
Now Maathai is travelling the world with a warning .
As she told the United Nations climate summit last Tuesday , it is not just her beloved rainforest that is threatened now , but all rainforests .
" As human beings , we are attacking our own life - support system , " she says .
" And if we carry on like this , we are digging our own grave . "

Her story begins with one particular tree in the heart of Africa .
In 1940 , Maathai became the third of six children born to illiterate peasant farmers .
Her father worked as a " glorified slave " for the British settlers who occupied Kenya .
He was forced to do what he was told on their farms , and forbidden – like all black people – from growing his own food and selling it .
The nearby town of Nakuru was strictly segregated , with Africans banned from the " European areas . "
As a child , Maathai escaped into the natural landscape .
She studied the forests – how they absorbed water and turned them into streams , and how they were filled with life .
She would sit for hours under one particular fig tree , which her mother told her was sacred and life - giving and should never be damaged .
" That tree inspired awe .
It was protected .
It was the place of God .
But in the Sixties , after I had gone far away , I went back to where I grew up , " she says , " and I found God had been relocated to a little stone building called a church .
The tree was no longer sacred .
It had been cut down .
I mourned for that tree .
And I knew the trees had to live .
They have to live so we can live . "
I. A Daughter of the Soil
I am meeting Maathai in a busy hotel in London .
She approaches me in the lobby – a tall , broad woman with a bright blue headdress and a slight limp – looking frazzled .
" I have a flight in a few hours and I have packed nothing !
Ah , you know how it is , " she says .
" Let 's have coffee . "
As soon as we sit , she begins to talk about the trees , and a calm settles over her unlined 69 - year - old face .
" I am a daughter of the soil , and trees have been my life , " she says .
She begins to talk reverentially about how trees store carbon , regulate rainfall , hold soil in place , and provide food .
" I can't live without the green trees , and nor can you .
I 'm humbled by the understanding that they could get along without me though !
They sustain us , not the other way round .
We do n't really know where we came from , where we are going , and what the purpose of all this is .
But we can look at the trees and the animals and each other , and realise we are part of a web we can't really control . "
She was only able to learn the hard science of the forests because her parents made a bold decision .
At a time when girls were not often educated , her mother resolved to send her girl to school , and give her all the opportunities she had never had .
The British settler her father worked for was furious : who was going to pick his pyrethrum ?
But her mother insisted – a rare and risky act of defiance .
Maathai soon shot to the top of the class , and was offered a place at a Catholic boarding school run by Irish nuns .
When she was 13 , in her first year away at school , the rebellion against the British occupation broke out .
The Mau Mau guerrilla fighters took on the British occupiers to drive them away , killing around 100 people .
The British fought back with astonishing ferocity , killing around 100,000 Kenyans .
" The Home Guards had a reputation for extreme cruelty and all manner of terror , " she says .
Her mother was forced out of her home at gunpoint and ordered to live in an " emergency village " – a glorified camp surrounded by trenches .
Men were not allowed in .
" My mother and father did n't see each other for seven years , " she says .
" I carried messages between them .
That 's how I ended up imprisoned for the first time . "
When she was 16 , she was caught by British soldiers , and thrown into a detention camp .
" The conditions were horrible – designed to break people 's spirits and self - confidence and instil sufficient fear that they would abandon their struggle . "
It stank .
She slept on the floor and wept .
After two days , she was released .
She adds : " I will never forget the misery in that camp .
There is terrible trauma for everyone from those times . "
What does she think of the British historians who lyrically laud the British Empire , and say what happened in Kenya was merely a blip ?
" Well , that is the propaganda we all give to our subjects !
They have to do that for them to support these terrible crimes . "

It was not only humans who were being cut down .
Her forests began to be slashed by the British and replaced with vast commercial plantations growing tea for export .
These plantations could n't absorb and store water in the same way , so the groundwater levels fell to almost nothing , and the local streams dried up .
After independence , Kenya 's corrupt new ruling class continued the same policies , treating the forests as their private property to be pillaged .
But Maathai was offered a way out , to a place where she could ignore all this .
After scoring extremely highly on the national exams , she was granted a place at an American university .
It would be fully paid - for by the US Government , as part of a policy introduced by John Kennedy .
She was one of thousands of young Africans – including Barack Obama
Sr – who became part of " the Kennedy airlift " to study there .
At first , " I felt like I had landed on the moon . "
She remembers getting into her first elevator : " I thought I was going to be pulled apart ! "
She was shocked to see men and women dancing pressed up against each other and women with relative freedom .
She stayed for four years , majoring in biology in Kansas , and " America changed me in every way .
I saw the civil rights movement .
It changed what I knew about how to be a citizen , how to be a woman , how to live .
But I always knew I would go back . "
Her forests were calling .
When she arrived back in Kenya , she soon became the first woman ever to get a PhD in East or Central Africa .
She was a Professor by her mid-20s .
But she was paid far less than men in the same position , and the entirely male student body at first refused to take lessons from her in anatomy .
" But I showed them who was boss .
A failing grade from me counted as much as from any man !
That was a language they understood . "
She met a young Kenyan politician called Mwangi Maathai , and adored him .
She became swept up in his campaign to gain a seat in parliament , and quickly married him – but it soon started to go bad .
" When Mwangi won the election , I was so happy for him .
I said – what are we going to do now to get jobs for all the people we promised help for ?
He just said – oh , that was the campaign . "
She pauses , disgusted still .
" I could n't believe what I was hearing .
He did n't intend to do anything . "
She joined a group called the National Council of Women of Kenya , determined to give other people the opportunities she had been given .
" Many of the girls I was at school with were back working in the fields and living in huts , and I wanted to help them , " she says .
When she went out into their areas , she saw the forests had been razed , and malnutrition was rife .
She felt helpless and wondered what she could do .
" Then it just came to me – why not plant trees ?
The trees would provide a supply of wood that would enable women to cook nutritious foods .
They would also have wood for fencing , and fodder for cattle and goats .
The trees would offer shade for humans and animals , protect watersheds and bind the soil , and if they were fruit trees , provide food .
They would also heal the land by bringing back birds and small animals and regenerate the vitality of the earth . "
She managed to persuade international aid organisations to pay women a very small sum – around 2 p – for successfully planting each tree .
At first , local men scoffed .
What could women do ?
How could they make trees grow ?
What did this belong in our traditions ?
But women were soon organising themselves from village to village into independent committees .
" We started by planting trees , but soon we were planting ideas !
We were showing women could be an independent force .
That they were strong . "
But a scandal was waiting that threatened to leave Maathai broken – and broke .
II .
Too strong
Mwangi Maathai was jealous of his wife 's intellect and expected her to be submissive and obedient .
" He wanted me to fake failure and deny my God - given talents .
But I would n't do it , " she says .
One morning , he announced he was divorcing her – and it became a national news story .
Divorce was , at that time , a huge scandal – and the woman was always blamed .
When the case came to open court , it was filled with journalists eager to report on Mwangi 's charges that she was an adulterous witch who had caused his high blood pressure and refused to submit to his will .
She was , he announced , " too educated , too strong , too successful , too stubborn , and too hard to control . "
The men in the courtroom cheered .
" With every court proceeding , I felt stripped naked before my children , my family and friends .
It was a cruel , cruel punishment , " Maathai wrote in her autobiography , Unbowed .
She adds : " I was being turned into a sacrificial lamb .
Anybody who had a grudge against modern , educated and independent women was being given an opportunity to spit on me .
I decided to hold my head high , put my shoulders back , and suffer with dignity : I would give every woman and girl reasons to be proud and never regret being educated , successful , and talented . "
The judge found in her husband 's favour , saying she had been a disgrace as a wife and deserved nothing .
A few days later , she criticised the judge in an interview for his sexism – and he ordered she be tossed into prison for contempt of court .
" So not only had I lost my husband but I lost my freedom , " she says .
The other women prisoners were very kind to her : they let her sleep in the middle of the huddle , so she would n't be so cold .
" Far from beating me down , I felt stronger .
I knew I 'd done nothing wrong . "
When she was released , she decided to run for parliament herself , to demand rights for women .
She resigned from the university and announced her candidacy – only for another judge to declare she was ineligible to stand on the false grounds that she had n't placed herself on the electoral register .
The university – also under political pressure – refused to take her back .
Suddenly , " I was 41 years old and I had no job , no money , and I was about to be evicted from my house .
I did n't have enough money to feed my children .
I remember them wanting chips , and I just could n't afford it .
You never forget the sound of your child crying with hunger . "
She rubs her head - dress softly and says : " I thought about my mother .
She had survived everything life put at her .
She had been kept apart from my father for seven years in an emergency village .
She always survived . "
It was at this personal midnight that she returned to the small seeds she had begun to plant years before .
She decided to urge women to plant whole forests .
She wanted to see an entire new green belt across Kenya nurtured by women .
A grant by the UN Development Programme and the Norwegian Government spurred it on , and she felt herself awakening again – along with the greening land .
Then one day she read about a threat to some of the country 's most precious trees .
Daniel Arap Moi , the thuggish dictator of Kenya , decided to build over Uhuru Park , the only green space in the capital of Nairobi .
He wanted to replace it with a giant skyscraper , some luxury apartments , and a huge golden statue of himself .
So she decided to do something you were n't supposed to do in Moi 's Kenya : protest .
She led large marches to the park , and wrote to the project 's international funders , asking if they would happily pay to concrete over Hyde Park or Central Park .
" People said it would make no difference – that you can't make a dictator hear you , he 's too strong , " she says .
" But I was in Japan a few years ago and I heard a story about a hummingbird .
There 's a huge fire in the forest and all the animals run out to escape .
But the hummingbird stays , flying to and from a nearby river carrying water in its beak to put on the fire .
The animals laugh and mock this little hummingbird .
They say – the fire is so big , you can't do anything .
But the hummingbird replies – I 'm doing what I can .
There is always something we can do .
You can always carry a little water in your beak . "
But the initial reaction to her protests was frightening .
She began to receive anonymous phone calls telling her should shut up or face death .
Moi called her a " madwoman , " and announced : " According to African traditions , women should respect their men !
She has crossed the line ! "
When she carried on , she was charged with treason – a crime which carried the death penalty – and was slammed away in prison .
She had arthritis , and she says : " In that cold , wet cell my joints ached so much I thought I would die . "
But she would not apologise , or give in .
" What other people see as fearlessness is really persistence .
Because I am focused on the solution , I do n't see the danger .
If you only look at the solution , you can defy anyone and appear strong and fearless . "
It was only after international protests began to gather – led by then - Senator Al Gore – that an embarrassed Moi had to let her go .
She immediately started protesting again .
After three years of campaigning against the developers and relentless death - threats , Moi finally relented .
He dropped the project .
The park was saved .
A dictator defeated by a woman ?
Nothing like it had happened in Kenya before .
It was the moment the Moi regime began to die .
She says : " People began to think – if one little woman of no significance except her stubbornness can do this , surely the government can be changed . "
A great green wave of trees was starting to grow across the country : some 35 million have been planted by her Green Belt Movement .
But her confrontation with Moi was not over .
As a symbol of resistance , Maathai was contacted by a group of mothers whose sons had disappeared into the prison system , simply for democratically opposing the regime .
They believed their sons were being tortured .
They were frantic with fear and grief .
Maathai realised she could not refuse them .
She told them to gather up blanket and mattresses , because they were going to go to Central Nairobi , plant themselves in Moi 's vision , and refuse to leave until he released their sons .
On the first night , the police watched anxiously , unsure what to do .
Hundreds of people gathered in solidarity .
By the third day , there were thousands – and men started to publicly describe how they had been tortured by the police , and weep .
" Nothing like it had happened in our country 's history before , " she says .
But then the police swooped in with tear gas and batons .
They beat the women hard , and Maathai hardest of all .
She was carried away bleeding .
When she had to sign her name at the police station , she dipped her finger in her own blood , pouring from a crack in her head , and scrawled her name with it .
The next morning , all the women went back .
Maathai was there too , in a neck brace and bandages , insisting she would not be intimidated .
For a second time , Moi relented .
There was a sense of shock in the country – the women had won against a Big Man again , using only peaceful political pressure .
But there was a third confrontation coming .
Moi announced he was going to raze most of the Karura Forest , one of the most precious green areas in Kenya .
Again Maathai was there – this time facing down soldiers with machine guns , armed only with a small tree for her to plant .
Again , she was beaten , and she nearly died .
Again , she won in the end .
Moi 's rule was finally broken .
Within a year , he was chased from office , and Kenya saw its first democratic elections in a generation .
Maathai was elected to parliament in a landslide .
III .
Death of the rainforests ?
Are we in the rich world rendering these victories meaningless ?
As a scientist , Maathai is warning now that man-made global warming threatens to make the rainforests dry up and die , whatever she does in Kenya .
She could save them from Moi – but can she save them from us ?
" People do n't realise how much they depend for their own survival on this ecosystem and how fragile it is , " she says , almost pleading .
" The world 's forests are its lungs .
Thick , healthy strands of indigenous trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and keep them out of the atmosphere .
If the Congolese rainforests were entirely destroyed , for example , 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide would be released – equivalent to more than a decade of man-made emissions .
So if we lose these forests , we lose the fight against climate change . "
The rainforests can be killed from two directions – by the saws of men like Moi , or the warming gases of people like us .
That is why she has left the land she loves , armed with the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 2004 , and travelled so far : to try to persuade us to let the forests live .
" There are moments in history when humans have to raise their consciousness and see the world anew .
This is one of those moments .
We are being called to assist the earth in healing her wounds , and in the process we can heal our own .
We can revive our sense of belonging to a larger community of life .
We can see who we really are . "
When I tell her some people say environmentalism is a rich person 's luxury without any relevance for the poor , she lets out a low scoff .
" The exact opposite is the case !
The people who are at greatest risk are poor .
When the problems hit , it 's them who are going to be hit worst .
They have no money to adapt or flee .
They still get their water from the rivers .
Their agriculture is very dependent on rainfall .
They will die first . "
If man -made global warming continues at the current rate , she says there will be " catastrophe " in Africa .
" First of all there will be a fast spread of the Sahara desert .
It is spreading now .
So events like what is happening in Darfur will get much worse .
There will be violent competition over shrinking arable land , grazing land and water points as the desert spreads and dries up the land .
Second , there will be crop failure because of changing rainfall patterns , and we will get massive starvation .
What happens then ?
As we all know , people do n't sit down and wait to die .
They migrate .
They will try to come here to Europe . "
As she speaks , I remember the last time I saw the Congolese rainforest .
Logging on a large scale had just begun , and the stumps of cut trees were visible everywhere , like stubble on a dry , cracking face .
Maathai is a UN Goodwill Ambassador for this rainforest – and says saving it is an " urgent priority for us all .
It covers 700,000 square miles .
It is a quarter of all the tropical rainforest remaining on earth ...
It affects weather patterns all over the world .
It has n't been cut a lot until now because the conflict there means it can't be accessed . "
But even the cutting down of trees in the Congo Basin that has already happened produced a 35 per cent drop in the amount of rain that falls in the Great Lakes Region of the United States in February .
Does she believe there is a choice between encouraging development and saving the environment ?
" Not at all , " she says quickly .
" You do n't reduce poverty in a vacuum .
You reduce it in an environment .
In Kenya , one of our biggest exports is coffee .
Where do you grow coffee ?
You grow coffee in the land .
To be able to grow coffee you need rain , you need special kinds of soil that are found on the hillsides , and that means you need to protect that land from soil erosion .
You need to make sure they can hold the rain so that it flows as rivers and streams .
You need forests to regulate the rainfall .
You can't grow anything in a wrecked environment . "
In reality , " poverty is both a cause and a symptom of environmental degradation .
They have to be dealt with together .
When you 're poor , you will take whatever you can to stay alive today , which degrades the environment , and makes you ever poorer .
It 's a matter of breaking the cycle .
Paying people to plant trees was the best idea I had to break the cycle and it is working . "
But it is , she adds , not enough .
For the forests – and a recognisable climate – to survive , there needs to be dramatic change on both sides .
We in the West need to change our carbon emissions – and Africans , she says , need to change their culture , by rediscovering something that was smashed by colonialism .
She says there is a " vacuum " at the heart of Africa – one that needs to be met by radically changing how the continent works .
IV .
The Taboo
As she oversaw the mass planting of trees , Maathai steadily realised the ripping up and hacking down of the forests is only a symptom of a much - wider problem – one that was crippling Africa .
" The disease remained .
What made our leaders treat their own country like it was a colony , not something they were part of ?
It was the same disease that causes corruption and very bad leadership . "
There was something wrong in how African societies worked – something so deep and puzzling that she has just written a whole book trying to figure it out , called The Challenge For Africa .
She touches on many problems , from global warming to unfair trade policies , but the most intriguing section is one that breaches a taboo about Africa – the fact that most Africans identify not with their country , but with their tribe .
" Colonialism destroyed Africans ' cultural and spiritual heritage , " she says .
" Any culture is accumulated knowledge and wisdom , built up over millennia .
It tells you how to live in your environment , how to understand life .
All our accumulated knowledge was wiped out in just a few years .
It was n't written down , so it died with our elders .
Now it is lost forever . "
This had many effects : " Before , there was something deep in our culture that made us respect the environment .
We did n't look at trees and see timber .
We did n't look at elephants and see ivory .
It was in our culture to let them be .
That was wiped out . "
Part of her work is trying to restore that lost sense of respect for the ecosystem – one that has been proved essential by science .
But this erasure of African culture also left another wound , one harder still to rectify .
" It left us with a terrible lack of self - knowledge .
Who are we ?
This is the most natural question for human beings .
What group do I belong to ?
Where did I come from ?
We no longer had an answer . "
They were told to forget what came before .
In Kenya when the British invaded , there were 42 different tribes – or " micro-nations " , as she prefers to call them , because it removes the taint of " primitivism " .
These old identities were supposed to be abandoned for an identity that consisted of lines arbitrarily draw on a map by their European killers .
" The modern African state is a superficial creation : a loose collection of ethnic communities brought together by the colonial powers , " she says .
" Most Africans did n't understand or relate to the nations created for them .
They remained attached to their micronations . "
The result has been " a kind of political schizophrenia .
Africans have been obscured from ourselves .
It is like we have looked at ourselves through another person 's mirror – and seen only cracked reflections and distorted images . "
They have been told to adopt identities like " Kenyan " that make no sense to them .
" It is impossible to speak meaningfully of a South African , Congolese , Kenyan or Zambian culture , " she explains .
" There are only micronations .
But we are still living in denial .
We are denying who we are . "
The result is that when a leader comes to power , he does n't try to govern on behalf of his people – and they do n't expect him to .
He delivers for his own tribe , at the expense of the others .
" What they call ' the nation ' is a veneer laid over a cultureless state – without values , identity , or character , " she says .
The mechanism of democratic accountability breaks down : the leader is not expected to serve his people , but only a small fraction of them .
Elections consist of different tribes fighting to hijack the state to use in their own interests .
The system of winner - takes - all democracy – where you need 50.5 per cent of the vote and get 100 per cent of the power – encourages this , and will never work in Africa , she says .
Maathai believes there is a way out of this – but it is absolutely not to pretend tribes do n't exist , or to urge people to simply overcome these identities .
" We have been telling people to transcend their micronations for so long , and it has n't happened .
They are urged to shed the identity of their micronations and become citizens of the new modern state , even though no African really knows what the character of that modern state might be beyond a passport and an identity card .
It does n't work . "
The tribal violence in Kenya last year after the election was , she says , even more proof .
She wants to find another route .
Instead of a melting pot that pretends all identities will merge into one , she wants to create a salad bowl – one where every piece is different , but together they form a perfect whole .
" Instead of all attempting the impossible task of being the same , we should learn to embrace our diversity , " she writes in the book .
" African children should be taught that the peoples of their country are different in some ways , but because of Africa 's historical legacy , they need to work together ...
The different micro-nations would be much more secure and likely to flourish if they accepted who they are and worked together .
In my view , Africans have to re-embrace their micronational cultures , languages and values , and then bring the best of them to the table of the nation state . "
In addition to conventional parliaments , she says that in each African nation there should be assemblies bringing together all the different tribal groups , modelled on the United Nations .
There , they could find common ground , and negotiate areas of disagreement .
" It is the only way to heal a psyche wounded by denial of who they really are , " she says .
Every African should rediscover and feel comfortable in their tribal identity , and feel it is properly represented in the political structures of the state .
Only then can they share and live together , she believes .
That way , everyone will feel they have a stake in the state all the time – not just when one of their men has managed to seize the reins .
She discovered this sense of calm when , in her forties , she rediscovered her Kikuyu roots .
The Kikuyus had regarded the trees and Mount Kikuyu 's glaciers as the closest thing they had to a sacred being , something worthy of respect .
She too found value there , rather than in the dessicated texts left behind by the colonialists .
" When they erased our culture , we were left with a vacuum , and it was filled with the values of the Bible – but that is not the coded values of our people . "
But is n't there a danger that you are romanticising past cultures and the equally - irrational beliefs that went with them ?
Were n't these cultures also committed to keeping women separate and subordinate ?
Is n't your great achievement to break with the traditional subordination of women ?
She nods .
" Culture is a double - edged sword , " she says .
" It can be used to strike a blow for empowerment , or to keep down somebody who wants to be different .
There are negative aspects to any culture .
We should only retain what is good .
We were taught for so long that what came before colonialism was all bad .
It was n't .
We were told our attachment to the land was primitive and a block on progress .
It was n't .
We had a ritual – ituika – through which leaders were accountable to their people and could be changed .
And people took what they needed but did n't accumulate or destroy in the process .
Those are values we need to rebuild in Africa . "
She suddenly leans forward and says : " That is the way we will save the rainforests , and prevent global warming ! "
She is going to follow this goal with the same feverish intensity that drove her from a mud-hut to the Nobel Prize , and enabled her to stand firm through beatings and imprisonments so she could knock down a dictator .
Can will - power and a relentless focus on the solution pull us through the climate crisis as it pulled her through a tyranny ?
Before I can ask this , she stands up .
" Now I must finish packing .
My flight is so soon , and my clothes are all over the room ! "
In a whirl of bright green , she laughs and limps off through the lobby .
She has a slightly pained gait , the result of too many nights sleeping on the floor of damp jail cells .
She turns back and waves with a strange bend in her back – as if she is still weighed down , after all this time , by the ghost of that single felled fig tree she failed to save .

A hopeful note , but do n’t get too excited .
The data ’s actually pretty discouraging .
Gallup ’s October Crime poll finds 44 % of Americans in favor of making marijuana legal and 54 % opposed .
U.S. public support for legalizing marijuana was fixed in the 25 % range from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s , but acceptance jumped to 31 % in 2000 and has continued to grow throughout this decade …
The highest level of support for decriminalizing the use of marijuana today is seen with self - described liberals , among whom 78 % are in favor .
In contrast , 72 % of conservatives are opposed .
Moderates are about evenly divided on whether the use of marijuana should be legal , although they tilt against it ( 51 % vs. 46 % ) …
Gallup also finds a generational rift on the issue , as 50 % of those under 50 and 45 % of those 50 to 64 say it should be legal , compared with 28 % of seniors .
Only 28 percent of Republicans support legalization , and regionally , only in the west does it enjoy majority approval .
( In the midwest , which looks set to have an outsized role in presidential elections in 2012 and going forward , it ’s at 42 percent . )
I was thinking this morning that the positive bipartisan buzz
The One ’s getting for the DOJ ’s new federalist policy on medical marijuana might tempt him to consider a broader legalization effort — which he once kinda sorta supported — but these numbers make it unlikely .
Even with support at an all - time high he ’s still 10 points in the hole , and with ObamaCare on his plate and the looming meltdown of Medicare and Social Security , ai n’t no way no chance no how either side ’s going to further antagonize high - turnout seniors by defending the demon weed .
Exit question : 72 percent of conservatives oppose legalization ?
Pathetic .
I would have referred to them as Spiny Shell Condoms , but that would have given the comic a completely different feel .
Literally .
I had this comic finished pretty close to midnight EST , but I wanted to create a mock wrapper for a Blue Shell Condom .
Thought it adds a little something more to the experience .
Or at the very least a picture of a fake condom wrapper .
Seriously though , the blue shells or spiny shells or whatever kind of shell you want to call them are a mixed bag of tricks .
On one side , its a cheap way to win and an even cheaper way to lose .
It can completely destroy the whole skill aspect of any given race .
Then again , it does add a completely random level of uncertainty of how a race will play out even until the very last second .
So I guess I have a love hate kind of relationship with the blue spiny shells .
Though , it ’s still an extremely crappy way to lose .
Have a differing opinion ?

It would be really hard to add terrain tools to our engine and keep the quality we have for the terrain , but sometimes it is still nice to layout a level using sculpting tools .
I have recently been testing out doing basic layout in Mudbox before making a height map in xNormal , and finally running it through World Machine 2 .
This workflow is a bit awkward , but still allows us to automatically generate a lot of nice terrain data , and so is actually still faster than many other methods .
Here is a comparison with the Mudbox sculpt on the top , and the same terrain in the engine :
Some small details are lost , but it is still nice to be able to have control of the layout , and work with a tool for sculpting as advanced as Mudbox .
Here is the new level I am working on that takes advantage of this technique !

As the US currency continues to set fresh 12 - month lows , the stock market is nearing a 12 - month high and the economy is back from the brink of disaster .
That 's rarely the case in an economy that is seeing normal growth .
But in an investing world where up is down and day is night , that 's how things may have to stay for a while .
" A weak dollar is boosting everything that 's priced in dollars — boosting stocks , even bond prices and especially commodities , " says Delta Global Advisors chief economist Michael Pento , who worries over the long - term ramifications of dollar - weakening policies .
" What you 're seeing now is we 've traded long - term growth for a short - term boost in nominal gains . "
The Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive dollar devaluation policy — primarily by slashing interest rates — following the blowup of the financial markets in 2008 .
The Fed said Wednesday it was continuing to keep its key interest rate near zero and expressed little concern about inflation .
Policy makers have felt it critical , in part , to lower the prices on US assets to get foreign investors to start buying again and inject liquidity back into the financial system .
Foreign demand for US goods is important as domestic consumers weaken under the burdens of surging unemployment and stagnant wages .
Thus the need for a weak currency .
Since the trough of the financial crisis stock prices have recovered strongly — more than 50 percent in many indexes — but the dollar has tumbled and commodity prices , particularly oil and precious metals , have soared .
" We 've been the big consumer country driving global growth and that 's shifted .
As a consequence we 'll be relying more on our export potential , " says Kurt Karl , chief economist at Swiss Re in New York .
" For that , a weak dollar is good .
But also part of the story for a weak dollar is we do n't have the internal demand driving growth as we have in the past . "
Investors worried about inflation due to the influx of dollars in the system have been betting against the dollar as well , and there have been calls from other countries to consider replacing the greenback as the international reserve currency .
Money has flowed to the stock market broadly , but specifically in commodity - sensitive stocks and the goods themselves .
Oil prices have nearly doubled from their lows late in 2008 while gold has soared to record highs .
Yet some see the trade unwinding at a point in the not too distant future , presenting a challenging climate for investors banking on the weak greenback .
" I can assure you that some time in the near future — I 'm not talking about 10 years from now , but in four to six quarters — you will see that inflation left unchecked will destroy the earnings power of corporations and hence lower the return for investors and perhaps even the nominal returns for investors , " Pento says .
Some worry that both stocks and commodities are being driven by a trade that is speculative and technical in nature and not supported by fundamentals .
The example of crude rising even as global demand remains soft is one area that has drawn concern .
" There could not be a more lucid anecdotal example of the large amounts of speculative dollars that are flowing through the commodity markets , " Mike O'Rourke , chief market strategist at BTIG in New York , wrote in an analysis for clients .
" We all know what happens when a trend becomes too obvious .
It is usually weeks away from collapsing in on itself . "
For now , though , investors have little choice but to follow the trend .
Those who wo n't want to get into direct currency trades can play the dollar through the PowerShares US Dollar Index Bull ETF that holds long contracts in the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies .
" A weak dollar does work for us , " says Kathy Boyle , president of Chapin Hill Advisors in New York .
" Foreign investors are just getting out of the dollar because of the global attitude towards it .
But at some point everything gets overdone . "
That could come sooner than some people think , says Matt Havens , partner in Global Vision Advisors in Hingham , Mass .
Havens thinks a widening trade deficit and higher savings rate will trigger a shortage of dollars that will drive their worth higher .
" The dollar is a reflection of this perception of high inflation , " Havens says .
" We could be at an inflection point where we see that reverse . "
Upcoming ABC series FlashForward is about people who see the future .
But there 's no futurism in it .
Robert Sawyer , author of the novel that inspired the series , said the show 's producers felt they could sell science , but not the future .

Speaking to us at WorldCon science fiction convention in Montreal , Sawyer explained why the show ( featuring John Cho , pictured here in a publicity shot for FlashForward ) changes his novel in one significant way .
The characters get a glimpse only six months into the future , rather than the two decades they get in the novel .
Sawyer says executive producers David Goyer and Brannon Braga chose to do that for a few reasons :
One rationale is pure economics : you do n't have to make the future world .
But it 's also about audience .
For example , here 's the difference between Battlestar Galactica and Lost .
Lost gets 10 million viewers and Battlestar Galactica rarely tops 1 million , even if Battlestar Galactica is arguably a better show .
And that 's because as soon as audience sees robots and aliens , it dries up .
They tune into other channels .
Not showing the future on FastForward allows the audience to build .

Sawyer is a creative consultant and what he calls an " unofficial science consultant " on the ABC series .
" I 've been very impressed by how well - informed David [ Goyer ] is about science , and how important it is to him , " Sawyer said .
I asked whether the show would revolve around an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider , the way the novel does , and he was mum on that point .
But he did offer a hint : " They needed a science consultant for the show , so that tells you something about what 's going to happen . "
Mainly , though , Sawyer is happy with the writing on the show .
He enthused :
The ever - informative Technology Review previews new handheld drug detection devices by Philips that can be employed by law enforcement ( or potentially one ’s employer ) to detect the presence of banned or illicit substances in the human body , notably cannabis .
This is indeed bittersweet news as there are two likely policy outcomes .
The first is that drivers will be subject to more and more roadside drug tests , however the secondary policy outcomes may provide some benefit for individuals and society : a ) Current roadside testing is notoriously inaccurate and subject to challenge , b) Most testing today performed by law enforcement is urine or hair follicle testing ( which only measures for inert metabolites from past drug use , not impairment or recent use ) , a roadside ‘ sobriety ’ test that can detect very recent cannabis use ( within a few hours ) narrows the window of personal liability and criminality , and c )
Many law enforcement personnel will agree in debate that the social controls created by legalization and regulation is ideally preferred to the international chaos , potential harm caused to police and ineffectiveness of prohibition–but the one inch of ground few police will yield on is driving while impaired .
Dozens of law enforcement officials , from patrol officers to heads of state police departments to state Attorneys General , have told me that they can not become converts to reform absent an accurate roadside test like they currently have for alcohol ( which is an interesting and awkward way of acknowledging that current roadside drug tests police often give drivers are problematic )
Maybe , in time , the subset of American society that most vociferously opposes ending cannabis prohibition –the law enforcement community –will come to be sated by the satisfaction that similar to alcohol - impaired drivers , they ’ll be able to fairly and accurately detect cannabis - impaired drivers .
After all , ask yourself this :
When have you ever seen police or their industry associations ( ie , Chiefs of Police Association , Fraternal Order of Police , etc … ) publicly lobby in favor of bringing back alcohol prohibition and re-criminalizing alcohol consumption ?
Have these law enforcement trade groups funded and supported public campaigns against impaired or reckless driving ?
Sure , and all the power to them !
But , propagandizing that the producers , sellers and consumers of the very dangerous drug alcohol ( or for that matter , pharmaceuticals ) be considered common criminals , and a threat to society ?
No .
Americans will not ( hopefully ) ever see police and their trade groups seeking to re-vilify alcohol products .
What will it take to get the law enforcement community to finally support cannabis law reforms ?
Our bittersweet friend … technology .
Device Offers a Roadside Dope Test
The system uses magnetic nanoparticles to detect traces of cocaine , heroin , cannabis , and methamphetamine .
By Alexander Gelfand
— — — — — ———-
Later this year , Philips will introduce a handheld electronic device that uses magnetic nanoparticles to screen for five major recreational drugs .
The device is intended for roadside use by law enforcement agencies and includes a disposable plastic cartridge and a handheld analyzer .
The cartridge has two components : a sample collector for gathering saliva and a measurement chamber containing magnetic nanoparticles .
The particles are coated with ligands that bind to one of five different drug groups : cocaine , heroin , cannabis , amphetamine , and methamphetamine .
Philips began investigating the possibility of building a magnetic biodetector in 2001 , two years after a team of researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) in Washington , DC , first used magnetic sensors similar to those employed in hard drives to sniff out certain biowarfare agents .
The NRL scientists labeled biological molecules designed to bind to target agents with magnetic microbeads , and then scanned for the tagged targets optically and magnetically .
The latter approach used the same giant magnetoresistant ( GMR ) sensors that read the bits on an iPod ’s hard drive .
They quickly developed a shoebox - sized prototype capable of detecting toxins , including ricin and anthrax .
Philips initially developed both a GMR sensor and an optical one that relies on frustrated total internal reflection ( FTIR ) –the same phenomenon that underlies fingerprint scanners and multitouch screens .
The company decided to go the FTIR route in order to exploit its expertise in building optical sensors for consumer electronics devices , says Jeroen Nieuwenhuis , technical director of Philips Handheld Immunoassays , the division responsible for commercializing the biosensor technology , which goes by the trade name Magnotech .
Moving to an optical detection method also allowed Philips to simplify the test cartridges that the device employs , making them easier to mass - produce , says Nieuwenhuis .
With the current FTIR - based system , “ we can make simpler cartridges in larger quantities more easily , ” he adds .
Once the device ’s sample collector has absorbed enough saliva , it automatically changes color and can then be snapped into the measurement chamber , where the saliva and nanoparticles mix .
An electromagnet speeds the nanoparticles to the sensor surface , different portions of which
have been pretreated with one of the five target - drug molecules .
If traces of any of the five drugs are present in the sample , the nanoparticles will bind to them .
If the sample is drug free , the nanoparticles will bind to the drug - coated sensor surface instead .
The orientation of the magnetic field that first drew the nanoparticles to the sensor is then reversed , pulling away any nano - labeled drug molecules that may accidentally have stuck to the sensor surface but leaving legitimately bound ones in place .
This last magnetic trick promises to reduce what Larry Kricka , a clinical chemist at the University of Pennsylvania who recently co-authored an article in Clinical Chemistry on the use of magnetism in point - of - care testing , calls “ a major restraint in such assays ” : the unintentional capture of molecular labels on the test surface , a leading cause of both false positives and false negatives .
Kricka is not involved with Philips but does serve as a consultant to T2 Biosciences , a Cambridge , MA , firm that promotes a magnetic biosensor based on MRI technology .
During the analysis phase , a beam of light is bounced off the sensor .
Any nanoparticles bound to the surface will change its refractive index , thereby altering the intensity of the reflected light and indicating the concentration of drugs in the sample .
By immobilizing different drug molecules on different portions on the sensor surface , the analyzer is able to identify the drug traces in question .
An electronic screen displays instructions and a simple color - coded readout of the results .
The test takes less than 90 seconds and can detect drugs at concentrations measured in parts - per- billion using a single microliter of saliva .
The sensor is capable of even greater sensitivity –it has been used to detect cardiac troponin , a commonly used indicator of heart attack , at concentrations 1,000 times lower .
Philips plans ultimately to enter the healthcare market .
It is working on a platform capable of testing blood as well as saliva and is seeking partners that can help expand its testing menu by providing it with additional biomarkers .
Other researchers have built experimental devices to magnetically detect a wide range of biomolecules in minuscule samples of blood or saliva at extremely low concentrations .
Often this involves using microfluidic or magnetic forces to quickly shepherd the magnetically labeled molecules through scanners –though a group at the University of Utah has even built a prototype in which a sample - laden stick is swiped across a GMR sensor , like a credit - card through a reader .
The combination of high sensitivity , low sample volumes , miniaturization , speed , and ease of use has raised hopes for a handheld biosensor that could perform sophisticated tests with high accuracy .
“ Everyone ’s trying to get there , ” says Kricka .
“ The question is who ’s going to win ? ” With Philips set to introduce its drug tester in Europe by the end of the year in partnership with the British diagnostics firm Cozart , the consumer electronics maker appears poised to take the prize .

( CNN ) --
A raging blaze at a fuel storage complex in Puerto Rico lit up the night sky Friday near San Juan as firefighters battled to keep it from spreading further .
i Reporter Maria Marquez photographed the flames early Friday from the 17th floor of her San Juan condominium .
Fifteen of the 40 tanks at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in the city of Bayamon were ablaze more than 19 hours after an explosion of unknown origin rocked the complex , Gov. Luis Fortuno said at an evening news conference .
The governor had put the tally at 11 a few hours earlier .
" I do n't think there 's ever been a fire like this in Puerto Rico , " Fire Lt. Jose Atorre told CNN affiliate WLII - TV .
The fire started shortly after midnight , when at least one fuel tank exploded .
Residents described a surreal scene after the blast woke them from their sleep and shattered windows miles away .
" I was in bed and all of a sudden heard this really horrible sound , so I ran upstairs and thought the whole town had blown up , " said Teo Freytes , who filed an iReport for CNN .
" The explosion blew out windows here in Old San Juan , " he said .
" It 's still burning outrageously . "
Others woke up Friday morning to an extremely unusual sight .
" I did n't expect to see a mushroom cloud from my house , " said Justin Gehrke , a U.S. Army civilian employee who also filed an iReport .
Fortuno said he declared a state of emergency for the area so Puerto Rico can get aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
The storage and refinery complex sits near San Juan 's bay , and Fortuno said officials are working to protect the water from being affected .
" We have serious worries that the bay or other bodies of water could be contaminated , " he said .
Caribbean Petroleum 's
Web site says the complex has storage facilities for gasoline and gasoline - related products .
" We have been monitoring the water visually and we have installed preventive pads and other material to contain a spill , " said Pedro Nieves , chairman of the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board .
" No oil has reached the water . "
But Nieves said that Caribbean Petroleum has a history of spills and " there was potential that it had contaminated ground water . "
He said he did not have any specifics on hand and that his organization was more focused on containing the current problem of fire and smoke .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately return calls about the company 's environmental history .
Newspaper and TV reports said a 4 - inch pipe from a lagoon on the complex was broken , preventing firefighters from using 2 million gallons of water from the lake to battle the blaze .
About 150 area firefighters and 215 National Guard personnel were battling to keep the blaze from spreading .
One person suffered smoke inhalation and was taken to a hospital , Fortuno said .
At least 350 people were evacuated to a nearby stadium .
iReport.com : See , share , send images of the explosion
The smoke can be toxic for people with breathing conditions and officials have asked nearby residents to stay away , the governor said .
" This is a tremendous amount of smoke , and fire contains all kinds of irritants and this is oil that is burning , " said Mary Mears , spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency region that includes Puerto Rico .
" It 's smoke , so you 're going to notice coughing , tearing , maybe a sore throat . "
The wind shifted to the north Friday morning , blowing most of the smoke over less - populated areas and the Atlantic Ocean .
The smoke plume also is rising 5,000 feet straight up before starting to drift , which keeps it away from people on the ground .
" The average air quality for Puerto Rico is still good , " Nieves said .
But the wind was expected to change Saturday morning , blowing the smoke over a large part of the island west of the fire .
Officials also are concerned that rain mixed with the smoke could lead to acid rain .
Authorities urged residents to bring in animals and their food and for people not to go out during or after any precipitation .
The National Guard Combat Support Team was helping to monitor air quality and local environmental officials were working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to install monitors near the blaze .
Officials will investigate the cause of the blaze .
Puerto Rico is a U.S. protectorate , which means federal officials are involved .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms sent a team of fire investigators , but have yet to determine whether the fire was an accident or set deliberately , said Orlando Felix , ATF Resident Agent in Charge of the Puerto Rico office .
The FBI confirmed it is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire .
A spray - painted message on the two tunnels , less than three miles apart , said : " Boom , fire , RIP , Gulf , Soul , ACNF . "
" We have found graffiti in two different locations , " FBI Special Agent Harry Rodriguez told CNN .
" We are looking into the matter as part of this investigation with respect to the fire at the fuel - holding facility . "
Rodriguez and San Juan police spokeswoman Maria Del Pilar
Bon said they did not know what or who ACNF is .
Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand in Puerto Rico .
Speaking at a news conference Friday afternoon , Fortuno said all leads must be followed .
" There could be many reasons [ for the fire ] , " he said .
" We 're not going to guess .
But there has to be an investigation . "
Caribbean Petroleum , which owns 200 gas stations in Puerto Rico and several inland distribution facilities , supplies much of the island 's fuel .
But Department of Consumer Affairs Secretary Luis Rivera Marin said there is enough fuel on hand for 24 days , and 16 million gallons of gasoline were in transit to the island .
He also froze prices at the level they were at 8:06 a.m .
Officials transferred 295 inmates from a high - security prison in the area to other facilities , which they declined to identify for security purposes .
Another 1,600 prisoners were moved from another nearby facility .
Some 200 extra prison officials were brought in to handle the transfers , Fortuno said .
Watch iReporter 's account of the blast and fire »
Video on WLII showed a caravan of white vans with sirens blaring transferring the prisoners ,
San Juan police said they activated all units : explosives , transit , tactical operations and SWAT .
Schools in Bayamon , San Juan , Toa Baja and Catano were closed , as was Puerto Rico Road 28 .
Roads 5 and 22 were partially closed .
Flights in and out of Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan were not affected , an airport official told CNN .
CNN 's Jackie Castillo and Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report .

Reading this makes you wonder what it would take for Fox to delete a comment .
It makes you wonder what was said in any comments that they did delete .
This is the same enterprise that pays Glenn Beck ( handsomely ) to spew racist garbage .
Talk about showing your true colors .
At least we know where they stand .
Addendum :
It just occurred to me that McDonalds is a significant advertiser on Fox News as well as other Murdoch properties : Fox , McDonald 's ink blockbuster deal .
Does McDonalds know about the hate speech that their business partner is engaging in against them ?

Enough dithering !
President Barack Obama says it ’s time to act on health care .
I agree .
But act how ?
Are we really going to be happy with the pussy - footing proposals floating around Congress ?
All the so - called reformers want to do is tinker with insurance regulations .
But how effective would that be , considering that the insurance companies themselves support the changes ?
We have taken our eyes off the ball , people .
Let ’s get back to first principles .
Mr. Obama ’s premise is that we have a right to health care .
A right .
America was founded on the idea of rights — inalienable rights .
No one can take them away .
I assume that when people say that health care is a right , they mean that health care is an inalienable right .
Mr. Obama apparently agrees .
In his speech before Congress he called for free services , such as physical exams , colonoscopies , and mammograms .
Free !
You have a right to those things .
Well , OK .
But why stop at free preventive services ?
Why not free treatments , free surgery , free drugs , and so on ?
We need those things as much as a physical exam .
If we have a right to health care and if we are unable to obtain those services , our rights have been denied or violated .
That is something the advocates of health - care “ reform ” say we must not tolerate .
Okay , let ’s not tolerate it .
Let ’s make sure no one ’s right to health care is violated .
Let ’s get serious for a change .
But how ?
I can think of only one efficient way to accomplish this .
Let ’s enslave the providers of medical services — doctors , nurses , paramedics , dentists , chiropractors , acupuncturists , psychiatrists , and the rest .
My proposal may shock people , but I am confident that this feeling will wear off as we think about how logically it flows from the principle that we have a right to health care .
First , let me point out that there is no other good alternative .
Any other system designed to deliver health care as a matter of right will have gaps through which the least fortunate inevitably will slip .
Is n’t that the problem we ’re trying to fix ?
Obama ’s approach is n’t much better .
He wants to force the insurance companies , with taxpayer subsidies if necessary , to insure everyone — healthy or sick , young or old — at the same price .
He might even like a government insurance option , though he can’t make up his mind whether or not that is an essential feature of his plan .
Regardless , it ’s a bad plan .
Requiring insurance companies to pay for our medical care misses the point .
Where do you think insurance companies get their money ?
From us !
What kind of right to health care is it if we end up paying for it anyway ?
Obama means well , but his plan is a shell game .
On the other hand , enslaving the doctors and other providers would have none of the defects of the current system or the leading reform plans .
It goes right to the source .
We have a right to health care ?
Fine .
Force the doctors to provide it .
Of course , this would n’t be free .
I ’m no pie - in - the - sky utopian .
The doctors and the others would have to be fed , clothed , and housed .
They ’d need certain comforts .
That ’s understood .
But it would be far easier to keep a lid on costs by enslaving the providers than by the patchwork system we have now , or would have under Mr. Obama ’s plan .
The biggest problem I can see is that if doctors are going to be our slaves , no one will want to be a doctor .
Most people do n’t relish the idea of being slaves even in the national interest .
They ’re selfish that way .
We certainly ca n’t be a world - class country without doctors and nurses , so I have a solution to this problem : conscription .
President Obama should direct the nation ’s schools to look out for students with an aptitude for biology and direct them into medical studies .
Then , at the appropriate time , the government should draft those young people into the newly created U.S. Medical Service Corps .
I know what you ’re thinking :
As word of this got around , the best students will play dumb .
If that happens , we ’ll have no other choice than to pick our doctors by lottery .
Far -Right Fears New Push To Outlaw Germany 's Neo-Nazi Party
Right wing extremist political party , the NPD , was re-elected in Saxony two weeks ago .
Now a leading politician in Bavaria wants to seek a national ban on them .
But his push is causing political conflict .
Because while most German politicians want to stop the NPD , they can't decide how best to do so .
Take it from us , your London - based sleuths , when anything sells faster than Harry Potter books or DVDs in the UK , it 's scorching hot .
Case in point is Microsoft 's Vista successor , which has sold so well that it has beaten the Amazon UK pre-order record previously held by J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .
In fact , Windows 7 was able to tally up more sales in the first 8 hours of pre-order availability than Vista was able to collect altogether .
Now that 's what we call an upgrade .
When it comes to Open Data in Canada and the United States , things appear to be similar .
Both countries have several municipalities with Open Data portals : Washington , D.C. , San Francisco , and now New York City in the US , Vancouver and Nanaimo in Canada with Toronto , Edmonton , Calgary and Ottawa thinking about or initiating plans .
But the similarities end there .
In particular there is a real , yawning gap at the federal level .
America has data.gov but here in Canada there is no movement on the Open Data front .
There are some open data sets , but nothing comprehensive , and nothing that follows is dedicated to following the three laws of open data .
No data.gc.ca in the works .
Not even a discussion .
Why is that ?
As esoteric as it may sound , I believe the root of the issues lies in the country ’s differing political philosophies .
Let me explain .
It is important to remember that the United States was founded on the notion of popular sovereignty .
As such its sovereignty lies with the people , or as Wikipedia nicely puts it :
The American Revolution marked a departure in the concept of popular sovereignty as it had been discussed and employed in the European historical context .
With their Revolution , Americans substituted the sovereignty in the person of the English king , George III , with a collective sovereign — composed of the people .
Henceforth , American revolutionaries by and large agreed and were committed to the principle that governments were legitimate only if they rested on popular sovereignty – that is , the sovereignty of the people .
( italics are mine )
Thus data created by the US government is , quite literally , the people ’s data .
Yes , nothing legally prevents the US government from charging for information and data but the country ’s organizing philosophy empowers citizens to stand up and say – this is our data , we ’d like it please .
In the United States the burden is on the government to explain why it is withholding that which the people own ( a tradition that admittedly is hardly perfect as anyone alive from the years 2000 - 2008 will attest to ) .
But do n’t underestimate the power of this norm .
Its manifestations are everywhere , such as in the legal requirement that any document created by the United States government be published in the public domain ( e.g. it can not have any copyright restrictions placed on it ) or in America ’s vastly superior Freedom of Information laws .
This is very different notion of sovereignty than exists in Canada .
This country never deviated from the European context described above .
Sovereignty in Canada does not lie with the people , indeed , it resides in King George the III ’s descendant , the present day Queen of England .
The government ’s data is n’t your , mine , or “ our ” data .
It ’s hers .
Which means it is at her discretion , or more specifically , the discretion of her government servants , to decide when and if it should be shared .
This is the ( radically different ) context under which our government ( both the political and public service ) , and its expectations around disclosure , have evolved .
As an example , note that government documents in Canada are not public domain , they are published under a Crown Copyright that , while less restrictive than copyright , nonetheless constrains reuse ( no satire allowed ! ) and is a constant reminder of the fact that Canadian citizens do n’t own what their tax dollars create .
The Queen does .
The second reason why open data has a harder time taking root in Canada is because of the structure of our government .
In America , new projects are easier to kick start because the executive welds greater control over the public service .
The Open Data initiative that started in Washington , D.C. spread quickly to the White House because its champion and mastermind , the District ’s of Columbia ’s CTO Vivek Kundra , was appointed Federal CIO by President Obama .
Yes , Open Data tapped into an instinctual reflex to disclose that ( I believe ) is stronger down south than here , but it was executed because America ’s executive branch is able to appoint officials much deeper into government ( for those who care , in Canada Deputy Ministers are often appointed , but in the United States appointments go much deeper , down into the Assistant Deputy and even into the Director General level ) .
Both systems have merits , and this is not a critic of Canada ’s approach , simply an observation .
However , it does mean that a new priority , like open data , can be acted upon quickly and decisively in the US .
( For more on these difference I recommend reading John Ibbitson ’s book Open & Shut ) .
These difference have several powerful implications for open data in Canada .
As a first principle , if Canadians care about open data we will need to begin fostering norms in our government , among ourselves , and in our politicians , that support the idea that what our government creates ( especially in terms of research and data ) is ours and that we should not only have unfettered access to it , but the right to analyze and repurpose it .
The point here is n’t just that this is a right , but that open data enhances democracy , increases participation and civic engagement and strengthens our economy .
Enhancing this norm is a significant national challenge , one that will take years to succeed .
But instilling it into the culture of our public service , our civic discourse and our political process is essential .
In the end , we have to ask ourselves – in a way our American counterparts are n’t likely to ( but need to ) – do we want an open country ?
This means that secondly , Canadians are going to have to engage in a level of education of – particularly senior – public servants on open data that is much broader and more comprehensive than our American counterparts had to .
In the US , an executive fiat and appointment has so far smoothed the implementation of open data solutions .
That will likely not work here .
We have many , many , many allies in the public service who believe in open data ( and who understand it is integral to public service sector renewal ) .
The key is to spread that knowledge and support upwards , to educate senior decision - makers , especially those at the DG , ADM and DM level to whom both the technology and concept is essentially foreign .
It is critical that these decision - makers become comfortable with and understand the benefits of open data quickly .
If not we are unlikely to keep pace with ( or even follow ) our American counterparts , something , I believe is essential for our government and economy .
Second , Canadians are going to have to mobilize to push for open data as a political issue .
Even if senior public servants get comfortable with the idea , it is unlikely there will be action unless politicians understand that Canadians want both greater transparency and the opportunity to build new services and applications on government data .
( I ’d also argue that another reason why Open Data has taken root in the US more quickly than here is the nature of its economy .
As a country that thrives on services and high tech , open data is the basic ingredient that helps drive growth and innovation .
Consequently , there is increasing corporate support for open data .
Canada , in contrast , with its emphasis on natural resources , does not have a corporate culture that recognizes these benefits as readily . )
Keith Olbermann gave a one - hour Special Comment this evening , and if you ’re not moved to tears , especially by the last five minutes , then you are not aware of the current state of American humanity — or lack thereof .
Like Keith , I do n’t understand why it ’s okay to let someone suffer with sickness and pain , and die a needless or early death , simply because they do not have money .
Is this what the Founding Fathers had in mind when we finally broke from England with the Declaration of Independence ?
That we would be freed from the tyranny of the Crown , only to subjugate ourselves to the tyranny of Corporate Health Care and BigPharma ?
I ’m going to take a huge chance here , and say NO .
Part 1
Part 2
Part 3
Keith began with , “ I do not want to yell … ”
I understand where he ’s coming from , since there have been plenty of screamers these last few months .
But frankly , I do n’t mind yelling out TRUTH , INDIGNATION and COMPASSION for the sake of my fellow man — even if my fellow man would not do the same for me .
That ’s why it ’s called compassion .

Boise State beat Oregon 19 - 8 last night , and it was nowhere near that close .
Right after the game , Oregon running back LaGarrette Blount went on a rampage that started with a solid pop to the jaw for Boise State defensive end Byron Hout :
Yeah , is n’t this just what you want to see ?
Now before it gets buried in the chorus of all of the nasty things that should happen to Blount ( and I ’m not saying nothing should ; just trying to keep perspective here ) , let ’s note that Hout was n’t the victim of a drive - by here .
He clearly claps Blount on the shoulder and says something , and I ’m sure from the look on his face ( and his coach trying to get him away , pre-punch ) , that it was n’t “ good game . ”
Bob Davie , just after hyperventilating out of one side of his mouth about the symbolic handshake to start the game , then inexplicably defends
Hout ’s taunt by saying it was a response to an earlier ( off - field ) taunt Blount made .
Well , fine .
But trash - talking in the press is n’t trash - talking on the field to a just - downed opponent .
A punch in the face was obviously the wrong response to it , but there ’s little doubt to me that Hout was being a jackass .
LaGarrette Blount deserves suspension , and I ’m sure he ’ll receive it .
But if I ’m Byron Hout ’s coach , he receives some extra work next practice , along with a few choice words about what it means to win with class .

During California 's rainy season , many Bay Area mushroom lovers head to Mendocino County to collect wild mushrooms sprouting from the forest floor .
Mycologist David Arora used to do the same , but now all he has to do is step out his front door .
After living in Santa Cruz for decades , Arora , author of the popular field guides " Mushrooms Demystified " and " All That the Rain Promises , and More ... , " has moved to a ridge outside Gualala , above the southern Mendocino County coast .
He bought his 2,800 - square - foot house five years ago , but he did n't move in for two years .
The house was built in the 1920s , but rebuilt after it was damaged by fire in the '50s .
After Arora bought the home , he used a photograph of the house from the 1940s to restore some of its original features , such as a gable and a picture window in the great room .
The large window overlooks a meadow that rolls into a pine forest .
Beyond the forest sparkles the Pacific Ocean .
On the sloped roof above the windows is a hybrid solar array designed and installed by Larry Majorana , a retired NASA engineer .
Half of the output from the 8 - kilowatt system is fed into the grid and half is stored in batteries for use during the frequent utility outages .
The house is still a work in progress - he has the help of local carpenters Tom Rodgers and Scott Wigton - but it feels like home to Arora .
" Home is where the hearths are , " he said , referring to the two stone hearths on which he roasts turkeys at Thanksgiving and grills wild mushrooms after forays .
The main house has five fireplaces , including the two hearths .
Arora is a citizen of the world , extremely knowledgeable about the natural world and various cultures .
His home feels like an international folk - art museum and natural history museum rolled into one .
His unusual collections are on display , and he encourages visitors - and there are many - to roam the house .
In addition to collecting dried mushrooms , which he stashes in secret hiding places throughout his house , he collects handmade scissors , signs from African barbershops , bags made from bottle tops and toys made of Coca - Cola cans .
He even collects chefs .
Brigid Weiler and Jill Milton have cooked for Arora 's Thanksgiving workshop for eight years , and Arora learned hearth cooking from William Rubel , author of " The Magic of Fire : Hearth Cooking : One Hundred Recipes for the Fireplace or Campfire . "
Birds ' nests , dried pods
At the house 's north end , near the front door , is a big , open room .
At one end is the kitchen ; at the other end is a round dining table and a few couches facing a hearth .
Arora recently installed a new hardwood floor at this end of the house , with rose - and tan - swirled wood milled from several giant chinquapin trees that died on his property .
Hanging from the rafters of the high , open ceiling of redwood logs are oblong birds ' nests and 4 - foot - long dried pods from Thailand .
African baskets used for mushroom collecting hang above the front door , and Chinese paper beads strung in the doorways add color and texture to the room .
When Arora bought the house , the bathroom was in the center , but he moved it to the west wall .
For privacy ( and to let others know that the toilet is occupied ) , guests pull a colorful curtain across a French door .
There 's a second glass door - with - curtain to the outside , but that curtain is optional , as there 's nothing in that direction but field and pine .
And here , he 's taken the idea of a glass brick wall a step further :
In addition to embedding glass bricks in the wall , he has embedded red , blue and yellow vases in a variety of shapes and sizes .
By day , the sunlight shines through the glass ; by night , the bathroom light throws colored light onto the dark grass outside .
The sink basin does n't have a drain and is interchangeable with two other bowls hanging on the wall .
After washing your hands , you pour the water into the toilet or simply toss it outside .
( This encourages water conservation . )
Mushroom stairs
Opposite the bathroom is what Arora calls the African store , which is filled with more collections : handmade soldered oil lamps , black leather sandals , stoves and cooking utensils handmade from recycled metal parts .
A large mushroom sculpture takes up one corner of the room and reaches to the ceiling .
At first it is n't obvious that the large , solid , flat - topped mushrooms are stairs that lead to a loft , where a cozy bed is walled in by a rainbow of scarves .
In the middle of the house is the great room , where guests gather for dinner .
Arora redesigned the room by raising the ceiling , adding barked redwood beams and installing a huge picture window worthy of the stupendous sunsets .
A yard - wide artist 's conk ( a type of shelf fungus ) , intricately carved with an idyllic mountain scene , serves as a centerpiece .
Arora explains in " All That the Rain Promises " that this type of conk has a white underside that stains brown when scratched .
In front of the stone hearth is an old cobbler 's bench that 's used as a cook 's table for grilling the wild matsutakes , shrimp russulas or boletes found on his property .
On the rough - hewn long table near the window , during a reporter 's recent visit , were tossed napkins and colorful rolling pins used to make the Indian bread chapati .
( Each guest gets a rolling pin and clanks it against everyone else 's before making a toast . )
After dinner , Arora and his friends might spin an antique bingo wheel modified with a Mexican Loteria game or go to the boar 's head , an outbuilding without electricity , and play mah - jongg by oil lamp .
" It only cost $ 100 to fix up that room , " Arora said of the boar 's head .
" It shows that you do n't have to spend a lot of money to create a popular space . "
When Arora bought the house , the back of it butted up against a hillside .
Arora terraced the hill and planted lush gardens on the east and south sides of the home .
He also installed a series of ponds and small waterfalls .
The entire east wall of the great room opens to a koi pond enclosed by a terrarium .
Arora spends most of his time in the south end of the house , where there is an electric heater , small kitchen , dining nook , bedroom , office - and tea collection .
In keeping with Arora 's extraordinary collections , this is not your ordinary tea :
He collects pu-erh tea , a large - leafed tea pressed into round cakes , which grow more valuable as they age .
He artfully displays the round cakes in their decorative packaging on shelves .
Arora buys the tea during his frequent visits to Yunnan , China , the world 's largest exporter of wild mushrooms .
Annual mushroom hunt
Arora leads an annual Thanksgiving - weekend mushroom foray in nearby Albion and impromptu forays at his house .
Going on a foray with him is like going with a walking , talking mushroom encyclopedia .
He started collecting mushrooms as a kid in Pasadena , when he kept his head down on rainy days to keep water off his glasses .
In high school he started the Fungus Federation , a club whose members tied skillets to their belts , clanked down the halls and cooked wild mushrooms on Bunsen burners after school .
Although Arora encourages visitors to roam his house , the man himself remains a mystery .
When asked if he was born in Pasadena , he said : no , India .
When pressed for details of how that came about , he replied without the slight stammer that sometimes accompanies his words , " Because my mother was there . "
You could say his house is like a mushroom .
Mushrooms fruit out of a fungal mat that grows below the surface and lives symbiotically with the flora of the forest .
Just as a mushroom does n't reveal everything about the fungi from which it fruits , a house does n't reveal everything about its occupant .
Arora and his stories are as subterranean as the mycorrhiza web from which a mushroom fruits .
Le porte - parole du PS , Benoît Hamon , a qualifié aujourd ' hui de " choquant " le livre publié en 2005 par Frédéric Mitterrand qui raconte des épisodes de tourisme sexuel , dénonçant un " ministre consommateur " .
" Je trouve choquant qu'un homme puisse justifier , à l'abri d'un récit littéraire , le tourisme sexuel " , a déclaré M. Hamon , interrogé par l'AFP , à propos de cet ouvrage , " La mauvaise vie " , dans lequel M. Mitterrand confesse son penchant pour les " jeunes garçons " durant ses voyages .
" Au moment où la France s'est engagée avec la Thaïlande pour lutter contre ce fléau qu'est le tourisme sexuel , voilà un ministre du gouvernement qui explique qu'il est lui-même consommateur " , s'indigne M. Hamon , qui refuse qu'on puisse " tout relativiser , même ce qui est incontestablement choquant " .
Le porte - parole du PS dénonce également le soutien apporté par le ministre au cinéaste franco - polonais Roman Polanski , arrêté le 26 septembre en Suisse , sur mandat américain , pour une affaire d'abus sexuels sur mineure remontant à plus de 30 ans .
" M. Mitterrand , qui n'a démontré pour l'instant aucune qualité comme ministre de la Culture , s'est illustré sur un terrain qui n'est ni à l'honneur du gouvernement , ni au sien " , affirme le responsable socialiste .
Interrogé sur la pétition lancée par le Front national ( FN ) pour exiger la démission du ministre , M. Hamon a déploré que cette affaire " donne des arguments " au parti de Jean - Marie Le Pen .
" Cela fait le lit du Front national .
On lui donne des arguments qu'il exploite à sa manière habituelle , avec surenchère " .
Mais , a -t - il souligné , " l'affaire existe " .
" Le FN , je sais ce que vaut ce parti , mais comme porte - parole du PS , je suis choqué par les propos du ministre , violemment choqué " , a - t - il conclu .
Posted in | at 3:33 AM
Alan Johnson , the Home Secretary , said recently that he did not lie awake at night worrying that the population of the United Kingdom might rise to around 70 million , probably in his own lifetime .
When Mr Johnson was born , in 1950 , there were 50 million people in this country .
Today , there are 61 million .
Taken alone , England is the fifth most densely populated large country in the world – behind Bangladesh and South Korea and well ahead of Japan or China .
So , at what projected population would the Johnsonian slumbers be interrupted : 80 million , maybe ? 90 million ?
Or does Mr Johnson calculate that by the time it reaches 100 million he will not be around to worry about the consequences , so why should he care ?
The latest population estimates from the Office for National Statistics confirm that we are seeing the fastest growth in population since the post - war baby boom .
In the 1950s and 1960s , however , a high birth rate was considered something to be encouraged because a rising population meant more people would be available to work , and a bigger economy meant greater wealth .
And so it has proved .
Indeed , it has always been the case that in order to have economic growth it is necessary to have more people .
Countries whose populations stagnate and decline are countries with no future .
But this was not always considered a truism ; and there must come a point where it is a falsehood .
It is a question of knowing when the population becomes too high and what to do about it .
In the 18th century , Thomas Malthus imagined that a population of about 10 million was unsustainable .
His 1798 essay
On the Principle of Population predicted war , pestilence and starvation as a result of overcrowding .
Yet at the time , Britain was on the cusp of an agrarian and industrial revolution that would provide both a motor for rapid population growth and the means to feed the extra people .
Between 1800 and 1850 , the population of Britain doubled .
In the 1960s , the population doomsayers were at it again .
Paul Ehrlich 's book The Population Bomb predicted that by the following decade , millions would have starved to death , as our natural resources and food ran out .
Ehrlich was right : the world 's population has indeed exploded , up by more than 60 per cent over the past three decades .
But he grossly underestimated the capacity of the world to cope , thanks to the discovery of new energy reserves and spectacular improvements in agricultural productivity – the so - called Green Revolution .
Today , the world 's population is 7 billion and is growing by 78 million a year .
Yet the world 's resources have still not run out : recent famines have been caused largely by war ; malnutrition has declined ; and fewer people starved to death in the final quarter of the 20th century than in the last 20 years of the 19th .
A bigger population is an engine of economic growth ; yet greater prosperity tends to lead to a fall in the birth rate , as is the case in Europe , where it is below replacement levels in most countries and falling .
This is a big worry for countries such as Italy and France – and for Germany , now Europe 's most populous nation but , according to UN estimates , on course to be overtaken by the UKby 2050 .
This is the most startling aspect of the population projections : not that the number of people might reach 69 million , or 72 million – but that it is going up at all .
Until relatively recently , it was predicted that the UK population would stabilise at under 60 million ; indeed , the planning of governments since the 1970s has all been predicated upon a static population .
Infrastructure , the capacity of schools and hospitals – all the utilities needed to make a modern , prosperous country work have to be planned well in advance .
That is one reason why we have statisticians and actuaries trying to predict the future .
And that is why Alan Johnson should be lying awake at night – because none of this was anticipated .
There are two reasons why the population is growing .
One is that we are living longer , so there are more older people than ever before .
Child mortality rates are historically low , which means parents have small families , which they did not when the chances of losing offspring to disease were high .
But the principal driver of population growth is immigration , directly through the numbers arriving every year and indirectly through the higher birth - rate among first - and second generation foreign - born mothers .
This is what makes population growth in Britain today so different .
Once , it was fuelled by a high birth rate that saw a rapid rise in the indigenous population ; now it is changing the nature of the nation itself , making it far more diverse ethnically and culturally .
Some people are happy with that ; others are not .
But there is no use pretending it is not happening .
The most likely forecast based on current trends is that the population will grow to 71 million in 2031 and to 85 million in 2081 , but if birth rates rise more quickly than expected , immigration remains high and people live longer , this figure could be 108 million .
But do we have any choice if we want to remain a viable and economically strong nation ?
Big economies have big populations – look at America , a nation founded entirely on immigration , where there are now more than 300 million people .
Over the next 25 years , the population of the UK aged 65 and over will rise by 63 per cent to 15.8 million .
We will need more young people in work to sustain an increasingly elderly nation .
Is immigration the answer ?
After all , immigrants themselves grow old and become pensioners .
Also , their own fertility patterns start to match those of the country they settle in .
And while their children are growing up they , too , are a burden on schools and hospitals .
There are now 61 dependants for every 100 people of working age .
By 2031 , taking into account the impact of immigration , there will be 64 .
So the dependency ratio , as it is called , is worsening , even with record immigration .
The impact of population growth is felt especially severely in London and the South East .
We are such a top - heavy nation that migration , both internally and from overseas , tends towards the capital and its environs .
But it has always been thus .
People battling to work on crowded buses and trains every morning may find it hard to believe , but London 's population is lower than it once was .
It peaked at around 8.6 million in 1939 before beginning a steady decline as people moved into the suburbs and beyond .
By 1990 , it was down to around 6.5 million .
Immigration , though , is pushing it back up .
We were clearly not prepared for this , either logistically nor culturally .
If the Labour Party was intent upon an immigration - fuelled population boom , it was not something it put to the nation in 1997 .
Ministers now seek to make a virtue out of something that was simply never planned for and that lax immigration policy allowed to happen , deliberately or not .
What will the impact be on the quality of life in Britain of an additional 10 million people in just 20 or so years ?
In the past , such rapid growth has resulted in long - term prosperity , though it has often been accompanied by short - term privation as in the city slums of Victorian England .
Roger Martin , chairman of the campaign group the Optimum Population Trust , does not think the country can sustain such growth any longer .
" Britain 's population increase is out of control and we are on course for a high - density , low - quality future where overcrowding and congestion are the norm and resource shortages , particularly of vital commodities like water and energy , are ever more pressing .
" Every addition to the population pushes this country further from sustainability and nearer to a position of extreme environmental precariousness .
This is a future nobody wants .
" But it is a future that we are going to get without a fundamental rethink in government policy .
Far from enjoying a good night 's sleep , Mr Johnson should be having nightmares .
More evidence of our great American divide arrived last Friday in the form of some focus group studies undertaken by Stan Greenberg ( Bill Clinton 's pollster in 1992 ) and James Carville .
They oversaw conversations with a group of hard - shell conservatives in Georgia .
The fascinating results explain a lot about my country 's political tensions and shed light on the question of what makes contemporary American conservatism – well , unique , let 's call it .
They found that conservatives " stand a world apart from the rest of America " in terms of how they view Barack Obama and how they see politics .
There is a continuum , in other words , in US politics , running from those on the left who 've already concluded that Obama is a sellout , to mainstream liberals who are basically happy with him , to moderates who are approving but with reservations , to centre - right folks who are unconvinced but pulling for him to succeed , for the country 's sake if nothing else .
Then there are committed conservatives .
They 're off the continuum , in three basic ways .
First , they fundamentally question his legitimacy as president .
Second , they believe that a successful Obama presidency would destroy the country and are " committed to seeing the president fail " .
And third , they think he is " ruthlessly advancing a ' secret agenda ' to bankrupt the US and dramatically expand government control to an extent nothing short of socialism " .
Big deal , conservatives will say to liberals .
You people loathed George Bush .
What 's the difference ?
It 's a fair question .
But I think there is a difference .
It does n't repose in the character of either set of partisans – that is , I 'm not saying liberals are better or fairer - minded than conservatives are .
Rather , the difference has to do , I think , with the different ways liberals and conservatives define their relationship to their country .
On the first point , liberals questioned Bush 's legitimacy , too .
There is little doubt of that .
Of course , there were solid empirical bases on which to do so .
His campaign stopped the vote recount in Florida , and the supreme court , not the voters , put him in the White House .
Around Obama 's victory there were no such vexations .
And the questions that do exist about Obama 's legitimacy – his citizenship and religious affiliation – are fantastical fabrications .
Be that as it may , let 's be generous and acknowledge simply that legitimacy issues have been raised on both sides .
It is also true many on the liberal - left wanted to see Bush fail .
We wanted him to fail at a lot of things .
To some degree that 's just politics .
Matters get trickier when one discusses Bush 's wars , because that raises questions about whether wanting to see him fail crossed the line into wanting to see America lose a war , however illegitimate that war might have been in liberal eyes .
Most Bush opponents tried not to cross that line , but I can't say it was never crossed .
So let 's be gracious and call this one a wash too .
The third point is where the difference enters the picture .
As much as liberals despised Bush , people never thought ( except maybe on the fringes ) that he was secretly out to destroy the US .
We felt some of his administration 's principles were n't American as we understood the concept ( the arrogation of executive power , or the approval of torture ) .
But there was none of this Manchurian Candidate business .
Liberals assumed that Bush was doing what he , his team and their supporters believed was the right thing based on their understanding of American values and needs .
Conservatives do not believe this about Obama .
Clearly some of this has to do with his background .
Greenberg and Carville stress that race was not a factor in their all - white Georgia focus group , and while I would agree that conservatives ' problems with Obama are far more ideological than racial , I have to believe that race is a subliminal factor of some sort .
But it also has a lot to do with history .
One often hears conservatives speak of how Obama is destroying " my country " .
They use the " my " because conservatives tend to feel a type of ownership regarding the country that liberals do n't .
They are certain that they represent " real " American values , and that liberals represent alien values .
There 's a long history here , which is bound up in everything from the two sides ' different definitions of patriotism – " my country right or wrong " versus " I want to improve my country because I love it " – to religion to militarism to cosmopolitanism to a thousand other things .
Every American presidential campaign , on some level , is about the Republican trying to frighten people into believing that the Democrat does n't share " your values " and the Democrat trying to reassure people that he does .
So , for conservatives , Obama is not just a guy whose views they vehemently disagree with .
He 's an ideological Typhoid Mary , a carrier of unknowable and barely comprehensible infections .
That is qualitatively different from liberal hatred of Bush .
It is also , to be blunt , paranoid – because it 's rooted in metaphorical narrative far more than in fact .
And that means facts can never win an argument .
Obama could leave office in January 2017 with the capitalist economy roaring and American power and security enhanced and these voters would still believe we 'd escaped state ownership of everything and one - world government by a whisker .
It 's been part of the psychology of the American right for decades , and it sure wo n't be dissipating as long as Obama is in office .
( CNN ) --
For more than two hours on a dark Saturday night , as many as 20 people watched or took part as a 15 - year - old California girl was allegedly gang raped and beaten outside a high school homecoming dance , authorities said .
As hundreds of students gathered in the school gym , outside in a dimly lit alley where the victim was allegedly raped , police say witnesses took photos .
Others laughed .
" As people announced over time that this was going on , more people came to see , and some actually participated , " Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond Police Department told CNN .
The witnesses failed to report the crime to law enforcement , Gagan said .
The victim remained hospitalized in stable condition .
Police arrested five suspects and more arrests were expected .
So why did n't anyone come forward ?
Criminology and psychology experts say there could be a variety of reasons why the crime was n't reported .
Several pointed to a problematic social phenomenon known as the bystander effect .
It 's a theory that has played out in lynchings , college riots and white - collar crimes .
Under the bystander effect , experts say that the larger the number of people involved in a situation , the less will get done .
" If you are in a crowd and you look and see that everyone is doing nothing , then doing nothing becomes the norm . " explains Drew Carberry , a director at the National Council on Crime Prevention .
Carberry said witnesses can be less likely to report a crime because they reinforce each other with the notion that reporting the crime is n't necessary .
Or , he says , witnesses may think another person in the crowd already reported the incident .
The responsibility among the group becomes diffused .
" Kids learn at a young age when they observe bullying that they would rather not get involved because there is a power structure , " Carberry adds .
The phrase bystander effect was coined in the 1960s after people watched or heard a serial killer stalk and stab a woman in two separate attacks in the Queens neighborhood of New York .
Kitty Genovese struggled with the attacker on the street and in her building .
She shrieked for help and was raped , robbed and murdered .
When witnesses in the building were questioned by police about why they remained silent and failed to act , one man , according to the 1964 New York Times article that broke the story , answered , " I did n't want to be involved . "
Though the number of people who saw or heard Genovese struggle was eventually disputed , her case still became symbolic of a kind of crowd apathy that psychologists and social scientists call the " Genovese syndrome . "
" I do n't propose people get involved by running over and trying to stop it , " the 73 - year - old brother of Kitty Genovese told CNN , referring to the California gang rape case .
Instead , Vincent Genovese advocates a call to 911 .
" Everyone has a cell phone , " he said .
" There is no excuse for people not to react to a situation like that . "
A similar incident took place at a New Bedford , Massachusetts , bar in 1983 .
Witnesses said several men threw a woman on a pool table where they raped and performed oral sex on her .
Several witnesses failed to call police .
" The people in the bar did n't do anything .
They just let it happen , " said Richard Felson , a professor of crime , law and justice at Penn State University in University Park , Pennsylvania .
This detached mentality can be especially pervasive among youth , who are too young to comprehend what victimization means , said Salvatore Didato , an organizational psychologist in New York .
When a teenager -- or anyone -- does n't have a personal bond to the victim , they are less likely to help out .
Experts say sometimes bystanders see the victim as less important than the person committing the crime , who appears to wield power .
" The victim to them is a non-person , " Didato said .
But in California , it 's illegal for a witnessed crime involving children to go unreported .
The Sherrice Iverson Child Victim Protection
Act passed in 1999 makes it a misdemeanor to fail to report a crime against a child .
However , the bill only applies to victims 14 or younger .
The victim in the California gang - rape case was 15 .
Phil Harris , a criminal justice professor at Temple University , who has studied juveniles and group situations for nearly three decades , offered another hypothesis on why as many as 20 witnesses failed to notify police .
He said the witnesses could have been angry themselves -- or had a problem with the victim .
Richmond Police Department officials said some of the witnesses in the California gang rape ended up participating in the sexual assaults .
" A lot of kids do n't know how to express anger and they are curious when anger is expressed , " Harris said .
Scientific studies over the last decade have shown that adolescent brain development occurs into the 20s , which makes it hard for teens to make decisions , criminologists say .
In 2005 , the U.S. Supreme Court took this research into consideration when it ruled that children could not be given the death penalty .
It is still unclear the ages of the male witnesses who gathered around the victim in California and watched .
In Boston , Massachusetts , Northeastern University criminologist Jack McDevitt says he believes the California gang rape was too violent -- and lasted too long -- to be the result of the bystander effect alone .
McDevitt , who specializes in hate crime research , says the male witnesses may have kept quiet out of fear of retaliation .
In his research , witnesses who live in violent communities often fear stepping forward because snitching is n't tolerated .
Snitching could also bring dangerous consequences to their friends and family .
" They do n't believe the system will protect them from the offender , " he said .
" They think the offender will find out their name . "
That may have been the case in Chicago , Illinois , in September when an honor student was beaten to death by four teenage boys outside a school .
Video captured by a bystander showed several students watching the attack , but police have found many of the witnesses tight - lipped in the South side community where violence has been prevalent .
Police have charged three suspects with murder .
While information from the Richmond Police Department in the coming weeks may reveal more about the bystanders and attackers , crime experts say one thing is clear :
Third parties can affect the outcome of a crime .
Witnesses have the power to deter violence -- or stop a crime from going on , experts say .
Bystanders could have prevented the gang rape from lasting more than two hours , if they had reported the crime to authorities sooner .
The victim was found under a bench , semi-conscious .
" This just gets worse and worse the more you dig into it , " Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond Police Department .
" It was like a horror movie .
I can't believe not one person felt compelled to help her . "
Nick Valencia contributed to this report .
Statistically , he was vulnerable .
Boomers 45 to 64 have the highest suicide rate of all age groups , according to 2006 figures , the latest available , from the National Center for Health Statistics .
Dr. Myrna Weissman , a Columbia psychiatry professor and member of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , said that starting about 20 years ago researchers noticed a higher rate of depression in boomers than the previous generation at that age .
They attributed the increase to a number of stresses : more divorces , more - transient lifestyles , more drug use .
“ We expected to see this generation ’s suicide rate increase , since people are more likely to kill themselves as they age , ” Dr. Weissman said .
The economy is an A - 1 stressor .
According to the federal Suicide Prevention Resource Center Web site , “ widespread increases in unemployment ” are “ strongly linked with increases in suicide rates . ”
Men are most affected .
While women attempt suicide three times as often as men , men “ succeed ” four times more often .
In 2006 , 33,308 Americans committed suicide , 26,308 of them men .
Scott Schnipper , who lives in Brooklyn , last saw his brother in February .
He suggested an outing to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and brought along his son Adam , 4 , to cheer up Uncle Steven .
A mistake .
“ I was pulled between trying to care for Steven and trying to shield Adam from his distraught uncle , ” Scott said .
He tried to tell his brother he had options .
He could sell the condo at a profit , move to a less - expensive area .
Several friends and family members  Mr. Mancini ( Charlotte , N.C. ) ; a cousin , Jody Doman on the Upper East Side ; Steven ’s twin , Marc , in Madison , Wis. ; their father in Glendale , Calif .
 had offered spare rooms and even a garage apartment .
Two friends gave him part - time bookkeeping work when they had it ; one put Steven on his employee health insurance .

Through the years he had partners , and though that was not so recently , he was hardly alone .
“ A lot of people cared about Steven , ” Scott said .
He was famous for never forgetting to send a birthday card .
Loving beautiful things , he made elaborate gift lists that he ’d review endlessly with his friend Ms. Williams .
CABANATUAN CITY , Philippines ( CNN ) -- Typhoon Parma crossed the northern tip of the already storm - battered Philippines Saturday afternoon and early Sunday , killing three people , according to local media .
A NASA satellite image shows Typhoon Parma as it headed toward the Philippines on Friday .
Parma made landfall Saturday afternoon in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon , the largest of the Philippine islands .
Tens of thousands of people to fled their homes for safer shelter .
Winds whipped the coastline and felled power lines in northernmost Cagayan Province .
Debris littered the roads , making evacuations even more difficult .
At 5 a.m. Sunday ( 5 p.m. Saturday ET ) , Parma , known locally as Typhoon Pepeng , had maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour ( 75 mph ) with gusts as high as 148 kilometers ( 92 mph ) as the eye began to leave land , heading to the northeast , according to the U.S. Navy 's Joint Typhoon Warning Center .
Parma avoided a direct hit on heavily populated Manila , but the real menace in the Philippines capital was not wind .
It was water , and there was no escape from it .
Parma was expected to dump as much as 8 to 20 inches of rain in areas still water - logged from last week 's Typhoon Ketsana .
That storm resulted in the heaviest rainfall in 40 years and at one point , 80 percent of Manila was submerged .
Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro appealed to Filipinos to remain in shelters even if they were in cities and towns not directly in Parma 's path .
He said he was worried about massive flooding and possible mudslides in mountainous regions .
The government deployed 10,000 troops to help with rescue and relief operations as frightened Filipinos prepared for the worst .
World Vision , the Christian humanitarian organization , was planning to launch relief operations Saturday evening in Isabela Province , one of the areas slammed by Parma .
The group also plans assistance for nearby Cagayan province , whose capital , Tuguegarao , is being hit hard by Parma 's strong winds .
Arturo Fidelino , a telecommunications executive in Manila , described panicked people rushing to stock up on essential goods -- drinking water , canned food and electrical supplies .
" We had a traumatic experience when we had Ketsana , " he said .
" We do n't want that to happen again . "

Indian economic analyst
The World Bank says developing economies may drive global recovery Can the lumbering elephant overtake the hyperactive dragon ?
What appeared unthinkable for decades , if not for more than half a century , may actually happen soon , perhaps as early as next year .
In 2010 , the Indian economy may grow faster than that of China .
What is more , experts contend that South Asia could expand at a more rapid pace than East Asia .
While there is no dearth of sceptics who believe that China will continue to grow faster than any other major economy on the globe in the foreseeable future , there are others who contend that the trend growth rates of the two most populous nations could change and that India could march ahead of the Chinese economy just a little faster than many predict .
The economy of India started accelerating from the early 1990s onwards as Delhi loosened bureaucratic controls over industry , trade and services
China and India , accounting for roughly 40 % of the 6.5 bn plus people on Planet Earth , are not merely the two fastest growing major economies in the world at present , but are among the few countries that have continued to expand at a time when the economies of most countries have contracted .
In the early 1950s , in terms of per capita income and levels of economic development , there was little to distinguish between China and India .
Half the populations of both countries were mired in abject poverty - in India 's case after centuries of colonial rule .
From the 1970s , the Chinese economy started growing at a fast rate while India 's economy grew sluggishly at an average rate of 3.5 % - sarcastically described by the late economics professor Raj Krishna as the " Hindu rate of growth " .
The World Bank predicts India will grow by 8 % in 2010 As China grew by double - digits decade after decade for nearly 40 years , economists kept claiming the bubble would burst , that data was doctored by smart statisticians in Beijing - but the metaphorical dragon continued to grow bigger and bigger defying all expectations .
The economy of India , on the other hand , started accelerating from the early 1990s onwards as Delhi loosened bureaucratic controls over industry , trade and services .
In the middle of the 1990s , for the first time since India became independent in August 1947 , the country 's economy expanded by an annual average of more than 9 % four years in succession , that is until the impact of the ongoing international recession saw the Indian economy decelerate .
Economists argue that one reason why India 's economy can grow faster than that of China in the near future is simply on account of what statisticians describe as a " base effect " .
Following this argument , India 's growth rate is higher because the base on which the rate is calculated is narrower .
China 's economy is roughly three and a half times bigger than that of India - Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) measured in US dollars in 2008 for the two countries stood at $ 4.2 trillion and $ 1.2 trillion respectively .
But there is an important reason why India 's economy has been hurt relatively less by the ongoing international economic recession in comparison to China , whose growth has been largely export - driven in recent decades .
Exports and imports put together ( including " invisible " earnings from tourists , workers ' remittances and exports of services ) account for approximately half of India 's GDP whereas the comparable proportion for China is over 80 % .
Forecasts revised
Two years ago , China overtook the US as India 's largest trading partner .
In late June , the World Bank in its Global Development Finance 2009 report projected that in 2010 , the rate of growth of India 's economy at 8 % would be faster than that of China , expected to be 7.7 % .
The bank 's forecast for the current year was revised upwards for both China ( from 6.5 % to 7.2 % ) and India ( from 4 % to 5.1 % ) but these prognostications are lower than those made by the governments of the respective countries .
The Chinese government claims a rate of growth close to 8 % for 2009 , while various agencies of the Indian government would place the comparable figure at somewhere between 6.5 % and 7 % .
East Asia is predicted to grow at a slower rate than South Asia
The bank report pointed out that the growth rate of all developing countries taken together had come down from 8.1 % in 2007 to 5.9 % in 2008 and is expected to be only 1.2 % this calendar year .
" When China and India are excluded , GDP ( gross domestic product ) in the remaining developing countries is expected to fall by 1.6 % , causing continued job losses and throwing more people into poverty , " the World Bank report stated .
Justin Lin , the bank 's chief economist , was quoted as saying that developing countries could " become a key driving force " in reviving the world 's economy , " assuming their domestic investments rebound with international support , including a resumption in the flow of international credit " .
Mr Lin is not alone .
Speaking at a recent seminar in Delhi , Ajay Chibber , Assistant Secretary General of the UN's Development Programme , said it would have unthinkable until recently that India could grow faster than China .
" I never thought I would see it during my lifetime but South Asia could grow faster than East Asia , " he remarked .
Kalpana Kochhar , deputy director of the Asia Pacific department of the International Monetary Fund , told me that it was no longer improbable that India could grow faster than China or that South Asia would expand at a faster pace than East and South - East Asia .
" I see these as distinct possibilities , " she said .

Jonathan Escobar , 16 of Georgia 's North Cobb High School in Kennesaw has been kicked out due to the fact that he wears female attire .
Jonathan maintains the school originally had no problem with the fact that he cross dresses but only told him to stop after a student harassed him .
The school then said he was in violation of their dress code and that the outfits were " causing a disruption and that he needs to dress more manly " if he wants to continue attending the school .
Jonathan has dropped out and said this policy is n't fair , and that he wants to graduate but not at the expense of " sharing his art and expressing who he is "
Fellow students meanwhile have joined a facebook group in support of Jonathan and plan on wearing bright pink t shirts that say " Support Jonathan " to show solidarity .
Please contact schools administrators and tell them to apologize , create a policy for the safety and inclusion of gender variant students , and to allow Jonathan Escobar back into the school .

Border Barrier Blues :
Mexican footpaths on the Arizona side of the fence
Last week , the Government Accountability Office released a depressing audit of the US - Mexico border fence we ’ve been trying to put up for the past three years .
The report caused about 8 hours of pretend outrage and was promptly forgotten .
It found that we ’d already shoveled $ 2.4 billion to half - seal 600 miles of the border since 2005 ( we still have about 100 to 200 miles to go ) and we would need to spend an additional $ 6.5 billion over the next 20 years just plugging up holes punched in the fencing .
The Christian Science Monitor :
So far , it has been breached 3,363 times , requiring $ 1,300 for the average repair .
. . .
Despite the price tag of maintaining the border fence , authorities have not found a way to determine whether it is helping to halt illegal immigration , the GAO report says .
The only semi-relevant stats we got are the number of illegal border border - crossers being caught by the US Border Patrol , which has dropped by 25 percent in recent times .
But that does n’t tell us much .
“ No one knows whether the decrease in crossers is due to the recession keeping people home , the thousands of new border patrol agents or the more than 600 miles of new border fence that has been built , ” says NPR .
There is one thing we can be sure of : the massive steel pylons have been a boon for Mexican scrap metal entrepreneurs , who are able to supplement their incomes by dragging off whole sections of the fence right under the nose of our beefed up Border Patrol .
Bush ’s Secure Fence
Act of 2006 mandated that the Department of Homeland Security had 1.5 years to create a physical border fence bolstered by surveillance technology .
But it was obvious from the very beginning that Bush ’s push for a border fence was nothing more than a political show — there was not enough time and not enough money — to boost Bush ’s and Republican ’s creds with their base .
Besides , the real Republican base–Bush ’s corporate sponsors , “ the haves and the have mores ” –were the ones who benefited most from all that cheap illegal - immigrant labor , so naturally it was bound to be a half - assed effort intended to quell the Tea Party suckers who believe the Republicans .
The building contractors were the only ones who stood to gain from the massive , wasteful show of Republican fake - patriotism .
A show that ’s still costing us billions .
I was down on the Arizona - Mexico border about six months ago doing a story on a McGyver - style vigilante group called the American Border Patrol and the total clusterfuck that is our border fence up close and personal .
One day I was ATVing along a freshly built stretch of the fence on the Arizona border , when I ran into a bored , young US Border Patrol agent .
He seemed skeptical about the wall doing much good .
The wall would n’t make much of a difference , he told me .
“ They ” always figure out a way to get through — or over , in this case .
Burros carrying bales of drugs on their back simply throw a rope up over the two - storey barrier , snagging it with some sort of hook on one of the fence ’s steel beams and scuttle up and over .
The amazing thing is that they ’ve managed to get cars over it , too .
According to the agent , Mexican smugglers rig trucks with collapsible ramps similar to those used at old - school airports for boarding planes .
They would have two trucks drive up to the fence — one on each side of the border — line them up and have their hombres drive right over .
Apparently , a whole caravan of cars and pickup trucks could cross that way in a matter of minutes .
When they were done , the ramps would be folded up and concealed , and the operator would drive peacefully home .
People who live on the border will tell you that the fence has reduced foot traffic from Mexico .
But in part that ’s because smuggling routes have been pushed into more isolated , less fenced and usually more deadly terrain .
So while border crossing apprehensions are down by a quarter , the number of deaths have remained the same .
Which means that the border patrol is increasingly turning into a Search , Rescue and Detain operation involving helicopters , medical supplies and hospital bills .
Guess who ’s paying for those ?
When I was down in Arizona , I got in touch with an old Vietnam vet who passed the time doing crazy Rambo shit : rigging a mountainous stretch of the Mexican border with motion - activated “ game cameras . ”
Since they put up the border fence across the open desert , he saw foot traffic go off the charts in the nearby mountains , which are not fenced .
His cameras captured group after group of people crossing in areas that were before rarely active , if at all .
Border Patrol ca n’t get to them there , and it ’s also not the safest place to be .
In one of his videos , there ’s a huge bear hobbling down a foot path that is frequently used by border - crossers .
One of these days , those two parties are bound to meet .
But the border fence is n’t a total , ineffectual waste of money just in the physical realm .
In 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security awarded Boeing with a contract to develop a “ virtual fence ” prototype along a 28 - mile stretch of the border in Arizona .
Dubbed SBInet — part of President Bush ’s “ Secure Border Initiative ” — it was meant to replace an outdated CCTV - style surveillance system currently in use by the US Borer Patrol and create a unified surveillance system that linked tower - mounted cameras , ground sensors , UAVs and radar .
The project started off with a budget of $ 20 million , but quickly ballooned to nearly $ 1 billion just two years later .
They had to start from scratch at least once , and there is still no working prototype in sight .
The Department of Homeland Security was going to scrap SBInet due to cost overruns , but recently decided to extend its contract with Boeing for another year .
So there you have it .
The Secure Fence Act of 2006 , thirty - six months later : Directive # 1 — ” border surveillance through more effective use of personnel and technology ” — is total fucking joke .
And Directive # 2 — ” physical infrastructure enhancements to prevent unlawful border entry ” — is so ineffectual and expensive it would probably be cheaper to demolish the whole thing and hand the rubble over to Mexican scrap metal brokers .

最近なぜか私のTLにはマニアックな若者が増えてきて、Smalltalk／Lispマシンの話とかすると妙に反応があったので、まとめ。
私 とSmalltalk-80との運命的な出会い（いやほんと人生が変わった）は、マイコン雑誌「I/O」のSmalltalk-80紹介記事でした。1985年ごろに当時プログラミング好き（Z80、Fortran、BASICとか）の高校生でMZ-2000のテキスト画面しか知らなかった私は、「マウス」なるもので操作するマルチウィンドウや、白地に黒いマルチフォントを描けるビットマップディスプレイ、WYSIWYGエディタ、カット＆ペースト等、いまのあらゆるGUIの原型（MacやWindowsの元ネタ）を見て、さらにその言語が「3+4て書くと3が+4てメッセージを解釈実行するんだよ」とかいう意味不明なパラダイムで、それ何て並行世界？オーパーツ？位の衝撃を受けました。そこから数年はXerox
PARC出身の鈴木則久先生の名著「 Smalltalk」を毎日手放さない少年となりました。もちろん自分ちのパソコンじゃSmalltalkなんて動かないので、Alto等のXeroxワークステーションに触れる日を夢見てました。
しかしホント偶然に、私が入った大学にたまたまFuji Xerox 1121AIWがあったのです。しかも先輩が卒論書く時期以外はほとんど使われてません。大学にはSun 3とかSony NEWS 等 のUNIXマシンもありましたが、そんなトランジスタ時代のOSには目もくれず4年間1121を使ってました。
（引用元 ：Alto、Star、Smalltalk 、Lisa、Mac、Win の関係をはっきりさせよう）
1121 はAltoの子孫にあたるマシンで、Smalltalk-80とInterlisp-Dが動作します。その凄さ|変態さは、sumimさんのすばらしいサイトですべて語られてるので、ちょこちょこ抜粋させていただきます。
XNSプロトコル、Ethernet、レーザープリンター、Interscript まず 、Web誕生前の80年代後半にTCP/IPじゃない独自プロトコルXNS（NetWare IPXの元ネタ）でグローバルなネットワークが構築されてた件。それもtelnetとかftpとか単純なものじゃなくて、現在のネットワークファイルシステムやActiveDirectoryのような洗練されたネットワークサービスが利用可能でした。私もDNSに相当するClearing Houseってやつのマニュアルとにらめっこしてました。
私は1988年から6年間、ユーザとして8080 J- Star II ( コードネー ムKiku ) などを使っていました。ドロワーをどんどん開いていくと、アメリカまで行ってしまったときの感動は今でも忘れられません。--abee
Interlisp-Dで作られたアプリケーションに複写機などのUI作成を支援するTrilliumというシステムがあるのですが、このデモを見せてもらったとき、たまたまローカルに関数が見つからず、勝手に海の向こうから取ってきたのを見て腰が抜けました。
ウチの大学は外につながってなかったけど、黄色く太い同軸ケーブル（これがXerox
PARC発明のオリジナルのEthernet。針のついたトランシーバをケーブルの途中にぶっ刺して接続する）でワークステーション間が結ばれてました。鈴木先生いわく、10Mbpsという速度は当時「肝をつぶすような広帯域」だったそうです。1121の横には8080というStarワークステーションと、同じくPARC発明のオーパーツ「レーザープリンター」がつながってて、これまたPARC謹製InterPress（AdobeのPostScriptの元ネタ）による超高品質印刷が可能。ドットプリンタ育ちの私は意味もなく自分のソースを印刷してその品質にほれぼれしてました。
ダイナミックマイクロプログラミング それと、ダイナミックマイクロプログラミングな件。つまりプロセッサ（16ビットで1MIPS位だったかな？）のファームウェアを使う言語に応じて入れ替えることで、SmalltalkやInterlisp-DのバイトコードをCPUが直接実行する仕組み。CPUそのものがVirtual Machineになるわけです。後のJavaチップ等の先祖で、これは当時のCISC界の先端技術でした（そんな複雑なことしてるからクロック速度上げられないのだけど）。
Dマシン最大の特徴は、 マイクロコードプログラミング可能なビットスライスプロセッサ
を採用していたことでしょう。 私たちが普段使っているPowerPCやPentiumなどのCPUはチップ自体に命令セットが組み込まれており、これを変更することはできません。これに対して、Dマシンは 起動時に命令セット自体をロード することが可能でした。 この機能を用いることにより、動作させるシステムに最適な命令セットを用いることが出来ます。DマシンではViewPoint以外にもInterlisp-D , Smalltalk , XDE ( Xerox Development Environment ; Mesa開発環境 ) などを動かすことが可能ですが、これらのシステムに応じて命令セットを切り替えて使っていました。Smalltalkになじみの深いバイトコードとは、このSmalltalk用命令セットのことに他なりません。
マイクロプログラムの選択は、ブート時のパチスロっぽいボタン操作で行います。
1121AIW ( や8080 ) のブートはものすごく変です。まず、メンテナンスパネルのカバーを開いて、リセットボタンとオルターネートボタンを同時に押し下げながら電源を投入します。続いてリセットボタンを離すと、4桁の7セグメントLEDがパラパラと変っていくので、適当なところでオルタネートボタンを離します。これでブート対象が切り替わる訳です。
0001でオルタネートを離すことを1番ブートと呼び(VPやXDEにも番号があります)、SystemStartupTool( ムービングロゴ)
が起動します。ここからさらに、LispSystemToolsでInterlisp-Dを起動するか、RunST80でSmalltalk-80を起動するかを選択します。
私が1121のディスクイメージをごにょごにょしてたら壊れてブートしなくなったことがあって、教授にすごく怒られて（1000万するんだから大切に使ってくれよ！）、東京から仙台まで富士ゼロックスのサポートの人が来て1日かけて再インストールしてくれたことがありました。冷や汗かきました。
Smalltalk - 80 ／Interlisp-Dは言語＋OS＋開発環境＋etcだよ
上記のような仕組みなので、例えばCで書かれたOSカーネルとか存在しません。OSカーネルは全部Smalltalk-80やInterlisp-Dそのもので記述されてます。ST80では、SemaphoreとかProcessorみたいなカーネルを構成するオブジェクトに始まり、基本ライブラリ（OrderedCollectionとか）、ファイルシステム、MVCによるGUI、ネットワーク、そしてIDEやバージョン管理まで、100 %
Pure Smalltalkで実装されてます。しかもEclipseっぽいIDE上で全部ソースを見れます。
（引用元 ：Smalltalk -80 ( スモールトーク・エイティ ) ） ま あST80のカーネルってたしかプリエンプティブじゃなくて、ちょうど今のFlash Playerみたいに 「譲り合いの精神でマルチタスク」だったわけですが（yieldってのをちょこちょこ書かないと固まる）、でもLinuxのない時代に目の前で動いてるOSカーネルのソースを見れる（しかも変更できたりする）のは嬉しかった。
ST80の開発環境「 System Browser」は今のEclipseに近くて（ていうかEclipseの元ネタ）、もちろんシェルなんて無骨なものはなくて、エディタ上のソースをメニューからsaveすると勝手にコンパイルされます。スペルミスがあったりするとポップアップが出て、「CollectinをCollectionに直していい？」とか聞かれるのでOKすると勝手に直してコンパイルを続けてくれます。DWIM（Do
What I Mean）ていう設計思想です。このあたりのすばらしさは、進藤達也さんのSmalltalk-80(スモールトーク・エイティ ) でも熱く語られています。 余談ですが 、Eclipseの前身である「 IBM VisualAge for Java」の中身はSmalltalkで書かれてたってIBMの人に教えられてびっくりしたことがあります（だから重かった）。IBMは扱うプラットフォームが多すぎるので、90年代にはツールやアプリケーションをSmalltalk VMで共通化しようとしてたようです。

When the deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive fell through , there were likely a lot of surprised people at General Motors ' Detroit , MI headquarters .
Penske released a statement saying that the reason the deal fell through after months of good faith negotiations was that a suitable post - GM supply of vehicles could not be found .
However , after reacquainting ourselves with over eight minutes of outtakes from Jim Gaffigan 's old Saturn commercial , we 're thinking the comedic pitchman is to blame .
Hit the jump to join in on the laughs .
Gaffigan is a flat - out goofball , and we 're pretty sure he 's addicted to calling animals and inanimate objects his family members .
We 're not sure how the old guy with the lease term paper did n't flip the hell out , though .
Sure , the video is old , but considering the quickening demise of the Saturn brand , we feel it 's apropos to revisit it now .
Besides , we reckon that both Saturn fans and employees could use a bit of humor at a time like this . : Explicit language may be NSFW .

The Potemkin Duma
The Kremlin does n’t rig elections ; it engineers them .
This is something everyone in Russia , no matter what their rhetoric or political persuasion , knows and accepts .
So when recent local elections returned some unusual results , the only surprise was the intensity of the backlash .
On Sunday , Oct. 11 , 76 of Russia ’s 83 regions went to the polls in some 7,000 regional and municipal elections .
In the weeks leading up to the event , the government pushed and pushed Russians to register to vote .
But because these were local elections in a country where everything is centered on the so - called Kremlin " power vertical , " and because Russians , long shut out of the process , do n’t much believe in participatory democracy anymore , only about 30 million ( out of 140 million ) registered .
And when the day came , even fewer showed up to vote .
On Election Day in Moscow , which was holding elections for the Moscow Duma , turnout was a meager 29 percent .
If government employees and their families had n’t been forced to vote , the figure would have been much , much lower .
All of which is to say :
No one cares .
Russian elections are a known and tightly choreographed quantity .
The joke making the rounds in Moscow when Dmitry Medvedev was up for election in the spring of 2008 was Medvedev ’s mom calling on election night , frantically asking if he ’d won .
" Mom , " he says , " do n’t you fuck with me , too . "
Even the opposition parties — the " loyal opposition " successfully co-opted and neutered by the Kremlin — do n’t mind the fraud as long as they still get to play ball .
Because no one cares , it ’s the same every time :
An election is held , a few dedicated pensioners vote , and United Russia — the party of power , the party of the Kremlin , the party of Putin — reasserts its overwhelming primacy .
And this time , at least at first , it seemed like everything would unfold as planned .
On Oct. 11 , United Russia swept back into control of political offices up and down the country ’s command chain by huge , double - digit margins .
In the Moscow Duma elections , for instance , United Russia took 32 of the 35 seats ( that is , 91 percent ) , leaving three seats to the Communists , and forcing out the Kremlin - engineered A Just Russia Party ( SR ) and the liberal Yabloko Party entirely .
The number of parties in the chamber was cut in half .
( A United Russia deputy told me , somewhat disingenuously , that his party colleagues in the Moscow Duma were dismayed to be stuck with just the Communists .
" Before , Yabloko just sat there and criticized us .
But so what ?
It was food for thought , " he said .
" Now we have to listen to three Communists .
And their criticism is n’t usually constructive . " )
The fact that two parties were forced out of the Moscow Duma was suspicious , as was the fact that the results trickling in on Oct. 11 so obviously diverged with exit polls .
Several elections across the country also smelled a little funny .
From Derbent , in Dagestan , came tales of a third of polling stations never opening , while others closed early .
In Astrakhan , observers were beaten and forced from the stations while whole ballot boxes were tossed out .
Moscow was , as always , the epicenter .
A video of a young man emerged detailing how he facilitated " carouseling " voters around town to vote multiple times , using the Moscow mayor ’s name as a password .
( A few days later , he reappeared and claimed he had been drunk when he made the statement .
Someone had clearly gotten to him . )
Most egregious was the result in the Khamovniki neighborhood of Moscow , where Yabloko chairman Sergei Mitrokhin and his family went to vote — and where not a single vote was registered for Yabloko .
( Yesterday , a local court annulled the results in Khamovniki and ruled for a recount . )
It was a bit much even for those used to such Kremlin antics .
But still , it all could have passed without remark , because , still , no one cares .
And absolutely no one expected the plot twist :
On October 14 , three days after the elections , Vladimir Zhirinovsky , leader of the nationalist right - wing LDPR party , stood up before the federal Duma and declared the election results unacceptable .
He and his party , he said , were leaving , and they would n’t come back until the Central Election Committee chairman was fired and until they could secure a face - to - face with Medvedev .
Then the leader of A Just Russia ( SR ) , a center - left party engineered by the Kremlin to serve as an opposition magnet , got up and said her people were out of there , too .
Then the Communists followed , and all of a sudden , only United Russia was left in the chamber .
No one knew what to think .
After all , nothing like this had happened in a very , very long time .
Although insiders knew LDPR was planning a walkout , no one thought the others would follow .
And even if the fraud was over the top , the Communists , LDPR , and SR were n’t exactly the opposition .
They were loyal and accommodating , and had fully bought into the Kremlin ’s system — from which they benefited hugely .
" This is an alarm bell , " says Gennady Gudkov , the leader of the People ’s Party of the Russian Federation .
" If even this most tolerant , most cooperative opposition unites and walks out , it ’s a sign of trouble .
And it means we ’ve had it up to here . "
But was this the first sign , as many Moscow liberals hoped with baited breath , of a meaningful rumble , of a color revolution ?
Was this an echo of this summer ’s unrest in Iran after a fraudulent and widely disputed election ?
Or was it simply another charade ?
Was the walkout an event orchestrated by one Kremlin apparatchik to get back at another Kremlin apparatchik , as some conspiracy theorists alleged ?
In the meantime , United Russia took advantage of the opposition ’s absence .
On October 15 , the party tore through an entire day ’s docket , passing all proposed pro-Kremlin laws before the lunch recess , at an estimated speed of one law every three minutes .
( Of course , the rush was unnecessary .
The party has 315 of 450 seats in the Duma .
That means that not only can party leaders pass whichever laws they want , but they can change the Russian constitution , too .
Alone . )
By Friday , after Medvedev put in a quick phone call to Zhirinovsky , LDPR was back , quickly followed by the SRs .
But the Communists held out the longest , only returning on Wednesday because , they said , it would be irresponsible not to fight the Kremlin ’s proposed 2010 budget .
( It passed anyway . )
The opposition continues to scream about the delegitimization of Russian democracy and this Saturday they will meet with Medvedev at the presidential dacha , where they will demand the annulment of certain results , the firing of the Electoral Committee chairman , and Duma reforms that will allow deputies to speak longer .
Duma representatives insist they will keep fighting , but they are , at this point , simply saving face .
The revolution is very much over .
This is primarily because it was never about the legitimacy of Russian elections or democracy in the first place .
Given its dominance of the airspace and the Kremlin ’s fine touch at engineering results , United Russia would have swept the elections without lifting a finger .
The fraud was unseemly and , quite simply , extraneous .
And , though it may have angered some Duma deputies , that ’s where the discontent ends .
The most recent poll by the Levada Center , a prominent Moscow polling organization , found that not only were 55 percent of Russians not surprised by the election results , more than half could n’t even answer whether they were satisfied with the election in their region .
When Iran exploded in protests this summer , just as Ukraine had in 2005 , after disputed elections , it was because Iranians believed their vote was a vector for change .
Russians , however , know better .
" During the Orange Revolution [ in Ukraine ] , people had something invested in their vote — there was feeling behind their votes , " says Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center .
" Here , you can falsify as much as you want because the voter has nothing invested in it . "
There was a protest in Moscow on Thursday night , but it was organized and attended primarily by Duma deputies and members of various thinly populated political organizations .
The far more likely reason for the Duma walkout was the deputies ’ own fear they might be next on the Kremlin ’s list :
First , they force out the party representatives in the regional organizations , like A Just Russia Party and Yabloko , and then they come for the big dogs like Zhirinovsky and Communist Party chair Gennady Zyuganov .
" Being a deputy is a lucrative business in Russia .
And their well - being depends on the Kremlin ’s benevolence .
This is n’t about fair or unfair elections but about people ’s lives and livelihoods , " Lipman says .
" The discontent people here are the well - fed deputies . "
Some deputies do n’t even dispute this .
" Of course , we imagined ourselves in their shoes and realized , yes , it ’s going to be bad for us , " Duma deputy Valery Zubov says .
" The regional Duma elections are in March ; the federal Duma elections are in two years .
If they do the same thing then , then our party thinks we should n’t even participate in the farce . "
And , for its part , the Kremlin is eager to grant the opposition leaders an audience with Medvedev because the Kremlin needs the tightly controlled , beautifully ornamental opposition as much as the opposition needs the Kremlin .
" Here ’s an image for you , " says Vladimir Ryzhkov , an independent politician and former speaker of the Duma ( before he was forced out by the Kremlin ) .
" Here ’s this Potemkin village of democracy with a few crooked huts of opposition on the outskirts .
In the center of town , you have a huge red - brick palace with high fences , in the New Russian style .
That ’s called United Russia .
And the huts on the outskirts are afraid they will be burned down and kicked out of the village .
" Maybe , in the next elections , United Russia will be more reserved , " he continues , " but the substance wo n’t change : United Russia will have the overwhelming majority and will rule unopposed .
The Potemkin village will remain a Potemkin village . "
Dixon , Illinois ( CNN ) -- William Heirens , the " Lipstick Killer , " is believed to be the longest - serving inmate in the United States .
He turns 81 on November 15 .
Diabetes has ravaged his body , but his mind is sharp .
" Bill 's never allowed himself to be institutionalized , " said Dolores Kennedy , his long - time friend and advocate .
" He 's kept himself focused on the positives . "
The days are spent mostly watching television and reading magazines .
Using a wheelchair and sharing a cell with a roommate in the health unit of Dixon Correctional Center , he still yearns for a chance at freedom .
It is something he has not tasted since 1946 .
Heirens has been locked behind bars and walls for 63 years , making inmate C06103 the longest - serving prisoner in Illinois history , state officials say .
According to Steven Drizin , the legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University , Heirens " has served longer than anyone in the U.S. that I can find . "
He was put away a year after the end of World War II .
It is a dubious record , but fitting for the man dubbed the Lipstick Killer , whose crime spree remains among the most infamous in the history of Chicago , the city of Capone and Leopold and Loeb .
The scar - faced gangster and the thrill - kill pair are long gone .
Heirens , however , has not slipped into the past .
He lives in the present and hopes for a future outside prison .
Supporters have championed his cause , convinced that he is innocent , or arguing that he has been rehabilitated , a model inmate who has served his sentence .
" Pray for my release , " he wrote in a letter dated October 11 .
" There is no reason to keep this man behind bars , " said Drizin .
" He meets all the criteria for parole . "
While Drizin , who has represented Heirens since 2001 , and others passionately plead for his release and prepare to re-petition the state parole board that has consistently refused to free Heirens , others are convinced he is a manipulative murderer .
" He was the bogeyman , " said Betty Finn of the man convicted of strangling her sister .
" I do n't think you need to feel sorry for him .
He chose his life and he chose his actions . "
Josephine Ross was the first victim .
The 43 - year - old was found stabbed to death in her apartment .
She was killed on June 5 , 1945 .
In December , police discovered the body of Frances Brown in her bathroom .
She was stabbed through the neck and shot in the head .
The killer left a message on the wall .
It said , " for heavens sake catch me before I kill more I cannot control myself . "
It was scrawled in red lipstick .
The press seized on the detail .
The headlines would soon scream of the Lipstick Killer .
Four weeks later , an intruder used a ladder to enter the second - floor window of Suzanne Degnan 's bedroom .
The killer approached the sleeping 6 - year - old girl and abducted her .
" I was old enough to know everything that happened and remember the looks on my parents ' faces , " Finn said of the crime against her younger sister .
" Can you imagine as a child to have this happen ?
Can you imagine going to bed at night and all of a sudden your sister is not in her bed ? "
There would be a ransom note demanding $ 20,000 .
But there would also be the horrific discovery of Suzanne 's severed head in a sewer .
Other body parts were found within days .
Chicago was gripped in fear .
Scores of people were questioned , but the investigation dragged on for months without a break .
One , however , came in June , when two police officers confronted a burglar near the Degnan home .
The young thief was a 17 - year - old student at the University of Chicago .
His name was William Heirens , and police soon became convinced he was the killer .
Drizin said Heirens was subjected to days of brutal interrogation .
He also was beaten and given sodium pentothal to make him tell the truth , Drizin said .
He underwent a spinal tap , another extreme measure to compel him to talk .
Prosecutors said his handwriting matched that of the words scribbled in lipstick at the scene of the Brown killing .
The FBI determined that a fingerprint lifted from the Degnan ransom note matched Heirens .
That gave the state 's attorney two powerful pieces of evidence against Heirens .
But a confession would seal his fate .
On August 7 , 1946 , Heirens supplied it , describing how he killed Degnan , Brown and Ross .
He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder .
In exchange for the plea , Heirens was spared the death penalty and given three consecutive life sentences .
Heirens has distinguished himself in prison .
He was the first inmate in Illinois to receive a college degree .
" He helped redesign the library system in the department of corrections , " said Drizin , who also commended Heirens for becoming a " first - rate jailhouse lawyer . "
Drizin said Heirens has been eligible for parole nearly every year since the 1970s .
The Center on Wrongful Convictions mounted a clemency campaign for Heirens on the grounds that he has served longer than required , and that the evidence used to convict him was unreliable .
" Smoke and mirrors " was how Drizin described it .
Kennedy , who wrote a book that attempts to prove Heirens is innocent , said a political component is keeping him in prison .
" It 's a very political case , " she said .
" Authorities have made statements that he would never get out .
I think the courts managed to look the other way and the [ parole ] board did n't want to take the heat . "
John Russick , senior curator for the Chicago History Museum , said the story of William Heirens is complicated .
" This is not a largely understood case , " Russick said .
" People know the term Lipstick Killer , and that there was a sensational crime , but I do n't think it 's talked about in detail . "
He added , " I feel like it defies logic , and that 's what 's troubling about it .
When you look closely at the nature of these kinds [ of confessions ] and when you know how these confessions were acquired , there 's enough there to -- at the very least -- to make you feel very unsure . "
Frank Czagany , who met Heirens when both were working in the machine shop at U.S. Steel in 1944 , remembers his friend as being " very quiet , not wild . "
" He would n't say crap if he had a mouthful of it , " Czagany said .
Finn calls the efforts supporting Heirens misguided .
" I 'm not a vindictive person , I 'm not doing this out of anger .
It 's fear , " she said .
" There is no evidence that says he 's the least bit innocent .
How can every single court be wrong ? "
Finn , who attended Heirens ' most recent parole hearing , in July , said he is not innocent by any stretch of the imagination .
" Keep him locked in jail , " she said .
Kennedy said she and others are looking for a suitable placement in a nursing home for Heirens .
She said she believes there is some indication that if an acceptable facility is located , he may have a chance to spend his final days a free man .
" He looks for any glimmer of hope , " said Kennedy .
" He still wants to be out . "
Drizin said that time has come .
" This is a case where I have serious doubts about his guilt , " he said .
" But it 's a case where there is no question in my mind that the circus - like atmosphere that pervaded his arrest and his prosecution resulted in a trial proceeding for Bill and a guilty plea that was fundamentally unfair . "
" They probably have good hearts and are dedicated , " Finn said of Heirens ' believers .
" He is not innocent by any stretch , no matter how they twist it . "
MIDDLESEX COUNTY --
Sobriety checkpoints , normally put into place for the spring prom season in Middlesex County , will become year - round beginning this weekend , according to Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan .
Kaplan announced today that a $ 43,000 grant from the New Jersey Office of Highway Traffic Safety will enable police to establish Driving While Intoxicated ( DWI ) checkpoints at any time during the year .
He said members of various municipal police departments in the county and investigators from the his office ’s fatal crash investigations unit will be randomly stationed throughout the county to check for impaired drivers .
" Due to the dedicated efforts of our local police departments , the sobriety checkpoints have been very successful over the years in helping to curb driving by motorists who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs , " Kaplan said .
In the past , the checkpoints were set up for various holidays and during the prom and graduation season each spring , but their success led authorities to decide to expand the program , he said .
Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Nicholas Sewitch , who heads up the fatal crash investigations unit , said , " the purpose of the sobriety checkpoints is to remove intoxicated drivers from the road . "
Sewitch , who supervises the checkpoints , said they are also " to educate people to the dangers of drinking or using drugs and driving , " and " to deter people from driving if they have become intoxicated and ensure the safety of the motoring public . "
When motorists are stopped at the checkpoints , they are handed pamphlets outlining the consequences of impaired driving and are told that first - time offenders could lose their driving privileges for up to seven months and face a variety of fines , insurance surcharges and legal fees that could total as much as $ 15,000
L'affaire est vieille de vingt - sept ans mais elle a connu avant - hier un rebondissement incroyable .
Dieter Krombach , un médecin allemand de 74 ans , condamné par contumace pour le meurtre d'une jeune Française en 1982 , mais que la justice allemande avait toujours refusé d'extrader , a été découvert dimanche matin dans une rue de Mulhouse ( Haut - Rhin ) , blessé à la tête et ligoté .
Ce cardiologue , qui vit près du lac de Constance , non loin de la frontière autrichienne , avait été enlevé quelques heures auparavant .
Hier , André Bamberski , le père de la jeune victime de Krombach , Kalinka Bamberski , était en garde à vue .
Présent à Mulhouse ce week - end , cet expert - comptable , qui s'est battu pendant des années pour que l'assassin de sa fille soit remis aux autorités françaises ( lire l'encadré ci-dessous ) , était soupçonné hier d'avoir joué un rôle dans l'enlèvement du docteur Krombach .
Une perquisition a eu lieu hier soir au domicile d ' André Bamberski u à Pechbusque , près de Toulouse ( Haute - Garonne ) .
« Une jeune fille sacrifiée sur l'autel des relations franco - allemandes »
C'est un coup de téléphone anonyme passé par un interlocuteur « à fort accent russe » qui a finalement permis aux policiers de localiser le cardiologue allemand .
Celui - ci a été découvert dans une petite rue près de l'esplanade de l'Europe .
Blessé au visage , Dieter Krombach avait été ligoté et bâillonné par son ou ses ravisseurs .
Conduit à l'hôpital , il a été placé en garde à vue .
Il fait en effet l'objet d'un mandat d'arrêt international .
Joint hier soir , l'avocat d'André Bamberski , Me François Gibault , a estimé que , « puisque M. Krombach est désormais en France , il va devoir faire face à la justice française .
Le mandat d'arrêt s'applique à l'égard de ce fugitif .
Logiquement , il devra donc comparaître à nouveau devant une cour d'assises pour être jugé de façon contradictoire , cette fois , et non par contumace .
Si la logique judiciaire est enfin respectéeâ ? ¦ »

L'affaire Krombach a débuté en juillet 1982 , lorsque Kalinka Bamberski , une jeune Française de 14 ans , est retrouvée morte à Lindau , sur les bords du lac de Constance , lors d'un séjour chez le cardiologue allemand qui est le nouveau compagnon de sa mère .
L'adolescente est morte dans la nuit des suites d'une curieuse injection .
En Allemagne , l'affaire est rapidement classée sans suite au motif qu'il est impossible de préciser les causes exactes du décès .
Mais une enquête est ouverte en France à l'instigation du père de la victime , qui reste persuadé que sa fille a été droguée pour être violée .
Au terme d'une longue bataille , le docteur Krombach est finalement condamné par contumace par la cour d'assises de Paris , en 1995 , à quinze ans de prison .
Mais les autorités allemandes refuseront toujours d'extrader leur ressortissant , qui continuera même à exercer jusqu'à ce que d'autres affaires , d'abus sexuels et d'escroquerie , le rattrapent .
Il sera condamné deux fois pour ces faits , en 1997 puis en 2007 , en Allemagne , mais restera hors d'atteinte de la justice française malgré un mandat d'arrêt européen .
This is not a political blog .�
That said , almost all writing on economics and business embeds a political point of view . �
I recognize that my view is relatively libertarian with respect to economics / business , but conservative with respect to ethical issues .�
There are a few things that I think would get wide agreement from many parties , aside from those entrenched in DC . �
That is what tonight ’s post is about . �
I think that I will not post like this often .
1 ) � End gerrymandering — all congressional and state districts should follow the following rule :
The ratio of the square of the circumference to the area of a district should not exceed 30 .
This would make representatives less partisan than is common today , because they would have to be elected by groups closer to a random sample of the people in a given area . �
Exceptions would be granted for non-negotiable boundaries , like state and national boundaries .
2 ) �
Make them read the bills publicly .�
We have a health bill that is 1990 pages long .�
Make them read it , and make the legislators listen . �
Whip those that fall asleep .�
Further , let the bills fully express the changes made in a plain english manner .�
Amendments to existing laws must be written out in entire , rather than referencing a code , and saying that it has been deleted , amended , etc .
3 ) � Limit the length of bills .�
The Law of God through Moses was far more comprehensive , and is far shorter than even most narrowly focused bills .
4 ) � Flesch - test all bills .�
Make them simple enough to be understood by ninth - graders . �
Hey , they force this on insurance companies !�
Do you suppose that laws which should have universal application should be different ?
5 ) � Publish an abstract of all major laws that affect citizens once every five years .�
Give a copy to every adult citizen .�
Let this be done in every state as well .
6 ) � Re-emphasize the ninth and tenth amendments to the Constitution .�
Those amendments are supposed to maximize liberty for states and individuals .
7 ) Amend the Constitution to make Federal and State laws superior to treaties .�
I know what mischief this would do , but I would rather be ruled by my local peers than by foreigners who have no understanding of what our American system is like .
Would that we would do this .�
Our government is less and less understandable to the average citizen . �
If we want our government to exist for a long time , we need to put into place reforms that will cause the government to be more responsive to its citizens .

United Nations ( CNN ) --
For the 18th year in a row , the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday voted to condemn the 47 - year embargo against Cuba by the United States .
The draft resolution was passed by a vote of 187 - 3 , with 2 abstentions .
Only the United States , Israel and Palau voted against the measure .
Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained .
The yearly vote has become almost a ritual , but has not changed the United States ' stance toward the communist island nation .
Washington severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 and has had the economic embargo in place since 1962 .
Wednesday 's vote was the first with President Obama in office .
Obama has taken some steps to thaw relations with Cuba , but extended the embargo in September .
Since taking office , the Obama administration has lifted restrictions on Cuban - Americans traveling to the island and sending remittances to family members there .
The United States also shut down a ticker atop the U.S. interests section in Havana , Cuba , that had since 2006 scrolled anti-Cuba slogans in 5 - foot - high crimson letters .
In July , U.S. and Cuban diplomats held their first talks since 2003 on Cuban migration to the United States .
Despite the changes , the U.S. stance remains that the embargo will not be lifted until political and social changes are seen in Cuba .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than a million people could receive an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits under a bill approved by the House on Tuesday .
The bill extends benefits for those living in states with jobless rates higher than 8.5 % .
Some 27 states , plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico , fall into this category .
The national unemployment rate hit 9.7 % in August , the highest in 26 years .
The legislation now moves to the Senate .
While there is support for the measure on both sides of the aisle , senators may make significant changes to it .
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , is seeking to expand the bill to give additional weeks of benefits to people in all states , not just high unemployment ones , an aide said .
Senate Republicans , meanwhile , want to look at other funding approaches , said a spokesman for Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Ky .
There is no timetable for introducing the measure in the Senate , though Democratic leaders said they want to do so soon .
Under the House bill , the extended benefits would apply to an estimated 314,000 people set to exhaust their benefits by month 's end and to more than a million who will stop getting checks by the end of the year .
Workers in other states could qualify if their state is expected to hit an 8.5 % unemployment rate soon or meets other criteria .
" Decent , hard - working Americans from North Carolina to California have been calling my office to tell me they still cannot find work after a year or more after becoming unemployed and they need some additional help to keep their heads above water , " said Rep. Jim McDermott , D - Wash . , when he introduced the legislation earlier this month .
To cover the benefits , employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes .
This proposal would be funded by a one - year extension of an the federal tax , which has been in place for the past three decades .
Also , the legislation would require that reporting on newly hired employees include a start date , which would reduce unemployment insurance overpayments .
Republicans , however , would like to look at other ways to pay for the benefits , McConnell 's spokesman said .
An estimated 400,000 people are expected to lose their checks by the end of this month and 1.4 million will by the end of the year , according to the National Employment Law Project .
The advocacy group urging the Senate to expand the benefits to all states , since every one has experienced record increases in unemployment and record numbers of workers filing for and exhausting their unemployment benefits .
" It 's hard to leave 23 states out of the equation , " said Maurice Emsellem , the project 's policy co-director .
In most states , unemployed people receive 26 weeks of state - funded benefits .
Depending on where they live , they could get federally funded extensions for a total of 79 weeks .
Calls to extend benefits
Over the past year , Congress has twice voted to extend benefits .
Still , pressure has been building on Capitol Hill to extend them again as the recession wears on and unemployment continues to rise .
Governors of 22 states appealed to congressional leaders last week to quickly pass extended benefits .
A record 50.7 % of the unemployed failed to find work within six months of receiving benefits , according to the National Employment Law Project .
There are now more than six potential workers for each opening , up from 1.7 in December 2007 .
Extending benefits is crucial since unemployment often continues to rise even after the economy starts to turn around , said Chad Stone , chief economist for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , which advocates for workers .
Also , lengthening benefits helps boost the economy since the jobless usually spend their checks .
The bill is well - targeted since it would apply to more than 80 % of those about to exhaust their benefits , Stone said .
They will likely continue to have the hardest time finding a new job .
The locations with unemployment rates greater than 8.5 % are Alabama , Arizona , California , District of Columbia , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Nevada , New Jersey , North Carolina , New York , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Puerto Rico , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Washington , Wisconsin and West Virginia .
Libertarian Texas Congressman Ron Paul is finding rare support for his push to shine the spotlight on the Federal Reserve .
" He ’s finally found the right moment , " Sarah Binder of the liberal Brookings Institution told Reuters .
" His bill happens to be in the right place at the right time , " adds Paul spokesman Rachel Mills .
Paul ’s history of long - shot causes , which include pulling out the United Nations and repealing federal drugs laws , has n’t drawn a lot of support from Congressional colleagues in the past but his criticism of the Fed and its dominant role in the U.S. economy , is drawing support .
His bill , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act , has 178 Republican and 104 Democratic co-sponsors .
None of the 57 other bills Paul introduced in the current session of Congress has drawn more than 12 cosponsors .
Democrat Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , has pledged to work with Paul with expanded legislation that includes an audit of the Federal Reserve .
The bill is expected to come up for a vote in October .
In the Senate , a similar bill offered by Socialist Bernie Sanders has drawn only 23 co-sponsors .

Since the late 1970s , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has certified the fuel - economy projections of some 450 million new vehicles sold in this country .
The projections are there by law and appear boldly on the window stickers of new vehicles , for example , CITY MPG 16 , HIGHWAY MPG 25 .
They appear authoritatively , almost like a pledge from the federal government , and motorists have put a lot of faith in these numbers .
The EPA figures also determine whether an automaker meets the required fuel - economy averages for a company ’s entire vehicle line , so the numbers are a very big deal .
As such , you might expect the federal government ’s facility to be about the size of , oh , the Department of Agriculture and loaded to the brim with persistent bureaucrats .
While the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck , van , car , and SUV , in reality , just 18 of the EPA ’s 17,000 employees work in the automobile - testing department in Ann Arbor , Michigan , examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year , or roughly 15 percent of new models .
As to that other 85 percent , the EPA takes automakers at their word — without any testing — accepting submitted results as accurate .
Two - thirds of the new vehicles the EPA does test are selected randomly , and the remaining third are done for specific reasons .
We ’re not sure why a Porsche 911 GT3 was at the lab when we were there — other than to get an up - close look at its sexy , single - lug wheels — but candidates for scrutiny usually involve new technologies , new manufacturers , class fuel - economy champs , or cars that barely avoid a gas - guzzler tax .
We visited the EPA ’s nondescript lab for a look at just how these numbers are derived .
Located across the street from the University of Michigan ’s North Campus and next to a mundane strip mall , the only clue to its importance is the imposing gate that guards the industrial building complex .
What happens inside is enormously complicated .
There are endless reams of documents that explain , in detail , every procedure and circumstance , and each comes with its own set of rules .
Even the procedure for rounding off the results of the fuel - economy tests to produce what is published on a new - car label is crazily complex .
“ We have a guy that ’s literally made a career out of specializing in rounding , ” says the EPA ’s Linc Wehrly , manager of “ light - duty compliance , ” the man in charge of vehicle testing .
So how does the EPA lab work ?
Vehicles are tested on dynamometers , or dynos , which are like giant treadmills for cars .
The vehicle is held stationary while its wheels spin the dyno ’s large rollers .
There are just three dynos , and only one of them is a four - wheel - drive unit with sets of rollers for both the front and rear wheels ; the two other dynos are spun by only a car ’s driven wheels .
The four - wheel dyno was added fairly recently ; before that , all testing had to be done on two - wheel - drive dynos , which necessitated the additional complexity of disconnecting driveshafts on AWD models so they could be converted to two - wheel drive .
( How weird can it get ?
The EPA created a two - wheel - drive version of the $ 1.7 million , 1001 - hp Bugatti Veyron — the world ’s fastest and most outrageous production car — for this purpose , prompting visions of burnouts of nuclear dimension . )
When tested this way , additional drag is applied to the dyno to replicate normal operation of the AWD system .
AARON KILEY
Every last detail of an EPA fuel - economy test has specific rules — there ’s even a set volume of air that a fan must blow under the car ’s raised hood .
“ Driving ” the test by matching the red line is tricky and takes a sensitive foot .
After a vehicle is strapped down on a dyno , the staff punches in coefficients that allow the dyno rolls to simulate real - world factors , such as wind and road friction .
One of the EPA ’s six drivers is behind the wheel of the test car .
With an average of 20 years ’ experience , they have extremely fine - tuned throttle and brake - control skills .
They “ drive ” by following a precise red line of speed versus time that ’s displayed on a monitor hanging just in front of the windshield .
Using the gas pedal and the brakes , the driver attempts to match the red line with the car ’s wheel speed , which is shown in white .
We got into a test car and tried it , and indeed , it ’s very difficult to maintain the speed of the tests , particularly when it dithers in the single digits and a brush of the throttle can send the white line careening off - course .
If the speed deviates from the test cycle by more than 2 mph , the results are thrown out .
For manual - transmission cars , there are standard EPA shift points , which are broadcast on the driver ’s screen as well .
AARON KILEY
In 1972 , when regular gas was 35 cents a gallon , test cycles were invented by the newly created EPA to measure exhaust emissions .
The first test cycle , which sought to mimic rush - hour traffic in downtown Los Angeles with an average speed of 21 mph , is called the FTP , or city cycle , and is still in use today .
This dyno test is 11 miles long , takes just over 31 minutes to complete , involves 23 stops , reaches a top speed of 56 mph , and has maximum acceleration equivalent to a lazy , 18 - second 0 - to - 60 - mph run .
A second cycle to measure highway driving was added in the late 1970s as part of the introduction of corporate average fuel - economy ( CAFE ) regulations .
This 10.3 - mile cycle with an average speed of a paltry 48 mph and acceleration no more severe than in the city test , may have been somewhat realistic in the days of the national 55 - mph speed limit but does n’t come close to approximating the manic highway behavior of today ’s drivers .
As a result , and even though the test figures were adjusted downward starting in the early 1980s in an attempt to produce more realistic sticker values ( by 10 percent for the city test and 22 percent for the highway ) , the EPA numbers gave drivers too optimistic an expectation of fuel economy for decades .
In 1987 , Congress allowed the states to increase highway speed limits from 55 to 65 mph , but it would take another 21 years for the EPA to adopt tests that provide more realistic projections .
To accomplish this , the EPA added three additional test cycles to the original two for 2008 model - year cars .
These new tests — they had , in fact , been in use since the late 1990s but for emissions purposes — are the US06 high - speed ( 80 mph max ) cycle ; the SC03 , or “ A/ C , ” cycle , which is very similar to the city cycle but run in 95 - degree heat with the vehicle ’s air conditioning filching fuel ; and the cold FTP test , which is exactly the same as the city cycle but run at a frigid 20 degrees .
Until the 2012 model year , however , automakers may use results from the two old fuel - economy cycles and then plug those numbers into an elaborate equation developed by the EPA that approximates the new five - cycle procedure .
For 2012 , all fuel - economy figures will derive from the results of the 43.9 miles covered by the five tests .
AARON KILEY
While piloting a Honda Insight at the lab , we found the high - speed US06 cycle impressively aggressive .
The cycle still averages only 48 mph but has bursts of acceleration ( similar to a 7.0 - second 0 - to - 60 - mph time ) that are more than twice as demanding as the original highway cycle and a top speed of 80 mph .
To keep pace , the Insight required at least three - quarters throttle , which made us appreciate the realism of the new tests and wonder if some underpowered cars may have a tough time keeping up with their acceleration demands .
The imperfection of human drivers is a big problem with repeatability of the tests , and hybrid vehicles in particular are very sensitive to throttle inputs — which , in turn , control engine starting and stopping and the amount of battery assist .
We ’ve heard complaints that fuel - economy results for hybrids can vary by as much as 10 or 20 percent depending on the driver , although the EPA claims the results are repeatable within one to two percent .
Measuring fuel economy during the tests is likewise hugely complex , which is why the automakers and the EPA both follow precisely the same protocol .
For openers , the chemical composition of fuel varies slightly , so simply retrieving it from a local gas station wo n’t produce repeatable results .
The EPA has a specialized company manufacture small batches of consistent fuel , which is 93 octane ( cars running 50 - state certifications get a slightly different , 91 - octane “ California ” blend ) .
Before being used , the gas is analyzed to measure its properties , and fuel economy is then calculated based on the measured carbon content of the various tailpipe emissions — unburned hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , methane ( CH4 ) , and oxides of nitrogen ( NOx ) — that are collected in bags made of a special Kynar plastic .
A $ 350,000 gas - analyzing machine then makes minute measurements .
The one - percent accuracy of this machine from Japanese company Horiba is amazing considering the minuscule amounts of some of the exhaust constituents — some in quantities as low as a half - dozen parts per million .
The final city and highway ratings are calculated by taking the fuel - economy results from specific portions of each of the five tests and piecing them together .

This fairly recent revision in the testing protocol is n’t cheap for automakers to adopt .
The EPA estimates that to build a test facility capable of running one SC03 or cold FTP test per day would cost $ 10 million .
Even the EPA ’s own lab is incapable of performing two of these new tests , which it instead contracts out .
But the revised tests are likely worth it as we ’ve noticed a big change :
Pre-2008 test cars in our enthusiastic hands rarely returned fuel economy anywhere near the EPA ’s highway projection and would regularly get poorer mileage than even the city figure , which — not counting hybrids — is the lower of the two .
Now we generally see mileage between the two numbers , and with a little restraint , the EPA ’s highway number is usually within reach .
The EPA maintains a repository of ratings from 1985 to the present at www.fueleconomy.gov.
The recent proliferation of things such as paddle shifters , various transmission modes , and more - responsive sport settings has made for interesting back - and - forth negotiations between the automakers and the EPA when it comes to the particulars of vehicle testing .
For emissions purposes , cars are certified in groups arranged by similar characteristics ( engine , transmission , etc. ) , and the model or trim level with the highest emissions must be tested by the automaker .
There ’s no wiggle room .
This version is generally the heaviest or has the most aerodynamic drag , and that vehicle is tested in any driver - selectable mode , such as a transmission sport mode , that would worsen emissions .
But for fuel - economy purposes , many things are up for discussion ; it ’s the automaker ’s task to convince the EPA how the cars are likely to be driven in consumers ’ hands .
The EPA ’s Wehrly describes a hypothetical , but typical , discussion where an automaker wants to get around activating a particular feature that degrades fuel economy during the testing .
Luxury automaker : “ We have this feature , but no one uses it . ” EPA : “ Then why do you have it ? ” Automaker : “ Because Mercedes has it .
If we do n’t have it , it looks bad . ”
We thought the powerful BMW M5 starts up using “ just ” 400 horsepower to save fuel ( the driver can push a button to get the full 500 horsepower ) .
But most gimmicky buttons are just that :
The EPA tested the M5 in both 400 - and 500 - hp modes and found no difference in the amount of fuel used .
The demands of the test cycles never call upon all the M5 ’s horses anyway .
And the Honda Insight ’s econ mode — activated by a dash button and claimed to improve fuel economy — registered no effect , either .
It relaxes throttle response , so the test driver simply compensates with additional throttle to achieve the required speeds .
However , GM ’s skip - shift device , found in the Corvette among others , irritates by forcing the driver to shift the manual transmission from first gear to fourth at low speeds and was developed precisely to improve fuel economy on the test cycles .
It was approved by the EPA , i.e. , not considered cheating .
As this is written , Porsche is in negotiations to report fuel economy with the Panamera ’s standard , mileage - enhancing stop - start system in place , which switches off the engine as the car stops , then refires it in a flash the moment the driver ’s foot releases the brake .
( Surprisingly , the sports - car specialist will have the first nonhybrid start - stop system in the U.S. )
But the EPA ’s likely counterargument to Porsche using the higher numbers is that with the imported car , the system has to be manually switched back on each time the car is started ( the opposite of European Panameras ) , which means drivers will likely forget to activate the system and let the engine continue to idle at stops .
Porsche would n’t say how much of a fuel - economy boost the system provides , but 18 percent of the EPA city cycle is spent idling , where the Panamera could be saving fuel with its engine switched off .
The EPA says its test results are almost always very close to the automakers ’ numbers .
When they do n’t match , a long discussion ensues .
According to the rules , if the EPA retests a vehicle to assess an automaker ’s results , the fuel economy should be within three percent .
If not , the automaker can choose to accept the lower of the two sets of numbers or request one additional retest .
The EPA seems convinced that cheating is rare , given the complexities of the current tests and the high stakes involved in getting caught .
After all , the EPA has to give its approval before an automaker is permitted to sell a particular model .
If that ’s not enough of a deterrent , there are also big fines for cheating .
In 1998 , all the major players in heavy - duty diesels ( Caterpillar , Cummins , Detroit Diesel , Mack Trucks , Navistar , Renault , and Volvo ) were cited for an engine - control strategy that leaned out the air - fuel ratio at steady highway speeds , which boosted fuel economy at the expense of NOx emissions .
The EPA slapped those seven manufacturers with what it called the “ largest civil penalty in environmental enforcement history , ” a total of $ 83.4 million in fines .
One last fuel - economy tidbit :
Do n’t even think of comparing EPA figures with stand­ardized fuel - economy tests from other countries because the test cycles are very different .
For example , the European highway rating , called “ extra urban , ” is higher than the EPA ’s by about 30 percent , so a rating on that cycle of , say , 60 mpg , would be closer to 40 in this country .
The mainstream press , not realizing the difference , often complains that automakers refuse to bring efficient models here when , in fact , they may not be all that efficient when measured by U.S. standards .
Next time you ’re verifying fuel economy by topping off the tank and dividing the miles driven by the number of gallons , maybe you ’ll appreciate the rabbit hole of complexity behind those numbers .
RATING ELECTRICS : MPG OR KILOWATT HOURS PER 100 MILES ?
2011 Chevrolet Volt : 150 MPG ?
AARON KILEY
How will the EPA measure the mileage of electric cars and plug - in hybrids ?
Particularly tricky are upcoming cars such as the Chevy Volt , which can travel a significant distance on electric - only power .
If the EPA were to run its fuel - economy tests with a fully charged battery , the Volt would burn no gas at all .
So would the miles per gallon on the city cycle read “ infinite ” ?
According to the EPA , a likely solution is to test this new breed of hybrid twice — once in electric - only mode and again with the battery drained and the gas engine providing electricity — and then combine the test results .
But should the two tests simply be averaged ?
GM argues that most customers will plug in the car at night and therefore be running on batteries the majority of the time , so the results should reflect a significant portion of efficient , electric - only driving .
Pure electric cars , such as GM ’s EV1 of the 1990s and , more currently , the Tesla Roadster , have fuel economy stated in units of kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) per 100 miles .
For example , the Tesla gets 32 kWh per 100 miles city and 33 highway , but these figures are Greek to American car buyers accustomed to miles per gallon .
Which is better , 100 mpg or 32 kWh / 100 miles ?
Everyone involved , including the automakers , seems to agree that all cars , including electrics , need to be rated on a mpg-equivalent basis where , for example , the amount of energy used by an electric vehicle could be converted into a volume of gas with the same energy content .
All window stickers would then contain mileage figures in mpg .
The EPA is currently in long , soul - searching meetings to agree on a standard ; a draft proposal should be submitted by year ’s end .
Whatever the specifics , GM expects the Volt to carry a fuel - economy rating of well over 100 mpg .
PAY THE MAN
Lamborghini Murciélago : Buyers pay a $ 6,400 fine for the biggest fuel - sucking car in the nation .
AARON KILEY
When an automaker ’s vehicle falls into “ gas - guzzler ” territory — below 22.5 mpg according to a different , “ unadjusted ” rating — or when its entire model lineup fails to meet the government - ordered fuel - economy average , somebody pays .
The gas - guzzler tax was created as part of the Energy Act of 1978 and is enforced by the Internal Revenue Service .
The possible penalties for poor fuel economy range from $ 1000 to $ 7700 per vehicle , do n’t apply to trucks , and are added to the sticker price .
Since 1983 , the IRS has collected nearly $ 800 million in these fees from new - car buyers .
It ’s a confusing system that could only make sense to politicos because the fuel - economy numbers used for gas - guzzler calculations ( referred to as “ unadjusted ” ) are n’t the same as what appears on the window sticker .
The unadjusted number is higher than the EPA ’s combined mileage rating ( a weighted average of the values posted on the window sticker : 55 percent city and 45 percent highway ) by about 30 percent .
Currently , the worst single fuel - economy offender is the manual - transmission Lamborghini Murciélago , which is rated at 8 mpg city and 13 highway ( the Lambo ’s combined score is 10 mpg and for gas - guzzler purposes gets an unadjusted 12.6 mpg ) .
For this excess , the buyer pays a $ 6400 penalty .
Again , because of rounding that happens behind the scenes , guessing the guzzler threshold based on window - sticker figures is n’t an exact science , but roughly , it begins at sticker ratings of 14 mpg city and 22 highway , such as those for a Mercedes - Benz S550 .
The Mercedes carries the minimum penalty , $ 1000 .
On the other hand , automakers have to pay when they do n’t meet the fleet - wide CAFE mandate that was also enacted in 1978 and is likewise based on the higher , unadjusted fuel - economy figures .
For the 2009 model year , automakers must meet an average of 27.5 mpg for cars and 23.1 mpg for light trucks ( below an 8500 - pound gross vehicle weight rating ) on a sales - weighted basis .
Automakers ’ fleets are further separated into three categories — domestic cars , imported cars , and light trucks — and each individual category has to meet the fuel - economy bogey .
For each 0.1 mpg that an automaker misses this mark , it is fined $ 5.50 multiplied by the number of cars it sells .
Conversely , if an automaker exceeds the CAFE requirements in a given year , it can carry forward a credit to offset future shortcomings .
Currently being argued is whether companies should be allowed to buy and sell credits to each other .
Electric - car maker Tesla , which has an inflated CAFE average of 244 mpg , thanks to an adjustment factor devised by the Energy Department , would certainly benefit .
Meanwhile , Ferrari pays about $ 1 million per year in fines ( $ 616 for each of its 1645 cars sold in 2008 ) in order to sell its breathtaking lineup here , while Mercedes ’ fleet of imported cars came up 2.8 mpg short in 2007 , which equated to a whopping , $ 29 million tab .
The Obama administration has recently announced plans to dramatically ramp up the CAFE thresholds to attain 39 mpg for cars and 30 mpg for trucks for 2016 ( that ’s average real - world fuel economy in the neighborhood of 27 mpg for cars and 21 for trucks ) and to include vehicles up to a 10,000 - pound gross vehicle weight .
The policy also slices those average “ car ” and “ light - truck ” thresholds listed above into vehicle - specific fuel - economy targets that are based on the vehicle ’s footprint ( wheelbase times track width ) , so each model will , in fact , have to achieve slightly different fuel - economy numbers .
Opponents of this modification argue that it will encourage production of larger vehicles because the larger the vehicle , the lower the fuel - economy hurdle .
One thing ’s for sure :
These sweeping changes will significantly alter our vehicular landscape .

My opinions stated herein , of course , are not the opinions of the Department .
I write for myself and myself alone .
I had a long conversation regarding the al - Rabiah case with colleagues when the decision came down .
Our expertise and experiences are varied , but we all work on matters ranging from criminal matters to civil habeas cases .
We are litigators , and we know what makes a case , and when a case is weak .
The conclusion drawn by each of my colleagues  some of whom are liberal Democrats , some of whom are conservative , law - and - order Republicans  is , to a person , that the detention and interrogation programs the United States implemented in the months and years following 9/11 is not only a complete abrogation and violation of international law and , in many cases , federal law  it is also fundamentally immoral .
We also agree that the al - Rabiah case is by far the most egregious yet to come to light .
To repeat : yet to come to light .
I can only guess that there are other , far worse cases .
That said , I am surprised you did not highlight what me and my colleagues agreed was the single most horrifying passage from the Court ’s decision .
It was the Court ’s quotation of something an interrogator said to al - Rabiah during his interrogation .
The interrogator told al - Rabiah :
“ There is nothing against you .
But there is no innocent person here .
So , you should confess to something so you can be charged and sentenced and serve your sentence and then go back to your family and country , because you will not leave this place innocent . ”

Abu Dhabi : The Abu Dhabi police ’s very own Formula One car F999 was unveiled amidst F1 festive fervour , on Wednesday evening .
Arresting performance by the Abu Dhabi Police music band enthralled hundreds who turned up at the Corniche to witness the events unfold .
F999 zipped past the cheering audience but got no close to its maximum speed in a bid to adhere to its motto of spreading the word on road safety .
More puissant than any other police car probably , it could go up to a maximum of 400 kilometres per hour .
However , the car is intended to be the centrepiece in safety campaigns of the police , particularly in campaigns against speeding .
Prior to the launch , F999 was kept hidden under an F1 flag .
While the crowd waited in anticipation , a speeding police car swerved and came to a halt in the middle of the road .
As a masked official dressed in all black got out of the car and opened fire , the F1 flag was removed and F999 was unveiled .
Dressed true to F1 style , Lieutenant Majid Abdul Kareem Al Marzouqi , of the police , got behind the wheels of F999 for a short drive along the Corniche , which was partially closed to traffic for few hours for the event .
Al Marzouqi said that he underwent special training to drive the machine .
“ I was taught on safety , controlling the car and so on . ”
“ The event shows the interest of Abu Dhabi police in reaching out to the community .
It not only marks this major event that we are hosting , but also allows us to draw crowds to tell them about the importance of safe driving . ”
Ahmed Al Kaabi was one amongst the many in the crowd who let out a gasp of delight at the hissing sound of F999 .
“ I would give anything to be able to drive F999 .
It looks amazing ” , he said , in excitement .
With her face painted F999 , 5 - year old Hanan Saleh said that she enjoyed watching the show .
Another custom made police vehicle , the Falcon bike also made a special appearance .
A police helicopter which flew over the scene sporting a flag with F999 printed on it .
A short parade was performed giving an insight into history of Abu Dhabi police – starting with the police officer in Dishdasha with a gun strapped around him to the most modern patrol cars that are seen today .
A future sports model patrol car and police on Segways amused the onlookers .
Seven young drivers who committed no traffic offence during their first year after obtaining a license were also honoured after being chosen by a computer search .

What follows is my new method of addressing someone who does n’t create sound arguments during a debate , i.e. those backed by fact , data , or some type of objective evidence .
Once you suspect that you ’re arguing with someone like this , directly probe to see if they have any evidence whatsoever to support themselves .
If they ca n’t offer any–and especially if they look genuinely confused by your request–respond with something like this :
Well , if you are someone who holds beliefs without regard for actual evidence then I have no interest in continuing this conversation .
Basically , if facts do n’t sway your beliefs , then there ’s no reason I should believe I will be successful either .
This approach will yield one of two responses :
a renewed interest in listening to your evidence an angry retreat back to his / her beliefs , with no offer of evidence
Either way , you benefit .
You either get to have a real conversation or you get to save energy for someone worthy of one . ::

Google has made its commitment to clean energy known – the company has made more than $ 10.5 million in goethermal energy investments and has declared that it wants to make renewable energy cheaper than coal .
Now the search engine giant is expanding its ever - growing reach to include plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Dan Reicher , Google ’s director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , announced today that the company is working on software to better integrate PHEVs into the power grid .
The software will reduce strain on the grid , possibly by letting cars send stored energy back to the grid–so utilities can have extra energy on - tap during times of peak usage .
In such a scenario , utilities might also have the power to turn charging EVs on or off during peak times .
In return , the car owner could receive a credit from the utility .
Google has n’t revealed a timeline for the software , but the company has been experimenting with PHEVs since 2007 .
Rest assured , however , that car companies will release competing plug - in software once more PHEVs hit the streets in the next few years .
Perhaps the biggest competitor will be Ford , which embarked last month on a three - year project with the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute to test vehicle - to - grid technology .

Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago .
I noted several months ago that , for the first time in recorded history , women ’s payroll employment might surpass men ’s during this recession .
This July women held 49.9 percent of all payroll jobs , and some recent research by Federal Reserve economists gives a sense of whether the current trend — heading toward a female - majority work force — will continue .
Obviously , millions of jobs have been lost during this recession .
These job losses have been especially concentrated in industries like manufacturing and construction , which disproportionately employ men .
The sharp contraction in these male - dominated sectors is part of the reason that male employment has fallen much more than female employment during this recession , and that women , as a result , have increased their share of the work force .
But with only the 49.9 percent figure , we do not know whether the high unemployment rate for men comes just because men are more likely to be laid off , or if it ’s also because men are finding new jobs more slowly than women are .
Aysegul Sahin and Joseph Song at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bart Hobijn at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco have examined job flows data that help assess the relative importance of these various explanations for our “ mancession . ”
And indeed , the Fed researchers found that the main reason for the “ mancession ” is that so many more men than women lost their jobs — and not that women find new jobs more quickly .
In any given month , the Labor Department considers every individual either employed , not employed but looking for a job , or neither ( i.e. , out of the labor force altogether ) .
Although more men are unemployed , the amount of time the average person is unemployed is the same for men and women .
( And as you might expect , both sexes are spending more time unemployed than they did prior to the recession . )
The reason that men and women remain unemployed about the same time is that unemployed men and unemployed women are pretty similar in terms of their rates of finding a new job .
These flows help us predict whether women ’s 49.9 percent share of payrolls will further increase , or ebb back .
The implication :
For the time being , women ’s share of the work force seems to hinge primarily on continued contraction in manufacturing and construction .
Why ?
As I explained , more men are searching for jobs and , so far , the average male job searcher has been about as successful as the average female searcher .
Once the male - intensive industries slow down their layoffs ( even if those industries never actually expand again ) , more men than women will gradually find new positions — remember that more men are searching — and we will see women ’s share recede from the 50 percent mark again .
SEOUL , Oct 27 ( Reuters ) - A South Korean man who worked at Samsung Electronics ' semiconductor unit and more recently at a pig farm has defected to the communist North by walking across the heavily mined border , the North 's state media said on Tuesday .
Crossings are rare through the razor - wire and land - mined Demilitarised Zone buffer that divides the peninsula .
But defections to the impoverished North from the affluent South are even rarer , with the last one likely taking place about four years ago .
The rival Koreas remain technically at war because they never replaced the armistice ending their 1950 - 53 conflict with a peace treaty .
" He is beside himself with joy for having accomplished this heroic deed , " the North 's KCNA news agency said .
It identified the defector as Kang Dong - rim , 30 .
South Korea 's military and spy agency could not immediately confirm the report .
" He is now under the warm care of a relevant organ , " KCNA said .
Since 2006 , more than 2,000 North Koreans a year have defected to the South after crossing the longer and less perilous border with China .
More than 16,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since 1953 .
In 2005 , KCNA said a man sailed through a volley of bullets to defect to the North .
The South 's military said at the time his family suspected he was drunk .

Here we have some real science fiction .
Researches from UK have received 228.000 pounds from the " Leverhulme Trust " , to build an amorphous non-silicon biological robot .
The plasmobot should be build from physarum polycephalum .
This is mould , that lives in forests , gardens and wet places in general .
The research should be a step into a complete new field of robotics , that enables parallel processing with non-silicon parts .
Well , why the hell use mould ?
Professor Andy Adamatzky , who leads the project , has proved in a former project , that the mould has ' computing abilities ' !
They call it plasmodium .
He says :
This mould , or plasmodium , is a naturally occurring substance with its own embedded intelligence .
It propagates and searches for sources of nutrients and when it finds such sources it branches out in a series of veins of protoplasm .
The plasmodium is capable of solving complex computational tasks , such as the shortest path between points and other logical calculations .
Through previous experiments we have already demonstrated the ability of this mould to transport objects .
By feeding it oat flakes , it grows tubes which oscillate and make it move in a certain direction carrying objects with it .
We can also use light or chemical stimuli to make it grow in a certain direction .
Not enough yet ?
Than take this :
This new plasmodium robot , called plasmobot , will sense objects , span them in the shortest and best way possible , and transport tiny objects along pre-programmed directions .
The robots will have parallel inputs and outputs , a network of sensors and the number crunching power of super computers .
Totally weird .

Read the rest at science daily .
One of the biggest challenges of evaluating and planning the energy economy is the existence of what economists call externalities , or externalized costs .
Any activity that causes damage to the environment and its inhabitants , such as running a large coal plant , exacts a price from society as a whole that does n't get charged to either the utilities or their customers , but can show up in other costs , such as healthcare bills .
In order to get a better sense of of the externalities associated with the US energy economy , Congress asked the National Academies of Science to estimate their dollar value for electricity , transport , and heating .
The NAS has delivered a number for 2005 : $ 120 billion , without including the impact of climate change .
To provide a more concrete example of an externality , many fossil - fuel powered vehicles and generating stations produce particulate matter .
Since it costs money to install and run equipment that removes these particulates from the exhaust stream , utilities and automobile manufacturers tend to avoid doing so .
But particulates have a significant impact on human health , especially among those who are prone to respiratory difficulty , like asthmatics .
So , part of the cost of particulate emissions is externalized to the health care economy , with other parts going to the individual sufferers , their employers ( due to missed work ) , etc .
Nuclear comes out quite well , in part because the most environmentally damaging aspect of nuclear power is uranium mining , and we do relatively little of it in the US
Although the existence of externalities is widely recognized , calculating their exact cost is challenging , to put it mildly .
Even for something that 's straightforward to estimate , like the health care costs associated with respiratory distress , figuring out the fraction of those caused by particulates ( or other forms of pollution ) is n't necessarily simple .
But , for the full cost of something like wind power , the NAS panel was considering things like whether there 's a way to put a price on the bats and raptors killed by turbines .
As a result , the report consistently mentions that its figures should be viewed with caution .
The authors also decline to attach a price to a number of externalities , like the national security cost of ensuring our oil supply or the loss of ecosystem services ; they also consider the costs of climate change separately from other externalities .
Still , the authors emphasize that this should be taken as an indication that the $ 120 billion figure is a low estimate .
Producing electricity and heat
Another consequence of this caution is that the final figures are dominated by pollutants that are well understood — sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , ozone , and particulate matter — and their ( relatively ) easy - to - quantify impacts on human health .
So , it 's to be expected that the dirtiest fuel , coal , would dominate the proceedings , accounting for just over half of the 120 billion dollar figure .
Still , the committees that prepared the report found a number of differences within the data .
Due to tightened environmental standards , the oldest plants were far and away the most damaging , with the dirtiest 10 percent of the coal - fired plants accounting for over 40 percent of the damages ascribed to coal .
Overall , coal clocked in with about 3.2 ? for each kilowatt - hour generated .
Natural gas is much cleaner , and it blew that figure away , with only 0.16 ? of externalized costs per kilowatt - hour .
But here , the differences between the modern and dirtiest plants was even more dramatic , with the bottom 10 percent of plants accounting for 65 percent of the total damages from natural gas .
Nuclear comes out quite well , in part because the most environmentally damaging aspect of nuclear power is uranium mining , and we do relatively little of it in the US .
The report notes , however , that there are significant uncertainties about the costs of waste storage , and the possibility of things like groundwater contamination , which could exact a staggering cost .
Renewable power sources like wind and solar have externalized costs associated with equipment production , but these were considered small enough to be essentially negligible .
Most of the heating in the US is provided by natural gas , and the costs there are also low .
However , a significant fraction comes from electricity , which helped drive the total cost for heating up to $ 1.4 billion .
Transportation
Energy - wise , the remaining segment is transportation , which comes in at $ 56 billion in health and other nonclimate damages .
Despite the wide variety of technologies considered by the report 's authors , including biofuels , compressed natural gas vehicles , and various forms of electric and hybrid cars , the cost per mile travelled is very similar .
Part of that is the fact that the energy cost of producing a vehicle is high , and plays a significant role in the lifecycle analysis .
But a significant part of the cost comes from the fact that we have yet to identify a very good oil substitute .
Electric vehicles were dragged down by the large fraction of power generated by burning coal , while biofuels were hurt by our current reliance on corn ethanol , which requires a significant energy input .
Non-corn - based fuels , which are n't currently on the market , have the potential to do significantly better .
Compressed natural gas , again due to the fact that it burns cleanly , also comes out well .
Electric and hybrid vehicles do not , primarily because their manufacturing costs are currently higher than those of regular vehicles .
At the moment , diesel is actually quite bad , but the authors point out that the US is in the process of phasing in new standards for these vehicles .
As a result , by 2030 , diesel is expected to have some of the lowest externalized costs of any transportation technology .
The climate
The authors tackled climate separately from the rest of the analysis simply because the estimates of its impact vary widely .
They tested a whole series of economic models that and fed them different assumptions for the cost of climate impacts , and found that they could differ by as much as an order of magnitude even when given a similar set of assumptions .
They also point out that these economic models do n't do well at taking into account low - probability , high - consequence events , like a sudden rise in sea level , and the discount rate involved in translating future costs into current dollars can be a source of error .
All that aside , they do provide some guidance for both current policy makers and future analyses .
For one , they point out that the costs of CO 2 emissions will continue to rise over time , as it has a long enough life span in the atmosphere to make the impacts cumulative .
They also suggest that providing an accurate measure of the costs based on ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions would be helpful , as it's possible to derive estimates based on that number .
In general , they found that a value of $ 30 / ton ( somewhere in the middle of the range of available estimates ) would give externalized costs that are roughly equal to the health costs .
Again , coal comes out very badly , given that burning it produces the most CO 2 per energy produced , while natural gas does very well .
But there is one downside to this otherwise clean power source : methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , so leaks that release it into the atmosphere are thought to account for about three percent of the US ' greenhouse gas contribution .
Given the challenges of this sort of analysis , it 's not clear that we 're at the point where we can have fine - grained estimates of how specific policy decisions will alter the externalized costs of the energy industry .
What the figures do suggest , however , is the tremendous room for improvement that can be had by targeting the small population of extremely dirty sources , like the most pollution - prone coal and gas generating plants .

With so little atmosphere there is no filtering of cosmic rays or ultraviolet light , blue sun light is not scattered , the sky is inky black , stars are visible and there 's no weather , so always bright and sunny , but very cold at - 60 to - 90 degrees Fahrenheit .
A small group of us in the Sherwood Park / Edmonton area decided to start launching high altitude balloons with experimental amateur radio payloads and nickname them BEAR ( Balloon Experiments with Amateur Radio ) after watching others do this and seeing no reason why they should have all the fun .
We are not a club or official group , but simply individual amateurs with similar interests , common goal and hope that BEAR projects , which anyone is welcome to participate in , will help promote education , experimentation & camaraderie between all amateurs and amateur radio clubs in the area .
The balloon and camera were launched at 7:44 AM , the balloon burst at 10:51 AM at 107,145 ft. and the camera landed via parachute at 11:40 AM , 89 miles from the launch site after a 3 hr. & 56 min. flight .
The camera recorded a total of 4 hrs . & 22 min. of Hi-Def Video before it stopped recording 53 secs after landing , when its 32 GB of memory was full .
The only thing better would have been if the camera had recorded for several minutes more to captured the sound of us approaching and video of us opening its container .
The camera captures a nice view of a local TV Tower at 2:50 ( min. & secs into the video ) , 3:16 and several other times .
The haze is from high humidity and it's unfortunate that the sky was n't as clear as it usually is and was for SABLE - 3 .
At 5:45 the camera is nearing 107,145 ft. where there 's basically no air to conduct sound so nothing is heard other then what vibrations are conducted through the supporting cords , Styrofoam box and camera body to the camera microphone , like the bursting of the balloon at 6:26 .
Some of the balloon remains can be seen falling past the lens at 6:27 and then the fun begins as the Styrofoam box with the camera inside is repeatedly struck by the antenna hanging below and the several pounds of latex remaining from the burst balloon as everything tumbles every which way back to earth at up to 7900 ft./ min ( 90 mph ) in the near vacuum until there 's enough air for the parachute to start functioning .
The beeping first heard at 9:13 is my car door alarm as I got out to watch the camera land and at 9:36 the camera catches those tracking it as we stand on the road and watch it pass by before landing a few seconds later .
BEAR - 4 was a balloon flight for Tomoya Kamiko from Japan who emailed on May 23rd after seeing the SABLE - 3 photos to say that he would like " to take a photograph of the space , too ! " and ask if I would help him send a Hi -Def Video Camera aloft .
Tomoya did n't know English , but was willing to learn and come to Canada to do this so how could I say no .
He did n't even have a video camera , but bought a Hi-Def one the day I agreed to help him and made travel plans to come for a balloon flight in August soon after that .

While concern over the spread of the H1N1 virus sweeps the country , epidemiologists in New York and a few other cities that were awash in swine flu last spring are detecting very little evidence of a resurgence .
Although flu season will not peak until the weather gets cold , in New York , which was the nation ’s hardest - hit city , officials say that flu activity is no higher than it normally is at this time of year and that school attendance is normal .
Last week , Dr. Anne Schuchat , the director of immunization at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said , “ Most states do have quite a lot of disease right now , and that ’s unusual for this time of year . ”
But public health officials say there appears to be a pattern of areas that had big outbreaks in the spring , like New York , Boston and Philadelphia , seeing less swine flu now .
Debates about health care are often personal .
Policy is full of statistics  mortality rates , spending per capita , cost of drugs , length of hospital stays  and full of hysterical predictions of what disasters change will bring .
But in discussing which system is best , patients turn to their own experiences and those of their families , friends and acquaintances .
People believe in the hospital and doctors where they had good outcomes ; they deplore those that have let them down .
As an American who now lives in Britain , occasionally writes about the health service , and uses public and private medicine here ( as well as back home , occasionally ) , I have seen firsthand the arguments from all sides .
Certainly , as someone who in the 1980s paid $ 333 to have an emergency room doctor at Georgetown University Hospital remove a piece of toilet paper from my ear after I had unsuccessfully tried to use it as an earplug , I applaud a system that is free .
Founded in 1948 during the grim postwar era , the National Health Service is essential to Britain ’s identity .
But Britons grouse about it , almost as a national sport .
Among their complaints : it rations treatment ; it forces people to wait for care ; it favors the young over the old ; its dental service is rudimentary at best ; its hospitals are crawling with drug - resistant superbugs .
All these things are true , sometimes , up to a point .
The N.H.S. is great at emergency care , and great at pediatric care .
My children have enjoyed thorough treatment for routine matters  vaccines , eye tests and the like .
A friend who had cancer received the same drugs and the same treatment , I was assured , as she would have in the United States .
When , heartbreakingly , she died , her family was not left with tens of thousands of dollars of outstanding bills , or with the prospect of long , bitter fights with hardened insurance companies .
But there are limits .
Without an endless budget , the N.H.S. does have to ration care , by deciding , for instance , whether drugs that might add a few months to the life of a terminal cancer patient are worth the money .
Its hospitals are not always clean .
It is bureaucratic .
Its doctors and nurses are overworked .
Patients sometimes are treated as if they were supplicants rather than consumers .
Women in labor are advised to bring their own infant ’s diapers and their own cleaning products to the hospital .
Sick people routinely have to wait for tests or for treatment .
Culver City , California —
“ I feel like we are starting to be where we should be , ” said Celia Pearce , Festival Chair of Indiecade 2009 before an intimate gathering of independent game developers , graphics artists and publishers at the The Rush restaurant in Culver City , California as the international independent games festival wrapped up Sunday , October 4th .
Osmos has a long list of critically favorable acclamation including top marks from IGN and IndieGames.com among others .
The game can add another notch in its belt as the winner of the Indiecade award for Game of the Year .
The Canadian - made ambient osmotic space shooter was developed by Hemisphere Games , led by Eddy Boxerman , who spent several years at Ubisoft working on the Splinter Cell franchise .
Congratulations to the Osmos team .
Audience Choice and Finalists Votes Unanimous
This year both the main prize and the first runner up for both The People ’s Choice Award and the Finalists ’
Choice Awards were unanimously voted in both categories .
The first runner up went to The Deep Sleep Initiative from developer Arx ( Tracy Kobedo Brown , Nicole Epps , Karin Ray , Hee Jun Kim , Brad Michael and Allison Theus ) , an experimental , casual alternative reality game ( “ ARG ” ) designed to lead players on a journey through a cross-media landscape .
Using a collection of fifty - one individually unique , hand - crafted journals , the game steers players to a variety of websites to paint an original world wherein every area the player uncovers brings them closer to solving the final mystery .
First place in People ’s Choice and Finalists ’ vote went to Minor Battle ( lead designer Andre Clark , producer Drew Moxon ) , an innovative capture - the - flag scenario wherein team members , who can switch from tank to defender to runner on the fly , attempt to carry a bomb , like a football , in order to drop it on the opponents key targets .
What makes the gameplay so interesting is that it is designed to be played on multiple screens .
To clarify : this is not an online multiplayer game per se , but rather a live multiplayer action game comprising four outward facing screens in a box configuration that display a contiguous playing field that forces the participants to move around the perimeter in order to follow their avatar and lay waste to the complete landscape .
We asked the team how they saw this positioned in the marketplace and they implied that it would be best suited for public gaming areas like cinemas or theme parks .
Though effectively a prototype , anyone who could pony up for a set of four 22 ″ wide screen LCD ’s could easily set this up at home .
The Singularity and a New Model For the Indie Game Label
At the end of the ceremony , in an interesting twist , Jesse Vigil of Psychic Bunny and Indiecade Festival Director Sam Roberts along with Celia Pearce ( Festival Chair ) announced a partnership venture to form The Singularity – a new independent game label .
We spoke briefly with Sam about the announcement and asked if he felt any affinity with SubPop and its model for releasing indie music in the early 1990’s .
“ We plan on following the Motown label template wherein talented artists worked on a salary and participated in the revenue share but in this case would keep 100 % of their intellectual property .
The idea is to work almost as an A&R function , finding the most promising young developers and aligning them with [ the equivalent of what would have then been ] the best recording engineers and producers . ”
The the bread has just gone into the proverbial oven , The Singularity plans on releasing two to four titles per year .
More than 90,000 innocent people have been added to the national DNA database since a landmark human rights ruling that keeping indefinitely the profiles of unconvicted suspects was illegal , according to new figures .
The disclosure comes as the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) is pressing the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) to withdraw guidance to chief constables to carry on collecting DNA profiles of innocent people .
It says it will take enforcement action if the chief constables fail to act .
Liberal Democrat research , based on parliamentary answers , shows that 433 , 752 profiles have been added to the DNA database since the ruling by the European court of human rights in Strasbourg on 5 December last year – the equivalent of 1,480 a day .
So far only 611 profiles of people who have been arrested but not convicted of any crime have been removed from the database after individual challenges to chief constables .
The Liberal Democrats say by applying a 2008 Home Office estimate that 20.8 % of people on the database are innocent to the current total of 4.8 million it is possible to estimate that the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people are being retained .
This includes an estimated 90,220 added since the ruling .
Jenny Willott , the Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokeswoman , said : " It is appalling that the government has allowed over a million people to be added to the DNA database .
Despite the European ruling that the practice is a breach of human rights , for every innocent DNA profile removed from the database , around 150 new ones are added . "
She said the government 's proposals to limit the storage of innocent people 's DNA for up to 12 years had been slated by experts , forcing ministers into an embarrassing climbdown in Parliament .
" The Home Office needs to put an end to this scandal by removing all innocent people from the database once and for all , " said Willott .
The EHRC has given ACPO 28 days to confirm that the advice to chief constables will be withdrawn and replaced by advice that complies with the law .
If ACPO fails to do this , the commission will consider taking formal enforcement action .
John Wadham , the commission 's legal director , said : " We can see no reason now why ACPO should not change its guidance on the retention of DNA .
The commission recognises that ACPO had been put in a difficult position by the government by this issue , which is why we are offering them the opportunity now to amend their advice and avert future legal action .
" The police are at the forefront of the fight against crime .
The importance of this fight cannot be underestimated but it should comply with the government 's legal obligation to protect the privacy of innocent people , as outlined by the European court . "
The Home Office said earlier this month it was withdrawing a proposal for the retention of DNA profiles from people arrested but not convicted .
Ministers said they wanted to keep the profiles of innocent people for between six and 12 years depending on the seriousness of the offence .
The measure was dropped from the policing and crime bill when it faced the threat of defeat in the House of Lords .
Ministers have said they will bring forward a new proposal after next month 's Queen 's speech .
If there is one thing the world needs right now it ’s another reminder of what happened between Kanye West and Taylor Swift at last Sunday ’s MTV Video Music Awards .
Thank goodness Jack
White is willing to put it all on the line and give the public what it wants , nah , needs .
During a premiere of The White Stripes documentary “ Under Great White Northern Lights ” at the Toronto International Film Festival , White “ pulled a Kanye ” while the film ’s director , Emmett Malloy , was giving a post - feature Q&A .
Dressed all in black , save for white sneakers ,
White interrupted Malloy and grabbed the microphone saying , “ I ’m gonna let you finish , I ’m gonna let you finish , but Orson Welles made one of the greatest films of all time ! ”
White is a fan of Orson Welles and included lines from Welles ’ masterwork , Citizen Kane , in the song “ The Union Forever . ”
The documentary follows the band on its 2007 tour of Canada where the duo played every province in the the country culminating with a gig in Nova Scotia , which happened to be the band ’s tenth anniversary show .

Todays paper contains a great quote attributed to Jascha Heifetz :
No matter what side of an argument you re on , you always find some people on your side that you wish were on the other side .
But according to Heifetzs official website , the actual quote is :
No matter what side of an argument you re on , you always find some people on your side that wish you were on the other side .
Equally true , but a somewhat different flavour .
Not all Americans crave convenience over security .
A new survey by tech systems consulting firm Unisys and Leiberman Research found 93 % of 583 respondents open to the notion of using fingerprinting to confirm their identities and secure their data .
Some 58 % of those polled by Unisys said they would be willing to provide biometric data to merchants and financial institutions to verify their identity .
This includes retinal and perhaps even vascular scanning , akin to this system used to control access to the Port of Halifax .
“ We believe that Americans are receptive to biometrics because of legitimate fear about misuse of personal information and pervasive risk of identity theft and identity fraud , ” says Mark Cohn , Unisys Vice President of Enterprise Security .
“ There is a growing awareness that biometric technology in a well - designed system can offer the highest levels of identity protection . ”
Public responds to pain points
Americans are beginning to grasp how easy it is for cyber criminals to obtain usernames and passwords and use them to access our banking , social network , free Web mail and other online accounts .
This realization has been agonizingly slow in developing .
But another poll out this week shows that the pain points are being felt .
Some 81 % of the 1,003 respondents surveyed by The Chertoff Group and Penn , Schoen & Berland said they were concerned about the security of their personal data online , with 54 percent indicating they were “ very concerned . ”
“ The poll findings paint a troubling picture , with profound implications for online innovators and the broader technology community for years to come , ” says the Chertoff Group ’s namesake , Michael Chertoff , former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under Pres .
Bush .
Budding public outcry
Last Watchdog is hopeful that these polls could signal budding public outcry to slow down the headlong rush by the financial services industry , aided and abetted by tech companies , to advance the use of convenient Web services , without fully addressing the security implications .
It may be that a critical mass of consumers wo n’t remain oblivious to rising cyber risks much longer .
Less than 1 - in - 10 respondents to the Chertoff poll said they trust Web mail providers , private companies and online brokerages .
The poll found that regional banks and healthcare providers , for the now , are deemed most trustworthy , but only about 30 percent of the respondents said they placed trust in these top- ranking organizations .
The Chertoff Poll also found that Americans are :
Highly concerned about the security of their personal data online .
Unfamiliar with and concerned about many new technologies .
Willing to accept more limited capabilities in return for greater security
“ The more that the public understands their exposure , the more challenging it will be for companies to convince customers that their personal data is secure , ” says Chertoff .
“ Those companies that demonstrate their commitment and competence in consumer security first will have the advantage in the 21st century . ”
President Mark Penn , President of Penn , Schoen & Berlan , says that as Americans move more and more of their lives online “ the companies that prioritize providing effective , reliable , and understandable security measures will have the chance to create powerful relationships with consumers . ”
Convenience is n’t everything .

Sacré bleu , or rather , sacré rose .
Has President Nicolas Sarkozy gone all soft and squashy and lefty on us ?
But worst of all , has he gone French on us ?
The French President was elected two years ago with the endorsement of the right - wing , never - wrong pundits of the Anglo - Saxon media .
Here – enfin !
– was a sensible kind of French politician , an anti-Chirac , a French Thatcher .
Here was the man who would make France work harder ; here was the man who would dismantle the fat and slothful French state ; here was the man who would make France more like Britain or the US .
Consternation and mockery , therefore , among the massed ranks of Anglo - Saxon punditry last week .
President Sarkozy had suggested that the world should ( hee , hee ) be more like France .
Instead of measuring national well - being and political success wholly in terms of money and growth , Sarko suggested , the world should devise a new " happiness index " , an internationally approved barometer of " joie de vivre " .
How silly .
How impractical .
How French .

But hang on just a moment .
What if Sarko is on to something important ?
It was always foolish to regard Nicolas Sarkozy as a French Thatcher .
Sarkozyisme , or Sarkonomics , was always a ragbag of left and right influences ; both pro-market and pro-big government ; in favour of trade and protectionism ; promoting both laissez - faire and interventionism or , rather , activism .
What the President chiefly believes in is being seen to do things ; being seen to have new ideas .
His only core ideology seems to be his belief in his own legend as a pragmatic man of action ; a man who gets things done .
In truth , his record as the all - action " omnipresident " , approaching the half - way point in his term , is muddled .
Reforms of education , the state , and healthcare have been partially sensible , partially blunted or abandoned and nowhere near as radical as Mr Sarkozy 's supporters ( and , helpfully to him , his opponents ) claim .
But there is a courageous pragmatic side to Nicolas Sarkozy that can be refreshing , even inspiring .
He is willing to state the obvious .
He is willing to be self - contradictory .
He is willing to challenge the comfortable , unthinking rules on which national , and international , institutions have always run the world and , arguably , run the world into the ground .
The dogma of economic " growth " , Mr Sarkozy suggests , is no longer sustainable .
It has to be broadened into a new measure of political success and national achievement that takes account of the quality of ordinary lives and our professed desire to save the planet from environmental disaster .
Twenty months ago – before a global economic crisis driven by the god of short - term growth – Mr Sarkozy set up a commission of 20 economists .
They were asked to report back on ways of changing the statistical currency beloved of the OECD , the EU and all national governments ; in other words , how to replace Gross Domestic Product with some new measure : Gross Domestic Happiness or Gross Domestic Contentment .
This idea was mocked as unforgivably quaint and foolish , especially in the United States , and especially by the high priests of Wall Street .
And yet the US Declaration of Independence lists the " pursuit of happiness " as an " inalienable right " of mankind .
There is no mention of the pursuit of GDP .
The committee of economists , led by Joseph Stiglitz from the United States , reported back last week .
President Sarkozy chose to receive – and endorse – the report one year to the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
Let us be technical for a moment .
The commission 's proposal is that GDP should be replaced by a broader measure based on something called Net National Product ( NNP ) , which takes account not just of annual growth but the value , and depreciation , of all of a nation 's human and physical resources .
The Stiglitz commission , and Mr Sarkozy , suggest that this should be broadened even further into an internationally accepted index of national achievement that would embrace the state of the environment , the equality of incomes , the quality of public services , free services provided within a family or community and even opinion polls on the contentment of ordinary citizens .
It has been suggested that France would thrive in such an international league table .
Hence President Sarkozy 's interest in changing the rules before he goes for re-election in 2012 .
In truth , France would score well on public services but not on contentment polls .
The irascible French always give excessively gloomy answers to pollsters .
If the world is to make a true recovery from the crash of 2008 - 09 , Mr Sarkozy says it must change the definitions of economic and political success .
If the world is to reduce its emissions of carbon , it cannot endlessly demand increased economic growth .
The " cult " of growth and the " cult " of the market must be replaced by a new " politics of civilisation " .
This , of course , is the same Sarko who came to power promising that he would make the French " work harder and earn more " .
It is the same Sarko who has pushed through legislation which will allow more French shops to open on Sundays .
France was aghast this week at a plague of office suicides at France Telecom , allegedly produced by the introduction of more brutal , non-French methods of business management .
In truth working in French offices – selfish , hierarchical and anti-youth – has always been a nightmare .
Mr Sarkozy 's happiness index is fraught with other contradictions .
Developing countries will see his ideas as another wheeze to deny them the right to rise to the level of developed nations .
The underlying philosophy may be green and progressive , but poorer citizens of rich nations would be first to feel the pain if low - growth politics began to destroy jobs .
All the same , the questions raised are important ones .
Brutal definitions of success produce a brutal world .
Nicolas Sarkozy deserves to be heard , not mocked .
Pakistanis make up the majority on the Glodwick estate just west of the town centre .
Some youths speak the language of racial hatred .
It 's not clear whether this is bravado but their message is blunt ... white people keep out .
Many openly admit to carrying out what they see as revenge attacks on white people as part of a tit - for - tat campaign .
One told us : " There are signs all around saying whites enter at your risk .
It 's a matter of revenge .
It 's about giving as good as you can take . "
Another had a six - inch scar running across his head .
He said he had been attacked by a white gang .
" I got slashed by some whites so that I 'm totally racist .
I do n't like whites .
It 's like this now , we go to a white area and we get done over .
It 's like them coming here they get done over ... it 's for your own good . "
This hardening in attitude is repeated across the town and has passed down to children as young as 10 .
Unlike their parents they will not tolerate being victims of racism .
Local white people are scared and many want to leave the estates but cannot .
" I was just walking with my dog around 10 at night and a group of Asian youths in their car , music blaring , threatening me like saying they 'd kick me head in calling me white bastard , white scum .
You 're frightened , " one person told me .
Many Asian youths say they take the law into their own hands because they have no confidence in the police .
The perception is that the police do not take racist attacks on Asian people as seriously as assualts on white residents .
Akbor Khan had his three front teeth smashed in a brutal attack by a white gang :
" I used to have a take away in Manchester .
We used to get lots of people who used to order food but not pay for it .
It used to take the police an hour to get there .
We 'd ring the police and they 'd say we have n't got the manpower .
But if it happened to white people they would be there in 10 minutes , " he said .
Many Asian community leaders say the trouble is caused by a minority stoking up problems for the majority , who are law abiding residents .
They say they would happily support greater police action to clamp down on the trouble makers .
Greater Manchester Police deny the accusations levelled at them .
A special multi-agency task force has been set up in Oldham to tackle the growing number of racist attacks
Zooey Deschanel has been melting hearts now for almost a decade , since her supporting role in Cameron Crowe 's Almost Famous , her second film after debuting in quirky comedy Mumford with Hope Davis and Jason Lee in 1999 .
Proving herself today as a worthy heart - breaker in her new movie ( 500 ) Days of Summer , she 's excited to be twisting traditional male / female casting so that she 's the one wearing the pants in the relationship .
Joseph Gordon - Levitt 's
Tom is left licking his wounds after her character , Summer , dumps him .
The remarkable thing is that , according to US box - office statistics , male audiences actually seem to enjoy their long overdue comeuppance .

" We all know guys who 've had their hearts broken in real life ; we just do n't usually see it in the movies , " Deschanel agrees .
" I know , like , 10 of these guys ! "
Despite a string of high - profile roles in The Happening , Yes Man and The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , Deschanel is still considered an indie girl , and this is the kind of delicious role that Hollywood usually reserves for its top - dollar leading ladies .
Still pinching herself that first - time director Marc Webb even cast her in Summer , which has since turned out to be one of the most critically praised movies of the year , she says : " I was so very flattered .
To be honest , its not the way I think of myself .
But if he 'd picked one of those girls , you know , one of those beauty girls – those actresses of whom everything thinks , ' Oh my God , she 's just so amazingly beautiful ' , and that 's their thing – I do n't think it would have worked .
Because this is partially romanticising a little bit of quirkiness , which I feel is one of the interesting things about the movie .
Summer is such a fascinating character because she 's seen entirely from Tom 's perspective as this ideal woman , when she 's actually just a smart , interesting girl with her own set of problems .
I 've personally never wanted to be ' the babe ' , and refuse to let vanity get in the way of my acting because I do n't see my job as being a beautiful person , " she insists .
If we 've all heard countless stories about actors actively soliciting roles , Deschanel laughs at the notion she might have gone after this part : " I never go after roles .
Ever .
It never , ever works for me .
I was so excited when I read the script because it 's so rare to see a romantic comedy that 's really fresh and different .
It felt like a new way of telling a story we think we 've all seen before .
But Marc had an idea of the film he wanted from the beginning , and I think I was part of that – he just had to go about convincing people to cast me , or let him cast me ! " she laughs .
" I 've never pursued a role .
I always hear stories about actors going after parts and I 'm , like , ' How do they do that ? '
It seems so weird .
It seems like a total myth or something .
" I 've always been really picky about roles and make a point of reminding myself that it's not about the money – because , obviously , there 's a lot of money to be made in this business if you 're willing to do anything . "
Talking about the role reversal in ( 500 ) Days of Summer , she says : " I do n't think it has anything to do with gender specifically .
I think it 's more that , with our generation , those gender roles are n't something that really apply anymore .
There are lots of guys who get heartbroken and lots of girls who are cynical about it .
Another thing this movie says is that , just because love does n't last , it does n't mean it does n't have value .
You will discover things about yourself if you 're being romantic even if it does n't last .
Love can mean a lot of different things .
" Fear of losing it is the dark side , but the wonderful side is the feeling that you get when you fall in love .
Everyone has the heart - break that shapes them in such a way that they could never go back to the innocence that they had before .
Today there 's a lot of polarisation of points of view .
People are either very cynical or overly romantic about love .
Like somebody 's in love one day , and then the next day , they 're totally out of love – and I think that 's sort of a new thing . "
Despite the fact Deschanel , 29 , has been engaged the past year to the indie rocker Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie , she 's thoughtful when asked if she believes in love at first sight : " I believe everything is out there .
Love is such a universally appealing theme .
It just depends on your point of view .
In some way , it exists in thought form .
If it has a name , then you are creating it .
I think people who try to force a relationship that 's not happening are just insane . "
However , she has clearly given some thought to what is romantic and what is n't – and Twitter , Facebook and internet dating definitely fall into the latter category : " They just do n't seem romantic to me .
I think there are great things about the internet , and there are great things about being able to connect with people quickly , but I also think it 's strange to have your taste in music , and the movies and books you like be your calling card .
I like this music , and I 'm in this mood , and all that stuff , has nothing to do with who you are as a human being .
It 's just not so interesting to me . "
The daughter of the Oscar - nominated cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel and the actress Mary Jo Weir , she was named after Zooey Glass from J D Salinger 's novella Franny and Zooey .
Together with her elder sister , Emily – presently starring in the television series Bones – they were educated at Santa Monica 's artsy Crossroads School , whose alumni include Kate Hudson , Jake Gyllenhaal and Jack Black .
" Our parents gave us advice all the time which , of course , we ignored .
Ultimately they encouraged my sister and I do to what we love to do and do what we want to do , so that started us off with a sense of ' Do this because you love it ' , not ' Do this because you want to be famous ' . "
Ever the rebel , she quit theatre studies at Chicago 's Northwestern University after seven months : " I started working before I entered as a freshman , and it was difficult to deal with all the petty politics there .
You had to be good at kissing up , which I 'm really bad at , " she admits .
( 500 ) Days of Summer has received enormous critical praise in the US , but a USA Today critic Claudia Puig went one step further , claiming that it captures the same contemporary romantic sensibilities as Annie Hall did for a previous generation .
Delighted by such comparisons , Deschanel says : " In terms of style icons , I 've always really liked Diane Keaton because she 's totally herself and [ in her ] you see a person who is n't looking to anyone else .
She 's just saying ' I want to wear menswear , ' or ' I want to wear this really long peasant skirt to the Oscars ' .
She 's somebody who 's just completely expressing herself .
In the same way , I feel my choice of clothes helps project who I am on the inside , which I think is the best way to use them – to show how I 'm feeling on any given day . "
However , she 's none too thrilled by those critics who liken her eclectic style – not to mention her signature black hair and bright blue eyes – to the pop starlet Katy Perry : " I do n't really have an opinion on it , I guess .
I think we both have ... hair , " she frowns .
A singer and musician for as long as she 's been acting , her dual careers often overlap .
While crediting her singing skills as one of the main reasons she was cast as a department store singer opposite Will Ferrell in Elf , she also sang in the Disney TV movie , Once Upon a Mattress .
Tease her that singing is perhaps a contractual requirement , and she pouts : " I try to avoid it .
I 'm very sceptical of it because it has happened a lot of times like , ' Would n't it be cool if you could sing ...'
They always feel they need to figure out an opportunity for me to sing .
You really do n't , unless it 's a musical , because it gets complicated , as you have to sing in character , and somebody has something to say about how you sing .
But , for Summer , all I had to do was karaoke , " says the actress , who last year earned rave reviews for her debut album , She & Him : Volume 1 , made in collaboration with M Ward , as well as appearing in videos for Jimmy Fallon 's " Idiot Boyfriend " and The Offspring 's " She 's Got Issues " .
While largely spurning what she describes as pop music , she jokes how her first album was Madonna 's Like A Virgin : " It was during the time of the problems with Iran , and I thought she was saying , ' Like a Persian ' ! "
A fan of Ella Fitzgerald , the Beach Boys and Marianne Faithfull , Deschanel plays the piano , banjo , xylophone and baritone ukulele , and has been performing with the cabaret act , If All the Stars Were Pretty Babies , since 2001 .
Previously dismissive of fellow actors launching musical careers on the back of their day jobs , she says : " For the longest time , I thought that any actor who released an album must be the biggest fool ever but , having been a singer all my life , I 've now changed that opinion .
No one gives musicians any flack for becoming actors , so I do n't see any problem in it working in the opposite direction . "
'( 500 ) Days of Summer ' opens on 2 September
DNA has quickly become the bedrock of modern law enforcement - as anyone who 's watched CSI will know .
It 's enough to make up the minds of the courts , and to convince the British government to put millions of people into its database .
Suddenly things look a lot shakier , however , after scientists discovered ways to fabricate saliva and blood samples - and even DNA evidence itself , given the right information .
The New York Times reports research into falsified results , which appear staggeringly easy - particularly for those with access to an original record ( even if not genetic material ) .
The killer quote , from the paper 's co-author , Dan Frumkin : " You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this " .
It 's certainly not enough to destroy DNA evidence entirely , but you can bet that thousands of defence lawyers are rubbing their hands at the chance to discredit crime scene evidence in front of juries around the globe .
The Norwegians call it kveis , meaning “ the uneasiness following debauchery . ”
The medical term is veisalgia ( algia is Greek for “ pain ” ) .
We call it a hangover .
While the Annals of Internal Medicine says , “ There is no consensus definition of veisalgia , ” most of us know it when we see it .
Alcohol is a diuretic , and most symptoms of overimbibing are a result of dehydration .
Under these circumstances , the brain shrinks away from the skull and the blood vessels in the head expand , causing headaches .
The body ’s capillaries shrink , leading to mild hypothermia , or that clammy feeling .
Dehydration starts as you digest that first drink , but other effects begin several hours later , as the alcohol makes its way through the small intestine ( hello , nausea ) .
Alcohol breaks down into acetaldehyde , which the body attempts to expel because it ’s toxic .
Fat builds up in the liver , which swells , reducing blood flow and preventing toxins from being flushed from the body .
And finally , alcohol inhibits the synthesis of glutamate , one of the body ’s stimulants .
At first , this inhibition makes the imbiber feel nice and mellow , but as the alcohol wears off , the body overcompensates for the lack of glutamine by producing more of it .
This prevents deep sleep and can cause early - morning insomnia .
None of this leads to much motivation to get up on time the morning after .
According to research published in 1998 in the journal Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research , hangovers cost the U.S. economy $ 148 billion annually in absenteeism and poor job performance , but they have led to some creative hangover “ cures . ”
One recent study published in the British Medical Journal concluded , sadly , “ No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover . ”
Some treatments , however , can assuage the pain .
Here are some you might try .
1. Painkillers .
Duh , right ?
Not so fast :
There are some caveats .
First , make sure the painkiller is n’t acetaminophen , which , according to the FDA , can cause liver damage in combination with alcohol .
Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium are better , but can cause stomach bleeding and lead to kidney damage if used long term ( longer than two weeks ) .
Aspirin , taken with milk and food , may be the best over - the - counter option , but it can also cause stomach bleeding when used long term in combination with alcohol .
And do n’t take it before you drink :
As Stephen Braun mentions in his book , Buzz : The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine ( Oxford University Press , 2001 ) , studies have shown that taking aspirin before drinking can increase the rapidity of intoxication , especially in women .
“ In one study , ” Braun notes , “ the average blood alcohol levels of subjects who had consumed alcohol an hour after ingesting two Maximum Bayer aspirin tablets were 26 percent higher than subjects who consumed ethanol without first taking aspirin . ”
2. Water .
Common sense says that if alcohol causes dehydration , then water is the cure .
But not too much water , which can lead to hyponatremia , or “ water intoxication , ” which dilutes the sodium in the body and can be fatal .
The standard guideline of 12 eight - ounce glasses a day should be adequate for rehydration .
Fruit juice may be a better option because it contains fructose , which may speed up the rate at which the body rids itself of toxins .
3. Taurine .
A common ingredient in energy drinks and also available in supplement form , taurine has been shown in studies to reverse liver damage caused by a night of heavy drinking , helping the body to flush out toxins more quickly — so you can imbibe that Red Bull and vodka and feel a little smug about it .
The high amounts of caffeine in energy drinks also help to constrict cerebral blood vessels , alleviating that headache the next day ; however , caffeine is a diuretic and may exacerbate dehydration .
Meat , poultry , eggs , dairy products , and fish are other good sources of taurine .
4. Pedialyte .
Yes , it ’s for babies that have diarrhea .
Yes , that might be exactly what you feel like after drinking to excess .
In liquid or in “ freezer pop ” form , Pedialyte contains more electrolytes than Powerade or Gatorade , rehydrating you more quickly .
Enough hangovers , and you may even develop a preference for fruit , grape , or bubble gum flavor ( Pedialyte also comes in unflavored liquid ) .
5. Fried food .
Even if there were n’t evidence to back up the benefits of a greasy breakfast , it would qualify as a hangover treatment simply because it ’s so comforting .
But two elements of a fried breakfast have some scientific backing : Both egg yolks and garlic contain cysteine , an amino acid that binds and neutralizes acetaldehyde .
All those carbohydrates help stabilize blood sugar and neutralize stomach acids .
6. Marmite or Vegemite on toast .
Made from brewer ’s yeast , Marmite and Vegemite both contain vitamin B complex , folic acid , and salt , all of which are depleted after alcohol consumption .
Despite rumors to the contrary , Vegemite is not banned in the U.S. , but it can be hard to find in stores .
It is easily ordered online .
7. Ginger .
A long - trusted anti-nausea treatment , ginger has also been shown to be a powerful antioxidant and anticoagulant .
Whether taken in pill form , in tea , or in a juice , it may counteract some of that hungover wooziness .
A 2001 study published in Obstetrics & Gynecology showed that ginger counteracted nausea and vomiting in pregnant women , and if it can combat morning sickness , it can deal with a little morning - after sickness , right ?
Be aware : Fresh ginger can irritate the stomach lining , so it should never be taken straight on an empty stomach .
8 . Soups such as menudo , haejangguk , pho , or borscht .
Soups hold an honored place as hangover cures in many countries , with various ingredients , such as tomatoes , cabbage , and tripe , ascribed medicinal qualities .
Medicine or no medicine , soup will certainly rehydrate the dehydrated , pump up the protein and blood sugar levels , and slow the rate of alcohol absorption .
The vegetables will offer some nutrition , and the heat and spices will make you sweat , releasing toxins .
9. Honey .
Like fruit juice , honey has a lot of fructose and glucose , and it ’s full of antioxidants , which , according to London ’s Royal Society of Chemistry , makes it the ideal hangover remedy , spread on toast .
In Poland , they mix the honey into a little pickle juice .
( The salt replenishes electrolytes . )
Yum .
10 . Hangover pills .
Classified as dietary supplements ( so they ’re not regulated ) and sold under names like Sob ’r - K Hangover Stopper , Soberfast , RU - 21 , Rebound , and Uncle Rummie ’s Hangover Helper , these hangover treatments mostly rely on pharmaceutical - grade activated carbon or charcoal , which can be used to treat alcohol poisoning .
Although no independent studies have been done , some people swear by them .
Others point out that the pills contain so little activated charcoal that they may well have no effect .
Ever since the U.S. troop surge in Iraq put a lid on the boiling sectarian cauldron , counter - insurgency has been the talk of the town ( at least , the particular town that cares about this sort of thing ) .
The debate over American strategy in Afghanistan has brought counter - insurgency warfare into even sharper focus , as the Obama administration mulls a massive influx of American troops to bolster General Stanley McChrystal 's proposed strategy there .
Unlike conventional warfare , where destroying the enemy and his fighting capacity is the order of the day , counter - insurgency is " population - centric . "
It aims , in the words of Marine Corps Gen. James E. Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to make the civilian population and its attitude the main determinant of success or failure .
In testimony before Congress , General Cartwright noted that " one of our key metrics for success [ in Afghanistan ] will be over the next few months to see whether or not there is a shift in the attitude of the local residents . "
This recognition - that the attitudes of a population matter - is central to any successful counter - insurgency .
When the population hates America , our job is harder .
When it likes , or at least tolerates the United States , our job is easier .
In Iraq , it was only when Sunni Arab attitudes towards al - Qaeda shifted did they switch sides to aid coalition forces .
The strategy sketched out by General McChrystal for Afghanistan similarly prizes the attitudes of local Afghans and seeks to pull opportunistic Taliban from the hard core of implacable zealots .
Yet for all the focus on Afghanistan , there is a larger and perhaps more urgent question : can ( or should ) America apply the principles of counter - insurgency to the global insurgency that is Islamic terrorism ?
After all , Iraq 's Sunni tribes - much like the Taliban in Afghanistan - are second - order threats .
Both took up arms against American forces because we were ( and remain ) on their territory ; not out of any ideological commitment to destroying America .
The real threat to American lives and interests are transnational terrorists aligned with Osama bin Laden ; who are either based in the West and lured to jihad or , like the Saudi 9/11 hijackers , are willing to travel into the West to attack us .
Even if the U.S. were able to mollify the Afghan Taliban much the way it mollified Iraq 's Sunnis , we would still face a very serious threat from people such as 24 year old Najibullah Zazi ( a legal U.S. resident since 1999 who was recently arrested on allegations he was planning to attack mass transit hubs ) , or Abdulla Ahmed Ali , the London - born jihadist who was recently convicted for an attempt to blow up multiple transatlantic airliners in flight .
Yet if the dictates of counter - insurgency point to the necessity of winning hearts and minds , the challenge in applying these lessons to a global insurgency is infinitely more complex .
While the U.S. was able to placate Iraq 's Sunnis with cash and political accommodation ( scaling back de-Baathification , urging the Shiite - led government to provide a greater role for the Sunnis ) , finding an accommodation with the Middle East and radicalized Muslims in the West would be far more difficult .
The problem is simple : the very policies that tend to drive radical recruitment are the ones the U.S. will almost certainly never change .
America 's overt military presence in the Persian Gulf , its support for autocratic regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt and its tight alliance with the state of Israel are all well established elements of American foreign policy .
They enjoy bipartisan support .
Yet time and again , opinion polling in the Middle East reveals that these are the policies that have turned the population of the Middle East against the United States .
In a wide ranging survey of predominantly Muslim countries , WorldPublicOpinion.org and the University of Maryland found that " large majorities agree with al - Qaeda 's goal of pushing the United States to remove its military forces from all Muslim countries and substantial numbers , in some cases majorities , approve of attacks on U.S. troops in Muslim countries . "
Even the newly minted Nobel Laureate has not turned back the tide of Islamic antipathy .
According to a recent report from Pew Research , President Obama " receives more negative reviews than positive ones in places such as Lebanon , Egypt , Jordan and the Palestinian territories .
And in Pakistan ... only 13 % believe Obama will do the right thing in international affairs . "
If those urging a robust counter - insurgency effort in Afghanistan are to be believed , only a substantial effort to turn the tide of Muslim opinion can truly secure the United States from the broader threat of Islamic radicalism .
Just as the attitude and perception of Afghan civilians is the " center of gravity " for a counter - insurgency strategy in Afghanistan , so too the opinions and perceptions of Muslims in the Middle East and in Europe must be the center of gravity for a global counter - insurgency .
For now , however , the U.S. has chosen to meet the global threat of Islamic radicalism with what some would dub ( in the Afghan context ) a " narrow counter - terrorism " approach .
We use intelligence to pick off al - Qaeda operatives on the battlefield , or police and investigative work to derail plots already set in motion , while mostly ignoring the psychological and political milieu from which radicalization occurs .
To date , though , such an approach has been fairly effective .
Terrorists have managed to kill scores in Europe ( Madrid and London ) but have yet to reprise a 9/11 - scale atrocity inside the United States .
While al - Qaeda is infamously known for spacing its attacks out over several years , it has also been faced with unprecedented pressure since 9/11 .
U.S. and allied efforts may have permanently crippled al - Qaeda 's ability to launch mass casualty attacks on American interests .
( Of course , if that 's true , it would severely undermine the counter - insurgent 's case for a stepped up commitment to Afghanistan ) .
On the other hand , we may simply be in a lull before the next massacre .
Unfortunately , we wo n't know until it 's too late .
What we do know is that technology will only advance , allowing smaller groups of individuals to perpetrate ever more lethal attacks .
The Internet ensures that even if physical safe havens such as Afghanistan become inhospitable , like - minded holy warriors can still find support and perhaps technical training in " virtual safe havens . "
We know too that while targeted military action and investigative work can yield tactical successes , America could well remain behind the strategic curve if broad swaths of the Middle East or pockets of Western Europe 's Muslim community remains sympathetic to bin Laden 's narrative .
Ironically - while there is a broad cross-section of elite opinion willing to countenance a truly massive investment in Afghanistan to win ordinary Afghans away from the Taliban - there is scant discussion , much less the political will , to embark on a strategic reorientation of America 's Middle East policy and apply some basic precepts of counter - insurgency to that wellspring of jihadism .
Indeed , it 's just the opposite .
As the centrifuges spin in Iran 's nuclear facilities , America will likely double - down on the very policies the region finds so objectionable - strengthening its military presence in the Gulf and entrenching its defense relationships with the region 's autocracies and with Israel .
In such an environment , all we can do is hope that Washington stays at the top of its tactical game .
As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld frequently observed , the U.S. has to be lucky 100 percent of the time but the terrorists only need to get lucky once .
That being the case , it would be far better for the U.S. if there were fewer terrorists .

I enjoy tales about well - bred chaps behaving badly .
I treasure the story of a dinner in a Pall Mall club in 1905 , during which the august members at the long tables – spurred by some trivial and wholly forgotten dispute – began throwing bread rolls at each other .
As the food fight escalated , one of the dining - room ’s 18th - century windows was broken by a poorly - aimed cruet .
When the club secretary remonstrated , like a housemaster upbraiding the rowdy fifth form , a bearded clubman assured him , “ It ’s nothing to do with me .
I ’ve thrown nothing stronger than jelly all evening . ”
It ’s traditional for posh , violent dimwits to refuse to take any blame .
In Evelyn Waugh ’s Decline and Fall , the Bollinger Club , who smash the windows of Scone College , Oxford , and de-bag Paul Pennyfeather in the quad , get off with a small fine , while Paul takes the blame and is kicked out .
I expect the rowing - club rowdies who used to invade Oscar Wilde ’s Oxford rooms in the 1870s , to smash up his famous blue china , knew they were part of literary history but never came forward to claim it .
So it ’s interesting to hear the responses from David Cameron and Boris Johnson to the nation ’s current interest in their membership of the Bullingdon Club in the 1980s .
Johnson was unembarrassed about his exploits , or “ events that might charitably be described as high jinks ” , as he calls them .
What annoys him is the suggestion that he did not wind up in the cells for a night .
A TV programme tomorrow night will re-create the evening of drunken revelry that culminated in broken glass and police sirens – but some nasty people have suggested it ’s all fabrication .
“ Those who say I was not in the cells are mistaken , ” he told the Sunday papers .
How dare you , sir !
How dare you suggest that I did not spend several hours in the nick ?
I shall sue !

David Cameron , by contrast , writhes with embarrassment about the photograph of him and Boris posing languidly with the Club on some Oxford college steps .
“ We do things when we are young that we deeply regret , ” he told Andrew Marr .
But you just know it is n’t membership of the club he regrets .
It ’s the photograph – the Man - of - Destiny pose , the daintily blow - dried hair , and most of all , those clothes .
The cut - away tailcoat with white lapels , the six silver buttons , the wing - collared dicky - bow , the low - slung waistcoat … it all shouts money , bespoke tailoring and a rich stockbroker daddy , none
of which he likes to wave in the nation ’s faces .
So his answer to Andrew Marr ’s question , “ What ’s the personal wealth of you and your wife ? ” was a cautious , “ Our main asset is the house that we own in London … ”
We have here the spectacle of two of the nation ’s top Tories strenuously denying they are a ) completely respectable , and b ) quite rich .
It does n’t seem too long ago that Tory MPs would ’ve longed to be taken as either ( or both ) .
I look forward to more revelations at the party conference this week : Do n’t You Dare Call Me A Teetotaller , Warns Michael Gove .

Waitrose , the supermarket chain , have pulled their advertisements from the Fox News channel in America ( carried here by Sky TV ) because they disapprove of the Fox presenter Glenn Beck , who called President Obama a racist .
“ We take the placement of our ads in individual programmes very seriously , ” said a customer services spokesman , “ ensuring the content of these programmes is deemed appropriate for a brand with our values . ”
Waitrose ?
With its own - brand organic coffee beans and commitment to seasonality ?
When did they start having “ values ” and standing up for what they believe in ?
It got me thinking : Waitrose – they ’re clearly in favour of free markets , keen on Europe ( especially in the cheese section ) , big on health ( see their policy on organic bananas ) , tough on grime ( especially Mr Muscle ) and they believe in change ( the Beckenham branch changed its flipping aisle layout so much , I used to get horribly lost ) .
They ’re probably a little morally hazy about binge drinking , but otherwise , they ’re politically admirable .
Ca n’t we get them to run the country ?
I want to hear their top checkout girl , next summer , rally the nation with the words , “ Go back to your supermarkets – and prepare to govern . ”

How to do a wheelie on a motorcycle
In motorcycle acrobatics , the way a wheelie works is the front wheel comes off the ground due to extreme torque being applied to the rear wheel .
On more powerful motorcycles , such as those above 500 cc , the way you get the front wheel up is by accelerating , but on smaller bikes you might need to use the clutch and / or “ bouncing ” the forks ( using the rider ’s weight to compress the front suspension , so that the recoil will help lift the front wheel on accelerating ) .
The number one thing to remember when doing a wheelie is
to go off of the noise and feel of the engine , not by what the tachometer says –you should be paying complete attention to the road , not your instruments when you do this .
I ’ve got an awesome video here , about 9 minutes long , that takes you from the very basics and assumes you ’ve got no idea what you ’re doing , shows you 2
different ways to wheelie a motorcycle , starting with the safest way , and then goes on to show you some cool tricks you can do once you ’ve got that mastered :

Here ’s an awesome article that goes into great detail about properly doing a wheelie called ‘ Wheelies Explained ’ .

The car that thinks it 's a powerboat :
The 60 mph amphibious car that rules the waves
The awkward styling is unlikely to tempt car - lovers away from their Ferraris and Porsches .
But then this £ 125,000 machine has a party piece to blow its competitors clean out of the water .
It is called the Python , and its makers claim it is the fastest amphibious vehicle ever sold .
It can hit 60 mph on the waves - quicker than many speedboats - but is said to be equally at home on the road .
All the driver has to do before leaving dry land is put the gears into neutral , engage the jet drive , then push a button to raise the wheels .
I 'm off : The Python takes to the waves as easily as it travels on the road , hitting speeds of 60 mph in the water
Where to park ?
The Python is at home among traditional sea-going vessels
When coming out of the water , the driver simply reverses the process .
The Python is powered on land by a V8 engine from a Chevrolet Corvette , which produces 640 horsepower and enables the 3,800lb machine to reach 100 mph .
On water , thrust is provided by its Dominator Jet , which gives around 500 horsepower .
It is the first time such a potent powerplant has been put on an amphibious car .
It allows the Python to skim the tops of waves and travel at double the speed of its closest rivals .
The five - seat Python is built by the California - based company WaterCar .
The Python weighs nearly two tonnes , so power it certainly needs .
It is 30 mph faster than its closest competition - the Gibbs Aquada also built in the U.S. - and is 54mph faster than the Dutton Mariner which is built in Britain .
Fancy a race ?
The Python lines up next to two much larger boats
The Aquada has a similar power drive and also boasts retractable wheels , but Dave March , creator of the Python , says it is the hull design - which rides higher in the water than competitors ' - allied to the Dominator Jet that gives his snake - named amphibian its bite .
' I noticed in the late 1990's that a number of design specifications between cars and boats were being shared , ' he said .
' Boat manufactures were using lightweight high - performance automotive - type engines .
Car manufacturers were incorporating light - weight marine - type composite and alloy bodies and chassis .
It sparked the idea of developing high - performance cars that could be driven on the water .
' My vision was to see high - performance cars that were also high - performance boats .
' But I was not interested in previous amphibious vehicles that just float around .
I was interested in designing a high - performance automobile capable of getting to plane on top of the water , to reach motorway - style speeds on the water . '
Back on dry land :
The vehicle is driven easily back onto the ground
With the front end of a truck , the rear end of a Corvette , and the interior of a boat , this certainly is an awkward looking vehicle .
It has a truck - like stance on the road due to the lightweight hull on the bottom , so drivers must beware of speed bumps .
The wheels tuck up into the hull when on the water , giving it more speed .
Ever since the Amphicar was manufactured in Berlin , Germany , from 1962 to 1967 - with most of the 4,500 produced commercially being sold in America at the then high price of £ 3,000 - car makers have sought to conquer the waves with machines equally at home on land .
Luxurious :
The interior of the Python is in the style of a speedboat .
Buyers with £ 125,000 to spare can choose from 60,000 shades of paintwork
But cost - the Aquada is £ 150,000 - has meant that they remain luxury items for luxury lifestyle individuals .
Relatively few have been sold - and that will probably remain the destiny of the Python in these dire financial times .
On land it will easily hit 100 mph while its 60 mph top speed on water puts it near the high - end of luxury speedboats .
Buyers are given the chance of customising their vehicles and have a mind boggling choice of 60,000 colour shades for the paintwork to choose from , and 4,000 different colours for the interior .
Nine banks with a total of 153 offices were seized last evening , opening today as branches of the appropriately named U.S. Bank .
“ The FDIC and U.S. Bank entered into a loss - share transaction on approximately $ 14.4 billion of the combined purchased assets of $ 18.2 billion .
U.S. Bank will share in the losses on the asset pools covered under the loss - share agreement .
The loss - sharing arrangement is projected to maximize returns on the assets covered by keeping them in the private sector . ”
Activision Blizzard is a company filled with creative , talented people .
I remember the first time I was shown X - Men Origins : Wolverine , and how genuinely enthused the developers in the room seemed about both the project and the character .
When we played the full game it was clear that it was n't a show ; this was made by people who wanted to produce a solid , fun Wolverine title .
They succeeded .
I can share many , many other stories about good experiences with Activision Blizzard employees and their products .
Which is why it 's so frustrating that they seem to be lead by such a joyless man .
I 'm not sure if a video game beat up Bobby Kotick when he was a young man , but he seems to find the industry genuinely distasteful , even as it makes him rich .
Here are some choice quotes from a presentation at the Deutsche Bank Securities Technology Conference in San Francisco .
He points to the newly acquired business acumen of people in his company .
" You have studio heads who five years ago did n't know the difference between a balance sheet and a bed sheet who are now arguing allocations in our CFO 's office pretty regularly , " he stated .
Of course , that may be due to the fact that his incentive program " rewards profit and nothing else . "
He continued with that message : money , money , money .
" We have a real culture of thrift .
The goal that I had in bringing a lot of the packaged goods folks into Activision about 10 years ago was to take all the fun out of making video games . "
" We are very good at keeping people focused on the deep depression , " he stated .
Now , these quotes are taken from GameSpot 's reporting , and we do n't have the entire speech to give these statements context .
The problem is I 'm just not sure what kind of context would make these quotes look any less bloodless .
This is the man who controls Blizzard .
This is the man who controls the Call of Duty franchise .
This is n't the first time Kotick has been very upfront about wanting to squeeze his franchises for everything they 're worth .
Things may be looking good for Activision Blizzard right now , but gamers are a fickle bunch .
When you invite a vampire into your home , it 's possible he may be able to simply take a little blood every now and again and be a genial guest , but at some point you know he 's going to lose control and bleed you dry .
At that point you 'll be dead , and he 'll be out in the night looking for a new home .
The worst part ?
It 's hard to argue that you did n't know what he was when you invited him in .
ABILENE , Texas –
How does a former social worker from Chicago wind up living in an abandoned nuclear missile silo in Texas ?
The Johnny Carson show .

Missile Silo Confessions : Living on the Edge of Armageddon
Bruce Townsley was up late one night in the mid-'80s when he saw an unusual guest take a seat on Johnny ’s set : a nuclear missile base real estate mogul named Ed Peden .
Peden lives in an abandoned missile base in Kansas and was invited on the show to tell Johnny all about his underground lifestyle .
Townsley was hooked .
Using the pre-Google research librarians at the public library outside of Chicago where he then lived , Townsley tracked Peden down .
And though it was n't until 1997 that Townsley secured his current property , the idea blossomed in his head over the years .
After completing his fair share of conventional home remodels in the Chicago area , Townsley wanted a challenge to keep him busy for the rest of his life .
So far , his silo property has perfectly fit the bill .
Read on to tour Townsley 's subterranean lair in our second installment of missile base homes .
Townsely ’s tour begins in a corrugated steel quonset hut , one of the few above - ground structures on the site .
The prefabricated and easily assembled structures became popular with the military during World War II and look like a tin can cut in half lengthwise .
They were used as everything from barracks to warehouses to latrines .

The instructions to Townsley ’s place are simple : Head south of Abilene , nearly smack - dab in the middle of Texas , cross a couple of intersections , look for a small lump in the road with mailboxes sprouting out of the ground , and you ’re there .
At the end of the driveway , an American flag and array of solar panels provide the only evidence of habitation .
When purchasing an abandoned missile base , one must first realize that not all silos are created equal .
Hundreds of missile facilities built by the military between 1960 and 1965 were quickly deactivated due to the changing political climate .
They 're named for the type of missiles that they housed – Atlas E , Atlas F , Titan I , Titan II and Minuteman – and they vary widely in scope and function .
For example , Ed Peden 's base is an Atlas E site , which means the missiles were stored horizontally in giant garages with retractable roofs .
When it was time to fire , the roofs would open and the missiles would be raised vertically .
They also contain a much more extensive underground bunker – a feature too daunting for Townsley .
“ What the hell am I going to do ? ” asks Townsley .
“ Build a house inside a bunker ?
Too much room . ”
Instead , with Peden ’s help , Townsley went with this Atlas F site .
Here , a missile was stored vertically in an underground silo and the attached living quarters for the missiliers were more modest .
More than 30 years after it was deactivated , Townsley bought the property in 1997 for $ 99,000 .
By 1999 he had moved in to the 2,200 sq ft. fixer - upper .

Above ground , Bruce Townsley ’s place bears little resemblance to the busy site it was in the early ' 60s .
Most working parts have been decommissioned .
Buildings and parking lots have been removed and this escape hatch has been capped in thick concrete .
But not everything is out of order :
In the background sit the two giant overhead silo doors .
They cover the 185 - foot hole in the ground where a missile armed with a nuclear warhead used to be .
Townsley has managed to get one of these massive doors up and running .
It took a bunch of local volunteers and a rented crane , but he finally cracked it open .
“ I took out a loan against my truck to have a bracket built to be able to open the door , ” said Townsley .

While Ed Peden ’s more horizontal Atlas E silo home requires hundreds of feet of tunnels to get to the living space , Townsley ’s vertical Atlas F site means lots and lots of stairs .
Townsley takes this stairwell down to the first level of his house , which is where the old crew quarters ( now his subterranean living space ) is located .
The stairway ends at a set of 6,000 - pound blast doors designed to keep occupants safe during a nuclear attack .
The doors curve inward to offset the vacuum effect of a blast – keeping everything inside from being sucked out .
As an added safety feature , the white “ latticed ” debris door is hung to keep whatever an explosion carries into the tunnels from making it to the control room .
All four of the doors are still fully functional – a small miracle , considering that a number of blast doors from other Atlas F sites have since buckled under their weight .
Having the functioning doors was a big selling point for Bruce .
They are impressive in their size and precision , taking little more than a gentle shove to swing open .

Townsley ’s living space is about 1,100 square feet and completely round .
The room is essentially a concrete bubble suspended from the large column in its center .
When the site was an active missile base , this room “ floated ” on massive springs .
This let the room move both up and down and side to side , which would absorb a bomb blast in the event that the Russians managed to get a shot off .
Now Townsley has replaced some of the springs with poles so the room can only sway side to side .
Townsley would n’t trust his house with a nuclear blast these days , but it does just fine in strong Texas thunderstorms .
Every room in the structure revolves around the center pillar like a clock – kitchen , living room , office , bedroom – all separated by short partition walls built by Townsley .
Townsley has a clean aesthetic .
His tastes in furnishings have a simple , feng - shui vibe .
Clutter disturbs the chi when you live in a round , totally open room , he says .

While Townsley had a lot of home remodeling experience in Chicago , nothing in the windy city prepared him for the demands of such a space .
He has designed every detail in the room to fit its circular shape .
The kitchen counter , for example , reflects the contour of the wall .
“ The hardest part , says Townsley , “ was learning how to drywall on a curve . ”
Townsley says he also took some time adjusting to the subterranean lifestyle .
“ You have to get used to living without windows , ” he says .
“ But I have a TV monitor [ hooked up to ] an aboveground video camera . ”
Another thing he did n’t expect was the noise , or lack thereof .
“ It ’s intensely quiet , ” he says , “ and I ’m a quiet freak .
But there was a time when I had to keep a fan on all day just to have some noise . ”
Another set of stairs leads down to a second floor identical in size and shape to the main room .
Here , Townsley has installed a bathroom that could be showcased on the Home and Garden Network .
Also tucked into this lower level is a Bowflex machine .

The tour of Townsley ’s home base does n’t end here .
There ’s a much , much larger feature to his house – the 185 foot - deep missile silo .
To get to the silo requires navigating another set of blast doors and a corrugated steel tunnel .
During the silo ’s heyday , this tunnel would lead to a fully fueled , nuclear warhead equipped Atlas F missile , which was the U.S. ’s first attempt at a vertical in - ground launch system .
The missile was held in place with scaffolding , which was necessary since the Atlas missiles were basically thin aluminum shells filled with fuel .
Instead of some internal framework , they were pressurized on the inside to stay upright .
“ If there was a leak , ” Townsley says , “ they ’d collapse like a Coke can . ”
Townsely swings open another set of blast doors leading to the silo .

The tunnel exits bout two - thirds of the way to the top of the silo .
Townsley has hung a steel cable around a small platform – the only protection from a dark plunge to the bottom .
Some men tinker in the backyard shed .
Others putz around the garage .
Townsley has strung lights up in a 185 - foot hole in the ground and has enough space and tools to tinker for the foreseeable future .
And that suits him just fine .
He ’d like to make the silo more presentable .
Clean it up and restore it to a mock - up of its original condition .
But Townsely admits it ’s “ such a long - term project . ”
And , now that he ’s got his underground bachelor pad all set up , there ’s no rush on the silo .
“ You play with it when you play with it , ” he says .
Top photo : Jim Merithew / Wired.com
Seen from below , the giant silo doors give little hint that there ’s a blue sky beyond .
Such substantial doors required Townsley to get a little creative to prop it open .
But the main tool is fairly pedestrian : “ It ’s your standard hydraulic lift , ” Townsley says .
“ It ’s just really big . ”
Decades ago the lifts were a crucial part of the operation .
Before the missile could be launched , the multi-ton , three - foot thick doors had to swing outward and allow an elevator to raise the missile toward the sky as quickly as possible .
If an enemy attack was really underway , every second counted and vertical silos like these were soon preferential to the horizontal Atlas E silos , where the doors had to open and the missile raised upright .
Although the Atlas F silos were soon rendered obsolete by even faster missile launch systems , they became the template for all that followed .
“ Everything after has been a vertical launch system , ” Townsley says .
An Atlas F missile , flanked by the massive silo doors , is fully raised and ready to launch .

The hallway from the missile silo to the bunker is lined with the heavy blast doors intended to keep occupants safe during an attack .
The doors curve inward , a design feature that , theoretically , would help offset the pull of the vacuum created by a nuclear explosion outside and keep them from being flung outward .
While those attacks thankfully never did come to pass , a handful of Atlas F ’s exploded in their silos and exposed one problem with the heavy steel doors .
According to Townsely , during these “ missile failures ” the blast doors were n’t quite as strong a defense against forces going the opposite way .
“ Both sets of blast doors would blow in , ” Townsley says , “ They ’d be defeated . ”
Luckily the debris doors held and kept any shrapnel from entering occupied areas .
Bored local teens ventured underground throughout the ' 80s and early '90s before Townsley took the place over .
Their graffiti helps the silo serve another purpose – time capsule .
Peace signs , ( not yet in wide pop-cultural circulation during the early ' 60s ) became a popular symbol wherever nuclear warheads once resided .
Other highlights include a “ Regan / Bush 1991 ” scrawl and a spray - painted tribute to The Cure .

Across America these concrete slabs and giant doors cover very deep holes in the ground , somber mementos of a time when many Americans felt that the end of the world as they knew it was just the push of a button away .
When the silo was operational , both doors would swing open and an elevator would bring an Atlas F missile to the surface to be fired .
But do n’t expect many people to go to the lengths Townsely did to crack one open .
In fact , just getting the one back up in working order was enough for Townsley .
Aside from the logistical nightmare presented by their sheer size and weight , the doors were designed to open in a complicated synchronicity .
Townsley did n’t want to spend all the time and effort needed to figure out how to recreate it .
“ I was thrilled to death and called it a success with just one , ” Townsley says .
At the time it was being lowered into its silo , this Atlas F was the most advanced missile in the U.S. arsenal .
Top photo : Jim Merithew / Wired.com
No , it ’s not a nuclear strike .
Many of the Atlas missiles were eventually launched , but instead of weapons for the Cold War they became tools of the space race , carrying satellites into orbit .
As the tour ends , it ’s time to let Townsley get back to his peace and quiet .
It ’s hard not to wonder why someone would give up Chicago for rural Texas .
All those glass skyscrapers for a literal hole in the ground .
But like other civilians who are now putting abandoned silos to use , Townsley is a near expert on the history of these relics of American weaponry .
Besides , it ’s the perfect location for someone who ’s self - reliant and likes his space .
And as Townsley launches into another detail about Atlas missiles and underground bunkers , it ’s obvious that he ’s having a blast .

NASHVILLE 
Two years ago , the Tennessee legislature put into statute what most people assumed should go without saying — it is illegal to have sex with an animal in this state .
But prosecutors across Middle Tennessee have cause to be glad that someone spelled that felony out .
No less than three bestiality cases have come up in separate counties in recent months .
Three people stand accused of engaging in sex acts with farm animals in Maury County .
In Humphreys County , a youth football coach was already under investigation for child rape when police reportedly found images of bestiality on his cellphone .
And in Nashville , police charged a man and a woman under the new statute after a tipster turned over photos of them having sexual contact with a dog .
Plenty of people cracked jokes about the bestiality bill when it came up in the legislature in 2007 .
But District Attorney General Mike Bottoms , who is prosecuting the Maury County case , said he's not sure what he could have charged the Maury County defendants with if the statute had n't been on the books .
" There are laws against cruelty to animals , but they dealt more into the neglect of the animals , which was n't the case here , " Bottoms said .
The Maury County case revolves around 58 - year - old James Tait .
Audiences who watched the critically acclaimed documentary " Zoo " a few years ago heard Tait 's voice , narrating his part in the story of a Washington State man who died of internal injuries after a sexual encounter with a horse .
It was Tait who videotaped the fatal encounter and later drove the dying man to the hospital .
The case prompted Washington State to criminalize bestiality after frustrated law enforcement officials were unable to charge
Tait with anything more than trespassing in a stable .
Maury County investigators found photographic and video evidence of similar activity at the farm .
" We had no idea this sort of thing was happening , " said Maury County Detective Terry Chandler .
" This goes on .
These people live all across the United States , and they know each other . "
Washington State is considering a new law that would add bestiality offenses to the sexual offender registry , and Chandler said he would like to see a similar law in Tennessee .
Along with Tait , deputies arrested his housemate , Kenny Thomason , 44 , and 35 - year - old Christy Morris .
All three remain in jail , awaiting a grand jury hearing in early November .
It was Rep. Debra Maggart , R- Hendersonville , who pushed to get a bestiality bill on the books .
The law makes it a class E felony to engage in sexual activity with an animal , or to help someone else do so , or to allow it to happen on one 's property , or to take or possess pictures or videos of such activities , or to advertise , organize or promote that sort of behavior .
The law makes exceptions for commercial animal husbandry activities .
" You can imagine all the remarks I got , " Maggart said .
" It sounds funny , until you know what 's going on . "
Maggart and groups like the Humane Society of the United States point to studies that show the high correlation between sexual abuse of animals and sexual abuse of children .
She said she sponsored the bill at the urging of local law enforcement officials .
One study , linked on the Humane Society Web page , found that 96 % of juveniles who engaged in sexual abuse of animals also admitted to sex offenses against humans .
In another study , some 37 % of sexually violent juvenile offenders were found to have a history of animal sexual assault .
An FBI study found that serial killers have a high rate of animal sexual abuse as well .
The Humphreys County case is still under investigation , and no charges have been filed , but the initial warrant cited photos of bestiality found on the coach 's cellphone during the investigation .
A local parent had accused the coach of drugging and raping a boy during a slumber party .
For the first year the new law was on the books , the Administrative Office of the Courts has no record of anyone in Tennessee being charged with bestiality .
That changed in May , when Nashville police got a tip that led them to a couple who had images on their computer of the two of them performing sex acts on a dog .
The woman was given a suspended sentence .
The man , who told police he met his girlfriend " on the Internet and she is into bestiality , " is still awaiting trial .

For the first time in 144 years State interposition ( Madison ) and State nullification and secession ( Jefferson ) have entered public discourse as remedies to usurpations by the central government of rights reserved to the sovereign people of the States by the Constitution .
Since Americans are not in the habit of exercising these policy options , it is worthwhile to ask just what State legislators and governors can do to protect their citizens from usurpations by the central government .
First , they can begin by passing resolutions ( as a number have done ) , declaring in no uncertain terms that all powers not delegated to the central government nor prohibited to the States by the Constitution are reserved by them ; and that the States themselves have the authority to judge what is reserved and what is delegated  Supreme Court case law notwithstanding .
To deny this is to say that the central government can define the limits of its own power which flatly contradicts the Constitutions language of State delegated and reserved powers .
Second , the States can insist that an office be set up in Congress to receive and respond to these resolutions .
Resolutions are words .
They cost little to produce , but words have power .
As the Scottish philosopher David Hume observed , political authority is based primarily on opinion not force .
It is not merely iron bars that confine you to prison , it is also the guards opinion not to let you out .
If you could change his mind , the bars could not restrain you .

Naylor , Thomas H. Best Price : $ 2.95 Buy New $ 7.45 ( as of 09:40 EST - Details )
A continuous flood of resolutions from the States about the constitutionality of this or that issue ( and widely publicized ) , would serve to educate the public ( and their rulers ) about constitutional limits and alter the mind - set of politics in a decentralist direction .
Further , State legislators and governors should revive , where appropriate , the Jeffersonian discourse of State interposition , nullification , and secession as policy options .
To deny this is to say that an American State is not a genuine political society at all , but a mere aggregate of individuals under control of a central government that alone can define the limits of its powers .
To hear such discourse in public speech can strengthen civic virtue and revive the long slumbering disposition of self - government that has been suppressed by a century of runaway centralization .
Lincoln understood the power of words , and advanced the cause of centralization by refusing to describe the States as sovereign political societies .
He described them as mere counties authorized by central authority .
He asked incredulously :  What is this particular sacredness of a State ?
If a State , in one instance , and a county in another should be equal in extent of territory , and equal in number of people , wherein is that State any better than a county ? 
Lincoln was not describing the federative America that Jefferson and Madison founded , but an imagined and wished for centralized , unitary American state .
It is time that the Lincolnian inversion of political discourse be inverted .
CONSTITUTION IN EXILE , ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 3.93 ( as of 04:40 EST - Details )
Third ,
In addition to changing the terms of discourse , State legislators and governors should engage in 10th amendment acts of recovering usurped authority .
The least controversial of these acts would be simply to not accept federal money for projects that are judged unconstitutional , such as federal involvement in education .
Refuse the money , and begin restoring state and local control over education or whatever the issue might be .
Fourth , in order to restore usurped constitutional authority , a State must be prepared , at some point , to resist federal intrusion .
There is a long history of States doing just that .
Georgia nullified the Supreme Courts ruling in Chisholm vs. Georgia ( 1793 ) ; New England States nullified fugitive slave laws ; and earlier New England townships nullified Jeffersons embargo and the war of 1812 declared under Madisons administration .
Jefferson said he felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by the New England townships .
Wisconsin was nullifying what it declared to be usurpations by the Supreme Court into the 1850s .
There was a time when the States kept the central government under control .
Can this be done today ?
Before it is attempted a clarification is necessary .
We must understand that any such constitutional challenge is a political one based on the States sovereign authority and not a matter justiciable by the courts .
Genuine federalism in America can be recovered only by political action in the name of the States own authority and not by Supreme Court legalism .
Indeed , legalism only affirms that the Court has the final say over what powers the States have .
When States interposed to block the Supreme Courts orders to desegregate public schools in the South on the ground that such orders were unconstitutional , the move failed but only because racial segregation was not a popular issue .
Many scholars then and now thought that Brown v. Board of Education was bad constitutional law , i.e. , that the court had abandoned its proper role of policing the Constitution in favor of social engineering .
Most , however , approved of the engineering , and paid little regard to the constitutional cost .

For decades , Scottish geologist and gem dealer Campbell Bridges navigated the risks that came with mining precious stones in Africa .
At his camp deep in the Kenyan bush , he spent nights in a treehouse to stay safe from wild animals .
He used a python to stand guard over his cache of colored gems and more than once chased away marauders attempting to poach from his caves .
But Bridges ’ life and adventurous career ended abruptly this week when his truck was ambushed in southeastern Kenya by a mob armed with spears , machetes , and bows and arrows .
Police and family members say the attackers appeared to be linked to a gang seeking to seize control of Bridges ’ lucrative mining concession .
Bridges died Tuesday of stab wounds , officials said .
His son , Bruce , and two Kenyan colleagues were injured in the attack .

In addition to his son , Bridges is survived by his wife , Judith , and daughter , Laura , a law student in Chicago .
Like Bruce Bridges , they are U.S. citizens .
Bruce Bridges said his father had been fighting for three years against a group of Kenyans -- who he said were backed by local government officials -- seeking to drive him away .
After Kenyan mining officials this year upheld his father ’s rights to mine the land , the group turned to violence and intimidation , including roadblocks , harassment and death threats , Bruce Bridges said .
“ They are just a bunch of thugs who want the resources , ” he said .
Advertisement
His father ’s repeated complaints to the local police were ignored , Bridges said , including a plea shortly before Tuesday ’s assault .
They had left the police station and were headed home to his base near Voi when at least eight assailants attacked their vehicle , he said .
“ We know everyone who did this , by first and last name , ” Bridges said .
“ We reported it to the police , but they gave us no assistance . ”
Charles Owino , a police spokesman , said he could not comment because he had no information on the case .
Other police officials told reporters that they were searching for suspects , but that no arrests had been made as of Thursday .

In a career that spanned half a century , Campbell Bridges spent most of his time digging in the caves and mountainsides of Africa , including stints in South Africa , Zimbabwe ( then known as Rhodesia ) and Tanzania .
The son of a mining company geologist , Bridges was among those who worked in the initial extraction and marketing of the gemstone tanzanite in the 1960s .
He worked as a consultant for New York - based jeweler Tiffany & Co. in selling the gems to U.S. customers .
He is credited with finding , in 1967 , an equally rare green gemstone called tsavorite .
When Tanzania nationalized its mining industry , Bridges moved his prospecting business to neighboring Kenya , where he laid claim to a large deposit of the green - specked rocks near the border with Tanzania .
He named the stones after Tsavo National Park , near where his company , Tsavorite USA , mines and sells gems .
Family members expressed skepticism that Kenyan authorities would prosecute those involved in the slaying and have asked the U.S. and British embassies to launch their own inquiries .
Officials at both embassies said they were assisting the family , but had no plans to get involved in the criminal investigation unless asked by Kenyan authorities .

“ We are closely following the investigation and hope that the perpetrators will be brought to swift justice , ” said Charley Williams , spokeswoman for the British High Commission in Nairobi .
The attack comes amid what many see as a resurgence in violence , crime and corruption in Kenya , which is struggling with a sluggish economy and a stalled coalition government , formed as a compromise after a disputed presidential election in late 2007 .
With police officers who routinely seek bribes and an overburdened court system , many crimes in Kenya are never prosecuted .
Despite prodding from the international community , the government has yet to punish perpetrators in the riots and tribal clashes that killed more than 1,000 people during the post-election crisis .
Advertisement
Bruce Bridges said his father had grown increasingly worried about Kenya ’s political and social instability but did not expect the threats against his business to turn so violent .
“ He used to say that with the way things in Kenya were going , who knows what might happen , ” Bridges said .
“ He knew the risks .
He understood Africa .
But to have something like this happen is just unbelievable . ”

Yet we , as a society , ignore a scheme conveniently upheld by calculator makers for decades that twists innocent minds with rude words and vulgar fractions .
Families today are under siege by Big Calculator corporate interests aimed at mentally molesting minors for money – and only one iPhone developer has the floating points to stop them .
James Thomson , the creator of PCalc has premiered bleeding - edge calculator censorship technology that detects when the iPhone is turned upside down with a potentially abased readout .
Behold :
We applaud your public - spirited act of self - promotion , Thomson .
A single child saved from a devilishly entertaining math problem is more than worth the effort . ®
There 's absolutely nothing wrong with being in any of these categories .
As you can see , I put our show in the " Opinion Outlet " category .
I have no problem with that .
We tell you our take on the news of the day .
All of the categories are based on the news ; but they do range based on how much original news reporting or editorializing they do .
And that is an important distinction .
The Obama White House has taken on Fox News channel in an effort to point out they are not a legitimate news network .
This is very important because out of all the outlets mentioned above , they are the only ones being dishonest about what category they are in .
This is where the confusion lies .
Fox News admits that their talk shows are opinion based , which is obvious and indisputable .
It 's not straight news and it 's not meant to be .
No problem .
The problem lies in their " news " side .
They do n't have a straight news division like CNN , MSNBC , ABC , etc .
They have propaganda disguised as news .
That 's a serious issue that must be addressed .
If they simply admitted as some of the partisan journals do - on both the left and the right - that they cover the news but from a certain ideological perspective , then again there would be no problem .
The Nation is n't purely an opinion magazine ; it does real reporting .
But they have a clear ideological perspective , in their case a liberal one .
The National Review is the same on the right - news stories and opinion from a conservative point of view .
Again , as long as there is truth in advertising there 's no problem at all .
The problem with Fox News is that they have shown over and over again that they tilt their news coverage indisputably toward a right - wing perspective and refuse to admit it .
They are not purely driven by the news .
They are driven by an agenda .
The Daily Show did a great segment just last week showing how Fox News acted as cheerleaders for the 9/12 Tea Party protests and gave it wall to wall coverage , yet for a protest of almost the same exact size - the Gay Rights protest last weekend - they did n't send a single camera crew .
And The Daily Show did n't even mention a Fox News producer who was caught on camera riling up the crowds in the 9/12 protest and literally encouraging them to cheer louder .
I do n't think they sent a similar " news producer " to the gay rights march .
To argue that they covered these protests straight without any leaning toward one side or another is comically disingenuous .
But this is only one of dozens of readily available examples .
Think Progress has another fantastic example of exactly what the administration is complaining about - Fox News anchors parroting Republican talking points .
First you see Republican representatives pushing the talking point of " Where are the jobs ? " then you see Fox anchors asking the same exact question as if they are independently asking questions about the news rather than repeating propaganda ( it 's a perfect example of Fox 's agenda - watch the Republicans first and then Fox News here ) .
As if all of this were n't enough , we have absolute proof from the inside that Fox purposely manipulates the news to suit a Republican agenda .
There is a leaked memo from their Vice President of News , Dan Moody , where he directs his so - called reporters to find Iraqi insurgents celebrating Democratic victories in 2006 ( you can read it here ) .
Are we really having a serious conversation about whether Fox has an ideological perspective ?
Unfortunately , the rest of the media seems to be unbelievably dense in recognizing this point , so they treat Fox coverage as if it 's real , straight news .
So , when Fox wants to drive an issue like Bill Ayers or Rev. Wright or ACORN or just about every other conservative attack against Obama , the rest of the press goes along with it as if these are all straight news stories .
Now , it 's important to point out that ideologically driven press can break real stories .
They should not be dismissed out of hand as not news simply because they came from those sources .
As an example , Mother Jones has broken many important stories that are no less valid because they came form a source that has a clear liberal perspective .
So , Fox News can - and does - break stories that are valid and should receive some press coverage from everyone .
That 's why partisan press provides an important voice in the national conversation .
The problem is when partisan press gets confused for straight , unbiased news .
The perfect example of this is when Fox News called the 2000 election for George W. Bush first - and every other news network followed like sheep .
The person in charge of calling the 2000 election at Fox News was the cousin of George W. Bush .
That is not some hyperbole .
It was literally Bush 's cousin .
Would the other networks have panicked and called the election for Gore because Air America said he won ?
Would they have followed the lead of The Young Turks in calling the election for Gore if we had hired Gore 's uncle to tabulate the votes for us ?
It 's ridiculous and unthinkable , right ( especially so , since Air America and The Young Turks were n't around yet at the time of that election ; but you get my point -- there 's no way they would consider that legitimate , but yet they considered Fox 's call perfectly legitimate ) ?
So , why did they commit this unpardonable error in the 2000 election when Fox News was involved ?
Because Fox has purposely sold itself as straight news when they know that they are nothing of the sort - specifically to be able to influence the rest of the press in this way .
And the rest of the media bought it .
This dangerous charade has to end , and that is why I think it was a fantastic idea by the White House to call out Fox on this phenomenon .
They 're not saying they wo n't go on Fox News or that Fox 's point of view is illegitimate or unacceptable .
They 're simply asking people to recognize their point of view .
That 's a perfectly valid request .
In fact , if they do n't do this they are going to continue to get swift - boated on every issue because the press will follow the lead of Fox News on every partisan attack they bring up .
They must respond or they 'll wind up in the same position as John Kerry when Fox News kept asking if he really served honorably in Vietnam ( the problem again was that they were pretending to ask the questions as if they were journalists looking into the issue , but in reality they just wanted that story to last longer in the press so that more people would question Kerry 's service - Fox plays this " question " game all the time ) .
Even if you do n't agree with the White House 's tactic of taking on Fox , you have to agree that they have been smart in at least bringing up the question of Fox News 's credibility .
This was not a conversation that the rest of the press was having before .
Now , at least a question arises as to whether the media should really trust a story coming out of Fox News or whether they are pushing a Republican agenda with their so - called news item .
That 's a debate the White House can't lose ; because as Fox News has taught us , it 's not the answer that matters , it 's the question .
I would take it one step further than the White House though .
Yes , administration officials should go on Fox News on a regular basis .
You still want to talk to that audience .
Even if you think you 're not going to convince them , you 're still an administration that represents all of the American people and you must talk to your conservative constituents as well .
But the president himself should make a stand .
President Obama should go on Fox News again only when they admit that they are partisan press .
If they are not trying to trick anyone by pretending to be neutral journalists , then of course the president should talk to them .
But if they continue on their policy of purposeful deception in how they represent themselves , then the White House should n't reward that behavior .
Obama 's negative numbers have been driven up by constant attacks from Fox News Channel ( the one entity that the Republican base says represents them the most ) .
They can be proud of that accomplishment .
They 're having a large impact .
But to pretend that they are not behind the organized way those attacks are driven into the mainstream press is not just dishonest ; it 's an insult to our intelligence .
Obama is accused by some ( including Fox , of course ) of being too wimpy to come on Fox and challenge them .
Well , is n't Fox News too wimpy to admit what the really are ?
Why do n't they have the courage of their convictions and admit that they are conservative ?
If they rise up to the challenge of confessing their real identity and real purpose , then - and only then - should Obama rise up to the challenge of taking on that conservative voice in the media in an interview on their air .
That sounds fair and balanced to me .

Mackinac on Mars. Credit : NASA / JPL / colorization by Stuart Atkinson
Opportunity must be driving down Meteorite Alley on Mars .
The rover has come across still another meteorite , the third space rock it has found the past few months , and fourth overall since 2005 .
This one is called Mackinac , which continues the “ island ” theme by which the science team has dubbed the meteorites .
Block Island was found in July 2009 , and Opportunity came upon Shelter Island the end of September ( around sol 2020 for the rover ) .
Mackinac was found on sol 2034 ( Oct 13 ) , and it looks very similar in composition to the two earlier meteorites .
Opportunity analyzed the Block Island and found it was made of iron and nickel .
The image above was color calibrated by Stu Atkinson , who hangs out at UnmannedSpaceflight.com .
You can find all the raw images Opportunity has sent back to Earth here , and raw images from Spirit here .
But you can also follow Opportunity in other ways ….
You can keep track of Opportunity ’s travels through Meridiani Planum on its way to Endeavour Crater at one of Stu ’s blogs , Road to Endeavour .
But — and this is very fun — you can also follow Oppy on Google Mars , and see where it has found the meteorites .
Tesheiner on UMSF regularly updates a route map , pinpointing the spots where the rover stops .
Just go to Google Mars ( download Google Earth and Mars here if you do n’t have it yet ) , open up Google Mars , then click on this link , download and open , and you ’ll be transported to Opportunity ’s location on Mars .
Extreme , extreme cool .
Now , you ’ll notice that region of Google Mars does n’t have high - resolution imagery yet .
They ’re working on it .
In the meantime , though , if you want to see a great mosaic of the terrain that Opportunity is traveling through , check out this image below created by Ken Kremer , also of UMSF .
This is from Sol 2010 showing Nereus Crater and dunes on the Road to Endeavour , where Oppy was just prior to discovering Shelter Island .
The crater is about 10 meters across .
Ken created this mosaic from raw images from the Cornell Pancam raw images , stitching multiple images together and calibrating the color .
Beautiful !

Microsoft community manager Peter Galli announced Wednesday that Microsoft will apply its Community Promise to ECMA 334 and 335 , the standards that document the C# programming language and .
NET 's Common Language Infrastructure ( CLI ) .
This move affirms Microsoft 's willingness to enable the development of third - party .NET implementations such as Mono .
The Community Promise is a legally binding commitment through which Microsoft pledges to not assert its patents against others who implement certain Microsoft standards and technologies .
This means that developers can create their own interoperable versions without exposing themselves to the risk of patent infringement lawsuits from Microsoft .
Unlike the covenant that was part of Microsoft 's controversial agreement with Novell , the Community Promise does not discriminate against any users or restrict downstream redistribution .
It is generally compatible with open source licenses and philosophies .
This could have significant implications for Mono , an open source implementation of .NET that is developed by Novell .
Mono is being adopted by a growing number of developers and has been used to build some popular desktop Linux applications , including the Banshee music player , the Tomboy note application , the F - Spot image manager , and the GNOME - Do launcher .
Several of those applications are included by default in widely - used Linux distributions , such as Ubuntu and OpenSUSE .
Mono has proven useful for the Linux platform , both because it is highly conducive to rapid development and because it makes it easier for Windows application developers to migrate their skills and software to the open source operating system .
Mono is also being adopted in some unexpected places where its flexibility gives it an advantage over Microsoft 's own implementation .
The most notable example is iPhone development , where Mono 's support for ahead - of - time , static compilation gives developers the ability to use C# without falling afoul of Apple 's draconian App Store restrictions .
Mono has also made an appearance in the Second Life game client , where it is used as an embedded scripting engine .
Mono has the potential to give developers a free and open implementation of .NET in much the same way that GNU and Linux provide a free and open implementation of C and UNIX .
Although this offers significant benefits , deep distrust of Microsoft within the Linux community has limited the adoption of the open source runtime .
The distrust exists because Microsoft 's track record on facilitating unencumbered interoperability with Linux has traditionally been poor .
Microsoft has consistently said that it will not collaborate directly with Linux distributors on interoperability issues unless the distributors agree to patent agreements that are hostile to the principle of freely redistributable software .
Another source of concern among Linux users is Redmond 's unsubstantiated allegation that Linux infringes on its patents .
These issues have made it difficult for some Linux enthusiasts to feel comfortable with Mono .
Despite the constant ideological friction between Microsoft and the Linux community , Microsoft is increasingly embracing open source and is being relatively cooperative when it comes to development technologies .
The company has done much to enable the development of third - party .NET runtimes .
When C# and the CLI became ECMA standards , Microsoft agreed to make its relevant patents available under reasonable and non-discriminatory ( RAND ) terms so that the technology could be adopted by others .
Microsoft has made similar commitments in the past for other standards that it participated in authoring , such as USB and UPnP .
Some in the Linux community , however , were not satisfied with the RAND terms and wanted clarification .
The Mono developers began discussing this issue with Microsoft several months ago and asked for an authoritative and legally binding statement that would eliminate the patent concerns .
Microsoft decided to apply the Community Promise in order to fulfill that goal .
" It is important to note that , under the Community Promise , anyone can freely implement these specifications with their technology , code , and solutions .
You do not need to sign a license agreement , or otherwise communicate to Microsoft how you will implement the specifications , " wrote Galli in the announcement .
" Under the Community Promise , Microsoft provides assurance that it will not assert its Necessary Claims against anyone who makes , uses , sells , offers for sale , imports , or distributes any Covered Implementation under any type of development or distribution model , including open - source licensing models such as the LGPL or GPL . "
The Community Promise covers patents controlled by Microsoft that are required in order to produce an implementation .
In order to prevent fragmentation , it specifies that implementations must be compliant with the mandatory parts of the specification in order to be covered by the Promise .
This application of the Promise covers the contents of ECMA 334 and 335 , but not additional .NET technologies that are outside the scope of those standards .
The area covered by those standards includes the C# programming language , all the relevant parts of the runtime environment , and the standard library .
It does not include ASP .
NET , the WinForms APIs , or other proprietary Microsoft technologies .
Lead Mono developer Miguel de Icaza says that his team will simplify the matter for programmers by distributing Mono in two parts : the components that are included in the standard and the components that are not included in the standard .
This will make it easier for users and developers to avoid the handful of components that are not covered under the Promise if they wish to do so .
" A few months ago we approached Bob Muglia and Brian Goldfarb ( @bgoldy ) at Microsoft with a request to clarify the licensing situation for the ECMA standards covering C# and the CLI ( also ISO standards , for the ISO loving among you ) , " de Icaza wrote in a blog entry .
" In the next few months we will be working towards splitting the jumbo Mono source code that includes ECMA + a lot more into two separate source code distributions .
One will be ECMA , the other will contain our implementation of ASP .
NET , ADO .
NET , Winforms and others . "
It 's worth noting that the popular Mono - based desktop Linux applications that were mentioned previously in this article are all using GTK # and other components of the GNOME stack .
This means that they fit within the boundaries of what is protected by the Community Promise .
The Community Promise will likely satisfy virtually all of the users and developers who have had concerns in the past about the legal implications of using C# on the Linux platform .
It 's unclear , however , if anything will be able to change the views of the vocal minority of extremists who believe that Mono is part of a ploy to undermine the Linux platform .
By putting the C# and CLI standards under the Community Promise , Microsoft has demonstrated a strong commitment to collaborating with the open source software community and empowering the developers of third - party .NET implementations .
Much like Microsoft 's recent contributions to the Apache Foundation , it 's a sign that Redmond is coming to terms with open source and appreciates the advantages of truly open standards in some contexts .
The Community Promise is also a major win for cross-platform programming and rapid application development on the Linux platform , as it will clear the way for more developers to adopt Mono .

Where better to start a look at anarchism then to look at the state of the left as a whole .
The organised revolutionary left today is at its weakest for many years .
Its not so much a question of the triumph of capitalism however as the failure of the bulk of the ideologies of socialism .
The collapse of both labourism and the USSR has left the vast bulk of the left confused and demoralised , either dead , dying or repeating decade old slogans in a state of living death .
The left and the state
The left for the most part consisted of those who wanted to liberate the rest of us .
There were two distinct flavours , labour parties that said elect us to office and we will gradually abolish capitalism for you .
Not only has this not happened despite labour government becoming common but in countries like France and Australia in the 80's labour governments actually led the assaults on the wages and standard of living of the working class .
The bulk of the revolutionary left came to consist of Leninists in what has been termed 57 varieties .
Like the labour parties they promised if we put them into power they would sort out the problem for us .
They may have recognised that the creation of socialism would first require the overthrowal of capitalism but in power they have been every bit as anti-working class as the social democrats were , perhaps in fact more so .
Their idea of building socialism after the revolution consisted of smashing all working class organisation outside the control of their party from factory committees to trade unions .
This side of the revolution they spent more time squabbling over who was the vanguard than anything else .
the predictions of anarchism
Anarchism arose out of the 1st international as a movement that said socialism cannot be created for people it must be created by them .
As such it was based on absolute opposition to any form of minority power .
It predicted that the authoritarian aspects of Marxism would prevent the Marxists creating socialism , instead what would be created would be a dictatorship of scientists .
Today many of their writings from the 1870's are uncomfortably prophetic in relation to what became of the state centred left .
what is anarchism
So what exactly is anarchism .
Above all its the idea that an individuals freedom should only be constrained by the freedom of others , that there should be no government .
This definition is of course inadequate but from it flows the opposition to capitalism and authoritarian socialism .
Its aim is nothing less than the liberation of humanity .
Anarchism has taken many forms , to really define it in its complexity you have to look at the historical process of the anarchist movement .
Unlike most of the rest of the left we have no wish to remain static , scholarly re-interpreting the works of the early prophets and arguing over the number of angels a pinhead .
Our aim is revolution .
A history of Anarchism
1st International & IWA
Anarchism arose as a current in the 1st international in the 1860's .
The term had certainly been used before then and it is possible to see the seeds of the idea of anarchism in the writings and activities of movements and individuals before this date .
Most notable perhaps groups like the Levellers at the time of the English civil war , the sans culottes of the French revolution and some of the writings of Proudhon but these are all incomplete and flawed .
Contributing towards that latter movement that was to emerge just over a century ago .
Marxism also arose out of this period and too a large extent the two opposing currents defined each other and much of the events of 20th century socialism .
Indeed Marx and Bakunin ( the most vocal of the anarchists ) had met ( and argued ) in Paris in the 1840's .
There was much the two currents agreed on in particular the importance of historical materialism as a tool and also the importance of Marx 's economic work .
Bakunin said of Capital
" His [ Marx ] great work Capital , is not in the least a fantasy ... It is founded on a very extensive , very detailed knowledge and a very profound analysis of this system and of its conditions .
Karl Marx is a man of immense statistical and economic knowledge .
His work on Capital , though unfortunately bristling with formulas and metaphysical subtleties , which render it unapproachable for the great mass of readers , is in the highest degree a scientific or realist work : in that sense that it absolutely excludes any other logic than that of the facts " .
Marxism , Freedom and the State , Freedom Press , page 27
The conflict between Marxism and anarchism occurred over the question of the state .
Could socialism be introduced by a minority either using the existing state or using one of their own creation after a revolution as the Marxists claim or could socialism only be introduced through the actions of the working class itself .
Now after the collapse of the eastern block and of the labour parties it is clear that the statist path to socialism is a failure .
Unfortunately such was the ideological dominance achieved by Marxism in the period after world war two that for many this signals the end of socialism itself .
The conflict between Marxism and Anarchism in the first international ended bitterly .
At a conference rigged through Marx 's control of the standing orders committee Bakunin and two other leading anarchists were expelled on a variety of bizarre charges .
Marx moved the international to New York where it promptly died .
The Anarchist sections of the international continued to meet for several years and were later to reform as the IWA which is still with us today .
In the interim the anarchists built mass revolutionary unions , Marxism turned almost completely to reformism with only a tiny revolutionary rump .
Russian revolution
The next significant event in the history of anarchism was the Russian revolution .
Paradoxically not so much for its success but rather its failure there and the way that revolution was to shape the left for the next 70 years .
If the first international had seen the Marxists and anarchists fall out over the issue of the state the Russian revolution was to clarify this divide in blood .
The immediate aftermath of the Russian revolution saw a society were the working class were in control through workers councils and factory committees .
The state as such had ceased to exist that when gently pushed in October it has fallen to dust .
In the aftermath Russian workers started to construct a new society , one where they were in control .
At this stage they overwhelmingly supported the Bolsheviks for the Bolsheviks appeared to be creating this society alongside them .
They had won this support through their support in turn for the workers seizing and running the factories and for the creation of soviets .
" All power to the soviets " was probably the slogan that encapsulated the October revolution and it was one the Bolsheviks too had used .
Within a few short months however the Bolsheviks were to destroy the gains of the October revolution .
First the workers were denied the power of running the economy through organs they controlled .
Instead the state took over .
They were denied the right to even locally run each factory , or even elect the management .
Instead the Bolsheviks re-introduced one man management .
They believed socialism could only be introduced by their party wielding state control and stopped at nothing to make sure their decisions were implemented .
As workers left the party in droves and either joined one of the left opposition groups or struck against the new state they were crushed .
The Anarchists started growing and they were raided , shot and imprisoned , their press shut and their organisations banned .
The militarisation of labour was introduced and strikers were shot , all the gains of the revolution were destroyed in the name of building socialism .
By 1921 organised opposition outside the party was destroyed , its last stronghold crushed in Kronsdadt where those who made the revolution were mown down by the Bolsheviks for defending it .
The Bolsheviks even turned on the minority within their own party who wanted limited workers democracy in the unions .
Opposition within the party was banned , opposition outside the party had been destroyed .
Before long the internal opposition was to fall prey to the tactics it had used to smash working class resistance .
I mentioned the failure of the Anarchists in the Russian revolution .
What was this failure .
Basically the anarchists knew what the Marxist strategy of state control was likely to lead to .
The anarchists in the first international had argued against such a dictatorship of scientists .
They were smaller than the Bolsheviks in numbers but they had influence as far back as the 1905 revolution when the anarchist Voline initiated the formation of the Petrograd soviet ( and was offered but refused the role as chair ) .
They completely failed to capitalise on this early support and even as the revolution approached failed to build a libertarian pole of attraction to counter act the Bolsheviks .
Their growth after the revolution was too late , they were crushed by the Bolsheviks using the state machinery .
In 1927 exiled Russian anarchists living in Paris attempted to analyse why this had happened .
They published their conclusions in a pamphlet called " The organisational platform of the liberation communists " .
basically they said it came down to a lack of organisation unity & theoretical theory so that instead of having one or more national organisations the Russian anarchists were divided into a plethora of small groups .
They called for the creation of new organisations with unity of theory and action , where issues would be debated out , agreed and implemented by all the members .
Spain
If Russia proved that socialism could not be build through the state the Spanish revolution of 1936 proved that the anarchist method of organising the economy could work .
Spain had a mass anarchist union built over the course of a couple of decades .
When the military tried to launch a fascist coup in 1936 the members of the CNT led the fight against this coup that defeated half the military forces in Spain .
Through out much of Spain the government existed in name only , it commanded nothing .
The Spanish anarchists immediately set about the task of re-organising industry and agriculture not as the Russian Marxists had tried by decree from the top down but from the bottom up .
All over republican Spain peasants and workers met to decide how to re-organise their workplace .
These meetings elected delegates to regional bodies to decide on priorities for the national running of the economy .
Anarchist militias were created overnight to defend this revolution where the officers were elected and discipline was democratically decided .
Anarchists called the idea behind the national co-ordination mutual aid .
Whereas the Bolsheviks had used raiding parties to take food from the peasantry and had denied any initiative to the workers the anarchists used a different route .
They realised these people had made the revolution , they alone could defend and organise it .
When you gave aid to workers elsewhere it was not because you expected punishment if you did not or because you expected something directly in return .
It was because you realised it was in your interests to do so , by the same principle you supplied the lemon grove regions with food you were supplied by the factories with nails .
The success can be measured it the statistics so loved by economists .
700 trams came onto the streets of Barcelona where 600 had been .
Passengers carried increase from 183 million to 233 million .
The real proof is the reaction of the people , the CNT went into the revolution with perhaps one million members yet collectivisation covered 7 million .
The CNT was mostly an industrial union , it had only 34,000 members in Aragon , Navarre and Rioja yet here most of the land was collectivised .
Millions of non-members , peasants who Marxism had written off as only interested in their own patch of land voluntarily joined the collectives , sometimes not immediately but after the collectives had been demonstrated in practise .
Fascism & Stalinism
From the early 1900 's anarchism grew massively in Europe .
Syndicalists unions developed mass bases in most of the European countries , commonly they are still with us in name today .
But the period between the start of W.W.I and 1950 saw the distraction of much of what had been built .
The anarchist organisations that had been built in Italy and Germany were smashed by fascism .
During the second world war fascism smashed the organisations of Eastern Europe and France .
The anarchists played a major role in the resistance and as Germany was defeated went on to try and overturn capitalism in many of these countries .
In the west they were smashed by the allied armies with the aid of the communist parties , in the east they were smashed by Stalinism .
This reached a height in Bulgaria and right up to the 70's anarchists in the west campaigned for the release of the survivng Bulgarian anarchists .
Most did not survive that long they died in the purges and concentration camps of the Stalinists in the late 40's and early 50's .
This was aso a time when Russan marxism was attracting more and more followers in the west .
The russan economy seemed to be booming , they beat the US into space with Sputnik .
The anarchists were written out of the history books in country after country by right wing historans and marxists alike .
By the mid 60's anarchism was considered almost extinct as indeed was the prospect of socialist revolution .
The combination of adherance to the USSR on one hand and the creation of the welfare state on the other seemed to offer no place for anarchist politics .
Rebirth
Several events led to the re-birth of Anarchism throughout Europe .
The risings inEastern Europe in ' 56 and ' 68 put a question mark over the success of Soviet socialism .
The revolutionary wave that broke throughout the world in 1967 and ' 68 saw many looking for an alternative to the straight jacket moralism of the offical opposition in the shape of the social democrats and the CP's .
What emerged was , perhaps best typified by organisations like the 22nd July movement in Paris and commonly confused but it re-opened the discussion of anarchism and put the red and black flags back on the streets .
Francos ' death in 1976 saw nealy half a million people attend the first CNT demo in Barcelona .
The nature of the re-birth was such that as the revolutionary tide retreated many of the organisations collapsed and fragmented but out of these a minority built new organisation and started redeveloping the anarchist idea .
This process is currently being echoed in Eastern europe following the collapse of the regime and its move towards the market economy .
There too saw a rapid re-birth of anarchism and the rapid growth of anarchism as compared to any other left current .
There too mistakes were and are being made but out of these are arising a new movement .
To a large extent we are facing a stage cleared of much of the ideological drudge of the past .
The stateist left has collapsed or is in the process of collapsing .
It wont ' vanish for a while yet but the rump has no influence and for the most part is reduced to a call for past glories .
Anarchism today
We are very much part of that new growth in Anarchism .
The WSM was founded by people who had been through several earlier groups and were making the first steps in founding an Irish anarchist tradition .
Over the last few years however we have consolidated ourselves and made contacts internationally .
We have developed a reputation among activists as being serious and committed .
Syndicalism
Internationally syndaclism is by far the largest current in Anarchism .
We do n't consider syndaclism a complete set of answers but we recognise it as a significant step .
We are in contact with a number of syndaclist unions internationally both within the IWA and outside it .
These include the Spainish CNT , CGT and other unions with over 20,000 members and the Swedish SAC with some 15,000 .
Smaller unions and Propaganda groups exist in many other countires of the world .
Outside Europe
Anarchist groups have also re-emerged outside Europe and North america in Nigeria , South Korea , Japan and Uraguay amongother countires .
Lifestylism
One consequence of the historical weakness of anarchism in the English speaking world and of the collapse of this weak influence in the post WWI period is that on re-emergance the label was used by all sorts of people well outside the anarchist tradition .
To a large extent in the late 50's and early 60's in became devorced altogether from the class struggle and instead came to represent a combination of liberalism and lifestylism .
As a label it just came to mean dropping out and rejecting the present society , it lost its history of working class militancy , fighting back and winning .
in Britan the reaction to this came at the start of the 80's with the emergance of groups like Class War that in contrast to the pacifist liberalism of those who called themselves anarchists preached a creed of violence and McDonalds .
They representedthe new growth arriving in Britain along with groups like the Anarchist Communist Federationa and the Direct Action Movement .
What makes the WSM different
The WSM is different from any other left group in Ireland .
We have little in common with the Leninist left with their obsession with recuitment and slogan mongering and almost nothing in common with the reformist left .
Although we commonly work alongside members of these groups on specific interests our aims and methods of acheiving them are completly different from them .
We are also different if not so radically from many of the existing anarchist groups you may have come across .
Princaply this is because we place a high emphsis on the battle of ideas , we spend a lot of our time working out exactly what the bosses are up to and how to oppose them .
When we decide on something we all put it into practise .
This arises from the historical experiance of Anarchism .
Anarchism is a developing set of ideas not one carved in stone by a line of dead figure heads .
We belong to the tradition of anarchism that reassed its ideas after both the Russan and Spanish revolutions to counter act the mistakes anarchists made in these events .
This tradition is commonly know as ' Platformism ' within the anarchist movement after the 1927 pamphlet entitled the The Organisational Platform of the Libetaran communists .
Essentially the lessons this tradition holds are twofold .
Anarchist syndaclism is not a sufficent method of overthrowing capitalism .
As well as seizing the economic base of society as the syndaclists did in Spain it is necessary to physically smash the government as they did not .
They belived that once the control of the economy was in the hands of the workers all that was needed was to fight off the thrashings of the dying ruling class .
We do not , like the Friends of Durruti who opposed the CNT on this very issue we say .
Secondly a large loose organisation is not enough .
What is needed in an organisation based around tacticl and theoretical unity where disagreements are argued out and position adopted rather than ignored .
The loose organisations of the past had difficulty in arguing against authoratarian socialism and at times of crisis were inclined to follow the informal leadership .
Our experience
The test of Activity
The test of any anarchist organisation is in what it does and what it says .
Many leninist groups are happy to sit back and throw insults at each other , only popping out now and again for some token involvment .
We see particapation in struggle even at the current low level as th ecore to our politics .
Particapation alongside activists who do not share our views but with whom we have common aims in limited areas .
The purpose of our involment pure and simple is to win gains while demonstrating that anarchist methods are a practable means of struggle .
TUUAP & unions
The trade unions are central to out politics .
Not because we think they are revolutionary but because they are a body which unites most Irish workers even if in a distorted way .
They represent a collective recognition of the class struggle , unions exist as a recognition that bosses and wokers have contradictory interests .
The unions are however controlled by a bureaucracy that is un accountable to the membership .
In most unions it is difficult if not impossable for the members to alter policy .
On top of this bureaucrats are paid huge amounts in comparison to those they represent so that their life style resembles the bosses more than it does the workers .
Add to this the fact that increasing numbers of union officals have no experiance of working on thes hop floor at all but instead come straing out of industral relations school or student unions .
Its of little surprise that the bureaucracy can sometimes almost be as big a problem as the management .
We work to counter all these things and to make unions more democratic by building links beween shop stewards and union activists which can go around the bureaucracy and oppose it .
At the momet we are involved in Trade Union Fightback a grouping of union activists who oppose the Plan for Competitivness and simiar deals .
In the last two deals this group managed to co-ordiante considerable rank and file opposition .
We also get involved in strike support groups like the recent Pat the Baker one .
Our aim in this sort of involvment is not only to help win the strike but also build confidence among activists and demonstrate that workers can run campaigns etc for ourselves .
In short we aim to move away from dependance on any elite , bureaucratic or revolutionary .
DIAC
Although we see the unions and workplace as central to our politics we also see it as vital to get involved in issues affecting the wider community .
In recent years we were involved in the founding of the Dublin Abortion Information Capaign .
This provides an example of what it is possable for a samll group of revolutionaries to acheive .
At the time of its setting up we were the only far left group willing involved .
Presumable the others did not see abortion rights as an immediate issue for recruitment .
DIAC leaflettted in O'Connel st about once a month giving out ' illegal ' abortion information .
When the X case occured two years ago DIAC was out leafletting that Saturday and so in a position to act immediately .
It called pickets for the following week and a march on that Saturday .
This march saw some 15,000 particapate in and arguably resulted in the overturn of the injunction .
Publications & meetings
Anarchism is about ideas as well as action , in fact the two are intertwined .
As well as our activity demonstrating the practicality of anarchist methods of struggle we also belive its important to publisice anarchist history and theory .
Meetings such as these are one such forum but we also produce a regular magazine called Workers Solidarity .
In the future we will be producing a more theoretical magazine aimed at developing and discussing anarchist theory .
Our aim with all these is to stir away from the turgid jargon and mantra repeating of the marxist left and instead present our ideas in clear language .
International work
An Irish revolution would have no hope of succeeding on its own , capital is now multi-national and the fight of the workingclass against it has to regardless of natioanl boundaries .
We are regualar contact with 45 other anarchist organisations around the world covering every continent .
Our long term aim is to beome part of an international grouping or organisation .
One concrete activity we are involved in is solidarity action with comrades in other countires who come under state harassment .
This involves protest letters and embassy pickets and over the last year has included Nepal , Nigeria , Ukraine , Russia and Peru .
In addition to this we also have a solidarity fund for aiding anarchists particulalry in the third world with printing costs , legal fees and supporting the dependants of prisoners .
Making the future
That sums up perhaps what we see as anarchism and gives some clue as to how wesee the anarchist movement developing .
A revolution is possible and oppertunities for revolution will be thrown up within a couple of decades .
Its success will depend on the level of working class organisation and a widespread support for the project of building an anarchist society .
The work we are doing today is aimed at both these things , to build up the level of working class self activity and to promote the idea ofanarchism in general .
In fact these two go hand in hand .
Every individual has a contribution to make in this process and we hope you will look at anarachism in general , our politics in particual and joinus in this project .

Reading the July 2009 Government Accountability
Office report sparks about as much excitement as reading last month 's headlines , yet I can crack a smile at its earnest concern .
GAO is adding the US Postal Service 's ( USPS ) financial condition to the list of high - risk areas needing attention by Congress and the executive branch to achieve broad - based transformation .
I 'm sure our bureaucratic wizards are in the lab cooking up the next round of public finance models , with complications rivaling those of String Theory .
However , I 'm also sure that there will be nothing new in terms of results , aside from increased stamp prices – and perhaps a spike in short - term disability by way of calculator calluses .
Within the GAO report , one will find the crowning achievement of government detective work .
The United States Postal Service 's incompetence has finally shrieked loud enough for our masters to take notice .
Here are some of the report 's most keenly embarrassing lines .
This year , USPS expects to increase its year - end debt to $ 10.2 billion , and incur a cash shortfall of about $ 1 billion .
Another key risk factor is the accelerated decline in mail volume .
Mail volume declined by 9.5 billion pieces in fiscal year 2008 to about 203 billion pieces .
As of the end of May 2009 , mail volume had decreased another 18.5 billion pieces , and USPS expects to end fiscal year 2009 with mail volume of 175 billion pieces – about 28 billion pieces fewer than in fiscal year 2008 .
Table 1 : USPS 's Financial Results and Projections , Fiscal Years 2006 –2010 YEAR NET LOSS * YEAR -END DEBT 2006 $ 0.9 $ 2.1 2007 $ ( 5.1 ) $ 4.2 2008 $ ( 2.8 ) $ 7.2 2009 $ ( 7.0 ) $ 10.2 2010 $ ( 7.0 ) $ 13.2 * All dollars are in billions .
Even handicapped economists of the likes of Paul Krugman will attest that when falling demand is coupled with increased costs , we have a problem .
Does the decrease in mail volume indicate that the public has finally come to terms with reality ?
The GAO does n't think so .
They believe it is simply a matter of economics :
To achieve financial viability , USPS must align its costs with revenues , generate sufficient earnings to finance capital investment , and manage its debt .
Well , duh !
My fellow free marketers , there 's no need to worry .
With a motto like " Accountability , Integrity , and Reliability , " the Government Accountability Office will certainly correct such inefficiency .
Just look at their success in reforming programs in the last two decades .
Table 2 : Areas on GAO 's Current , 2009 High - Risk List PROGRAM AREA YEAR FIRST

Alas , despite the comical notion of " government accountability , " we can still imagine a room full of latté - drinking mental midgets listening attentively to what they believe to be breaking news ; we can imagine their fingers scribbling away at newly devised plans for reformation ; we can imagine them preparing for infinite inevitable boardroom meetings ; we can imagine countless proposals for interventionist solutions , inspired by the broken window fallacy .
And yet there is one thing we cannot imagine : the GAO bureaucrats accepting the solution of laissez - faire .
Obama signs bills for record Pentagon , Homeland Security spending
By Patrick Martin
30 October 2009
In a ceremony Wednesday , US President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing the largest ever military budget , a gargantuan $ 680 billion for the Pentagon , including $ 130 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
On Thursday , he signed a spending bill funneling another $ 44 billion into the Department of Homeland Security , to strengthen the apparatus of state repression within the United States .
The back - to - back bill signings are a clear demonstration that Obama is extending and intensifying the program of militarism and attacks on democratic rights for which the Bush administration was deservedly hated , in the United States and worldwide .
Each of the bills contained provisions aimed at further restricting democratic rights .
The Pentagon budget bill authorizes the use of military tribunals to try prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and others seized illegally , either overseas or within the US , as part of the “ war on terror . ”
It also bars the release of Guantanamo prisoners — even those found completely innocent — into the United States .
It prohibits bringing Guantanamo prisoners to trial on US soil without a 45 - day advance notice to Congress .
The Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill effectively prohibits the release of photographs taken by US military personnel during torture sessions at US bases in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .
It exempts these photos from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act , under which the American Civil Liberties Union and several media outlets have filed suit in federal court .
The exemption would apply , not just to the photos sought by the ACLU , but to any photos taken between September 11 , 2001 and January 22 , 2009 to which the Pentagon has objections .
Obama signed the record Pentagon budget less than three weeks after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize .
He then traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be photographed late Wednesday night standing at attention as the coffins of 18 US military personnel killed in Afghanistan in the last few days arrived in the United States .
A decision on how many additional US troops will be sent to Afghanistan is expected late next week , likely in the interval between the runoff presidential election in Afghanistan November 7 and Obama ’s departure for a lengthy trip to Asian capitals November 11 .
Obama ordered 21,000 more troops to the war last March , and the top US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , has requested an even greater number this fall to escalate the war .
The $ 680 billion authorized for the Pentagon in fiscal year 2010 is an increase of about 4 percent over the $ 654 billion authorized for fiscal year 2009 , despite the pledged drawdown of US forces deployed in Iraq .
The number of US troops in Iraq is projected to fall from 120,000 today to about 50,000 by September 2010 .
If the drawdown is significantly slower , or the war in Afghanistan escalates rapidly , the Obama administration will request a supplemental appropriations bill that could take total military spending beyond the highest level reached under George W. Bush .
At the signing ceremony , Obama singled out defense secretary Robert Gates , a holdover from Bush , for special praise , declaring , “ this effort would not have been possible without an extraordinary secretary of defense …on behalf of the American people , I want to thank you , Bob , for your extraordinary efforts . ”
The Pentagon bill includes a 3.4 percent pay raise for all military personnel , and increases troop levels by 55,000 , to a total of 1,425,000 in the US armed forces .
The military buildup had overwhelming bipartisan support , with all but one Senate Democrat backing the legislation , while some Republicans opposed because of the unrelated gay rights provision that was attached to the bill .
The US media paid relatively little attention to the bill ’s passage , or to the perfunctory , rubber - stamp character of the congressional debate .
Absurdly , the New York Times headlined its report on Obama ’s signing of the largest - ever military spending bill , “ Victory for Obama Over Military Lobby , ” claiming that the deletion of a few big - ticket weapons systems , notably the F - 22 fighter jet , represented “ reform . ”
The combined total of $ 724 billion for war and repression demonstrates the real priorities of the Obama administration , and the American ruling elite as a whole .
At that rate , the Pentagon and DHS will spend more in 18 months than the entire cost of Obama ’s so - called health care reform .
Two months of Pentagon / DHS spending would cover the budget deficits of all 50 states .
The appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes a raft of reactionary provisions :
Continued funding for the next three years of the E - Verify program , requiring employers to check the immigration status of workers against a federal database .
Funding a new program to monitor visitor exits from the United States , in addition to the current system of recording entries .
A 27 percent increase in cybersecurity spending , to $ 397 million .
$ 800 million for security measures along the US - Mexico border .
$ 1.5 billion to accelerate deportation of immigrants facing criminal charges .
One component of the Pentagon authorization bill is the Military Commissions Act of 2009 , which retains the military tribunals established by the Bush administration with a few cosmetic changes , such as prohibiting the use of prisoner testimony derived from torture .
Administration lobbyists successfully watered down more restrictive provisions adopted in the House version of the bill earlier this month .
A Department of Justice spokesman told Time magazine that the military commissions would be a “ viable option ” for certain Guantanamo prisoners .
White House officials have already made clear that they will not meet the January 20 , 2010 deadline for emptying Guantanamo , set by Obama amid much fanfare when he took office .
Obama ’s cynical attitude toward democratic rights was on display after the signing ceremony for the Pentagon bill .
He hailed the portion of the bill that extends federal hate crimes laws to include violence against gays and lesbians , meeting with the parents of Matthew Shepard , the young gay man beaten to death in Wyoming in 1998 .
The next day , the Obama administration moved quickly to enforce the prohibition on the release of military torture photos .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan sent a letter Thursday to the Supreme Court , apprising it of the legislation and declaring that she would file a supplemental brief on its effect on the ongoing ACLU lawsuit before the Court ’s conference November 6 .
FlashForward began with tremendous hype , being touted as the next Lost .
This alone set our expectations higher than normal for a new ABC series , normal being extremely low .
The pilot opened in epic disaster really pulling the viewer into this scene of complete turmoil and chaos following everyone in the worlds blacking out and seeing the future .
They really captured the feeling of world changing really well .
Everything for the first 17 minutes or so was on point and flawless and comparisons to Lost seemed legit… .
Then came the rest of the episode .
In typical lazy writing , the main character is a cop , well an FBI agent , you know like every lead character on a CBS show and hes a drunk , oh how original .
Even less creative , his wife is a doctor .
For gods sake if I see one more show where a character is a doctor I ’m going to book a flight to California and take a header off the Golden Gate .
Writers , stop being lazy , there ’s thousands of jobs you can choose from for a character , everyone does n’t need to be a cop or a doctor .
Be creative for once in your lives .
The writing here began to dip into the less than stellar category .
After the flash forward thousands of people are left dead , having gotten into car accidents , fallen down stairs , etc. and the FBI agent , who was chasing a terror suspect on the highway during the flash forward and his wife who is busy at work at the hospital treating the injured here exchange a phone call .
They have a child at home with a babysitter .
Do they run home like any normal sane human being would to make sure their little girl is ALIVE and well ?
Nope .
They just briefly talk to the babysitter .
They do n’t even bother checking in on their child ’s mental state having just experienced a trauma she could n’t possibly understand .
This is a problem which has cropped up quite a bit during the first three episodes .
The writing is decent , but its not thorough .
There are way too many plot holes , oversights and contrivances .
Things like what I just detailed do n’t per say ruin the show , but they do knock it down a notch or two .
Its an ambitious project , and when you take aim at something this detailed you have to be meticulous .
Everything needs to be looked at under a microscope to make sure it all fits and works , here it does n’t and a lot of things seem haphazardly thrown together .
Plot issues aside sadly , the real reason why this is n’t Lost , Fringe or even Invasion is the acting , merciful lord , the acting .
Earlier I reviewed CW ’s craptastic Vampire Diaries and I commented on how awful the acting was on that series , well , I stand now with egg on my face as FlashFoward has eclipsed even the worst of CBS shows in wooden , emotionless , dull , terrible acting .
This is the coffin nail for this show .
Over the course of three episode there has not been one good acting performance on the entire series .
Not one .
The FBI agent is awful , his wife is even worse , Harold is unwatchable and the FBI boss is perhaps the worst actor outside of the Saw series I have even seen in my life .
Really with a project this ambitious how can you hire a cast who would n’t even be serviceable in a day time soap opera ?
There is no reason for a cast to be this bad when there are so many good actors out there .
When your suppose to be the next Lost your cast should n’t make the cast of the Melrose Place reboot look like the cast of The Godfather .
Bottom line the show is n’t awful , but its not good either .
If you can tolerate the bad acting of CBS shows then you will likely enjoy this one as the plot is still pretty good despite a few hiccups .
However if your like me and are use to the astounding acting and plots of shows like Mad Men , Breaking Bad , Big Love , True Blood and Supernatural then this one might be tough for you to slog through .
So despite the hype do n’t expect this to be Lost , expect it to be more on the lines of Jericho and I would n’t expect it to be around for too long .
If I were you I ’d play it safe and just FlashForward to the DVD release date and add it to your Netflix .
Philippines : U.S. missed 9/11 clues years ago
Allegation follows congressional report faulting spy agencies
From Maria Ressa
CNN
MANILA , Philippines ( CNN ) – CNN has obtained documents showing a Philippine police report about the terrorist plot of September 11 , 2001 that was given to the FBI in 1995 and the U.S. agency 's summary document of the report , which left out any mention of the plot .
Philippine authorities said the United States did not take their information seriously .
The documents come on the heels of a congressional report that indicates the U.S. intelligence community missed several clues that could have added up to the terrorist plot before the attacks .
( Full story )
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of those attacks and the highest - ranking al Qaeda operative in custody , told his U.S. interrogators that planning for the attacks on New York and Washington began in 1994 in the Philippine capital .
In the mid-1990s , Mohammed , who had become al Qaeda 's third - highest - ranking leader by the time he was arrested in 2003 , lived in an apartment in Manila .
( Mohammed profile )
Mohammed told his U.S. interrogators that he and his nephew , Ramzi Yousef -- who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing -- began plotting what would become the September 11 attacks seven years earlier .
Test runs in the Philippines
In 1994 , the two tested airport security -- Mohammed on a flight from Manila to Seoul , South Korea ; Yousef on a flight from Hong Kong to Taipei , Taiwan .
Mohammed told authorities that the two men converted 14 bottles of contact lens solution into bombs by replacing their contents with an inexpensive liquid explosive readily available in the Philippines .
In place of a detonator , Mohammed said , he taped a metal bolt to the arch of his foot .
He then wore jewelry and clothing with metal to confuse airport security .
He said he and Yousef placed condoms in their bags to support their cover story that they were traveling to meet women .
Later that same year , Yousef would plant and explode a bomb on a Philippine Airlines flight during another test run .
He had boarded a jet in Manila under an assumed name , planted the device under a seat and left the aircraft during a layover .
The bomb exploded during the next leg of the flight , killing one passenger and injuring 10 others , but the plane remained intact and made an emergency landing in Japan .
The two were set to carry out a plot to bomb 11 U.S. - bound airliners over the Pacific in a 48 hour span -- attacks that the FBI estimates would have killed 4,000 people .
Those attacks were prevented when an accidental fire in their safe house apartment led to their cell being broken up .
Authorities searching Yousef 's laptop computer found detailed plans to blow up the airliners -- including flight numbers and schedules , and bombmaking formulas .
Mohammed was indicted in the United States in 1996 for his alleged involvement in that conspiracy .
That indictment landed him on the FBI 's list of 22 Most - Wanted Terrorists , issued in October 2001 .
Only one member of the cell was arrested in the raid : Abdul Hakim Murad , Yousef 's classmate , who had trained as a commercial pilot at four aviation schools in the United States .
Col .
Rodolfo Mendoza , a counterterroism expert with the Philippines police , interrogated Murad and discovered what he believes is the blueprint for September 11 .
In addition , the plots uncovered in Manila included one to assassinate the U.S. president and plans to attack nuclear power plants .
" They had a plan to crash the airplane -- the commercial jetliner -- into the specific target , " Mendoza said .
" They have done it after seven years .
So I believe all these plans , old plans , are supposed to be executed . "
The 1995 report listed the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as targets .
Philippine authorities say all the information they discovered was handed over to the FBI .
Top al Qaeda figure
Mohammed told interrogators that the 1995 operation was his first for al Qaeda .
Born in Kuwait in either March 1964 or April 1965 , Mohammed 's al Qaeda roots run deep and wide
Through the years , he passed along the lessons he learned to agents he controlled , including so - called millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam and shoe bomber Richard Reid .
Ressam , 34 , has been convicted of conspiracy to detonate a suitcase bomb at Los Angeles International Airport on New Year 's Eve of 1999 .
He is awaiting sentencing .
Reid pleaded guilty to trying to blow up an airliner with explosives concealed in his shoes , and in February was sentenced to life in prison .
The United States accuses Mohammed of being involved in planning large - scale al Qaeda operations , from the bombing of the USS Cole in a Yemeni harbor in 2000 to the bombing of the bar frequented by westerners in Bali , Indonesia , last year .
Al Qaeda expert Rohan Gunaratna said Mohammed ordered the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl , who was kidnapped in Pakistan in 2002 while researching an article and later found dead .
Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah , who is in U.S. custody , has named Mohammed as a key financial figure in the September 11 attacks .
Parents in Barnsley have been criticised by police for drinking alcohol when dropping off and collecting their children from school .
Complaints have been made about drinking in the street around Doncaster Road primary school in the town .
Councillors and police are to meet to discuss banning drinking alcohol in the streets around the school .
If the ban is implemented police will have the power to confiscate alcohol and drinkers could face a £ 500 fine .
' Not acceptable '
Det Insp Mark Spooner , of Barnsley 's Central Safer Neighbourhood
Team , said they had been getting reports of drinking in the streets around the school and also of parents drinking whilst waiting to pick up their children .
He said : " In my view that 's clearly not acceptable .
It 's not acceptable in a modern society and we will put a stop to it . "
Safer Neighbourhood
Teams consist of police , community support officers , impact wardens and neighbourhood wardens .
They work within communities to deal with local problems such as street drinking .
Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council will meet to discuss the proposed ban on 7 October .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : mecha-0.0.0
A few months ago , I started toying with a few alternative pump designs to power our hydraulic hybrids .
After not being able to secure a ProE license , I searched for a free solid modeler to sketch out a few ideas .
To my surprise , their are practically no open source 3D CAD packages available .
So I created Mecha , DSL for constructive solid modeling .
Mecha 's geometry is based on octrees , which makes it easy to perform set operations on solids , as well as volumetric calculations such as center - of - mass , moments of inertia , and of course , total volume .
Drawbacks of octrees include consuming a lot of memory and the loss of some surface information .
To address the later , Mecha carries forward surface points and normals to the leaf nodes of the octree to assist in rendering , such that solids do n't look like they 're made from a bunch of LEGOS .
Note this is a very early release .
The only thing Mecha can do at the moment is draw a pretty blue ball -- well it can also zoom and pan on a pretty blue ball ( mouse wheel ) .
Establishing a primitive API and building a primitive library must be finished before Mecha an do anything useful .
Any comments and suggestions are welcome .

Stem cells so far have been used to mend tissues ranging from damaged hearts to collapsed tracheas .
Now the multifaceted cells have proved successful at regrowing bone in humans .
In the first procedure of its kind , doctors at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center replaced a 14 - year - old boy 's missing cheekbones — in part by repurposing stem cells from his own body .
The technique , should it be approved for widespread use , could benefit some seven million people in the U.S. who need more bone — everyone from cancer patients to injured war veterans .
" This is sort of the holy grail for a number of different surgeons , " says Jesse Taylor , a surgeon and researcher in the hospital 's Division of Plastic Surgery and one of the procedure 's lead physicians .
The procedure could be used in plastic , orthopedic and neural surgeries , he notes .
Some bone tissue had previously been generated from stem cells in the lab , but this marks hope for a surgical solution for those who need additional bone .
" We often find ourselves in the operating room saying , ' Man , I wish we had a little more bone , ' " Taylor says .
In adult patients plastic and metal have often subbed in , in the absence of bone , but as Taylor notes : " What happens if someone gets a fracture ?
It 's another surgery . "
In contrast , a natural bone regrown from stem cells should heal on its own .
Another alternative , bone transplants — either repurposed from the patient 's body or from cadavers — have high rejection and absorption rates , leading to many unsuccessful attempts .
To create the new bones , which have become part of the patient 's own skull structure and have remained securely in place for four and a half months , the medical team used a combination of fat - derived stem cells , donated bone scaffolds , growth protein , and bone - coating tissue .
No culturing required
After honing the bone - growth technique in laboratory pigs for more than two years , Taylor and his team were ready to attempt it in a person .
Their first patient was Brad Guilkey , who had been born with Treacher Collins syndrome ( TCS ) , a rare genetic defect , which in Guilkey 's case resulted in the absence of some of his facial bones .
Guilkey , who was 14 at the time of the surgery , had been born without either zygomatic bone — the two upper cheekbones that protect the eyes and form the normal cheek contours .
" We were basically able to make new ones for Brad , " says Taylor of the bones .
Before the surgery , Guilkey 's face sloped slightly inward — and his eyes downward — and a lack of protective bone left his eyes vulnerable , especially when he played his favorite sports , basketball and baseball .
Unlike many other stem cell treatments , such as heart patches , the procedure Taylor and his colleagues used did not require any advance culturing or growth in the lab .
The intensive , daylong surgical procedure included every step — from the stem cell harvesting through liposuction to bone implantation .
The group chose fat stem cells over those from bone marrow largely because of the ease of access .
" One of the neat things about adipose - derived stem cells is they 're very easy to harvest , " Taylor says .
They also exist in just about the same proportion as bone marrow stem cells , which can be more difficult to obtain .
For the surgery , Taylor and his team shaped donor bone — from cadaver - donated femurs — to resemble zygomatic bones and act as a biological scaffold for the bone to grow on .
Mesenchymal stem cells , harvested from Guilkey 's fat , and growth - encouraging morphogenetic protein - 2 ( BMP - 2 ) , were injected into holes drilled into the scaffolds .
Before implanting the bone sections into Guilkey 's face , Taylor and his team wrapped them in periosteum tissue , which covers bone surfaces and was harvested from Guilkey 's leg .
The surrounding material , especially the periosteum and the growth protein , helped to cue the stem cells to produce bone tissue .
New bones for all ?
The new technique may have applications across the board for those who need bone regeneration , but it may not be as successful — or as simple — in every case .
Some of the procedure 's effectiveness may be due to Guilkey 's youth .
" The periosteum , which is probably the most important component , changes as you get older , " Taylor says .
This membrane , which covers healthy bones , helps to supply bones with blood and nutrients , encouraging growth and healing .
So new bone may not generate as quickly in a 70 - year - old as someone in his or her teens , he notes .
The team is performing tests on pigs of different ages to see how much of a role senescence plays in the growth and healing process .
Overcoming genetic diseases , such as Guilkey 's TCS , can be challenging , Taylor notes , as repurposing that person 's biological material does not eliminate the mutations that caused a lack of bone in the first place .
Although Taylor gives Guilkey 's procedure better than a 50 – 50 chance of long - term success , he remains cautious .
" The real proof of the pudding of this concept will be whether it 's there in five years , " he says .
If it is , " that will be really amazing . "
Other , more traditional bone grafts for similar patients often start to come loose within a few months of the procedure .
But , he says , Guilkey 's new bones remain " rock steady . "
Using the procedure in cancer patients may prove to be the most difficult due to intensive scarring and the fact that the growth protein , BMP - 2 , is not approved for use in people with cancer .
Traumatic injuries will likely be the easiest to fix , provided the patient can wait six months to a year for scars to heal , says Taylor .
Unknown mechanisms
The results from Guilkey 's surgery show that culturing stem cells extensively before implanting them might not be the only path to take in developing new stem cell treatments .
" We 're thinking at this point that that might not be such a great idea — to induce them into becoming something [ specific ] .
Maybe some of these cells need to become something else , " Taylor says .
To grow bone , the body also needs vascular cells , fat cells and others .
So why , Taylor proposes , limit a stem cell implantation to only one kind of cultured , differentiated cell ?
The procedure does highlight the vast amount of research that remains to be done .
" There 's so much we do n't know , " Taylor says .
" And to pretend that we have control over everything is presumptuous . "
He favors using biological rather than artificial scaffolds .
" I try to use as many natural cues and processes as possible , " he says .
" There 's a lot we do n't understand mechanistically , " so he prefers " putting it in an environment that says , ' Become a bone . ' "
Although the approach may sound overly simplistic for Guilkey and at least and two other patients who have undergone the procedure since , it appears to have been successful .
" It 's primitive , but it works , " Taylor says .
" Now the onus is on us to figure out why it works . "
In the meantime , Taylor says , Guilkey , now 15 , has become a lot more outgoing and has even cut his hair short for the first time in his life — rather than try to cover up his face with long locks .
Taylor reports that the teen has been able to return to sports and is now dating .
On Tuesday , the Denver Westword , a respected alt - weekly , posted an unusual job opening on its Web site .

Obama : Men need to be ' knocked across the head ' when it comes to sharing family duties
Barack Obama has announced that men ' need to be knocked across the head ' to see the imbalance between how much work fathers and mothers put into raising children .
The U.S. president said he knew it was not fair for his wife Michelle to have to ' make sacrifices ' all the time .
But he admitted that , even so , he has not managed to achieve equality in his own home .
Sharing the burden : Left to right , President Barack Obama , daughter Sasha Obama , First Lady Michelle Obama , and daughter Malia Obama come home from church earlier this month
The president was also forced to defend a game of basketball he played with members of his Cabinet recently after no women were involved , slamming criticisms as ' bunk ' .
Speaking in a television interview last night , Mr Obama admitted : ' There 's no doubt that our family , like a lot of families out there , were ones in which the men are still a little obtuse about this stuff .
He acknowledged things are different now for his wife , Michelle , and him given that they live in the White House with all its creature comforts and army of residence staff .
' Today 's Obama family is obviously not typical , ' he said .
However he quickly added : ' Five years ago , six years ago , though , we were having a lot of negotiations .
Because Michelle was trying to figure out , OK , if the kids get sick why is it that she 's the one who has to take time off of her job to go pick them up from school , as opposed to me ?
If , you know , the girls need to shop for clothes .
' You know , why is it that it 's her burden and not mine . '
The president said he tried to learn to be better - ' to be thoughtful enough and introspective enough that I was n't always having to be told that things were unfair .
' That once in a while , I 'd actually voluntarily say , ' You know what ?
Let me relieve this burden on you .
Let me make some sacrifices , in terms of how I 'm using my time . ''
He did not succeed , he admitted .
' The truth is that Michelle still had to make sacrifices of the sort that I did not have to make , ' he said .
Mr Obama also played down a recent basketball game with male members of his Cabinet and lawmakers .
No women took part in the game , played on a White House court .
The president said it was a standing game among House members that simply relocated to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue .
He faced criticism for the all - guys game ; but brushed it off and said it was nothing more than basketball .
' I think this is bunk , ' he said .
The Obama administration has made transparency and public access to government information a high priority .
Adobe is attempting to capitalize on initiatives to make government information more accessible while promoting its technologies , such as Flash and PDF , as cornerstones for implementing open access .
However , these technologies are actually an impediment to making information truly accessible .
Adobe has set up its " Adobe Opens Up " website to promote the use of Adobe technologies to achieve the goal of " opening up Washington , " as well as highlighting ways in which federal , state , and local governments have implemented these technologies .
While we agree that making information available in common formats , like PDF , is one helpful piece of this puzzle , we can't help but notice how the entire site — designed in Flash — is practically inaccessible .
After just a cursory browsing , here are some of the usability and data accessibility issues we observed .
You can't select , copy , or paste any text .
Your browser 's font override features wo n't work , so you can't adjust the font or its size to be more readable .
Your browser 's built - in in - page search wo n't work , and you can't use the keyboard to scroll through the text .
You can't parse or scrape the data in any way ; the design is fixed - width , so it 's not going to work well on different screen sizes ; and browser plugins , like Greasemonkey , can't adjust anything .
Basically when it comes to text at all , if you do n't like the style or are visually impaired , you 're screwed .
All the content of Adobe 's " open government " site is locked inside of Flash .
Sunlight Labs , a nonprofit , nonpartisan Washington , DC based organization focused on digitization of government data and making tools and websites to make it easily accessible , similarly feels that technologies like Flash and PDF — while ubiquitous and useful — do not intrinsically make government more open .
In particular , the group is critical of the fact that data in PDF format is not easily parsable into other useful forms .
PDFs are great for presenting data and information in a particular format , and the format is a useful tool for getting that formatted version to the public .
Anyone who has tried to copy and paste more than one line of text from a PDF , though , has likely experienced the issues that can happen — unrelated text from sidebars or the margins often ends up inline , requiring custom editing .
As one example to illustrate the problem further , Sunlight Labs recently had to write custom software to parse a 1,018 page healthcare reform bill ( H.R. 3200 " America 's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 " ) that was provided to the public only in PDF format .
Without this parsing , any analysis of the text would need to be done by hand .
Further , we note the irony of the fact that the bill Sunlight Labs was attempting to analyze is actually stored internally in XML format , but only offered to the public in PDF form .
XML is easily converted to a formatted PDF , which is what the House did to generate the PDF that it made available .
Going the other direction — from formatted PDF to structured , machine - readable data — is a much harder , and sometimes insurmountable , task .
It 's also worth noting that XML is also easily transformed to other structured formats , like HTML .
Wrapping all publicly accessible information in proprietary formats is neither a good nor complete solution .
Providing documents in PDF form , or augmenting a website with additional Flash content is certainly useful .
However , the goal of open government would be better served using open standards , like HTML , XML , JSON , ODF , and other formats that are both accessible and machine - readable .
Doing so ensures that public information truly remains usable by the public .
Luminous band - aids
Last night after bedtime Katara asked for a small band - aid for her knee .
I went into the bathroom to get one , and unwrapped it in the dark .
The band - aid itself is circular , about 1.5 cm in diameter .
It is sealed between two pieces of paper , each about an inch square , that have been glued together along the four pairs of edges .
There is a flap at one edge that you pull , and then you can peel the two glued - together pieces of paper apart to get the band - aid out .
As I peeled apart the two pieces of paper in the dark , there was a thin luminous greenish line running along the inside of the wrapper at the place the papers were being pulled away from each other .
The line moved downward following the topmost point of contact between the papers as I pulled the papers apart .
It was clearly visible in the dark .
I 've never heard of anything like this ; the closest I can think of is the thing about how wintergreen Life Savers glow in the dark when you crush them .
My best guess is that it's a static discharge , but I do n't know .
I do n't have pictures of the phenomenon itself , and I 'm not likely to be able to get any .
But the band - aids look like this :
Have any of my Gentle Readers seen anything like this before ?
A cursory Internet search has revealed nothing of value .
[ Addendum 20180911 : The phenomenon is well - known ; it is called triboluminescence .
Thanks to everyone who has written in over the years to let me know about this .
In particular , thanks to Steve Dommett , who wrote to point out that , if done in a vacuum , triboluminescence can produce enough high - energy x-rays to image a person 's finger bones ! ]

“ They are n’t something you can walk up to and touch , ” Jerrold E. Marsden , an engineering and mathematics professor at Caltech , said of the structures .
“ But they are not purely mathematical constructions , either . ”
As an analogy , Dr. Marsden suggests imagining a line that divides a part of a city that has been affected by a disease outbreak from a part that has not .
The line is not a fence or a road , but it still marks a physical barrier .
And as the outbreak spreads , the line will change .
To find the structures , scientists must track flow , not by watching it go by but from the perspective of the droplets of water or molecules of air moving in it .
“ It ’s like being a surfer , ” Dr. Campbell said .
“ You want to catch the wave and move with the wave . ”

In the laboratory , researchers shine lasers on tiny particles caught in a flow , capturing their speed and trajectory with fast , high - resolution digital cameras similar to the way tracer rounds from machine guns track the path of bullets .
In the ocean or atmosphere , scientists rely on instantaneous data from high - frequency radar , laser detection systems , buoys and satellites .
In the human body , phase - contrast magnetic resonance imaging has helped researchers map the complex patterns of blood flow in detail .
Computers take in the data from all those sources , applying algorithms that unveil the flow structures .
“ We ’re just recognizing that these things exist and are playing a role in a variety of scenarios , ” said Thomas Peacock , a mechanical engineering professor at M.I.T. who is evaluating how Lagrangian coherent structures affect vehicle performance and efficiency .
“ The idea is that cars , airplanes and submarines down the line would be fitted with sensors that will help them adapt to these structures . ”
Studies of the air flow patterns surrounding Hong Kong International Airport have shown that Lagrangian coherent structures cause unexpected jolts to planes during landing attempts , forcing pilots to waste fuel while they revert to holding patterns .
George Haller , an engineering professor at McGill University in Montreal who forged the mathematical criteria for finding such structures in fluid flows , is working with the airport ’s officials to design a tool that allows pilots to see and navigate around the structures .
It will rely on data from laser scans , analyzed by computers as planes approach the airport .
A man was killed early Saturday morning when he rolled his SUV in the parking lot of a north Phoenix bar after refusing offers for rides from witnesses and a cabbie , authorities said .
Witnesses told police that Caleb Schmidt , 21 , had been drinking late Friday and into Saturday morning at a bar on Happy Valley Road .
When Schmidt got up to leave at about 2:30 a.m. , several people tried to talk him out of driving , police said .
One person even reportedly called a cab company .
They followed Schmidt to his 1999 Dodge Durango to try to stop him from driving .
Authorities said that a taxi pulled into the parking lot , blocking Schmidt 's Durango .
According to police , witnesses said Schmidt sat behind the wheel of the SUV with the driver - side door open as he threatened the cab driver .
The cab driver moved the taxi and parked .
Police gave the rest of this account :
Someone reached into the driver 's side of the Durango and tried to get Schmidt 's keys .
Schmidt floored the Durango with the driver 's door still open .
He was apparently not wearing a seat belt .
He immediately lost control .
The Durango did a 180 - degree - turn , struck a concrete median and hit a tree , rolling onto Schmidt , who had fallen out of the SUV 's open door .
Schmidt 's blood alcohol content could not be determined at the time .
Most farmers look at a crop field and see profit , or hope to .
When farmer Bryan Gilvesy looks over his 44 acres of native tall - grass prairie in Norfolk County , Ont. , on Lake Erie , he sees truly green fields .
By planting this ancient " crop , " which once covered much of Southern Ontario and is now one of the most endangered in North America , he is also showing that farmers can become leaders in combating climate change .
These native grasses thrive in draught , extreme heat and poor soils .
The roots , which plunge up to 16 feet into the ground , can sequester as much as 1.8 metric tons of carbon per acre .
The extensive cover , up to seven feet high , can either feed livestock or produce a biofuel that regenerates year after year without damaging inputs , making it far superior to corn .
So what the former tobacco farmer turned environmental visionary would also like to see when he looks out over his grand experiment is payment for producing not only food but clean air , water and soil .
Gilvesy is the chair of the Alternative Land Use Services ( ALUS ) project in Norfolk County , which is developing a new model for farm support that could shift Canadian agriculture into a greener future .
The farmer - driven initiative has cobbled together a small , $ 1 million budget from 16 funding sources to run a three - year pilot that pays farmers $ 150 annually for every acre they devote to ecological functions , the rental rate for cropland in the area .
" We need to pay farmers in order to engage them to protect nature , " says Gilvesy .
" Farmers are highly skilled water managers .
Farmers understand soil .
They 're experts at sequestering carbon .
Farmers are excellent stewards of the land .
Paying farmers attaches a value on ecological services they provide that all of society benefits from . "
The incentive is clearly effective .
In just two growing seasons and with just one staff person , 53 farming families that work some 6,300 acres have managed to convert 438 of those most vulnerable acres into waterway buffers , wetlands , pollinator hedgerows , prairie grass and native Carolinian forest and oak savannah .
The project is a small green example of what agriculture , globally , must pursue on a grand scale .
Agriculture and food production in North America and Europe are major contributors to greenhouse gasses ( accounting for up to 20 per cent of emissions per country ) , and industrial agriculture is responsible for extensive degradation of the world 's waterways .
The European Union overhauled its agricultural subsidies to support environmental stewardship and ecological food production .
But Canada 's new agricultural policy , unveiled this year , remains stuck in the past , with no strong targets for reducing the sector 's environmental impacts .
Implementing ALUS across Canada , according to a review commissioned by the Delta Waterfowl Foundation , would conserve 36 million acres of environmentally sensitive areas on private farmland – the size of the state of Michigan – and deliver $ 820 million in societal benefits through greenhouse gas sequestration alone .
The work of Gilvesy and his band of Norfolk farmers has grabbed the attention of major conservation organizations , farming groups and local food enthusiasts .
Last spring , 78 of them formed the Ontario ALUS Alliance to press for government funding to continue growing ALUS across the province .
The Ontario government has resisted , and the program has generated little interest at the federal level .
Gilvesy remains undeterred .
He sees ALUS as the future of farming .
And he 's far from alone .
The first major global assessment of agriculture , initiated by the World Bank and United Nations and delivered last year , called for a shift to ecological farming systems ; payment to farmers for restoring land , soil and air , to ensure future harvests ; and a new partnership between farmers and science to increase ecological food production rather than corporate profits .
Often dubbed agriculture 's Kyoto , it concluded that Canada 's dominant form of agriculture – high - input , energy - intensive , export - oriented industrial food production – was no longer a viable option as it causes soil and water degradation , increases deforestation , undermines rural livelihoods , and , if unchecked , will threaten future world food supplies .
The assessment won the support of 59 countries .
Only three dissented : Canada , the United States and Australia .
The Canadian government has all but buried the assessment , not even submitting it to the standing committee on agriculture and agri-food .
That hardly surprises University of Toronto professor Harriet Friedman , one of hundreds of experts from around the world who developed the assessment .
" All three countries have a high commitment to massive production of crops and livestock for export .
When a certain production system becomes widespread , ministries develop to support it .
But they 'll have to shift fundamentally . "
How that 's done will require a major overhaul of the more than $ 8 billion Canada currently spends on agricultural programs .
The Harper government 's new national policy for agriculture , " Growing Forward , " merely bundles together old programs and includes no support for shifting agriculture into a greener future .
According to University of Saskatchewan agricultural economics expert Murray Fulton , the policy sinks billions into income- stabilization programs that largely protect export commodity producers from world price fluctuations .
Risk - management programs are " disaster subsidies " – bailouts for a system of agriculture that actually creates the conditions for those disasters , as industrial farming methods make animals and crops vulnerable to disease , pest infestations and drought .

The first outbreak of swine flu was in the Mexican village of La Gloria , which is surrounded by factory swine and poultry operations , and villagers complained for years about respiratory infections before the outbreak of the pandemic .
Such tax - funded bailouts are not helping farmers become economically sustainable .
Government programs and industry encouraged farmers to invest millions in expensive technology so they can produce more with less labour .
Now Canadian farmers are staggering under a collective debt of more than $ 50 billion .
But the profits , or even savings , have not flowed back to farmers .
According to the National Farmers Union ( NFU ) , net farm income plunged to zero this decade , while a whole supply chain that feeds off the work of farmers – food processors , retailers , chemical and seed companies , equipment dealers – harvested record profits .
What 's required to change this , along with payment for environmental stewardship , is support for production of healthier foods and more ecologically farming methods .
The shift to that is happening , if slowly , and it 's partly the result of a surge in consumer demand for local and sustainable foods .
Transitioning just 10 per cent of Ontario's cropped acres into organic production ( from the current 1 per cent ) would reduce environmental costs of agriculture by $ 2.18 billion over 15 years , according to a study commissioned by the Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada .
Government support for the program would cost $ 51 million , but farmers would save on expensive , damaging fertilizers and pesticides and also get an organic premium in the market , reducing other agriculture support payments to farmers .
Says Friedman : " We all live in this ecosystem .
It 's our collective responsibility to pay farmers if they 're growing health food and providing ecosystem services for us .
They get a good living , respect and skilful and interesting work producing food that can be afforded by everyone . "
NB : for the purposes of this article , we have gone with the same definition of a volley as suggested in this piece : namely that a volley is only a volley when it does not touch the floor between the previous player touching the ball and the ball being struck at goal ( it does not matter how many touches the striker has ) .
No , we are not naïve enough to expect all comments to adhere to this definition .
Also , this list does not purport to be definitive .
We are aware that Marco van Basten 's volley in the European Championship final of 1988 is probably among the top six goals of all time , never mind the top six volleys , but we decided to do something else .
We hope this does not spoil your day .
Many descriptions of sporting greatness justifiably refer to a subject who has been able to bend a seismic contest to his will , but even rarer is the man who can bend it to his skill .
There has been no more significant football example than Zinedine Zidane 's volley in the European Cup final of 2002 , the greatest winning goal in history * .
Never mind two goals in a World Cup final and a chestbutt that almost made violence cool ; this was absolutely Zizou 's zenith .
In some respects , the best part is not the whirling volley but the furious concentration as the ball drops from the heavens .
Zidane stares at the ball like a stalker before contorting his body into a grotesque and ugly position - but one that enabled him to produce a moment of unforgettable beauty .
* By this we mean the final goal in a single - goal victory
There are flying volleys .
There are lobs .
There are shots with the outside of the foot .
There are flying volleyed lobs .
There are flying volleys with the outside of the foot .
There are lobs with the outside of the foot .
And then there 's this sinew - straining , foot - tensing masterpiece .
( There is also an amusingly Verónish aspect to it .
Not even Enoch Powell was as loath to embrace the left as the entirely right - footed Verón , who simply refuses to use his left foot in case the wind changes . )
The volley is widely perceived as the hardest skill in football , but the flip side of that difficulty is that it is the perfect tool with which to demonstrate your superiority , as Eric Cantona showed at Selhurst Park in 1994 .
The backstory is important here : Cantona should have been sent off in the previous round , at Norwich , and in the seemingly interminable build - up to this match ( the FA Cup was big news in those days ) , Wimbledon promised to ruffle his feathers , get in his face , and other popular cliches .
Early on Vinnie Jones piled in with a laughable and predictable reducer ; Cantona simply looked Jones up and down with the sort of magisterial contempt that only he could muster , and then , just before half - time , showed how you really hurt someone on a football field .
Gary Elkins made his only contribution to football history by heading Denis Irwin 's long cross to the edge of the box , whereupon Cantona killed the ball with a velvety touch and then leathered it beyond Hans Segers .
It was a perfectly unanswerable piece of skill that broke Wimbledon , who had been in the game until then , completely .
There is some rather absurd revisionism going round about Cantona 's contribution to the Premier League .
He might not have been the greatest overseas player in English football history - the quality of the game in this country has increased so much in the last 15 years - but nobody has been so superior to his peers .
And nobody knew how to demonstrate that superiority in such a regal manner .
This was not a footballer ; this was Cantona .
One of football 's more cringeworthy experiences occurs when a player - someone like Gary Neville or , well , Gary Neville - lines up a long - range shot that everyone else in the entire world knows is going miles over the bar .
They rumble towards the ball , convinced that they are about to define their careers ; we recoil behind the sofa .
It 's like seeing your mate try to pull someone palpably out of their league .
The same feeling prevailed when Darío Rodríguez galumphed towards the ball , almost in slow motion , during the World Cup match between Denmark and Uruguay in 2002 .
The set - up had been so perfect , with the ball not touching the floor after a corner had been headed clear then controlled , controlled again and flipped sideways by Pablo Garcia , that you just knew Rodríguez was about to endanger low - flying aircraft .
Except he did n't .
He slashed across the ball immaculately to send it spinning away from Thomas Sorensen and into the corner .
The skill from Garcia made the goal even more special - tic , tic , tic , BOOM - and Rodríguez set off with the entirely warranted celebration of a man who had indeed defined his career .
( And equalised for his country in a vital World Cup game but , well , we 're all human . )
We have eulogised this pair of volleys once or twice before , but we 'll never tire of doing so .
The same game !
To misquote Walter Sobchak in The Big Lebowski : a volley is not ' Nam ; there are rules .
And Rule No1 is that you do not hit a volley while leaning back .
That , among other things , makes Hans Krankl 's wundergoal in the 1978 World Cup so special .
When he controlled the ball he was facing his own goal , but managed to adjust quickly to manufacture the shot and then control it perfectly with the instep .
Given the angle of his body , which was going backwards like a falling oak , it 's a miracle that he kept the ball in the stadium , never mind on target .
The quickness of his movements , both physically and mentally , is also startling : there is a lovely moment in the split - second between the first and second touches when we realise what he has done , and is about to do : snap , Krankl , pop .
Or , as the peerless Barry Davies put it , " Oh Krankl ! Ohhh Kraaankl ! "
Incidentally , at first the appreciation of this goal was diluted by the fact that , for Austria , it was a dead game .
But then no game between Austria and West Germany was dead , as this commentary of Krankl 's subsequent winner confirms .
The world 's first cannabis college has opened in the US .
Medical marijuana is being grown legally in the college 's laboratories in Oakland , California , and the city council is taxing sales of the drug .
Campaigners have said the rest of debt - ridden California should follow their example and legalise cannabis .
College head Richard Lee said the industry is worth an estimated $ 15bn in California so sales tax alone would bring in $ 1.5bn ,
" We learned with alcohol prohibition in the 1920s that when you make it illegal it does n't stop people from drinking , it just causes more crime and violence and less respect for law and law enforcement . "

Arsenal ’s financial health has long remained an intriguing subject for football enthusiasts .
The only subject possibly more intriguing in English football is Arsene Wenger ’s strict policy concerning transfers and wages .
How they relate to each other ; and more importantly , what the future holds for the team even opposing fans love to watch ?
Arsene Wenger stands tall in the stand of Old Trafford .
He keeps his cool when commenting about grossly unfair referring decision against him , or when the crowd of his biggest rivals throw explosive words .
Strong belief and sense of purpose keeps him so unfazed – in front of an abusive crowd , against a xenophobic media , against the disbelief of a part of his own fans and players , and under the pressure of four fruitless years after a tremendous run of success .
He has chosen not to become reactive in the wake of trying times .
A Remarkable Transformation
Nowadays fans are used to watching Arsenal playing free - flowing total football ; it ’s hard to believe that once the Gunners were known for their boring defensive style , producing clean sheet after clean sheet with commanding bullying defenders .
Many feel that Wenger ’s biggest success at Arsenal is not a pile of trophies , but this change to the team whose soul now is as open and free as it ’s game .
Arsenal are now a consortium of internationals from every corner of the world , and one of the top breeding grounds for new stars .
The New Challenge
After the ‘ Invincibles ’ era , Wenger could have rested on his laurels , or moved on to the Madrids or the Milans of the world .
However , for the last few years , after the new ( and allegedly very quiet ) Emirates Stadium took over from the legendary Highbury , the professor has embarked on a new challenge .
His previous mission has , to a good extent , changed the style of English club football .
If his new mission succeeds , it may change the way big clubs worldwide plan their winning strategy .
Arsenal ’s new challenge sounds very simple , live within your means and whilst doing so remain a super - club .
That breaks down to : keep winning trophies , keep posting profits , be in the top 10 richest clubs when measured by turnover , keep a high credit rating and control debt , retain brand - value worldwide ; and do all these by spending only as much as you earn , retaining the current management and remaining focused on long term goals .
The Approach And The Setbacks
The foremost step that the Arsenal board took to become an independent super - club was to replace the 36,000 capacity Highbury with a 60,000 stadium at Ashburton Grove .
They debated and rejected the option of renting Wembley from the FA , and consistently remained hostile to rumoured takeovers ; eventually causing the departure of vice - chairman David Dein , a close ally of Arsene Wenger , who disagreed on both counts .
The board also decided to ride the housing boom and develop premier apartments on the site of the old ground , named Highbury Square , which should help stadium loan repayments : at least it seemed that way when the property bubble was fully inflated .
Two unforeseen economic factors hit this otherwise sound looking plan .
Firstly , the rapid fall of Sterling against Euro and Dollar , thus weakening British clubs relative spending power in the world transfer market .
Secondly , the bursting of the housing bubble , leaving some of the Highbury Square apartments unoccupied and at the same time losing value .
Wenger ’s Financial Principles
Perhaps this is the time when Wenger polished and adapted his principles to align with his club ’s policies and the changing world around him .
The professor decided that in the present circumstances he had to choose one of two extremes , and the club ’s financial backbone was not strong enough to go the Chelsea route of spend now and worry about the balance sheet later .
Or perhaps , he simply chose to follow his heart .
Wenger put an iron leash on an already tight wage and transfer budget .
That actually made it easier for some of the ‘ Invincibles ’ to leave the club , as Arsenal did n’t try to match the sky - high offers they received from elsewhere .
More importantly , the replacements were not big names , nor even experienced professionals .
They were either Arsenal academy juniors , or promising but very young talents brought from around the world .
Arsenal ’s Recent Financial Figures – Not That Bad
Wenger ’s steps are almost a revolution considering Arsenal are one of the biggest club in the world , but find themselves operating like a bottom - half Premier League team .
This and also the lack of immediate success of his new financial principles , has generated wide interests and criticism .
Detractors accuse Wenger and the board of being miserly beyond reason , however supporters say this is the only way to keep the club afloat in trying financial times .
So what is Arsenal ’s current financial situation , and especially do they have too much debt ?
Looking at some of recent figures and statistics , it seems that the club is doing well enough in comparison to other European superpowers .
Arsenal actually made more profit than others last season , that too through winning nothing .
They have healthy stadium attendance levels , which , combined with high ticket prices is a very steady source of income .
They also remain highly “ creditable ” , and are ranked within top five of Forbes Soccer team valuations and the Deloitte Football Money League .

An Epic Choice between Right And Easy
Arsene Wenger looks fairly sure of what he is doing .
He knows what not to do .
Wenger wo n’t let Arsenal go the way of Leeds United , pouring money over Europe like wine .
The Frenchman would rather depend on his vast scouting network to spot talent early and cheaply .
Wenger ’s team wo n’t fly around the world in the summer picking up one - or - two million , he would rather prepare quietly in the Austrian wilderness .
He wo n’t bring in anybody who cannot fit into the crux of his young team , and if anyone does n’t wish to be a part of his battle , he ’ll let them go .
Arsene Wenger has chosen right over easy .
That does n’t guarantee success .
However , considering he has already proved that in the era of cheap money and cheaper loyalty a club can stay at the top table by living within its means , he should be applauded for treading what fans know in their heart is the right path .

Amid all the recent headlines about the US Chamber of Commerce , it ’s easy to forget that it does much more than work to derail climate legislation .
The nation ’s largest business lobby , with more than 3 million member companies , takes positions on everything from financial regulation to judicial nominations to health care .
That ’s why some companies that disagree with the Chamber ’s antiregulatory climate stance say they ’re sticking with the group .
Their prepared statements start with some variation of : “ We do n’t always agree with the Chamber , but . . . ”
To be sure , a company that has never staked much of its profits or reputation on the environment can reasonably claim that the Chamber ’s dirty behavior is n’t a relationship breaker .
But what about companies that manufacture solar panels or took out full - page ads in the green issue of Vanity Fair ?
Belonging to the Chamber would seem to undermine their bottom lines , or at least pull the rug out from under their green marketing campaigns .
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council , at least 18 remaining members of the Chamber ’s board publicly support federal climate policy .
Bruce Freed , the president of the Center for Public Accountability , a shareholder activism group , is urging them to distance themselves from the Chamber .
“ Where there is a fundamental disagreement with company values , with company business strategies , ” he says , “ companies really do need to act on that .
Its a matter of companies holding their trade associations accountable . ”
Here are six “ green ” companies that might be hurting themselves by remaining members of the nation ’s biggest stick in the mud on climate change :
PNC Financial Services
The nation ’s fifth largest bank , PNC controls a whopping $ 291 billion in assets , including a 35 percent stake in the high - profile investment group BlackRock .
Its substantial pile of green is matched by the alacrity of its green rhetoric .
“ Over the past decade , we ’ve become one of the most active companies in the nation when it comes to doing good for the environment , ” says the PNC website .
When world leaders recently discussed climate change at the G - 20 summit in Pittsburgh , PNC ’s hometown , the company gave them an eco -tour of its LEED - certified headquarters buildings .
Moreover , BlackRock recently signed a statement calling for a global climate treaty that would slash emissions by 50 to 80 percent by 2050 .
“ As one of the most progressive green companies in the nation , ” PNC says , “ we ’re constantly looking for new ways to help the environment . ”
Except , apparently , when it comes to using its considerable leverage inside the US Chamber of Commerce .
PNC board member Donald J. Shepard is the past chair of the Chamber ’s board of directors and current chair of its powerful Executive Committee .
PNC declined to make him available for an interview or say if he has pushed to overturn the Chamber ’s longstanding opposition to climate regulation .
“ It is unlikely that we would have anything to say about that at this moment , ” said PNC spokesman Fred Solomon .
“ I think you are fishing for information that is n’t the kind of thing you ’re going to get out of PNC . ”
Alpha Technologies Inc .
Alpha Technologies
Inc , a member of the Chamber ’s board of directors , manufactures solar panels that it says address the “ growing concern ” over climate change .
Is Alpha concerned enough to raise a stink on the Chamber ’s board ?
An Alpha spokesman did n’t return repeated calls .
According to Alpha ’s website , it also supplies AC power systems to “ power plants , petrochemical plants , [ and ] gas and oil pipelines . ”
Duke Energy
Duke Energy , the large southern electric utility , is one of at least seven Chamber members — six of them members of the board –that are also members of the US Climate Action Partnership , a group that wrote the framework for the Waxman - Markey climate bill .
According to an anonymous source , several of these USCAP members sat down recently with Chamber president Tom Donohue to ask him to change the Chamber ’s climate stance but were rebuffed .
USCAP members PG&E , Exelon , and PNM Resources later quit the Chamber .
But Duke Energy , General Electric , ConocoPhillips , Caterpillar , Siemens Corporation , Dow , and Alcoa have stayed on .
Duke ’s role on the Chamber is even more inconsistent than that of most other USCAP members .
Last month , the utility earned kudos from environmentalists when it quit the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , a coal industry front group .
“ We believe ACCCE is constrained by influential member companies who will not support passing climate change legislation in 2009 or 2010 , ” the company said in a statement .
Duke also cited differences over climate policy in leaving the National Association of Manufacturers earlier this year .
But though the Chamber is likewise unlikely to back a climate bill , Duke is sitting tight .
“ We think it ’s important to stay a member because we do agree on some things , ” said Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams .
But , he added : “ I ’m not saying we wo n’t do it [ drop out ] .
We review memberships in all of our groups all the time . ”
Siemens Corporation
The front page of Siemens ’ website features a panoramic photograph of windmills on a grassy plain .
Clicking on the image reveals a US map studded with examples of the company ’s work to save the planet : building the Smart Grid , helping a Manhattan skyscraper use 30 percent less energy than its neighbors , and , of course , manufacturing wind turbines .
“ We ’re convinced that policymakers and industry alike must address climate change by actively pursuing integrated strategies , ” says Siemens ’ 2008 sustainability report .
“ For Siemens , this means driving forward our environmental program at every level , in every company unit and at all of our locations . ”
All locations , that is , except the board of directors of the US Chamber of Commerce , where Siemens CEO George Nolen has a seat .
Siemens , unlike some other members of USCAP , has n’t publicly confronted or disavowed the Chamber ’s approach .
Of course , Siemens is also in the business of constructing oil drilling rigs and pipelines .
A company spokesman did not return a call .
General Electric
General Electric ’s Ecoimagination campaign is much more than a marketing gimmick .
Last year , its 80 climate - friendly Ecoimagination products –everything from wind turbines to halogen light bulbs –generated $ 17 billion in revenues .
Next year GE plans to boost those earnings to $ 25 billion while investing $ 1.5 billion in cleaner R&D .
It has also pledged to cut its own greenhouse gas emissions 1 percent below 2004 levels by 2012 .
“ Climate change requires a long - term path for significantly reducing greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , ” GE says on its website .
“ Developing more energy - and fuel - efficient products and technologies is an important step , as is rethinking our own operations to use resources wisely . ”
But does rethinking its own operations include its use of the Chamber of Commerce ?
“ We do n’t see the sense of urgency that we believe is necessary in their views on climate legislation , ” spokesman Peter O’Toole said , but added that GE did n’t want to leave the group because its agrees with its stance on health care and financial regulation .
He also pointed out that many of GE ’s industrial customers burn coal and other fossil fuels .
Asked if GE sits on the Chamber ’s 60 - member Energy and Environment committee , which is supposed to oversee its climate policies , O’Toole did n’t know .
“ If the answer is yes , I would 100 percent guarantee .
. . that we advocate loudly and vigorously in any meeting of the Chamber for urgent action on the climate , ” he said .
After pledging to investigate GE ’s membership on the committee and the actions it took there , he never called back .
Johnson & Johnson
In May Johnson & Johnson and Nike sent a letter to the Chamber asking it to refrain from speaking about climate change unless its comments reflect “ the full range of views ” of its members .
Yet the Chamber went right on speaking out against climate legislation while insisting that it represented “ more than 3 million businesses and organizations of every size , sector , and region . ”
Exasperated , Nike quit the Chamber ’s board late last month in a strongly - worded letter .
Johnson & Johnson ’s response has been more tepid .
Johnson & Johnson exhibited courage in challenging the powerful Chamber , but that might not be enough for its more eco-minded customers .
Presumably , it ’s still funding the Chamber ’s activities through its dues .

A number of newspapers have today reported a link between larger thighs and reduced mortality and cardiovascular disease .
The Independent_
_ , for example , says that “ big thighs could be the key to beating heart disease ” .
Behind this and the other reports is a large study that looked for a link between certain physical measurements and the risk of heart and vascular disease or death from any cause .
The researchers conclude that lower - than - average thigh circumferences are independently linked with death and heart disease .
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of this research , the study , which followed nearly 2,000 Danish adults for around 12 years , found that subjects with thighs under around 60 cm in circumference had a greater mortality risk , but the protective effect did not appear to increase beyond 60 cm .
Overall , this inverse association between thigh circumference and risk of death needs further study and exploration .
It is currently unclear how doctors should use this information , or what this news means to the general public .
Where did the story come from ?
Dr. Berit Heitmann and Peder Frederiksen from Copenhagen University Hospital and Glostrup University Hospital carried out this study .
The research was funded by the Danish Medical Research Council , and published in the peer - reviewed British Medical Journal .
What kind of scientific study was this ?
This was a prospective cohort study investigating death and cardiovascular outcomes in relation to physical measurements , physical activity and lifestyle .
It followed a sample of 1,436 men and 1,380 women who were participating in the Danish MONICA project , a wider study assessing a number of health factors .
The participants were on average 50 years old at entry into the study , and were free from coronary heart disease , stroke or cancer .
Their height , weight and body fat were measured , as well as thigh , hip and waist circumferences :
Thigh circumference was measured just below the gluteal fold ( the crease where the buttocks meet the thighs ) of the right thigh .
Waist circumference was measured at the mid-point between the lower margin of the ribs and the iliac crest ( hip bone ) .
Hip measurements were taken “ at the point over the buttocks yielding the maximum circumference ” .
Participants were followed up for between 10 years ( for heart disease outcomes ) and 12.5 years ( for outcomes of death ) .
Data was recorded on cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases and events , or death from any cause .
Information on cause of death and new disease was taken by matching people ’s personal identification numbers through Denmark ’s National Registers of Hospital Discharge and Death Registry .
Factors that could be confounding the relationship between the anthropometric measures ( body size and shape ) and the outcomes were also measured .
This included measures of physical activity , smoking , blood pressure , alcohol use , education and menopausal status .
Participants self - categorised their activity levels as follows :
Sedentary : sitting , reading , watching television , going to the cinema .
Active at least four hours a week : building , sometimes walking or cycling , table tennis , bowling .
Active in sports : running , swimming , tennis , etc. at least three hours a week , or doing heavy gardening or spare time work .
An elite sportsperson : swimming , playing football , long distance running several times a week .
Because there were so few in the final activity group , groups three and four were merged for analysis .
Researchers then compared data on those people who survived the study period , those who died from any cause , and those who had a new diagnosis of cardiovascular or coronary heart disease .
They specifically looked at anthropometric measures while taking into account potential confounders .
Four different analyses were undertaken :
Model 1 assessed the relationship between mortality and thigh circumference , smoking , education , physical activity and menopause .
Model 2 also adjusted for percentage of body fat and height .
Model 3 added BMI and waist circumference , and
Model 4 also adjusted for systolic blood pressure , cholesterol and alcohol consumption .
What were the results of the study ?
During the 12.5 years of follow - up , 257 men and 155 women died from any cause .
In 10 years of follow - up , 263 men and 140 women had new cardiovascular disease and 103 men and 34 women were diagnosed with new coronary heart disease .
Men who survived generally had lower BMI , body fat , hip and waist circumferences , age , blood pressure and cholesterol .
They were also more active , smoked less and drank less than those who did not survive .
At the start of the study , they also had greater fat - free mass , a greater thigh circumference and height .
Compared to those with an average thigh circumference in this study ( 55 cm ) , all of those with smaller thigh circumferences ( from the smallest 46.5 cm circumference ) were about twice as likely to die .
People with a thigh circumference greater than the average were not at a greater risk of death , but there was no ‘ dose effect ’ , i.e. their risk did not decrease as thigh circumference increased .
For men , thigh circumference was also related to cardiovascular and coronary heart disease .
Thigh circumference was still significantly linked with cardiovascular disease in men , and with total deaths in both sexes using analysis model 4 , which adjusted for all of the measured confounding factors ( alcohol , blood pressure , total cholesterol and blood fats , BMI , waist circumference , percentage of body fat , height , smoking , physical activity and education level ) .
What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results ?
The researchers say that they found independent associations between thigh circumference and mortality in men and women that “ were particularly evident when thigh circumference was below a threshold of around 60 cm ” .
They discuss possible reasons for this .
This includes the hypotheses that insulin sensitivity may be lowered when the leg muscle is small , or that the metabolism of glucose and fat is negatively affected by a lack of subcutaneous fat .
What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study ?
There are limitations to this research , some of which the researchers have acknowledged :
Failure to measure the tissue composition in the thigh , e.g. proportions of fat or muscle .
As the association between mortality and thigh circumference was independent of overall body fat and abdominal obesity , the researchers say that it could be due to insufficient muscle mass in the region .
They did not take the measurements necessary to confirm this .
The study may not have had enough statistical power to show any potentially significant age - related differences or to assess whether the association was stronger among smokers than among non-smokers .
Although the researchers attempted to adjust for the effects of physical activity , it is possible that this was not fully achieved , and that some confounding may have remained .
Low muscle mass is likely to be linked with less activity , which has a well - known link with increased risk of heart disease .
Anthropometric measurements of height , weight , waist and thigh circumference , etc. were taken at the beginning of the study , but are unlikely to have stayed the same during the 12 years of follow - up .
In spite of these possible shortcomings , the researchers conclude that they have established an independent link between thigh circumference and risk of death and cardiovascular disease in some models .
They say that there seems to be a ‘ threshold ’ effect , i.e. a circumference at which the risk seems most evident , but say that this needs further confirmation before the results can be generalised .
The researchers are concerned that more than half of the men and women aged 35 - 65 in this study had thigh circumferences below the threshold .
People in this study with thighs under about 60 cm in circumference had a higher mortality risk .
However , the protective effect did not appear to increase beyond 60 cm .
Overall , the association between smaller thigh circumference and risk of death needs further study and exploration .
It is unclear at this point how doctors should use this information or what significance it holds for the general public .

Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh was dropped from a group bidding to buy the St. Louis Rams .
ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported the story on Wednesday .
Limbaugh was to be a limited partner in a group headed by St. Louis Blues chairman Dave Checketts .
Checketts said in a statement Wednesday that Limbaugh 's participation had become a complication in the group 's efforts and the bid will move forward without him .
Checketts told the Associated Press he will have no further comment on the bid process .
Three - quarters of the league 's 32 owners would have had to approve any sale to Limbaugh and his group .
Earlier this week , Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay predicted that Limbaugh 's potential bid would be met by significant opposition .
Several players have also voiced their displeasure with Limbaugh 's potential ownership position , and NFL Players Association head DeMaurice Smith , who is black , urged players to speak out against Limbaugh 's bid .
A Limbaugh spokesman told ESPN that Limbaugh would have no comment on Wednesday .
Earlier , on his syndicated radio show , Limbaugh was defiant , holding on to hope that he still could be part of the ownership group that buys the Rams .
" This is not about the NFL , it 's not about the St. Louis Rams , it 's not about me , " Limbaugh said .
" This is about the ongoing effort by the left in this country , wherever you find them , in the media , the Democrat Party , or wherever , to destroy conservatism , to prevent the mainstreaming of anyone who is prominent as a conservative .
" Therefore , this is about the future of the United States of America and what kind of country we 're going to have . "
Without Limbaugh , Checketts and his group will have to find another partner .
At the NFL owners meetings this week in Boston , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed Limbaugh 's potential involvement in the league and said " divisive comments are not what the NFL is all about . "
Goodell added : " I 've said many times before , we 're all held to a high standard here .
I would not want to see those comments coming from people who are in a responsible position in the NFL -- absolutely not . "
In 2003 , Limbaugh was forced to resign from ESPN 's Sunday NFL Countdown after saying of Philadelphia 's Donovan McNabb : " I think what we 've had here is a little social concern in the NFL .
The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well . "
The Rams had no comment , reissuing a statement from Oct. 5 in which owner Chip Rosenbloom said a review of the team 's ownership was under way and the club will make an announcement when it 's over .
Checketts , the chairman of SCP Worldwide , announced that Limbaugh had been dumped toward the end of a news release .
" It has become clear that his involvement in our group has become a complication and a distraction to our intentions ; endangering our bid to keep the team in St. Louis , " Checketts said .
" As such , we have decided to move forward without him and hope it will eventually lead us to a successful conclusion . "
The move was hailed by the Rev. Al Sharpton , one of the most vocal critics of Limbaugh 's bid .
" It is a moral victory for all Americans -- especially the players that have been unfairly castigated by Rush Limbaugh , " Sharpton said in a statement .
" This decision will also uphold the unifying standards of major sports . "

The VROMA MOO has been shut - down permanently .
After running for 25 years , it is time to retire our beloved online haven for students and teachers of Latin and Roman culture .
Technology moved on long ago , but a few loyal patrons continued to make use of VRoma until recently .
We can no longer afford to host the MOO , but please be assured that it is archived for posterity , that future archaeologists might marvel at early Internet technology and our vision of re-creating an ancient society using first only text , then enhancing this text with images and interactive objects .
Valete , VRoma MOO !
The VRoma Project is first and foremost a community of awesome scholars , both teachers and students , who create online resources for teaching about the Latin language and ancient Roman culture .
The project was initially funded by a $ 190,000 National Endowment for the Humanities Teaching with Technology grant in 1997 .
The two major components of the project are its online learning environment ( MUVE , Multi - User Virtual Environment ) , which has received several favorable external reviews , and its collection of internet resources .
The VRoma MUVE requires logging on as a guest or through your personal character and password , but all the web resources are freely accessible on the internet .
A Virtual Place :
The center and home of VRoma 's virtual community is an online “ place , ” a virtual learning environment built upon a spatial and cultural metaphor of ancient Rome ( see article explaining “ The Nature of VRoma 's Virtual Environment ” ) .
The simulated environment of VRoma contains two types of spaces .
The historical component of this environment is Rome , a virtual simulation of the ancient city of Rome circa 150 CE ; this is as authentic and accurate as the work and research of many classicists can make it .
The non-historical component is much smaller and includes a number of locations : Officina , containing faculty offices and student projects ; Portae Somni ( “ Gates of Sleep ” ) , a twilight realm where users can create their own imaginative simulations ; and Thermopolium of Scintilla , where visitors can enjoy wine , nibbles , and relaxing conversation .
To explore virtual Rome as a guest , just click Log in on the menu above ; no password is needed .
We welcome anyone with a serious interest in ancient Rome to join the ranks of VRoman citizens by applying for a VRoma character and password ( click Join on the menu ) .
The VRoma MUVE has recently been upgraded to version 5 of the enCore Learning Environment platform .
This software offers major new features , making it easier than ever to “ walk ” the streets of Rome and interact with visitors and native inhabitants .
Teachers have new administrative powers , and there are many additional educational tools and resources , including the ability to change the language in which system messages are shown and a new game called Discover Rome , especially designed for younger students ( to find out more , click Teaching above ) .
We are especially grateful to Daniel Jung of the University of Bergen in Norway , chief programmer for the new version of enCore , who invested untold hours in upgrading VRoma .
The MUVE now speaks classical Latin !
The Classical Association of the Atlantic States has awarded the enCore Consortium a generous grant that enabled six classicists to translate the “ voice ” of VRoma ( all of the system and interface messages , menu items , buttons , etc. ) into classical Latin ( more information and photos ) .
The Quickstart Guide in the Help section of this website explains how to select the language in which VRoma speaks to you , and a very helpful glossary clarifies the underlying principles of the translation .
A Collection of Resources :
The VRoma Project uses workshops and presentations to engage teachers and students in a virtual community dedicated to using internet technology to foster the teaching and learning of the Latin language and Roman culture .
This web site features various types of resources created by VRomans ( accessible via the above menu ) , including a large archive of digital images relating to classical antiquity ( see VRoma Working for You ) , help files and other materials about the MUVE , teaching resources and course materials , and information about the initial project and its participants .
People flee in a panic from their office building through an emergency exit after an earthquake shook Jakarta October 16 , 2009 .
Indonesia was hit by a strong quake off Java island , in the Sunda Strait , on Friday afternoon , causing buildings to sway in the capital sparking panic in some areas as people fled homes and offices .

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - Indonesia was hit by a strong quake off Java island , in the Sunda Strait , on Friday afternoon , causing buildings to sway in the capital , Jakarta , and sparking panic in some areas as people fled homes and offices .
Indonesia ’s meteorology agency did not issue a tsunami warning after the quake , and there were no immediate reports of damage .
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.5 and was at a depth of 34.5 miles .
The epicenter was 187 km ( 116 miles ) west of the capital Jakarta .
Indonesia is situated in a belt of intense seismic activity known as the “ Pacific Ring of Fire . ”
A powerful quake measuring 7.6 struck off West Sumatra last month , killing more than 1,000 people and destroying hundreds of buildings .

This week one of my students shined a laser pointer in my eye while I was teaching .
I called her parents .
" It will take two weeks for the medication to set in " was the reply .
This was slightly less unsettling than , " I 'll get ' em " which means " with a belt . "
I asked her to write a page on the phrase , " permanent retinal damage " How did David get those great dots in his post ?
I would like some .

I 'm not really married .
Finally the new issue is complete , and I can slide off the saddle .
My wife will be so relieved .
Have you noticed ?
We 've updated four times this month !
Not since August in the hazy , distant summer of 2004 has such a thing occurred .
Let it be known that ALILBTDII is a weekly comic !
And now , for the curiously insatiable , a behind - the - scenes tour of my drawing process , like we tried once before with issue # 13 .
This time , I have gone into excessive detail in order to test the loyalty of our readers .
Fish Legs from the Primordial Ocean 01 / Rough Sketch - I 'd already done some sketches on paper , so I had a pretty good idea of how things were going to be arranged .
Sometimes I start drawing on the computer right away without sketching first , but that often leads me into a more protracted process with lots of complex rearranging throughout .
•
In the first panel , the lone figure is present but will appear differently in later stages .
•
The large figure with arm extending into the space below is already in place , as is the bed in overhead view .
Above it , a close - up which was later cut would have repeated and emphasized the action of the figure in the bed .
•
At the bottom , the final two panels are already there , although I did n't know what to do with them until much later .
I just knew I wanted a " tapering off " feeling .
•
The large circle one quarter down the page is a bit mysterious and does n't appear to have any correlative in the final piece .
It really is just a circle and was never meant to be anything else .
Looking at the overall composition , I sensed that the circle would be a convergence point for several major lines ; the comic would radiate from there .
02 / Getting More Specific - Already much of the major work is done .
The large head at the bottom would later become a more distant figure , the close - up above the bed ( center , right ) would disappear , and the close - up in the first panel of the second line would also pull out some , but most everything is in place .
I will become less and less a composer and more a musician , enacting and embellishing the idea .
03 / Introduction of Color - With the last episode ( # 20 ) , I added color only after finishing all the line work .
For these comics , color does n't take half as long as the line drawing , so when I save it that way , I enjoy it as a big , sudden payoff after a lot of careful labor .
But this time I wanted to get a sense of my colors before moving on , to help develop the atmosphere in my mind , I suppose . •
A couple scenes were to be overcast or rainy ; although red , green , purple and blue are pretty saturated , the rest of the colors have a lot of gray .
•
My blue shirt in the large " looking up at the rain " pose is greenish and grayish in order to push it back , to protect the clarity of the overhead view .
•
The Hot Reptilian King in panel one has attained a more exciting pose ... although it 's still very static .
" Excitement lines " are doing too much work .
04 / Balancing the Page - Time to pull things together a little bit .
Everything was looking too floaty and I did n't want a bunch of shoulder - to - shoulder panels like episode # 17 this time .
Some heavy black lines broke things up nicely in a somewhat Mondrian - like way .
•
Some panels are tinted orange to help balance the page as a whole .
As I adjusted the colors later on , this tinting effect was lessened and I think the balance of the page suffered somewhat .
But I liked the orange - heavy palette ; it reminded me of Winsor McCay ( Little Nemo ) .
Dale pointed out that the floating bed did not diminish this association .
•
In the first panel on the second line , the close - up has become a medium shot .
• Living room and bedroom scenes are more articulated . •
At this point I probably felt that I was almost done , but there were still hours to go .
05 / Correcting the End -
Here I started redrawing things that looked boring or wrong .
The most significant change is in the bottom panel , where the close - up became a head - and - shoulders viewed from greater distance .
The close - up felt too hopeless , as though The Hot Reptilian King 's words had filled me with sinking dread .
Instead , I wanted it to feel like I had been momentarily distracted from my frivolous activity .
There had to be more drama in the waves than in the face .
•
Both figures in the first panel are redrawn .
The Hot Reptilian King looks more radical than before .
As for my face , I kind of prefer the rougher one .
•
Waves now extend along the full length of the second panel .
I 've abandoned the tentatively indicated door , which was to lead in from the first panel .
Enough trickiness for now ! •
The figure looking up in panel three looks a lot nicer .
I 'd been putting the arm in different places -- holding the strap , on the hip -- but decided to go for something less difficult !
The girl is moved left and likes it better there .
•
The large sleeping figure has been redrawn from a lower , more interesting angle .
•
A bunch of other things are slightly better than before .
06 / This And That -
At this point I probably called Dale and told him , " it 's almost done ! " although it would take another day ( thanks to school and other interferences ) .
•
Lines are mostly all done , although they look messy because the colors under them are a mess ( often because the lines they were drawn for have moved ) .
•
The last scene is virtually finished , although other parts still languish in unfinishedness .
I try to advance a work in an even , unified way , but I think I just got stuck in that scene , enjoying it too much , and did n't want to leave . •
The final two panels have finally been given a purpose .
Earlier versions show my head , then nothing , suggesting that I have drowned , although that was never my intention .
Instead , I 'm catching the ball , which I think ends the story on the right kind of note .
•
Four discrete instances of the beach ball form a sweep in the meta - meta - meta - land of the comic page , where everything exists simultaneously .
This is one of my favorite pranks .
( See books in # 13 . ) •
The now - defined shoreline ( middle , right , overhead view ) completes another line converging where that circle was in the earliest sketch .
I guess the circle became the face of the grandfather clock .
Now it looks to me like the shore line and the invisible roof where the rain is falling ( both wet / dry divisions ) are hands of the clock , and everything is rotating around that clock face -- all the furniture and rugs and me -- showing the passing of time in the room .
Maybe that 's why everything is such a mess , because it 's turning .
07 / Finished ( Almost ) - Okay !
It 's done !
Clouds , scales , droopy dolls .
Everything is done except for changing the color of certain black areas to set them apart and increase spacial depth ( see final version ) .
I had n't tried this before , and it worked pretty well , except on the large sleeping figure , which in the final version is too faint and throws off the composition .
I think I may fiddle with that .
•
Also in the final version , I let that Winsor McCay association take the reign and borrowed some 1920s style for the word bubbles .

This week a man who had been acquitted of rape failed in his attempt to sue the woman who had accused him
Anthony
Hunt had been a magistrate and justice of the peace , a pillar of society .
And then he became an emblem for angry , accused men when he mounted a case that threatened to throw a legal tsunami at the already lamentable prosecution of sex crime .
In 2002 he was investigated for an alleged rape which was said to have happened seven years before .
A meagre 6 % of reported rapes result in a conviction on a charge of rape – and yet , despite the length of time that had elapsed , this was one of them .
In 2003 , Hunt was jailed for four years .
But he appealed and , in 2005 the conviction was declared unsafe : new evidence had emerged , and the judge had failed to properly advise the jury .
Hunt was acquitted .
Then came the killer blow :
Hunt decided to sue the woman for £ 300,000 damages for malicious prosecution .
His action was bewildering : malicious prosecution actions are usually pursued against the police or other public authorities for the abuse of power .
Last Thursday , four years after he started seeking damages against her , the woman ( known as Alice Barnes to protect her anonymity ) was told by her solicitor that the appeal court judges had at last rejected his case : " I was aquiver , overwhelmed , I could n't take it in , " she says .
Her lawyer told her again , " We 've won ! "
But Barnes felt nothing , " It was n't elation , victory , it was numbness . "
For although women 's rights groups have greeted last week 's ruling with great relief , Barnes has had to forfeit her savings and her pension fund to defend herself .
But why did Hunt 's lawyers seek remedy from her in the first place , rather than from the police and prosecutors – after all , it was their case , and she was only their witness ?
Hunt himself will not comment .
His solicitor , Stephen Taylor , told the Guardian that the evidence was hers , not theirs .
Without her evidence there was no case .
Therefore , the witness was the prosecutor .
It left Hampshire 's former chief constable Paul Kernaghan aghast .
" The idea that an alleged rape victim is in financial jeopardy suggests the law is an ass , " he said .
Barnes had no choice , she had to defend herself .
Her MP , Julian Lewis , pressed the police to give Barnes maximum support , but the police could not meet the costs of a civil case .
They recommended reputable lawyers , Talbot Walker , but her defence cost her in excess of £ 60,000 .
And the irony is that , according to both Barnes and the officer who carried out the original rape investigation , detective chief inspector Alison Scott , Barnes had never wanted a prosecution in the first place – rather , she 'd tried to forget the whole thing .
When the incident took place , in June 1995 , Alice Barnes had been a special constable .
" It was n't glamorous job , it was a community - based public service .
I loved it , I felt I was put on this earth to do it . "
She gave 1,000 hours a year to the special constabulary .
On the day in question , she and Hunt , a traffic warden , were on duty at a country show in the New Forest .
Both agree that Hunt came to her home for a cup of tea .
Both agree that sex happened .
She says it was rape , he says it was by consent .
She says that afterwards she showered and washed everything .
She telephoned her senior officer .
He told her to report it .
She did n't do so , she says , because she thought she would n't be believed – " this thing about no scratches , no bruises , no torn clothes came into my head " .
For seven years the story was only known by a tiny handful of people .
It was in 2002 that – during the course of an unrelated disciplinary matter – the allegation came to the attention of CID 's Alison Scott , a rape specialist .
Scott recalls when she first met Barnes : " She was shaking like a leaf .
She did n't want to act on it .
I told her that whether she gave a statement or not we'd have to investigate . "
Hunt was a traffic warden employed by Hampshire police , and if he was guilty " we could n't employ a man like that " .
Barnes eventually , reluctantly , agreed to give evidence .
The police investigated – witnesses were tracked down , phone calls were traced , notebooks were checked – and felt they had a case .
The CPS agreed , and the trial went ahead .
By the time I first met Barnes in 2008 she 'd been through the original trial , and the appeal , and her hands were still shaking .
Literally .
And they continued to shake more or less throughout our first conversation .
She told me then she feared she 'd lose her home to find the rest of the £ 112,000 her lawyers required .
" What am I supposed to do , live in a tent ? "
Her plight found its way to Vera Baird , Redcar MP and a barrister celebrated for her pioneering work on rape .
Baird and Lewis agreed : whatever happened , the woman should not have to pay another penny .
Baird enlisted the big city lawyers , Lovells , to take it on at no cost to Barnes herself .
And so , as Halloween approached a year ago a small , sombre congregation sat in the gloom of Court 11 at the Royal Courts of Justice before Mr Justice Blake : 64 - year - old Anthony Hunt , now living in Dorset , beside his wife ; and 56 - year - old Barnes , with her husband .
Hunts ' lawyers argued that when the victim was " the sole repository of the truth " she was , in effect , the prosecutor .
Barnes 's barrister , Antony Metzer , countered that police " investigated and authenticated " allegations ; the victim was merely a witness .
Mr Justice Blake rejected Hunt 's case , not on the basis of the truth or otherwise of the evidence during the rape trial – Hunt has been acquitted of that charge – but because the woman could not be deemed the " prosecutor " ; the police had instigated the investigation , and DCI Scott " could n't stress enough how much support and persuasion " had been involved .
Furthermore , having heard Barnes 's story again , he said that " nothing has come to light " to prove " any malice whatsoever " by Alice Barnes .
This week the appeal court , led by Lord Justice Sedley , agreed .
So , Hunt had lost , but had Alice Barnes won ?
Appeal judge Walls said " it is plainly undesirable … that key witnesses be deterred from reporting allegedly criminal acts for fear of an action for malicious prosecution if the defendant is acquitted . "
Thousands of people reporting rape could find comfort and clarity from the ruling , commented Lovells solicitor Anna Wilson .
But Barnes cannot recover her £ 87,000 .
Vera Baird hoped " something useful has come from her suffering " .
And Alice Barnes ?
" I would n't wish this even upon an enemy .
But if it saves anyone from suffering this turmoil again , then it has to be good . "

The original said that 6 % of rape cases result in a conviction .
This has been corrected .
Australian Big Cats
On the track of the big cat mystery in Australia , and around the world .
It sometimes feels like every time we mention a big company 's products or services here , it 's to shame them for doing something terrible or making something awful .
But every now and again , you get something wonderful out of a big company , and it 's worth celebrating , loudly .
This time , it 's IBM 's Global Services , who do the ThinkPad service contracts for Lenovo .
I switched to ThinkPads a few years back when I went Ubuntu Linux , at the suggestion of Chris DiBona , a senior free / open source guy at Google .
The ThinkPads are moderately priced , come in a wide variety of models with different characteristics , are incredibly well - built with fantastic keyboards ( the mid- to high - range machines have water - proof keyboards that have special , sealed drainage channels running to the laptop 's underside ) and rugged frames .
They run GNU / Linux really well , too .
I 've been happier with ThinkPads than I 've been with any other make of laptop ( though there have been occasional hiccups , see below ) .
I 'm hard on my equipment , so I knew that I 'd want to get the world - wide , on - site , next - day replacement service , which costs about $ 100 / year .
This is exactly what it sounds like : if you have a hardware fault ( even one due to dropping or knocking the machine ) , they will generally have a tech show up with a replacement part the next day , anywhere in the world .
When I was an Apple user , hardware failures often meant standing in line for 40 min to drop off a Powerbook at a Genius Bar , then coming back a week or two later and waiting 40 minutes again to reclaim it .
My latest ThinkPad , an ultralight X200 , just experienced a hardware fault in the built - in SD card reader .
I tried booting it from a couple different Ubuntu versions and then installed the original Vista HDD and tried that ( the ThinkPad hard - drives can be swapped in about two minutes with a single Phillips screwdriver , which makes it easy to buy giant third - party drives and install them when the ThinkPad arrives , building Linux on them and leaving the original drive intact for easy troubleshooting ) .
It was definitely hardware .
I called the service - center , got through in about two minutes , explained my problems to a level - one tech who nevertheless understood what I meant by " Linux " and " hard - drive swap " and ordered the service call after about five minutes of my describing the problem .
Today the service tech came by my office .
He phoned ten minutes beforehand to let me know he was on his way , then sat down at my desk , spread out a lint - free cloth , and , in about 20 minutes , fixed the SD slot , replacing the daughtercard that it lives on .
He did n't care that the Linux drive was in the bay , and let me boot it and show him that it was working to my satisfaction — he did n't insist on my swapping in the original Vista drive .
This is basically perfect .
Exactly what I want from my critical infrastructure .
Without my computer , I can't do anything productive .
I 've got edits due on my current novel by Friday afternoon , and a complete disassembly and replacement of a laptop daughter - card just took place without substantially disrupting my schedule .
I only had to walk as far as the reception at my office building .
So , with all that good news , let me add in a couple of caveats : first , once Lenovo end - of - life 's a model , they stop making parts for it and switch to refurbed parts , and those parts are n't so good .
My old X60 had to have three defective motherboard replacements before the service center just upgraded me to a new , faster , in - production model ( on the other hand , this swap was done by the head manager at IBM Global Service 's UK division , who drove into London to personally handle the case ) .
Lenovo's ecommerce ordering and build system is n't nearly as good as IBM 's service department .
They lost the original order for this X200 , waited two weeks to tell me , then told me I 'd have to wait two more weeks to get the machine .
Then they found me someone else who could get it to me in 24 hours , but I ended up paying a couple hundred pounds more than I 'd been quoted from Lenovo themselves .
They argued mightily about paying me back this sum , eventually promising to do so , but they never did .
So that 's it : be prepared for some glitches when you order a machine , and watch out for refurbed parts .
Apart from that , the ThinkPad with extended warranty can't be beat .
I 'm on my fourth laptop and I 've loved every single one of them down to its adorable little trackpoint .
For the record , I have no affiliation with Lenovo or IBM Global Services .
I have not been offered any sort of discount or reward for this post .
They are not Boing Boing advertisers ( though , seriously , IBM / Lenovo : we 'll gladly run your ads !
You folks kick ass ! ) .
This is entirely self - motivated , because , you know what ?
These machines and the service plan just rock .

Salt and paper make disposable batteries
A piece of wet , salty paper does n't look impressive , but cut it up , stack it up , and it can hold an impressive amount of energy .
With this in mind , scientists in Sweden have created a salt and paper battery that can hold up to one volt of electricity .
The scientists hope their battery will one day power remote , biodegradable sensors .
" We wanted to make a battery that was very simple and used the same material for both electrodes , " says Professor Leif Nyholm of Uppsala University in Sweden and co-author of a study that appeared in the journal Nano Letters .
" To make it simple we just put NaCl ( table salt ) in . "
The battery is as thin as a single piece of paper , but it is made up of multiple layers of cellulose , coated in a conductive polymer 50 nanometres thick , and sandwiched between layers of filter paper .
Water conducts the chlorine ions to the negative electrode , and electrons to the positive electrode .
The whole flexible assembly , several millimetres thick , is wrapped in plastic .
The initial salt and paper battery prototype can generate one volt of energy .
Stacking more layers should provide more voltage , says Nyholm .
Gram for gram , the salt and paper battery is n't as powerful as its thin - film cousins that use lithium , cobalt or nickel , but it does charge faster .
The salt and paper battery wo n't be used to power a laptop or a cell phone .
Its environmentally - friendly components will more likely be used for fabrics that heat up or remote sensors that monitor temperature or humidity .
Problem solver
The battery does n't just degrade into harmless products , it actually helps solve an environmental problem .
The traditional source of paper , wood pulp , does n't have enough surface area for ion exchange .
Instead , the scientists turned to a noxious marine algae that clogs up harbours .
The marine algae produces cellulose with 100 times the surface area , compared with terrestrial plants .
" The utilisation of the nanostructure of this cellulose preparation was a bright idea , " says Professor Gyorgy Inzelt , an expert on thin films from Eotvos Lorand University in Hungry .
The salt and cellulose assembly could also be used as a capacitor , a device able of dumping all its electrical charge at once , instead of a battery , which releases power more slowly .
As either a battery or a capacitor , Inzelt suggests the device could be useful in pacemakers , nanomotors , optical displays and other devices .
But , he says , more exhaustive testing is required before any commercial device can be produced .
" There are so many things we want to do with an actual commercial device , " says Nyholm , " But we still have a lot of work to fully characterise its performance . "
Here ’s what ’s wrong with current business education , indeed current business thinking — in a nutshell .
The current issue of the MIT - Sloan Management Review trumpets the main feature : " Sustainability as Competitive Advantage . "
You really do n’t have to go any further .
The clear implication is in the syntax : do this ( little ) thing , and you ’ll get this ( big ) thing .
Do this ( responsibility ) thing and you ’ll get this ( profitability ) thing .
Turn the hands over this way , you ’ll correct your hook .
Sell this way , you ’ll make more money .
Practice sustainability , you ’ll beat your competitors .
Use these means , and you ’ll get those ends .
This means - end confusion is n’t just in the headline .
One article makes it crystal clear in the opening three sentences :
Many companies are taking the first incremental steps toward sustainability , such as energy conservation and recycling .
That ’s a good start — but going further can yield significant competitive advantage .
The growing movement toward sustainability in business offers companies a powerful lever for creating competitive advantage .
Get the picture ?
The ultimate reason to do this ‘ good ’ stuff is because it ’s profitable at the individual company level .
Interesting : it suggests high profitability is the measure of social responsiblity .
MIT Sloan is hardly alone .
I ’ve taken flak lately for supposedly singling out Harvard .
Neither school is unique .
Capitalism - as - competition always implies an end goal–typically shareholder value , or sustainable competitive advantage .
Led by a variety of influences ranging from Milton Friedman to Ayn Rand , the idea of capitalism - as - competition has been transmuted and transmitted by business gurus like Michael Porter , government gurus like Alan Greenspan , and business superstars like Jack Welch .
Note : it has n’t worked too well .
Business has gotten so co-opted by the competitive paradigm that we ’ve lost all sense of even the possibility of another view .
Yet there is another view , and a very obvious one at that .
It ’s right under our noses .
Let ’s call it Buddhist Capitalism .
Buddhist Capitalism
I do n’t mean this too literally .
I am no expert in Buddhist teachings , and not all Buddhist precepts track easily to business .
But one difference between capitalism - as - we ’ve - come - to - know it and Buddhism is instructive .
One is about vanquishing one ’s foes ; one is about getting along harmoniously in the world .
And we all know which is which .
Business - as - competition is all about linearity : if you do this , you ’ll get that .
And the more you tighten those links , the more you control them .
Buddhism , on the other hand , embraces paradox .
If you let go your attachment to X , you ’re more likely to get it .
But only if you give it up .
The outcome cannot be sought successfully , it can only be received if you stop seeking it .
It is n’t all that alien a concept .
The best salespeople know that success comes to those who give selflessly to their customers .
From Dale Carnegie to Zig Ziglar , people have known that you succeed best by getting others what they want .
What I mean by Buddhist Capitalism comes down to doing two things : help others , and stop focusing on your own immediate ends .
Capitalism - as - competition negates the oncept of ethics , since it subordinates even ‘ ethical ’ ideas like sustainability to the overarching goal of profits and competitive advantage .
A business school can’t feasibly teach ethics when , down the hall , the strategy course teaches that your ultimate goal is to win battles against your supply chain , customers , unions and employees .
Who ’s left to behave ethically towards ?
Is Buddhism Profitable ?
It ’s the Wrong Question to Ask
Business ( some of it ) is more and more focusing on things like ethics , social responsibility , and sustainability .
And that is a good thing .
But it ’s doomed as long as we ca n’t get past the question : “ Can I gain sustainable competitive advantage by doing it ? ”
Believing that the purpose of business is to make profits is like believing the purpose of living is to eat .
The purpose of sustainability is sustainability — not the competitive advantage of those who practice it .
As long as we limit our definitions of ‘ good , ’ ‘ social benefit , ’ and ‘ business ethics ’ to definitions couched in competitive advantage , we subordinate them .
We need to make profit a byproduct , not a goal .
While it is true , very true , that ethical and customer - focused business focusing on the long - term really are more profitable , that is Not. The.
Point .
The point is to make business a full partner in society , not a mad dog following an ‘ invisible hand ’ that responds only to heavily enforced legal mandates .
If business wants a seat at the social family table , it needs to act like it ’s a member of the family — not an outsider following its own rules .
In an increasingly interconnected world , it ’s Buddhist Capitalism , not Competitive Capitalism , that we need more of .
The fact that it ’s also more profitable is a lovely byproduct .
But not a goal .
Reading “ Logicomix : An Epic Search for Truth ” October 8 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
In 1957 , a group of mathematicians programmed a " Logic Theory Machine " to prove theorems from Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell 's massive Principia Mathematica , published over 40 years earlier .
On learning of this feat , Bertrand Russell reputedly wrote " I am delighted to know that ' Principia Mathematica ' can now be done by machinery .
I wish Whitehead and I had known of this possibility before we wasted 10 years doing it by hand . "
Bertrand Russell lived a long , long life .
Born in 1872 , the grandson of a former Prime Minister of Britain , Russell 's first mathematics papers were published during the realm of Victoria .
Already in his 40s during the First World War , Russell was imprisoned for antiwar activities , but he lived long enough to lead campaigns against nuclear weapons , and to protest U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War .
When Russell died in 1970 ( on my 17th birthday , by the way ) , he was already one of heroes — a towering intellect and complex public figure of deep moral authority .
So I suppose that makes me the perfect audience for Logicomix : An Epic Search for Truth ( Bloomsbury , 2009 ) , an immensely enjoyable gorgeous graphic novel about Bertrand Russell and the quest to establish the logical foundations of mathematics .
I was skeptical about Logicomix , particularly when it began with a meeting in Athens between its two authors , Apostolos Doxiadis ( author of Uncle Petros and Goldbach 's Conjecture ) and Christos Papadimitriou ( Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley and author of Turing : A Novel About Computation ) , who then join the husband and wife artist and colorist team of Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna , and visual research Anne Bardy , all already deep into work on the very graphic novel we 're reading but with the working title Foundational Quest .
Ascending a layer further into self - reference , the main narrative uses a second framing device .
On September 4 , 1939 , the very date that Britain declares war on Germany , Bertrand Russell is arriving at an American university to deliver a lecture on " The Role of Logic in Human Affairs . "
Bertie ( the character in Logicomix ) uses this opportunity to tell the story of his life in mathematics .
Both framing devices and the layers of embedded narrative work extremely well .
This is where graphic novels excel .
The creators of Logicomix almost immediately charm us with their wit and their winks , and frequently pop back into the narrative to discuss and debate the history they 're portraying , almost functioning as a traditional , let us say , Greek chorus .
In particular , Apostolos — I 'll refer to the characters in Logicomix by their first names — wants to pursue a " logic and madness " theme in the novel that Christos resists .
At one point , Christos is back in Berkeley and writes a letter to Apostolos ( another framing device ) telling a story about when he was in Athens and travelled with Anne to a rehearsal of a performance Aeschylus ' Oresteia for which she 's made masks for the actors .
They soon get lost in a once familiar but now mysterious Athens neighborhood , leading to encounters with prostitutes and muggers .
At first it all seems completely irrelevant except for the lessons the characters derive about algorithms , the difference between maps and reality , and the deeply human wisdom of Aeschylus cutting through the impersonal logic of mathematics .
Bertrand Russell 's personal narrative begins with his childhood , continues with his discovery of Euclid , and gathers steam with his years at Cambridge .
At the turn of the century , Bertie takes a rather fanciful trip across Europe — the authors freely admit that they fabricated the details here — meeting Gottlob Frege , Georg Cantor ( in a madhouse , no less ) , and arriving in Paris in August 1900 to attend the Second International Congress of Mathematicians and hear David Hilbert deliver his famous address challenging the mathematicians of the 20th century to solve 23 outstanding problems .
A good chunk of this history will be familiar to readers of chapters 2 and 3 of my book The Annotated Turing : A Guided Tour through Alan Turing 's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine , but how can I possibly compete with the dialogue , human emotions and conflicts , and the lovely drawings based on Anne Bardy 's extensive research into period locations ?
I particularly enjoyed the introduction of what 's come to be known as the Russell Paradox — does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself ?
Logicomix relates it to the Barber Paradox — a barber shaves everyone who does not shave himself so who shaves the barber ? — and then a book that catalogues all books that do not refer to themselves — and of course the point is made in this very self - referential novel that that book does not list Logicomix !
Even more fun is when Whitehead and Russell team up to write Principia Mathematica , almost destroying themselves in the process .
With terrific dramatic foreshadowing , Kurt Gödel shows up as a 4 - year old on page 196 ( yes , he 's already wearing glasses with circular lenses ) and then as a graduate student on page 273 , ready to deliver his destructive missile 12 pages later .
No matter how well you know the story , in Logicomix it seems very fresh .
Close to the end , the authors debate whether the outcome of this " epic search for truth " makes the story end happily or tragically .
Christos clearly sees the ending of this story as a happy one , for it led directly to the creation of the computer .
If I 'm reading this correctly , he even convinces Apostolos that a sequel to Logicomix is in order , one that would of course feature as its main character someone equally as interesting as Bertrand Russell — Alan Turing , of course .
That sounds like a great idea to me , and I am already totally psyched .
Gold stretched higher early Thursday afternoon , with futures prices briefly touching $ 1,060 an ounce .
The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that gold 's run higher is fueled by some alchemy of inflation concerns and dollar worries .
Bond traders do n't buy the inflation side of the argument .
They point to the low yields on the 10 - year Treasury note -- which have been below 3.2 % -- as one reason why .
These yields have been moving lower since early August .
Bond yields fall as bond prices rise .
So investors have been buying ...

ONE area where Barack Obama and his tech - savvy supporters might expect to lead the debate on health - care reform is online .
Last year Mr Obama recruited legions of online champions in his campaign for the presidency .
But his digital backers are proving to be less influential on this issue , according to a new study by Market Sentinel , a firm of British media analysts .
It has tried to quantify which of dozens of American and British outlets have led the reform debate online , in particular on one question : whether a move towards a British - style National Health Service would be welcome .
To do so the analysts measured how often websites ( and other organisations and individuals ) were cited and linked to by other websites .
More citations and links , especially from websites themselves reckoned to be influential , means more influence .
Similarly it tried to measure how pro- or anti-reform individual outlets have been , again using “ citation analysis ” .
They portray an online debate that is as polarised online as it is in the real world , with the extremists on either side typically being more influential than the more moderate voices pushing for change .

Le scénario tant redouté des experts ès tirage au sort est arrivé : l'équipe de France affrontera l'Eire en matchs de barrage pour accéder au Mondial 2010 .
Têtes de série grâce à leur neuvième place au classement mondial de la Fifa , les Français évitaient d'office le Portugal , la Russie et la Grèce .
Il leur restait quatre adversaires potentiels : l'Ukraine ( 22e ) , l'Eire ( 34e ) , la Bosnie - Herzégovine ( 42e ) et la Slovénie ( 49e ) .
Les Bleus en seront donc quittes pour un déplacement au stade Croke Park de Dublin le 14 novembre , avant le match retour du 18 novembre au Stade de France .
Sur le papier , les Français , vice - champions du monde , n'ont rien à craindre des Irlandais .
Mais de la théorie , les Robbie Keane , Damian Duff et autres John O'Shea n'en auront cure .
Leur onze type est composé de joueurs titulaires dans leurs clubs de Premier League – le championnat anglais , présenté comme le meilleur du monde .
Invaincue pendant la phase de qualification ( terminée à la deuxième place , derrière l'Italie ) , l'Eire est dirigée par un des plus beaux palmarès du foot mondial , l'Italien Giovanni Trapattoni .
La dernière rencontre entre les deux nations avait tout de même tourné à l'avantage des Français : dans un match couperet , les Bleus , aidés par le retour de Zidane , Makelele et Thuram , l'avaient emporté 1 - 0 ( but de Henry ) .
Ne craignant pas le sacrilège , le sélectionneur de l'équipe de France Raymond Domenech a réagi à ce tirage sur l'antenne de RTL : « On sait ce qu'il faut faire , quel que soit l'adversaire .
L'objectif , c'est de se qualifier pour la Coupe du monde .
C'est l'Irlande , il faut le faire .
L'avantage , c'est que tout le monde les connaît , c'est l'Angleterre bis , ils jouent tous dans le championnat anglais , tous les joueurs les connaissent (... ) .
C'est une équipe qui n'a pas perdu un match pendant les qualifications (... ) .
C'est une équipe solide , c'est costaud .
Mais on l'est aussi . »
Le vainqueur de la double confrontation de mi-novembre sera qualifié pour la Coupe du monde de juin prochain .
Trois autres nations européennes l'accompagneront .
Le Portugal n'aura pas la tâche facile avec un match retour en Bosnie , alors que l'Ukraine aura la chance de recevoir la Grèce le 18 novembre .
La Russie , révélation du dernier Euro , écope a priori de l'adversaire le plus faible , la Slovénie .
Les autres matchs , le 14 novembre
Portugal - Bosnie
Grèce - Ukraine
Russie - Slovénie
The biggest story in the world economy is the continuing fall of the U.S. dollar , or at least it is everywhere outside of Washington , D.C. , the place most responsible for its declining value .
For good reason , the world is wondering if America has cast the dollar adrift .
A passel of Asian central banks — South Korea , Taiwan , the Philippines and Thailand — intervened yesterday to stop the greenback 's fall against their currencies .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude
Trichet also tried to buoy the buck , telling reporters that " A strong dollar is extremely important in the given circumstances . "
Neither effort made much difference .
Meanwhile , the London Independent created a splash this week with a thinly sourced and not very credible story that several nations were working secretly to trade oil in currencies other than the dollar .
The alleged conspirators all quickly denied it , but the tizzy the story created suggests the global mood of concern about holding American currency .
The attempts at intervention are probably futile , save for the short - term scare they give to currency traders .
Currency interventions are typically " sterilized , " which means that while a central bank extinguishes a currency ( say , Thai baht ) in the foreign - exchange markets it creates more baht through domestic monetary operations .
Thus there 's no underlying change in the relative supply of baht versus dollars .
The point of intervention is to frighten traders about the risks of speculating and getting burned .
Everything else is commentary .
The value of any currency is ultimately determined by the supply and demand for that currency .
And the problem for the dollar at the moment is that there is a much larger supply of dollars than there is global demand for them .
The solution rests not in Manila , Bangkok or Paris , but in Washington .

To build a fire , start by finding a clear , dry surface .
Choose a spot that is at least 6 feet ( 1.8 meters ) away from any trees or bushes .
Next , clear the area of dry leaves , twigs , or other items that could ignite and cause the fire to spread .
Before you build the fire , make sure you have a plan to put the fire out with water , dirt , or sand .
To build a fire , first gather three types of materials : tinder ( dry material like shredded bark , leaves , and grass ) , kindling ( small sticks and branches ) , and fuel wood ( larger logs ) .
Make a ball of the tinder material and place it in the center of the area you want to make a fire .
Then , stack your kindling around it in the form of a teepee .
Alternatively , you can stack the kindling on top of the tinder in a criss - cross pattern .
Leave a gap on one side so you 're able to easily light the tinder .
Once you ’ve made the basic structure , lean pieces of fuel wood against each other over the tinder and kindling .
Now you ’re ready to light your fire .
Use a lighter or matches to light the tinder .
The tinder should light quickly , but it might help to light it on multiple sides so your fire burns evenly .
If the fire is n’t catching , try gently blowing on it to help it spread , since fire needs oxygen to burn .
Once the tinder is lit , it should light the kindling , which should burn for long enough that the fuel wood will catch as well .

Kanye West 's MTV rant at Taylor Swift sparks wave of internet virals
His onstage outburst at the MTV Video Music Awards sparked outrage - and got him branded a ' jackass ' by Barack Obama .
But Kanye
West 's bizarre attack on Taylor Swift has inspired a wave of creativity among the online community .
A slew of internet virals loosely based on his tasteless critique of the country starlet have spread rapidly around the world .
The images are all loosely based on rapper West 's attack on Swift , 19 , which began as she collected an award for Best Female Video for You Belong To Me .
After grabbing her microphone , he shouted : ' Yo Taylor .
I 'm really happy for you , I 'm going to let you finish , but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time . '
He was booed by the star - studded audience and ejected from the theatre .
But the rant was watched by more than 27 million around the world and has been viewed about 2 million times on the MTV.com website alone .
The clip has since been removed from YouTube - although the off - the - cuff ( and supposedly off - the - record ) moment Obama called West a ' jackass ' is still available .

Meanwhile , inventive Facebook users have taken his words as a jumping off point , superimposing them on a number of famous images and celebrities .
These have included West - style attacks on George W. Bush , Neil Armstrong , Adolf Hitler and Usain Bolt , the Berlin wall
The audio viral of Obama 's attack has now been released online .
The US president 's candid thoughts on West have provoked a huge debate standards of journalism in the Twitter age .
ABC News said it was wrong for its employees to tweet that Obama had called West a ' jackass '
Kanye interrupts Obama ( in a spoof of the Joe Wilson controversy last week ) :
The network said some of its employees had overheard a conversation between the president and CNBC's John Harwood and did n't realise it was considered off the record .
The network apologised to the White House and CNBC .
Harwood had sat down with the president to tape an interview following his appearance on Wall Street on Monday .
Although they are competitors , CNBC and ABC share a fibre optic line to save money , and this enabled some ABC employees to listen in on the interview as it was being taped for later use .
E-mails shot around among ABC employees about Obama 's comments , said Jeffrey Schneider , ABC News spokesman .
Before anything was reported on ABC's air or Web site , at least three network employees took to Twitter to spread the news .
One was Terry Moran , a former White House correspondent .
He logged on to Twitter and typed : " Pres. Obama just called Kanye West a ' jackass ' for his outburst at VMAs when Taylor Swift won .
Now THAT'S presidential . "
When ABC News authorities found out about it , they had the tweets deleted after about an hour , Schneider said .
But the news was out .
Harwood said there was no explicit agreement with the president that those comments were off the record .
But he said it is broadcast tradition that such pre-interview chatter is considered off the record until the formal interview begins .
Harwood is holding to that :
He would not discuss what the president said before their interview and has no plans to do so on CNBC .
He said he was aware that it was likely someone outside of CNBC was listening to his conversation with the president .
Hell hath no fury like the staying power of baked on food on your pots and pans .
Sometimes a soak overnight is required , but to guarantee things will come clean by morning , try turning to your dishwasher detergent instead .

Like our parents before us , we 've left pots and pans out overnight , filled with water and dishsoap to let stuck on food soften for a morning cleaning .
It does n't always work , but it 's better than nothing , right ?

Maybe not .
The folks over at the weblog Parent Hacks suggest using 1 teaspoon of dishwasher detergent ( that you would normally use in your dishwasher ) in combination with hot water .
Let it sit in your pan overnight and the food should rinse clean without any scrubbing .
We were skeptical , so we put it to the test last night and it worked like a charm — even on the crusty leftover cheese from our baked macaroni dish .
It did n't even require a once over with our sponge , just a simple rinse and it all came clean .
Best of all , it did n't require any wear and tear to our sponges or additional elbow grease .
Have your own have a tip on getting your dishes sparkling without a lot of work ?

Madison —
The first solid - if still incomplete - employment numbers for federal stimulus spending by Wisconsin state government show that retaining government positions was job one .
Three - fourths of 8,284 stimulus - related jobs accounted for so far were public - sector posts protected by the federal infusion into state and local government coffers , Gov. Jim Doyle 's office reported .
That included teachers , police officers and other government workers .
Of the remaining one - fourth , it 's not clear how many are private - sector jobs , and whether the jobs were retained or newly created .
Predictably , the report touched off partisan disagreement , with Democrats calling the figures a good start and Republicans questioning the success of the hotly debated federal package approved in February , especially in light of recent record job losses .
The state - released numbers , meeting a federal reporting deadline , are just a slice of the stimulus picture in Wisconsin .
They do not include money funneled directly to local municipalities or to the University of Wisconsin system ; those reports are being made separately .
The spending so far represents just over one - third of the $ 1.92 billion awarded to the state .
The Doyle administration said that $ 680 million of the state - controlled funds has been spent so far - nearly all of the $ 701 million received .
Another $ 1.2 billion has been awarded but has not yet landed in Wisconsin , Doyle 's office said .
Eventually , and more broadly , an estimated $ 7.7 billion will go to Wisconsin individuals , governments , nonprofit agencies and private firms under the stimulus plan .
The $ 1.92 billion state - controlled chunk eventually should directly save or create some 25,000 jobs over the next couple of years , said Chris Patton , director of Wisconsin 's Office of Recovery and Reinvestment .
" This is money well - spent , " Patton told reporters at the Capitol .
The rough per-job cost of $ 82,000 is below original federal estimates , he said .
The stimulus package was designed to spread spending mainly over two years .
Many of the funds dedicated for road construction wo n't be spent until 2010 .
Earlier Tuesday , state government 's top economist told an Assembly committee that the effect of the federal stimulus package " is only really beginning to be felt . "
John Koskinen of the state Department of Revenue noted that much of the money will not be spent until 2010 or later .
The main effect of the stimulus money that went to state and local governments was to prop up health care and education spending so the state could balance its budget without huge tax increases , Koskinen said .
Republicans not happy
Republicans on the Assembly Committee on Jobs , the Economy and Small Business noted that taxes were in fact raised in the last budget despite the aid from Washington .
After the hearing , Rep. Rich Zipperer ( R - Pewaukee ) , a member of the committee , called the stimulus job report " very disappointing " because so few private - sector jobs appear to have been created .
He noted that the August survey of Wisconsin households showed 12,800 fewer employed than in July , and 118,600 fewer employed than one year ago .
And other Republicans said the report calls into question the whole stimulus program .
" The point I take away from it is , this is government giving government money to create government jobs , " said Rep. Phil Montgomery ( R - Ashwaubenon ) .
Top Democrats chose to highlight not the tangible job - creation / retention figure but a month - old White House estimate that the broader spin - off effect of the stimulus bill had boosted employment by some 22,100 jobs in Wisconsin .
" Those jobs are helping Wisconsin families keep a roof over their heads and food on the table , " Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan ( D - Janesville ) said in a statement .
The report from Doyle 's office also found that under the federal stimulus funding :
• 240 homes are having lead paint removed .
• More than 89,500 meals have been provided to 9,175 homebound seniors .
• 476 people have received services meant to prevent homelessness .
• Almost 4,000 young people received summer jobs .
• 175 AmeriCorps members provided services at 139 locations .
The state used $ 632 million of the federal funds to help fill a giant budget hole .
Supporters said that helped the overall economy by keeping people employed and saving essential government services ; critics said it allowed the state to avoid making tough spending decisions .
Koskinen delivered a generally upbeat forecast Tuesday , but also made it clear that the budding recovery is fragile and that a return to pre-recession employment and income levels is two to three years off .
" It 's a long way back , " Koskinen said .
Wisconsin is " not the epicenter of the recession " and could see economic growth in 2010 that tops the U.S. average , Koskinen said .
Wisconsin 's status as the No. 1 manufacturing state in the country will benefit it as the recovery grows , Koskinen told the Assembly committee .
He said many states are facing far worse conditions than Wisconsin , citing in part the higher rate of housing speculation elsewhere .
New signs of wage growth could " easily be derailed " by a new shock to the economy , he said .
The recovery , Koskinen said , " is just getting under way . . . and it does n't really have firm , established momentum . "
All wars depress me , but this Afghanistan one in particular makes me want to scream .
Why are we there ?
Theoretically , to hunt down Osama bin Laden and stop al Qaeda from using it as a base .
But is al Qaeda still there ?
Is that likely to work ?
Is it even possible ?
And if it is possible , is it worth the cost ?
Nice to see a high - ranking Democrat asking these questions , too :
The veteran chairman of the House Appropriations Committee posed a series of tough questions Thursday to his colleagues and the Obama administration about the wisdom of further U.S. engagement in that war - torn country .
Rep. David R. Obey , D - Wis. , in a statement expressed significant skepticism about the prospects for success of any major effort to stabilize the country , either through additional U.S. troops or by a concerted effort to train more Afghan troops and improve the country ’s governance and economy .
“ The problem with increasing the number of troops is that we become the lightning rod , and our presence runs the risk of inciting more anti-American sentiment that can become a recruiting tool for the very forces we seek to curtail , ” Obey said of one option President Obama is weighing .
“ If any adjustment is made in U.S. troop levels , it would be much better if those troops were focused on the job of training Afghani troops and police to take on the job of securing the population and maintaining law and order , ” he said .
“ But even there , we have to ask what is achievable .
My understanding is that there have never been more than about 90,000 troops under the sway of the central government .
Now we are told that the goal is to train up to 400,000 soldiers and police personnel .
I think it is reasonable to ask whether that is a realistic and achievable goal . ”
As for a policy bent on counter - insurgency and nation - building , Obey said , “ We should be asking not what policy is theoretically the most intellectually coherent , but which policy is actually achievable given the only tools we have in the region ; the Afghani and Pakistani governments .
Is there sufficient leadership , popular support , and political will , not in the United States but in Afghanistan , necessary for effective governance to take hold ? “
Equally important , he said , “ Do we really have the tools to overcome language , culture , history and a 90 percent illiteracy rate to sufficiently transform such a country ? ”
The widespread idea that Mars is red due to rocks being rusted by the water that once flooded the red planet may not be correct .
Recent laboratory studies show that red dust may be formed by ongoing grinding of surface rocks and liquid water need not have played any significant role in the formation process .
These findings , which open up the debate about the history of water on Mars and whether it has ever been habitable , have been presented at the European Planetary Science Congress by Dr Jonathan Merrison .
“ Mars should really look blackish , between its white polar caps , because most of the rocks at mid-latitudes are basalt .
For decades we assumed that the reddish regions on Mars are related to the water - rich early history of the planet and that , at least in some areas , water - bearing heavily oxidized iron minerals are present , ” said Dr. Merrison , of the Aarhus Mars Simulation Laboratory , Denmark
Accurate knowledge of the composition and mineralogy of the planet is vital in understanding the structure and evolution of the near - surface environment and its interaction with the atmosphere , as well as in searching for potential habitats on Mars .
Fine red dust covers
Mars ’s surface and is even present in Mars ’s atmosphere , dominating the weather and sometimes becoming so thick that it plunges the planet into darkness .
Even though dust is ubiquitous , we do not fully understand its physical , chemical and geological properties .
In their recent laboratory study , scientists at the Mars Simulation Laboratory have pioneered a novel technique to simulate the sand transport on Mars .
They hermetically sealed sand ( quartz ) samples in glass flasks and mechanically “ tumbled ” them for several months , turning each flask ten million times .
After gently tumbling pure quartz sand for seven months , almost 10 % of the sand had been reduced to dust .
When scientists added powdered magnetite , an iron oxide present in Martian basalt , to the flasks they were surprised to see it getting redder as the flasks were tumbled .
“ Reddish - orange material deposits , which resemble mineral mantles known as desert varnish , started appearing on the tumbled flasks .
Subsequent analysis of the flask material and dust has shown that the magnetite was transformed into the red mineral hematite , through a completely mechanical process without the presence of water at any stage of this process , ” said Dr Merrison .
The scientists suspect that , as the quartz sand grains are tumbled around , they get quickly eroded and an alteration of minerals through contact ensues .
How exactly this happens needs to be further investigated through more experimental and analytical work .
However , the first experiments show that this process occurs not only in air but also in a dried carbon dioxide atmosphere , i.e. in conditions that perfectly resemble those occurring on Mars .
It may also imply that the reddish Martian dust is geologically recent .
Scientists worldwide , aided by new missions and improved instrumentation reaching the planet , will continue developing new improved computer models and Earth - bound simulators to try to pierce through the red planet ’s mysteries .
“ By simulating the conditions and developing accurate analogues of the Martian environment , we will certainly gain a deeper understanding of its dusty nature .
In particular , developing better analogues of the Martian surface and atmosphere is vital in interpreting observations made on Mars by landers as well as pioneering the next generation of experiments to be flown , ” said Dr Merrison .
Weight is a sensitive subject with Mr. Christie , 47 , who seldom speaks publicly , even jokingly , about the subject .
In an interview , he said he had struggled with his weight since he stopped playing organized sports at 18 .
In 1997 , when he was serving as a county freeholder , he lost 40 pounds on a bet but gained it all back .
The same thing happened after he dropped 50 pounds on the Atkins diet from 2002 to 2003 .
He said he had become “ numb ” to fat jokes after so long .
“ It ’s one of the more difficult things I ’ve had to deal with in my life , ” he said .
“ But I do n’t see how it ’s relevant to my being governor .
I was a really good U.S. attorney , and I was struggling with it for those seven years .
It ’s just part of who I am , unfortunately . ”
Image Mr. Corzine , a fitness buff , said candidates often objected to depictions of themselves .

Despite the constant travel and take - out food of a political race , Mr. Christie said he had lost 25 pounds since June by working with a trainer three mornings a week .
“ It ’s not like I did n’t think it would come up in the campaign in some context , ” he said .
“ But I think the governor has decided to overdo it .
I think it ’s silly , it ’s stupid , and I do n’t think anybody really cares about it . ”
Mr. Christie declined to answer only one question on the topic : what his weight actually is .
“ No chance , ” he said , with a laugh .
He said the number would not cause concern about his health , but added , “ I do n’t think it ’s anybody else ’s business . ”
Although significantly overweight politicians are increasingly rare these days , especially at the national level , several governors have very publicly tried to shed pounds , often unsuccessfully .
Bill Richardson of New Mexico has told of trying the Atkins and liquid diets to little avail .
Sonny Perdue of Georgia weighed nearly 230 pounds when he threw away a Snickers bar to start dieting in 2003 .
Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has lost 48 pounds , but still carries 220 on a 5 - foot - 11 - inch frame .
We could n't get a handle on what at first seemed so " bloated " about the T - Mobile Pulse until we held it up to the iPhone : this is the first production Android phone to get a " regular " 3.5 - inch screen , instead of the rather narrow 3.2 - inchers on HTC 's trio of Android devices .
Sure , it 's the same resolution , but we really feel the breathing room .
Overall we 'd say the Pulse lacks a little something something up against the polished design of the HTC Hero hardware or the iPhone 3G , but it 's still plenty alluring -- especially considering that this is being positioned as a pay - as - you - go device .
The capacitive screen is quite responsive , and so is the Android UI underneath , which has been modded by T - Mobile to include an odd new home screen that you can pan up , down , left and right on , for a total grid of nine screenfuls of widgets and what have you .
Interestingly , the phone merges the back button with the home button , which actually cuts down considerably on the madness of typical Android phone button layouts .
Overall , we 'd say the phone provides a quite alluring example of what manufacturers that are n't HTC can pull off with Android : a cheap , sexy , powerful device running a " real " OS and the world 's best mobile Gmail app .

Hicks and colleagues report in the April 16 , 2009 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine regarding civilian non-combatant deaths during the current Iraq War period ( 2003 - 2008 ) was seriously flawed .
Their stated goal was to analyze the causes of these deaths .
To accomplish this purpose they used the database of Iraqbodycount.org that estimates 91,358 deaths due to “ armed violence ” .
For this report the database was pared down to 60,481 .
Several aspects of this are problematic .
Iraqbodycount.org lists no publications in peer - reviewed biomedical journals .
This is important since the methodology used by the authors on this website has been widely criticized .
Their methodology lends itself to undercounting of the excess dead , because they require documentary proof of each death .
This ignores an important and obvious problem that may be concisely phrased “ the fog of war ” .
How this manifests in Iraq includes mass unmarked graves , rapid burials by Muslims of their relatives without notifying press or authorities , poor communications due to war - related destruction , etc .
Furthermore , to be included in this database , deaths must have been due to munitions .
There is no mention of war - related water , food , or medical shortages or excess mortality due to the previous addition of chemical and radiological toxins in prior ( sometimes lower level ) war making ( 1991 - 2002 ) on Iraq by the U.S .
Other studies , using other methods , have estimated a much higher number of excess deaths due to the war , most notably those of the Johns Hopkins group , as published in The Lancet .
Their mean estimate for the excess mortality March , 2003 to August , 2006 is about 655,000 .
They estimated mortality using a cross-sectional cluster sample survey .
This group ’s papers are not referenced by Hicks and coworkers nor is there any mention of this large discrepancy and the controversy it engendered .
This , despite the fact that Dr. Hicks and Professor Spagat , a co-author , have extensively criticized the Johns Hopkins work elsewhere .
At the time of publication , the methods used by the Hopkins group were criticized bitterly by the Bush regime , though results using the same methods in the Congo were quoted approvingly by Colin Powell and Tony Blair .
Clearly , epidemiology is not an exact science , but the Hopkins group approaches this fact scientifically , soberly working with the degree of imprecision inherent to the events being investigated .
On the other hand , the current Iraqbodycount.org website does not make clear that though each and every fatality they list is certain , it is also certain that their total is inaccurately low .
It may be argued by the authors that their project is unrelated to the objections I bring forth here .
After all , they sought to determine what sorts of munitions were responsible for acute munitions - related deaths .
From that they could determine which party to the conflict is the proximate cause of death .
However it is important to place the data and conclusions there from in proper context .
By referring only to the Iraqbodycount.org without background or further comment , the impression is given that there is no controversy surrounding the issue .
As this is published as a Perspective in so distinguished a publication as The New England Journal of Medicine , an unearned imprimatur is given to the Iraqbodycount.org database .
Finally , all analyses and discussions of war mortality are enjoined from an ethical point of view , to fully consider , in context , the total excess mortality ( and morbidity ) .
Otherwise , a large number of the prematurely and wrongly dead are prematurely and wrongly forgotten .
I have sent a modified version of this comment to both The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet ; they failed to publish it .

The Haiku alpha is barely out the door , and we already have another important news item about the open source reimplementation of the BeOS .
About 18 months ago , Evgeny Abdraimov started porting the Qt4 graphical toolkit to Haiku , and now , we ave some seriously epic screenshots showing a multitude of Qt4 applications running in Haiku , as well as a developer preview release .
Gerasim “ 3d Eyes ” Troeglazov and Anton Sokolov have joined Abdraimov in the porting effort , which ishosted at OsDrawer , the hosting service for open source Haiku projects .
This summer , they could show off the analog clock unning on Haiku , but right now , they ’ve got a whole boatload of Qt4 applications , running in Haiku – including the WebKit - based Arora browser and QtDesigner .
The screenshots show Qt4 applications from all walks of life running inside Haiku .
In the screenshot showing Arora , I can even see some theme integration work going on there for Qt4 applications , which should , eventually , make them indistinguishable from regular Haiku applications .
You can grab the first developer preview from BeOSFrance .
This porting effort is a testament to the Haiku operating system and the three developers leading the porting effort , but of course also to Qt4 itself .
Well done , everyone !

The rows of white turbines spinning over wheat fields and ridgelines in eastern Oregon are ample evidence that renewable energy from wind is real and growing .
So much so that the aging network of transmission lines and power stations that carries energy around the region is loaded to its limits .
But wind developers are just getting started .
And thousands of miles of new power lines carried by skyscraper - sized steel towers will need to be laid across deserts , farms and forests as more wind farms rise in farther - flung corners of Oregon and the West .
It wo n't be cheap , or without controversy .
More than half of Oregon is public land that Oregonians value for recreation , unobstructed vistas and habitat for sensitive species .
And the cleared corridors that accommodate such transmission lines cut a wide swath .
Expanding the power grid is one trade - off of the national effort to expand clean energy technology and combat climate change .
" There 's no question that we are changing the face of the state right now , " said Brent Fenty , executive director of the
in Bend , which is tracking transmission proposals in eastern Oregon .
" And the important part is that we do that in a way that is responsible and reflects our values . "
Energy experts have long lamented the inadequacy of the nation 's energy grid .
The federal government estimates that even though electricity demand has increased nationally by a quarter since 1990 , construction of new transmission facilities has slowed .
The
also says $ 60 billion in new investment in transmission , or about 12,650 miles of new lines nationwide , is needed by 2030 to get 20 percent of power from wind .
Oregon
among states for wind power capacity .
It now gets 7 percent of its power from wind , versus 1 percent a few years ago .
And the state will require large utilities to source a quarter of the power they sell from renewable resources such as wind by 2025 .
The creation of federal dams such as Bonneville over the past century was accompanied by the build - out of major new transmission lines to carry the power they produced .
And over the past decade , excess capacity on those old lines -- due in no small part to the disappearance of energy - eating aluminum smelters -- has been filled up by new wind projects .
But now those lines are getting full .
" Especially with all the wind projects on the east side , the cross-Cascades capacity is beginning to be congested , " said Michael Mikolaitis , director of transmission projects for Portland General Electric .
Northwest projects
PGE proposes building a
from near Boardman in northeast Oregon , across the Cascade Mountains and into the Willamette Valley , one of a half - dozen or so proposed transmission projects in the Northwest .
PGE says it has requests to carry 700 megawatts of wind power from proposed wind farms near Maupin and Arlington , and its planners expect the line to serve 400 megawatts beyond that .
( One megawatt of wind power is enough to power about 200 homes . )
The new line also would connect to PGE 's planned natural gas plant , another existing natural gas plant and a coal plant near Boardman .
PGE hopes to break ground in 2013 and have the line up and running two years later .
But building a transmission line is complicated .
Terrain varies .
Transmission towers are up to 190 feet tall , and they are built in corridors 125 to 250 feet wide that have to be kept clear of trees .
" These corridors have a long - term environmental impact in that they are permitted clear - cuts .
Most of the time they are hundreds of feet wide , and that impacts wildlife habitat and clean water , " said Erik Fernandez , wilderness coordinator for the group
.
Power lines waiting to go up
Idaho Power :
Roughly 300 - mile line from Boardman to Hemingway , Idaho
Portland General Electric :
200 - mile line from near Boardman to Salem
Pacific Gas and Electric , Avista Utilities and British Columbia Transmission Corp. :
1,000 - mile line from Northern California to southeastern British Columbia
PacifiCorp :
Roughly 30 - mile line from to Wallula , Wash . , to McNary ; 375 - mile line from Hemingway , Idaho , to near Klamath Falls
TransCanada :
970 - mile line from central Alberta to near Columbia River Gorge
Bonneville Power Administration :
Nine projects totaling about 225 miles of lines
Source : utility companies
About 27 miles of the Cascade Crossing line would be on U.S. Forest Service land , with an additional 30 miles over the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs reservation and most of the rest on private land .
New lines often mean new rights of way , and across the American West , there are about 10,000 miles of new high - voltage lines -- those exceeding 200 kilovolts -- being considered in the next 10 years , according to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council .
At a meeting of Western governors in June , Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal lamented that transmission lines could make his state look like a jumbled plate of spaghetti .
" We are talking about in a very short time span having a massive build - out of the power infrastructure .
And if we do this the wrong way , there 's going to be a large price tag environmentally , " Fernandez said .
Permitting process
Most of Oregon 's wind development has focused on the Columbia River Gorge , where there are existing transmission lines , farmers willing to lease their land for turbines and good wind , at least in the summer .
" If you take a look at maps of where the high - quality wind sites are , they 're generally not where people live .
And ultimately the energy that 's produced needs to be delivered to consumers , " said Brian Silverstein , senior vice president for transmission services at the
.
The agency , which markets the power from federal dams , has 15,200 miles of transmission lines in Oregon , Washington , Idaho and Montana , that make up about three - fourths of the regional grid .
And it proposes 225 miles of new lines , mostly to handle the increased energy production from new wind farms , Silverstein said .
Those thousands of miles of lines do n't take into account the multitude of smaller feeder lines that will be needed to connect scattered wind projects to the grid .
A good example is the roughly 50 - mile line
proposes to carry power from its planned wind farm on the north end of Steens Mountain in Harney County .
Originally envisioned to cross the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , the line was rerouted after opposition from environmental groups .
The new route would cross mostly private land , with six power poles proposed on Bureau of Land Management land , said Columbia President Chris Crowley .
" Our project is permitted , and it's on private land .
But to connect to the grid , we have to cross federal land .
And that 's proven to be the hook , " Crowley said .
The BLM has 30 pending applications for transmission projects in the West , according to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar .
On Wednesday , Salazar and other administration officials announced an agreement to streamline the permitting process for transmission projects on public land .
Simultaneously , Western states and federal agencies are trying to plot where new transmission corridors should be located based on where the renewable resources are greatest and potential environmental impacts the least .
That includes the
, a plan to designate 6,000 miles of new energy corridors on 3 million acres of federal lands in Oregon and 10 other Western states where applications to build new pipelines or electricity lines would be expedited .

During their long history , no one has come up with a suitable and as - popular alternative ( such as a ray gun ) .
This list looks at ten of the greatest firearms in history – and in the bonus section poses a question .
10 MG - 42
“ Hitler ’s Buzzsaw , ” invented in 1942 , is infamous around the world as the weapon used at Omaha Beach to mow Americans down , but it was used in Russia to much more brutal effect .
It fired 1,200 rounds of 8 mm rifle ammunition per minute , which is sufficient to cut a man in half .
It was air - cooled , and could melt its barrel if fired non -stop for 5 minutes .
That ’s why the Germans had several barrel at hand , and could change to a new one in only 60 seconds .
9 Glock Handgun
The Glock is the ultimate in modern reliability .
You can pour sand down the barrel and it will shoot .
It will shoot underwater .
It is commonly used in 9 mm , but is chambered for .40 Sig and .45 ACP among others .
It is the standard law enforcement sidearm today and will continue to be for a long time .
It almost never jams , is waterproof , mostly plastic .
8 .303 Lee-Enfield
The British equivalent of the German Mauser has one trump on it , a 10 round magazine , compared to 8 .
The British adopted it into the army in 1895 and used it exclusively until 1957 .
Soldiers were drilled until they could perform “ the mad minute , ” firing 30 rounds in 60 seconds and hitting 30 targets .
This required reloading twice , and working the bolt back and forth in less than half a second .
The rifle is accurate to 1,000 yards with open sights , and served in India ( notoriously used against unarmed civilians ) , the Boer War , both World Wars , and many others .
7 .50 M2HB “ Ma Deuce ” BMG
The Browning Machine Gun is chambered for the most awe - inspiring shoulder - fired cartridge to date .
It is designed with one thing in mind : power tends to corrupt ; absolute power is kinda sweet .
The 800 grain powder load has 14,895 foot - pounds of energy at the muzzle , which is enough to put a full metal jacketed round through three approaching vehicles .
It has shot down helicopters with one round .
Now imagine a belt - fed machine gun spewing a curtain of these rounds at you at 1,200 rounds per minute .
Special Sabot rounds can go clean through tanks .
6 Smith and Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum Revolver
Made famous by Dirty Harry in 1971 , it was invented in 1955 , and is still thought of as one of the most powerful handguns in the world , though it has been eclipsed by the .500 magnum , the Desert Eagle .50 AE , the .454 Casull and a few others .
But what those other hand cannons lack is controlability and comparatively low cost .
The .44 Magnum will still run you at least $ 800 new , which is a lot for a revolver , but very cheap compared to other magnums .
You will not break your wrist shooting it , and yet it can drop Cape Buffaloes and Polar Bears .
If I may be afforded one bad joke , it will make your day .
Provided that you feel lucky .
Punk .
5 The Mauser Model 1893 Bolt Action Rifle
The bolt action had been kicking around since at least 1824 , when Paul Mauser and Co. patented the 1893 version in 7 mm .
It has become the benchmark , on which all bolt action rifles are based , and against which all are compared .
There are three primary bolt action systems : the Lee-Enfield , the Mauser , and the Mosin - Nagant .
Of the three , the Mauser system is by far the most widespread , the most reliable , and the most battle - proven rifle mechanism the world has ever seen .
The 1893 Mauser was the first , and original models still operate perfectly .
4 Colt Single Action Army Revolver
The icon of the Old West , the Colt .45 revolver was invented in 1873 and immediately caught on as extraordinarily accurate at close range , compared to the ball and cap conversions popular at the time .
Its caliber was sufficient to flip a charging man backward off his feet .
It can be used today to hunt deer and black bears .
The larger powder loads can take down grizzly bears .
It ’s as famous as the gun of Wyatt Earp , among other Old West celebrities .
3 Henry Repeating Rifle
The granddaddy of all lever - action firearms .
Benjamin Tyler
Henry invented it in 1860 , but neither the Union nor Confederacy wanted much to do with it , as they were afraid their soldiers would fire too quickly and waste ammunition .
If I may use a cliched joke , “ military intelligence . ”
Thank you .
It fired a revolutionary , self - contained cartridge in .44 caliber , with 568 foot - pounds of stopping power , more than enough to put a man down .
It held 16 rounds in a tube magazine , and a good man could fire 28 rounds per minute , so much better than 3 per minute with a muzzle - loading percussion cap musket , that if either side had adopted the rifle as standard for infantry , that side would certainly have won .
2 AK - 47
Accurate enough to do the job out to about 400 yards , which is all anyone usually needs in a battle , the AK - 47 is the ultimate pinnacle in rugged reliability .
It will not break down under fire unless something catastrophic happens to it .
You can drive a tank over it , throw it against a wall , submerge it in sand , water , mud , and every time it will go right on firing when you pull the trigger .
I know a Vietnam veteran who was walking through triple canopy jungle one day in 1966 , came across an abandoned AK - 47 , and could n’t get the bolt to slide back .
It was too corroded from the rain and weather .
The wood was rotting off .
But he put it butt first on the ground , stomped the action open , and it chambered a round , which he fired accurately at a tree 50 yards away .
He stomped the action open again , and it chambered another round , which he fired accurately .
1 Colt 1911 .45 ACP
Every bit as rugged and reliable as the AK - 47 , this handgun was invented by John Browning for the Colt Company , in 1911 , as a sidearm for American soldiers .
It immediately proved itself a world beater in WWI , again in WWII , and has been a cornerstone of the American military ever since .
But its most impressive feat has been the ease with which even untrained civilians can fire it accurately , keep it in working order , and defend themselves ably with it .
7 + 1 rounds of fat , man - stopping power perfect for close - range self - defense .
Soldiers have dragged it through swamps in the Pacific Theater of WWII , with their fingers on the trigger , then whipped it out of the muck and fired all 8 rounds accurately .
The only way to improve on it would be to make it cheaper .
You ’ll spend $ 1,000 on one .
+ A Question
In the United States , everyone has the right to bear arms .
As a non-American my question is : is this a fundamental human right which should be extended to all people in the world ?
Should all Iraqi ’s have the right to bear arms ?
If all Chinese people had the right , would they be living under an oppressive regime today or would they have risen up and put it down ?
Most important , we will require insurance companies to cover routine checkups , preventive care and screening tests like mammograms and colonoscopies .
There ’s no reason that we should n’t be catching diseases like breast cancer and prostate cancer on the front end .
It makes sense , it saves lives and it can also save money .
This is what reform is about .
If you do n’t have health insurance , you will finally have quality , affordable options once we pass reform .
If you have health insurance , we will make sure that no insurance company or government bureaucrat gets between you and the care you need .
If you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor .
If you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan .
You will not be waiting in any lines .
This is not about putting the government in charge of your health insurance .
I do n’t believe anyone should be in charge of your health care decisions but you and your doctor  not government bureaucrats , not insurance companies .
The long and vigorous debate about health care that ’s been taking place over the past few months is a good thing .
It ’s what America ’s all about .
But let ’s make sure that we talk with one another , and not over one another .
We are bound to disagree , but let ’s disagree over issues that are real , and not wild misrepresentations that bear no resemblance to anything that anyone has actually proposed .
This is a complicated and critical issue , and it deserves a serious debate .
Despite what we ’ve seen on television , I believe that serious debate is taking place at kitchen tables all across America .
In the past few years , I ’ve received countless letters and questions about health care .
Some people are in favor of reform , and others have concerns .
But almost everyone understands that something must be done .
Almost everyone knows that we must start holding insurance companies accountable and give Americans a greater sense of stability and security when it comes to their health care .
I am confident that when all is said and done , we can forge the consensus we need to achieve this goal .
We are already closer to achieving health - insurance reform than we have ever been .
We have the American Nurses Association and the American Medical Association on board , because our nation ’s nurses and doctors know firsthand how badly we need reform .
We have broad agreement in Congress on about 80 percent of what we ’re trying to do .
And we have an agreement from the drug companies to make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors .
The AARP supports this policy , and agrees with us that reform must happen this year .
We 'd love to hear from you .

Autoimmune disease has devastating consequences for healthy tissue .
Now , in mice , the same cells that can drive the body to destroy its own tissue have been used to fight cancer .
The cells are a recently discovered type of immune cell called Th17 .
These cells play a key role in autoimmune disease – in which the immune system mistakenly identifies the body ’s own tissues as foreign and attack them .
We already know that some people ’s immune systems have a natural ability to fight some types of cancer .
But how exactly this works – and why it does n’t always do so – is n’t known .
Discovered in 2005 , Th17 cells are thought to have a part in triggering the inflammation and tissue injury associated with autoimmune diseases .
But they also have a helpful role in fighting bacterial infections .
Advertisement
Guilt assumed
In addition , Natalia Martin - Orozco at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , Texas , and her colleagues noticed Th17 cells infiltrating cancerous tumours .
But as inflammation is known to promote the growth of cancer , they assumed that the cells were helping the tumours to grow .
To investigate further , the team engineered mice that were deficient in Th17 cells and then injected them with a strain of melanoma that affects the lungs .
To their surprise , they found that these Th17 - deficient mice experienced far more aggressive cancer growth than normal mice – with the cancer completely smothering the lungs within 16 days .
“ It was the opposite of what we expected , ” says Martin - Orozco .
“ If anything , [ the Th17 cells ] were promoting an anti-tumour response . ”
Next , they incubated Th17 cells with proteins specific to the lung melanoma .
This process was designed to enable the cells to recognise such a tumour if they encountered it .
The researchers then injected these tumour - specific cells into mice at the same time as injecting melanoma cells .
After 16 days , mice injected with the tumour - specific Th17 cells had barely detectable tumours , compared with mice injected with tumour cells alone .
What ’s more , injecting the cells into mice with established tumours reduced the tumours ’ mass by 75 per cent .
Set the T cells on them
Martin- Orozco believes that Th17 cells recognise tumours and , in response , release chemicals that attract immune cells called dendritic cells to the tumour .
These seize tumour proteins and take them to lymph nodes , where the dendritic cells prime killer T cells to recognise and attack the tumour .
The next step is to see if Th17 cells from humans also have an anti-tumour effect .
“ While there is much work to be done , these findings imply the possibility of taking a patient ’s Th17 cells , expanding them in the lab and then reinfusing them as a treatment , ” adds Chen Dong , also of MD Anderson , who supervised the work .
Similar approaches using killer T cells are already being investigated as a cancer treatment , with some promising results .
The researchers also plan to explore whether the production of extra Th17 cells could be stimulated through vaccination .
To avoid the risk of injected cells destroying healthy tissue , Th17 cells that are reactive to tumours but not to normal tissues would have to be identified , Dong cautions .
The team also needs to figure out which types of cancer Th17 cells respond to , and at which stage of the disease .
Caetano Reis e Sousa , head of the immunobiology lab at Cancer Research UK ’s London Research Institute , sounds says the work is “ exciting ” but cautions that it is at an early stage .
“ The results need to be validated and extended before scientists know if a treatment based on this approach could one day be used to help cancer patients . ”

What OurClients Say
Mr. Jared Martens came through better than I could 've hoped .
After the judge admonished the petitioner 's lawyer for disobeying orders , Mr. Martens proved the petitioner 's case was frivolous .
In under 20 mins , the case was dismissed .
Josh L .
My experience with Jared Martens was positive to say the least .
He helped me with an issue that a number of attorneys told me was a waste of time or they did n't have time for .
I was told that it was pointless , but it was an issue that was important to me .
The team at Martens Law Office took the time to understand my issue and promptly handled it to an outcome that was beyond my every expectation .
I would recommend this attorney to anyone who is looking .
They are the best that I have ever worked with .
Matt W .
I called Martens Law Office for a free consultation and after I met with Jared , I felt confident that he understood my situation .
Jared explained the legal process to me , and followed up with phone calls and emails letting me know what was going on throughout the process , which was helpful because I had never had to do this before .
I am happy with the results of my case , and feel that Jared did an outstanding job .
He understands the legal process and the importance of my goals and made the two work together .
I hope I never need another attorney but if I do , I know I will go to Martens Law Office .
Haden D .
Jared Martens put our minds at ease when we discussed our situation with him .
He is a great guy and we loved working with him and his staff .
We could n't have asked for a better outcome .
Robin L .
I used Jared for my DUI and I have to say it was the best experience .
He had a great understanding of the DUI process and did a exceptional job dealing with the legal system .
I could not have handled the process alone and would not have the same experience without him .
I would recommend Jared to anyone with a DUI .
Do n't try and do it alone .
You will have a much better experience with an attorney and it will be less painful .
Worth every penny !!!!
Jared is an exceptional lawyer and provided the best experience .
Brett B .
We made a comic today even though Wes transformed into a cephalopod while Tony was giddy over some insider information .
Do n’t forget !
Today is the LAST DAY to enter the ASP Anniversary Contest !
Have it emailed to us before we wake up tomorrow morning .
Google PowerMeter
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Google has announced it has secured its first official device partner for Google PowerMeter , which means you can now use the software without having a smart meter installed by your utility company .
Google PowerMeter was launched earlier this year , and is a free software package for monitoring electricity usage .
Until now it has only worked for homes with smart meters installed , which is only 6 % of the market in North America .
Smart meters are installed by utilities and provide information about electricity use more regularly than the more usual monthly .
They are designed mainly to help the utilities cope with peaks and troughs in the demand for electricity .
Knowing first - hand how much energy your home is using is a powerful way to adjust your energy use .
So Google decided to make electricity use data accessible to everyone , with Google PowerMeter .
After a year of talks , Google has now finalized a device partnership with Energy Inc. and its product The Energy Detective ( TED ) .
This means that anyone in North America who purchases and installs a TED 5000 will be able to use Google PowerMeter via the web or via smart phones with iGoogle if they wish to monitor their energy use .
If you already have a TED 5000 a free upgrade is available for download .
One advantage of the partnership is that the software can become available for more people more quickly .
Another advantage is that the TED 5000 provides more data than the smart meters , and the information is available online from Google PowerMeter at 10 - minute intervals .
This is significantly better than smart meter data , and the device is geared more to the consumer than to the electricity provider .
Near - immediate access to energy use information is important because the energy user is likely to be more engaged with the data , and that engagement tends to lead to changes in behavior that result in reducing the electricity use .
The PowerMeter and TED 5000 combination will allow users to view almost instant data , as well as weekly trends and comparisons with other PowerMeter users .
TED 5000
Energy Inc.'s President and CEO , Dolph Rodenberg said he expects the partnership with Google to raise public awareness of energy use .
An association with Google might also help with Energy Inc. 's efforts to raise funds .
The standard TED 5000 retails for about $ 200 , and can be installed by anyone familiar enough with electrical components and the circuit breaker panel to be confident working with the electric panel removed .
Installation is a breeze for an electrician .
Energy Inc. is the first company to become a device partner with Google PowerMeter , and Google is actively seeking more energy monitor manufacturers for possible future partnerships .

One of the most cherished items in my possession is a postcard that was sent from Mississippi to the Upper West Side of Manhattan in June 1964 .
“ Dear Mom and Dad , ” it says , “ I have arrived safely in Meridian , Mississippi .
This is a wonderful town and the weather is fine .
I wish you were here .
The people in this city are wonderful and our reception was very good .
All my love , Andy . ”
That was the last word sent to his family by Andrew Goodman , a 20 - year - old college student who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan , along with fellow civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and James Chaney , on his first full day in Mississippi  June 21 , the same date as the postmark on the card .
The goal of the three young men had been to help register blacks to vote .
The postcard was given to me by Andrew ’s brother , David , who has become a good friend .
Andrew and that postcard came to mind over the weekend as I was thinking about the sense of helplessness so many ordinary Americans have been feeling as the nation is confronted with one enormous , seemingly intractable problem after another .
The helplessness is beginning to border on paralysis .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , nearly a decade long , are going badly , and there is no endgame in sight .

Ron Paul has a bestseller .
That sounds so nice I�ll say it twice .
Ron Paul has a bestseller .
His new book , End the Fed , is number 30 on Amazon as this is written -- with 167 mostly glowing reviews -- and his reception last week on Jon Stewart�s Daily Show was hugely positive .
Stewart , more - or - less a left / libertarian , clearly sees Paul as one of the good guys , and his audience seems to agree .
With all these doors suddenly slamming open , it�s easy to forget that just a couple of years ago Ron Paul was an obscure , eccentric Texas congressman whose presidential run was met with a yawn in the mainstream media .
But when he stood up in the debates and made the case for limited government , sound money , and adherence to the Constitution , he struck a chord .
It was clear ( to libertarians at least ) that he was telling the truth and that the political hacks who were treating him like a deranged uncle were the ones with the vision / character problem .
Paul didn�t win many votes ( though out here in Idaho he did get 24 % in the Republican primary ) but he made an impression .
And when pretty much everything he warned us about came true -- while virtually everything the hacks of both parties said turned out to be disastrously wrong -- he even gained a bit of mainstream cred .
So when he introduced HR 1207 to audit the Fed , the response was at first respectful , and then enthusiastic .
Instead of instantly dismissing him , people began asking their representatives why the Fed is n�t already audited .
This law might just pass , with unpredictable but almost certainly amusing results .
But of course auditing the Fed is just the beginning .
Paul�s ultimate goal is to eliminate the whole institution , along with other golems like fiat currency and fractional reserve banking , and to reinstitute sound , honest money and limited government .
For those new to this subject , End the Fed is a clearly written primer on how unsound money and expanding government have gradually become the unquestioned conventional wisdom rather than the dangerous delusions that they are .
For more seasoned gold bugs the book provides some interesting history , along with plenty of useful debate ammunition .
Some of the high points :
� Paul makes it clear that the Fed is n�t the whole problem .
It �s just one part of a system that first went wrong with the introduction of fractional reserve banking centuries ago ( banks used to be warehouses , storing depositors � money for a fee ) , followed by the spread of European central banks ( really just scams to allow a few elite bankers and politicians to expand their own power at the expense of everyone else ) and then , finally , the introduction of fiat currency , which freed governments to expand spending and borrowing without regard to , well , anything .
The problem , in short , is the whole of modern banking and finance . �
The middle part of the book features transcripts of Congressman Paul grilling Fed chairmen Greenspan and Bernanke .
Some of these transcripts date back to the early Reagan era , which means that for going on three decades Paul has been fighting this fight , and slamming into the same brick wall .
The Chairmen feel no need to explain themselves to a lowly congressman , and respond with a mixture of lies and obfuscation that apparently fooled most of Washington .
The generally - respectful Paul even refers to Greenspan as �pathetic� after one especially dishonest piece of testimony .
Less charitable readers will , by the end of this section , want to take a congressional microphone and beat Greenspan and Bernanke senseless .
� Fractional reserve banking and fiat currency make war easier .
Back when a ruler needed actual gold to field an army , invading a neighbor required some serious forethought .
But once a dictator ( or the world�s policeman ) could just print a few billion pieces of paper and order some new tanks , �defending the national interest � got a whole lot easier .
Hence the bloodbath of the 20th century , and perhaps the mess of the coming decade .
� Paul knows all the major sound money / Austrian economics classics , and he cites them liberally .
The " recommended reading " list contains a year�s worth of serious research . �
Though he continues to fight , he�s not optimistic about averting the coming train wreck , which he refers to as the � BIG ONE � .
Anyhow , good book from a great man .
Stay healthy , Dr. Paul , your journey into the mainstream has just begun .

The possibility that Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon and the reality that it is building a capability for enriching uranium continue to raise tensions in the Middle East and could push other countries in the region to move in the same direction .
In my view the issue of nuclear weapons is not really of great importance for today 's negotiations .
After all , even if there were no such ambition now , Iran could change its mind next year and would then have come closer to a weapon by the progress made in the enrichment programme .
The conclusion is that it remains desirable to persuade Iran to abandon enrichment .
But we do not know if this would be possible under any circumstances .
Only direct talks will show this , and it is sad that such talks did not begin much earlier .
Several years were wasted by making suspension of enrichment a precondition for talks .
We should give President Obama the credit for the start of talks – without any guarantee , of course , that a deal will be reached .
In order to justify harsh punitive measures some may wish to show that Iran is lying and actually trying to develop a weapon .
However , efforts to shame Iran will not improve the chances of persuading it to abandon its advanced enrichment programme – the most important objective .
What can be done ?
To persuade Iran to abandon enrichment , both incentives and disincentives have been offered .
Economic sanctions and military measures could have dire consequences .
They might also rally a majority of Iranians to support a government they otherwise oppose .
Earlier European messages to Iran have pointed to possible rewards if the country were to abandon its enrichment programme .
But the quid pro quo has evidently not been enough .
This does not mean that " diplomacy is exhausted " .
Further incentives could be tried in the direct talks that are now on the agenda .
Looking at the negotiations on a nuclear - free North Korea we find two interesting offers that appear not to have had parallels in the contacts with Iran .
One is an assurance against attack and subversion ; the other is US and Japanese readiness for diplomatic relations .
After 30 years of no diplomatic relations with the US and more recent recurrent reminders by the US government that all military options are open to it to stop Iranian enrichment , perhaps offers of this kind could carry some weight in the negotiations with Iran .
A broadening of the agenda for discussions with Iran has sometimes been suggested as offering greater possibilities of balancing interests .
It is interesting to note that while Iran said it was unwilling to discuss its enrichment programme in the recent direct Geneva talks , it was ready to take up the broader subjects of non-proliferation and disarmament .
Discussions of these items could be used for delay , but they might also offer new openings .
It could perhaps be of interest even to broach the deep - frozen subject of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , and add to it the idea of making the area free of enrichment of uranium and production of plutonium .
Iran and Egypt were the first , many years ago , to take the initiative of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East .
All countries in the region – including Israel – have supported the concept , but for Israel , as the only nuclear - weapon country in the region , it has always been a remote scheme .
Today , with Iran and perhaps other states in the Middle East moving into more advanced nuclear activities , the idea might appear in a new light to all concerned .
For Iran , abandoning its enrichment programme within the framework of a zone could be a contribution to a broader global and regional disarmament and non-proliferation .
Israel may look at its nuclear weapons capability as a kind of life insurance against a possible future existential threat .
However , this perception would change drastically if one or more states in the region were to develop nuclear weapons or move close to weapons capability by programmes for the production of enriched uranium or plutonium .
To avoid having to face such a situation perhaps Israel would contemplate a zonal agreement under which all countries in the region – including Israel itself – renounced and eliminated nuclear weapons as well as nuclear fuel cycle installations .
This Israeli government may be far from this wavelength , but would it foresee continuing the line of action that began with the bombing of Iraq 's Osirak reactor in 1981 , and continued with the 2007 attack on Syrian installations claimed to be a North Korean designed research reactor , and the threatened bombing of Iranian nuclear installations ?
I do not underestimate the problems of a zonal agreement – for instance those of verification , or outside assurances about security and the supply of uranium fuel .
Yet the Obama administration , with the support of many governments , is seeking nuclear disarmament for all – including the original sinners – and both non-proliferation and disarmament are now on the agenda of the UN security council .
The Middle East looks like a region in need of a bold broad approach .
Here are the
on approaches to multicore programming in Haskell , presented at the ACM Reflections | Projections conference at the University of Illinois .
Abstract
Multicore computers are here : is your programming language ready for it ?
Haskell is : you can take an off - the - shelf copy of GHC and write high performance parallel programs right now .
If you want to program a parallel machine , a purely functional language such as Haskell is a good choice : purity ensures the language is by - default safe for parallel execution , ( whilst traditional imperative languages are by - default unsafe ) .
This foundation has enabled Haskell to become something of a melting pot for high level approaches to concurrent and parallel programming , all available with an industrial strength compiler and language toolchain , available now for mainstream multicore programming .
This talk will introduce the features Haskell provides for writing high level parallel and concurrent programs .
In particular we ’ll focus on lightweight semi-explicit parallelism , software transactional memory , and nested data parallelism , so you can go to work writing multicore programs in Haskell .
I ’d like to thank Michael Ilseman , Sameer Sundresh and Jeff Green for their hospitality during my visit .
A baby - faced , 15 - year - old burglar with more than a dozen busts already under his belt is being eyed as an Oliver Twist - like thief who ransacked up to 25 more apartments , mostly in the West Village , The Post has learned .
Juan Gonzalez was arrested Friday night in Queens — toting along his 13 - year - old brother , authorities said .
They were caught red-handed in Richmond Hill , a police source said .
The 150 - pound , 5 - foot - 7 Gonzalez was nailed for that robbery and 11 others in the same precinct , the source said .
Add that to two previous busts , and he ’s up to 14 arrests .
But authorities also are eyeing Gonzalez in 25 more burglaries .
“ He took whatever he could sell , ” a source said .
It is n’t just his recent burglary rap sheet that ’s stunning .
Detectives said his first arrest was in 2005 , when he was 11 .
His next followed in 2008 .
Relatives told The Post that the youngster spent six months in detention .
“ Instead of going to school , he learned how to be a burglar , ” said Juan ’s stepgrandfather , José Vasquez , 56 .
“ Juan said they did all these burglaries for someone else , and the other guy would sell all these laptops they took and sell them , ” Vasquez said .
They said he now brings his younger brother along for the ride .
Grandmother Gladys Gonzalez , 59 , blamed the bad company her grandsons have kept .
“ I chased one of these guys away with a knife once , ” the grandmother said of an alleged “ fence . ”
The last time his grandmother saw Juan was two weeks ago , when he asked to borrow $ 40 , relatives said .
“ Juan lives on the street now , ” Vasquez said .
“ He calls me on the phone , and says , ‘ I ’m OK .
I love you , ’ and hangs up . ”
“ I ca n’t take all the sad stuff anymore , ” Gladys Gonzalez said .
“ I hope they can turn their lives around . ”

John Hutton , the former defence secretary , has warned Gordon Brown that it would be " daft " to scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system , and predicted that his plans to scale it back will not save much money .
In an interview with The Independent , Mr Hutton appealed to the Prime Minister to resist pressure from within the Labour Party to kill off the £ 25 bn programme to renew Britain 's independent deterrent .
Mr Brown has announced his intention to reduce the number of submarines from four to three .
Some senior Labour figures are urging him to go further by scrapping plans to modernise what critics describe as a " Cold War relic " , with the savings divided between cutting the national debt and higher spending on equipment for frontline troops .

Mr Hutton said : " I do n't think the answer to the current problems we face to get our public debt down should be done exclusively or largely at the expense of our armed forces .
That would be a stupid thing to do .
You can not put all your eggs in one basket .
The idea that we can say we do n't need Trident because the only threat we face is from international terrorism is daft .
Can you honestly say to the public that for the next 50 years we are not going to face the threat of nuclear blackmail or weapons of mass destruction ?
You can't .
" My strong view is that we are a long way from a position of even thinking about giving up our independent nuclear deterrent . "
Mr Hutton is " not convinced " by Mr Brown 's proposal to cut the number of submarines , saying that four subs are needed to ensure that one boat always remains at sea .
Instead , he believes Britain should offer to reduce the number of warheads at global disarmament talks next spring .
He warned that reducing the number of boats by a quarter would not provide savings of anything like 25 per cent of £ 25bn , because the remaining three subs would need better propulsion systems and less frequent refuelling .
" It is not a cheap solution ; there is a price to be paid for upgrading , " he said .
Mr Hutton 's stance was influenced partly by his being MP for Barrow - in - Furness , where the new Trident submarines would be built .
He said Britain should not relegate itself from the " premier league " in defence engineering , as once skills were lost they would never come back .
He quit the Cabinet in June because he had decided to leave Parliament at the next election and believed Mr Brown needed ministers who would stay the course up to and beyond the election .
He wants to spend more time with his family and pursue his passion for writing military history books , with two about the First World War planned for next year .
He admits that this writing is unlikely to " pay the bills " and he will need some private - sector work too .
He has started speaking at private dinners for the law firm Eversheds , but turned down a post with EDF Energy , the British arm of the French state - controlled nuclear energy company .
Mr Hutton dismissed speculation that he could have helped to force Mr Brown out of office if he had joined James Purnell , who resigned in the same week , in calling for the Prime Minister to stand down .
" It did not cross my mind because it is not my view , " he said .
Although some fellow Blairites want a change of leader before the election , Mr Hutton insists that Labour can still win under Mr Brown provided it sets out a forward - looking vision and maintains its commitment to public service .
He admits that 12 years in government is tiring , but denies that Labour has run out of steam .
He said : " We have chosen our leader .
Our responsibility is to support him .
If we continue to bang on about that , we will do ourselves immense damage . "
He wished Mr Brown 's decision to send 500 more troops to Afghanistan had been announced earlier to give military chiefs more clarity , but strongly supports the Government 's stance on the conflict .
Admitting that British troops might need to remain in Afghanistan for 10 years , he said : " This is a defining struggle . "
If Britain were to pull out , the risk of terrorist acts in this country would increase , he said .
Mr Hutton concedes that people like David Cameron , but says they have not warmed to his party 's policies , and insists that the Tories are woefully unprepared for government .
" This new - found enthusiasm for the softer side of politics Mr Cameron espouses is not shared by his parliamentary colleagues .
They are rubbing their hands with glee at the idea of picking up where Margaret Thatcher left off in 1990 , " he said .
Many motives are cited for suicide bombings , from religious sanctification to revenge for Western foreign policy to hatred of Israel , but one thing ties them together : the boast that Muslims love death , whereas their enemies love life .
From killing the infidel enemy through suicide attacks , to allowing the subordinate female to participate in suicide attacks , a pattern emerges .
And just as honor killings are a perversion of the most basic of human ties , so love for martyrdom takes societies into a direct relationship with the darkest side of human nature .
In trying to explain this , it may be feasible to identify routes to a possible solution .
Origins
Iranian Hossein Fahmideh was the first suicide bomber .
He threw himself under an Iraqi tank with a grenade in his hand during the Iran - Iraq war .
In this poster , Ayatollah Khomeini looks down on the 13 - year - old suicide bomber .
Fahmideh was made a national hero , and following his death , thousands of young Iranians carrying " keys to paradise " walked and ran across minefields , killing themselves for God and the Islamic regime .
An Islamic Paradox
Since the 1980s , killing oneself deliberately has become the most popular method of attacking and killing one 's enemies in countries including Iraq and Afghanistan , in territories such as Chechnya or the West Bank and Gaza , and even in Western countries such as the United States and Great Britain .
It was a real - life Shi'i fanatic , a thirteen - year - old boy called Hossein Fahmideh , who set things moving in 1981 when he died with a grenade in his hand , throwing himself under a tank during the Iran - Iraq war .
He was followed by thousands of young Iranians carrying " keys to paradise , " who walked and ran across minefields , ripping their bodies apart for God and the Islamic regime . [ 1 ]
Two years later , the first suicide attack occurred against a Western target when a bomber drove a vehicle packed with explosives into the lobby of the American embassy in Beirut .
Apart from himself , he killed 63 people : 32 Lebanese , 17 Americans , and 14 visitors .
Iran denied all involvement in the attack , but its protégé , Hezbollah , soon claimed responsibility , and it was subsequently established that the killings had been approved and financed by senior Iranian officials .
The Iranian role in many subsequent suicide bombings has been crucial , given the existence of a clerical elite that inherited a deeply - embedded Shi'i cult of martyrdom , whose traditions of flagellation , public weeping , passion plays , martyrdom sermons , and hagiographies of martyrs were pushed into overdrive after the revolution of 1979 .
By 2008 , 1,121 suicide bombers had carried out attacks in Iraq , killing on a massive scale .
With the exception of Sri Lanka , where the Tamil Tigers used the tactic , suicide bombing has become an almost exclusively Islamic phenomenon .
Whether religiously observant or driven by other motives , the bombers have been Muslims , regardless of their country of origin .
Even Muslims raised and educated in non-Muslim countries ( like Britain's 7/7 bombers ) and exposed to cultures without overt jihadi propaganda have put on explosive belts and gone to their deaths in order to kill nonbelievers .
Apart from their Islamic roots , these terrorists display a wide range of characteristics .
Many have been young men , some of whom were mentally disabled , while others were very bright , some uneducated , others university graduates ; a growing number are women , mostly young , some old , some virgins , others pregnant or mothers .
Many have belonged to terrorist groups such as Hamas and have been indoctrinated in Islamist thought , anti-Semitism , or general hatred of the West .
Others have been volunteers seeking to expiate sins or retrieve the honor of their families .
Yet suicide bombing involves a paradox within Islam .
On the one hand , laws relating to jihad unambiguously state that fighters must not take the lives of noncombatants , such as women , children , the sick , or the elderly .
At the same time , anyone who dies while fighting non-Muslims is considered a martyr and guaranteed the highest rank in paradise .
How do Islamists get round this problem ?
Some may shut their eyes and get on with it , but others come face to face with the paradox by dividing the problem into bite - size pieces .
Clerics sanctify the bombers in their sermons , organizations including Hamas and Islamic Jihad identify and celebrate them as fighters in the jihad , and foreign donors provide aid that is siphoned off to the families of the martyrs . [ 2 ]
Whatever the private motivation of the suicide bomber , his or her action is rooted in much broader national , communal or , above all , religious demands , pressures , and desires .
These range from religious convictions and edicts to concepts of holy war and martyrdom to conflicts over issues of shame and honor to social constructs of sexuality .
Most importantly , the bombings have nothing to do with suicide .
Nor are they described as such by those who send the bombers out and those who immolate themselves .
To make it easier to understand what modern Islamist suicide bombing is about , we need to examine its historical background , its religious / nationalist role in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and its psychological and cultural roots in the Arab and Islamic interpretation of women , sexuality , shame , and honor .
World of the Martyr
In a speech at his headquarters in Ramallah on December 18 , 2001 , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat proclaimed he was willing to sacrifice seventy martyrs to bring about the death of a single Israeli . [ 3 ]
His audience replied " Millions of martyrs are already marching to Jerusalem . "
They meant suicide bombers , of course .
But nobody present used the term , since that is not how Arabic speakers refer to them .
Preeminently , the bombers are referred to as " martyrs " ( shuhada ' , sing .
shahid ) or " those who sacrifice themselves " ( fida 'iyun , sing . fida 'i ) .
These men and women — most in their teens and early twenties [ 4 ] — " die a martyr's death " or " blow themselves up " or carry out " martyrdom operations " ( ' amaliyat istishhadiya ) .
They do not commit suicide for suicide is a sin .
[ 5 ]
But killing oneself in order to harm non-Muslims is an act of deep piety .
This seeming contradiction has been examined by Daniel Pipes .
" The Qur'an , " he writes , " does tell Muslims , ' Do not kill yourselves ' and warns that those who disobey will be ' cast into the fire . '
The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said that a suicide cannot go to paradise .
Islamic laws oppose the practice . " [ 6 ]
He then points out that the prohibition against killing oneself has , in fact , been very effective , as is evidenced by the rarity of suicide in Muslim countries .
There is , however , another side to this story , in that the same action , when performed as a means of furthering jihad , elevates the individual to the rank of martyr .
There have been such martyrs in Islam almost from the founding of the religion .
Whereas Christian and Jewish martyrs without exception passively accepted death for their faith , most Muslim martyrs have given up their lives fighting as combatants in the holy war . [ 7 ]
Even Sufis , members of the mystical fraternities in Islam , have embarked on jihad as individuals and groups .
The warrior monk is a common figure in pre-modern Islam , and jihad scholar Michael Bonner has drawn attention to the important role played in war by religious leaders and scholars as preachers and as fighters . [ 8 ]
The figure of the martyr as a holy warrior ( mujahid ) who dies in battle and goes on to reap a heavenly reward above that of ordinary mortals is of central importance in the earliest period of Islam .
Its ideal type is the fighter who engages in an action called inghimas , throwing himself recklessly at the enemy , even if he should be one man against a thousand .
Doing this was seen as legitimate because the mujahid was seeking martyrdom and did not need permission from the leader of his army or unit . [ 9 ]
Its legitimacy , even today , is derived from the fact that Muhammad himself often sent out individual fighters as " military expeditions " in and of themselves . [ 10 ]
In the modern period , some scholars have argued that there is a close connection between inghimas and suicide bombing : " If , by immersing himself into enemy ranks , a fighter brings about his own death , such self - sacrifice is legally [ in terms of Shari'a law ] the same as bringing about his own death by his own hand .
In this respect there is no legal difference between the direct hand of the self - detonating suicide fighter and the proxy hand of the outnumbered fighter entering the fray alone . " [ 11 ] Gibril Haddad , a hard - line Wahhabi sheikh , writes that inghimas " must not be viewed as reckless self - destruction but as the highest valor and courage .
More than that , as Abu Ayyub [ a companion of Muhammad ] indicated with his tafsir [ interpretation ] of al - Baqara 195 [ Qur 'an 2:195 ] before entering the fray at Constantinople and fighting to the death , they viewed inghimas as life itself . " [ 12 ]
This again is a clear echo of the Islamist saying that Muslims " love death " whereas non-Muslims love life .
This conceit seems to have begun during the great Arab conquests of the seventh century .
In 633 , just one year after the death of Muhammad , the Muslim general Khalid ibn al - Walid had entered Iraq in the first phase of the conquest of the Iranian Sassanid empire .
Writing to Hormuz , the Persian governor of a frontier district , Dast Maysan , Walid proclaimed : " Submit to Islam and be safe .
Or agree to the payment of the jizya [ tax ] , and you and your people will be under our protection , else you will have only yourself to blame for the consequences , for I bring the men who desire death as ardently as you desire life . " [ 13 ]
It is a long journey from 633 to the modern era , but Walid 's boast still resonates in Islamist circles today .
On May 25 , 2001 , the mufti of Jerusalem and " Palestine , " Sheikh Ikrima Sabri , stated : " We tell [ our enemies ] :
As much as you love life — the Muslim loves death and martyrdom .
There is a great difference between him who loves the hereafter and him who loves this world .
The Muslim loves death and [ strives for ] martyrdom . " [ 14 ]
Sabri is not alone .
Hassan Nasrallah , secretary general of Hezbollah , has spoken in similar terms .
In 2004 , he said : " We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are the most vulnerable .
The Jews love life , so that is what we shall take away from them .
We are going to win because they love life , and we love death . " [ 15 ]
Others have spoken in much the same vein . [ 16 ]
It is clear that the distinction is always religiously based and that Jewish love of life is transformed from a healthy and spiritual thing to an attitude to be disparaged .
This fixation with death as a state superior to life combines with martyrdom ideation to create the suicide bomber as someone who passes beyond traditional themes of death at the hands of the enemy to bring death to himself and the enemy in a single moment .
In this unconventional form of fighting , the bomber no longer respects legal rulings that commit the mujahid to killing only enemy troops but makes death itself the arbiter of who should die or not .
The innocent are not innocent ; Muslim radicals are on record stating that non-Muslims are , by definition , not innocent . [ 17 ]
The self - immolation of the martyr makes death universal .
Yet the modern martyr is still deeply rooted in traditional typology .
Muhammad 's Sayings and Actions
The Qur'an contains numerous exhortations to violent action [ 18 ] and promises a divine reward for those who die fighting in God 's path , but it does not make martyrdom into the religious goal it soon became .
It is in the literature of Muhammad 's sayings and doings that warfare and martyrdom are emphasized together .
Both the Hadith — the vast corpus of " eyewitness " statements about what Muhammad did or said , second in holiness only to the Qur'an — and the earliest writings featuring the biography of Muhammad and his companions display a significant concern with fighting .
The Hadith compilations invariably have a section entitled " The Book of Jihad , " in which snippets from actual combat with non-Muslims jostle with instructions on how to wage war .
The books of biography are originally called Kitab al - Maghazi , [ 19 ] the Book of Raids , meaning the raids and battles in which Muhammad was personally involved or which he ordered carried out .
In other words , we are in a realm far less abstract than that of the Qur'an , on a landscape in which real men fought in real encounters with real enemies .
This is the world of the martyr , the ever - present battlefield in Muhammad 's lifetime and in the years that followed when Arab armies clashed with their Byzantine , Persian , and other foes across North Africa , the Middle East , and far beyond .
The warrior - martyr is born on these battlefields and in the martial deeds of Muhammad , not in the text of the Qur'an .
The Qur'an prescribes violence against nonbelievers and sets jihad in motion , providing a context for the holy warrior ; but that warrior only becomes flesh when riding out to battle beside Muhammad , and only takes on the mantle of martyrdom in death at the hands of the infidel and in the words of the prophet that confer that status on him and those that come in his train .
We read in the Sahih Muslim , one of the two most sacred texts after the Qur'an , of fighters picking up their swords and wading into battle :
The tradition has been narrated on the authority of ' Abdullah b. Qais .
He heard it from his father who , while facing the enemy , reported that the Messenger of Allah said : Surely , the gates of Paradise are under the shadows of the swords .
A man in a shabby condition got up and said ; Abu Musa , did you hear the Messenger of Allah say this ?
He said : Yes .
( The narrator said ) :
He returned to his friends and said his farewells .
Then he broke the sheath of his sword , threw it away , advanced with his sword towards the enemy and fought with it until he was slain . [ 20 ]
This behavior is very different from that of the Norse berserkers , [ 21 ] who entered battle in a rage , foaming at the mouth and laying waste everyone in their path .
The mujahid in this and other hadith reaches a decision based on confirmation of Muhammad 's promise of paradise .
This echoes the cool , almost detached manner with which the modern suicide bomber goes to work .
He or she may make a video in advance , in which a reasoned statement of justification and intent is provided for posterity .
The sword has become a suicide belt , but the fighter is still a martyr .
A famous hadith proclaims that " Paradise lies beneath the shades of swords " ( al - Bukhari 4:73 ) .
Today , it lies beneath the shades of suicide belts .
Religion in the Jihad against Israel
Suicide bombers from Hamas or Islamic Jihad or the Al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades cannot be understood as creatures of Palestinian nationalism , as the spawn of the Palestine Liberation Organization or Black September .
The religious war against Israel best explains the deep impulses that propel so many young Muslims to choose death for this cause .
No other conflict engages international Islamic opinion like this one .
" Palestine " has become a rallying cry for Muslims everywhere .
Benny Morris , a historian of the Arab - Israeli conflict , correctly argues that it was religion rather than nationalism that inspired the 1948 invasion of Israel .
He considers it a mistake to ignore the religious rhetoric that accompanied the 1948 assault by Arab armies .
" The 1948 War , from the Arabs ' perspective , " he writes , " was a war of religion as much as , if not more than , a nationalist war over territory . " [ 22 ]
The Muslim Brotherhood , the mufti of Egypt , [ 23 ]
Egypt 's King Farouk , King ' Abdullah of Transjordan , and many others spoke of a holy war , a jihad against the Jews .
It was not a purely nationalist struggle then , nor is it today .
The " [ violence ] did not emerge only from ' modern ' nationalist passions ; it also drew on powerful religious wellsprings .
Nothing , it seemed , could mobilize the Palestinian Arab masses for action more readily than Muslim religious rhetoric and symbols . " [ 24 ]
Little has changed since the 1940s .
With the rise of radical Islam and the expansion of violent recourse , Arab irredentism has continued to have a religious focus , sometimes on " Palestine " and sometimes on the umma , the abstract nation of all Muslims .
And it is as Muslims more than as Arabs ( or Iranians or Afghans ) that today 's leading enemies of Israel view the conflict .
Palestinian violence against Israelis is one of the earliest expressions of Islamic rage against modernity .
Its most recent manifestation , Hamas , is , according to its 1988 Covenant , " an Islamic resistance movement . " [ 25 ]
Hamas is , in fact , the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , still one of the leading forces of Islamic radicalism on the planet .
Article one of the covenant starts as follows : " The Movement 's program is Islam .
From it , it draws its ideas , ways of thinking and understanding of the universe , life and man .
It resorts to it for judgment in all its conduct , and it is inspired by it for guidance of its steps . " [ 26 ]
Female Suicide Bombers
In hard - line versions of the Islamic faith , unrelated men and women never meet , never so much as exchange glances .
Islamic society is patriarchal and , like other patriarchal societies , it diminishes the energies and abilities of its women .
Palestinian society links the repression of women to a male need for honor .
The " core of gender inequality in [ Palestinian ] society resides in patriarchal control and repression of female sexuality . …
The control of female sexuality maintains male power , privileges and prerogatives .
…
Control of women is the most important , if not the only , component of the honor code left to men . " [ 27 ]
Sexuality and the honor code have played a major part in the recruitment of suicide bombers ; but it is the emergence of the female bomber that is most intriguing , given that such women represent a challenge to conventional Islamic notions of female inferiority and Arab cultural demands for women to be restricted to their homes or dressed by Islamic standards .
A tiny number of women took part in jihad in the early years of Islam , but this practice seems to have been abandoned by the second generation or so .
Nevertheless , some hadith do permit it , and Shari 'a law rules that women may engage in jihad when , for example , the Muslim state comes under attack .
In recent years , women have volunteered for membership in a range of terrorist outfits from the " black widow " bombers of Chechny a [ 28 ] to Kurdish rebels [ 29 ] to the " martyrs " of Hamas and Islamic Jihad . [ 30 ]
Every suicide attack by women from 1985 to 2000 was motivated by secular goals .
Since 2000 , however , as Hamas has grown in importance , religiously - motivated female terrorists have carried out more than two - thirds of the suicide attacks by women . [ 31 ]
The religious leader of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmad Yasin , had originally restricted or denied women the right to take part in jihad operations :
In our Palestinian society , there is a flow of women towards jihad and martyrdom , exactly like the young men .
But the woman has uniqueness .
Islam sets some restrictions for her , and if she goes out to wage Jihad and fight , she must be accompanied by a male chaperon .
We have no need for suicide operations by women now because preserving the nation 's survival is more important . [ 32 ]
By 2004 , however , Yasin had reversed his theological understanding of the matter , and stated : " Exactly when there is an invasion to the holy land , a Muslim woman is permitted to wage jihad and struggle against the enemy ... the Prophet would draw lots among the women who wanted to go out with him to make jihad .
The Prophet always emphasized the woman 's right to wage jihad . " [ 33 ]
Yasin was , in part , motivated by existing notions of honor and shame , according to which a woman who is deemed to have done something shameful ( in the sexual sense ) may be killed by members of her family in order to expunge that shame . [ 34 ]
Even though issues of shame and honor may have their roots in communal psychology rather than faith , it is a constant justification of " honor " killings and related crimes that the Qur'an and Shari 'a legislation already demand punishments such as flogging or stoning for sexual crimes .
At some point it seems to have dawned on Yasin that a dishonored woman might be cleansed of her " wrongdoing " and at the same time be employed as a living bomb capable of passing unsearched through male - controlled checkpoints in order to detonate herself in the midst of as many Jews as possible .
According to Mira Tzoreff , a Middle East history specialist at Tel Aviv University :
An intensification of the shahidat [ female martyrs ] phenomenon is represented by the [ 2004 ] suicide of Rim Riashi at the Erez check post , not only as the married mother of two small children , but also because of the sanction she received by Sheikh Ahmad Yassin .
Indeed , it was not long before it became clear that Rim Riashi had requested Yassin 's sanction only after her relationship with a lover had … become a known matter .
Thus , the act of istishhad [ dying as a martyr ] was the only way to remove the stain of dishonor from both herself and her family . [ 35 ]
How was the " stain of dishonor " manipulated to wear a religious stamp through the expiation of martyrdom ?
Shame , Honor , and Martyrdom
Religious idealism cannot fully explain this desperation , this intense craving for a martyr 's death among so many young Palestinians .
But without a religious framework , it is highly unlikely that any of these women would seek to kill others through their own deaths .
There might be " honor " killings and beatings , and some women would run away from their families , but there would be no suicide bombings .
There seems to be an affinity here with two related drives in the Arab psyche that not only puts female suicide bombers into perspective but demonstrates important links between them and their male equivalents .
One of these drives is the acute awareness of shame mentioned above , an emotion sharply contrasted with honor .
Muslim societies are shame societies .
This is noticeable in Arab countries , Pakistan , Bangladesh and several other places where honor resides in the family above all , and , in particular , in the women of the family or , more accurately , their sexual probity .
This is not to say that men do not suffer dishonor , but for them this is projected outwards , towards rivals or enemies and , of course , towards the women and sometimes towards the men they believe have compromised their honor . [ 36 ]
The honor / shame dichotomy is responsible for the widespread practice of " honor " killings , something found in many parts of the Islamic world from Morocco to Pakistan , and always committed against women .
Though these killings form no part of Islamic law and are not exclusive to the Muslim world , the vast majority do take place in Muslim countries where killers are seldom prosecuted . [ 37 ]
That the Islamic clergy rarely condemn these practices as anti-Islamic provides them with a religious cover .
Should a girl become pregnant outside marriage , or a wife commit adultery , or a daughter refuse an arranged marriage or even be seen outdoors with an unrelated boy , it becomes the inescapable duty of her father , husband , brothers , or cousins to kill her in order to restore the family 's honor in the eyes of the local community .
According to UNICEF , in 1999 more than two - thirds of all murders in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were " honor " killings . [ 38 ]
By transcending ordinary emotional ties and by putting on a cloak of religiosity , the female suicide bomber sets out to expunge the shame she feels on behalf of family , community , or nation , both by accepting death as a martyr and by inflicting death on others as a holy warrior .
The bomber 's victims may be non-Muslims who , by definition , have been " brought low " by Islam yet who persist in their arrogance by asserting equal status with Muslims or who surpass Muslims in one way or another .
This humiliates the Muslim community , making it imperative that the non-Muslims be put back in their place or extinguished .
In the past , this was done in conventional ways , through imprisonment , flogging , or decapitation .
Similar punishments were used on deviant Muslims , apostates , and those who transgressed Shari 'a law .
But the use of suicide killing as a means of control is less easy to explain .
The idealization of sexual honor and sexual shame carries heavy symbolic weight outside the sphere of family relations .
Jehoeda Sofer , author of Sexuality and Eroticism among Males in Moslem Societies , quotes a Palestinian Arab as follows : " If the Arabs would have had war with the Israelis using [ their ] ***s , we would have defeated them easily .
The Israelis are a bunch of feminine males who want to be and should be *** by the Arabs . " [ 39 ]
Several years ago , Malise Ruthven , a British authority on Islam , pointed out that much Muslim outrage about The Satanic Verses was expressed in sexual language .
Zaki Badawi , the late principal of the Muslim College and a moderate British Muslim , for example , wrote : " What [ Rushdie ] has written is far worse to Muslims than if he had raped one 's own daughter . …
It 's like a knife being dug into you — or being raped yourself . " [ 40 ]
Ruthven suggests that Rushdie 's crime was to enter the sacral space occupied by the Prophet : " That entry is perceived as a violation , as a kind of rape . " [ 41 ]
When first the Christians and later the Jews ventured to turn their status as protected but inferior peoples upside - down , Muslim societies felt shame at their own weakness , at the possibility that the old world had disintegrated , never to return .
It is a shame akin to what is felt when a woman " gets above herself " and rejects the " protection " of father , husband , or brother .
Beyond that , it is a shame akin to being raped , in this case by Jews and Christians , deemed " women " in relation to " masculine " Islam .
In all cases , the only restitution is death .
The suicide bomber enters this sphere of shame like a rapist and in doing so invades sacral territory .
The Jews , as protected people , constitute a sphere that should be inviolate to Muslims ; instead , the fida 'i goes directly into Jewish space and there commits an ultimate act of rape , thereby restoring the masculinity of Muslim people .
Even the female martyr , by throwing off her inferiority as a weak - bodied woman and exercising the courage of a man , rapes the Jews she slaughters .
Conclusion
Since the Qur'an commends violence and the Hadith literature is steeped in the blood of martyrs , killing and dying violently are not breaches of the moral code or infringements of divine law .
They are , on the contrary , regarded as some of the highest achievements of Islamic spirituality .
Asked who was the best of people , Muhammad replied , the " believer who fights in the path of God with his self and his property . " [ 42 ]
The martyr enjoys double the pleasure of paradise and dwells there in an abode superior to its other denizens . [ 43 ]
What can be done about this ?
For most Western countries , the Israeli option , to build a defensive barrier between us and the homes of the bombers , will not work .
We can profile ; we can infiltrate ; we can discover and share intelligence ; we can carry out targeted assassinations of terrorist leaders , trainers , and motivators ; we can pinpoint and destroy terrorist training camps .
Like the Israeli fence , constant vigilance will reduce the numbers of bombers , sometimes dramatically .
But engaging the problem at the grassroots level is clearly more difficult because the phenomenon is so deeply entrenched in the cultures that produce the bombers , in the religious values , the sexual practices , and the shame and honor systems they inculcate .
If we are to modify those cultures in a positive way , perhaps we have to introduce sanctions that punish countries dependent on Western aid every time a terrorist or suicide bomber from that country is identified .
We have to make suicide bombing an affront to religion and a matter of great dishonor .
Set beside a system of rewards for identifiable counterterrorism initiatives , above all , education programs designed to reject religious and social propaganda , this may set in motion new ways of altering the suicide mindset .
But until such measures begin to bite and societies prone to this malaise start to shift toward moderation across the board , it is the intelligence and security services who will have to shoulder the burden of defense .
There are no quick fixes , but there are long - term goals that we need to plan for now .

For the past few days , Iranians have been taking advantage of US - hosted communication services like Twitter and Facebook to communicate with each other about their contested election , uncover and compare facts , and convey their experiences to the rest of the world .
They 've done that despite apparent attempts to block these sites by the Iranian authorities .
For those watching and listening , it 's been a bracing demonstration of the power of the Internet — and the latest Web 2.0 services — to enhance free speech , wherever you live .
But EFF has also been watching with concern the blocking of Web 2.0 sites in countries like Iran .
This new threat does n't come from foreign governments : it appears to be coming from the ambiguity of the United States own exports ' regulations , and how they should be applied to new web sites and services .
The problem , as is so often the case in the clash between new technology and the law , lies in the mismatch between the language of the old regulations and the new world of the Internet .
The United States ' export law bans much US trade with counties like Cuba , Iran , the Sudan and Syria : but those strict sanctions have long had explicit free speech exceptions carved out for the transmission of " information " and " information materials " , as well as transactions involved in the " publishing and marketing of manuscripts , books , journals and newspapers ... in paper or electronic format . "
The aim of such language is obvious : free speech across borders should n't be chilled by our export policies .
Similarly the U.S. should actively support access by those suffering under repressive regimes to the modern tools of free speech like Facebook , Twitter and Linked In .
Yet it seems that the regulations are , at best , unclear .
As a result we 've seen evidence that corporate lawyers advising Web 2.0 companies may be acting defensively to protect their Internet clients from prosecution under the export laws .
Earlier this year , Linked
In appeared to deliberately block its Sudanese and Syrian users from its website , presumably out of fear that their site be classed outside of the law 's free speech exceptions .
And ComputerWorld last week quoted two export lawyers who thought that websites like Twitter and Facebook would be affected by sanction regulations because they provide " services " rather than simply information materials .
" If you ask any lawyer who regularly practices in this area , they would say do n't offer the service [ to sanctioned countries ] , " one lawyer is reported to have said .
Iran is , of course , one of those countries currently under stiff sanctions from the U.S .
Hopefully , the amazing role of Web 2.0 companies in protests in Iran and other countries will demonstrate the important role that these tools play in supporting freedom of expression , and has made obvious that companies like Facebook should never be blocked by US export regulations from being used for political organizing and speech in these countries .
EFF is looking for more evidence about the chilling effect of the export restrictions on digital tools of free expression .
In addition , it seems time for the Obama administration pro-actively clarify that the Web 2.0 free speech tools do not require affirmative licensing under the export regulations .
Iranian net users have fought so hard to access and use the Web to push for freedom and democracy .
It would be a tragedy if American companies blocked them out of a fear of the U.S. government 's rules .

“ Shattered Horizon sees players fight in the aftermath of a catastrophic Moon mining accident that throws billions of tons of rocky debris into near - Earth space . ”
The very aptly titled Shattered Horizon is Futuremark ’s first proper foray into the gaming space .
While the company has dabbled in gaming software before – including having once effectively been a part of Remedy Entertainment , and later with the release of a 2007 Intel - only multicore demonstration , the company is ultimately known to us for their ubiquitous benchmarking software , 3DMark and PCMark ( we ’ve also seen members of the company as Mature Furk , among other crews , in the demo scene – in this sense the game is a return to form ) .
This ‘ specially spatial shooter , then , is all PhysX ’d up , optimized for multi-core machines and comes , in a slight conflict of interests , packaged with the NVIDIA seal .
Some more elaboration about the game ’s themes and features coupled with the most recent promotional trailer for the game - all this after the jump !
Its free - flying gameplay is split into three modes : Battle , in which two teams capture control points , Assault , a “ push ” - style scenario in which captured points change ownership permanently , and finally Skirmish , which is essentially team deathmatch .
The choice to only include 32 simultaneous players per fight during the closed beta is a surprisingly low number for a game with such tremendous implications of room and distance , so I only have to assume the company ’s direction for level design both forces and focuses the action into closer quarters by making the combat more reliant on cover and positioning .
The setting indeed has many intriguing implications :
The jetpacks used by the astronauts , for instance , glare brightly in the dark , forcing players to come to terms with their kinetic energy if they wish to remain unseen .
The constraints of the space suits restrict combatants to using one multi-functional weapon only , and shooting while moving too can be a difficult exercise due to the lack of balancing support .
Various types of tactical grenades – ICE , EMP and MPR – also play a factor in the combat .
With a belt of rock preventing travel and shipments between the Earth and the Moon , the most intriguing aspect of the game to me is the setting ’s potential for displaying tangible desperation that is achieved without having to include the commonly utilized monsters and aliens , instead only taking away our basic needs to create a shared sense of fear for our ( well - ) being .
After all , the current notion of outer space has so far implied to mankind a profound sense of abandonment - of human interaction , personal space and material resource - thus rendering it a major theme for sci-fi .
Shattered Horizon ’s potential twist , then , is how deep space horror often utilizes the claustrophobia of narrow , Nostromous and submarine - like corridors of various space vessels .
The notion of being free of this usual type of constraint - but nevertheless effectively capsized between Mother Earth and the Moon - sounds very refreshing to me ; the allure of the concept is of course furthered by the definite collision course created by the conflict for prolonged sustenance .
Hopefully Futuremark Games , despite the project ’s apparent focus on the more combative aspects of the deep space existence , will be able to capitalize on the excellent concept and bring over to us a great sense of desperation , subsequently establishing a conflict that feels real .
The official website has just been given a good old - fashioned HTML overhaul to override a pre-existing promotional Flash .
Do give it a whirl !

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - U.S. authorities seized nine failed banks on Friday , the most in a single day since the financial crisis began and the latest stark sign that substantial parts of the nation ’s banking industry are being crippled by bad loans .

The move brought the total number of failed banks in 2009 to 115 -- their highest annual level since 1992 -- with analysts expecting more to come .
Among the lenders seized Friday was Los Angeles - based California National Bank , in what was the fourth - largest U.S. bank failure this year .
The largest institution to fail in the current financial crisis was Washington Mutual , which boasted $ 307 billion in assets when it was shuttered in September 2008 .
U.S. Bancorp on Friday acquired the nine banks that had been held by FBOP Corp , picking up $ 18.4 billion in assets and $ 15.4 billion of deposits .
Visibly worried employees lined up to file into Cal National ’s head offices in the heart of a deserted downtown Los Angeles on a chilly Friday evening , where they had their employers ’ fate explained to them , regulators said .
“ We ’re getting ready to turn everything over to U.S. Bank , ” said Roberta Valdez , a spokeswoman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , which helped supervise the transfer of FBOP ’s assets .
“ They will continue to operate as normal in the interim , ” she added , referring to lenders acquired from FBOP .
U.S. Bancorp -- which has been buying up distressed assets this year -- is picking up the lenders once owned by FBOP , a private Illinois group with over $ 18 billion in assets that owned banks in Texas , Illinois , Arizona and California .
Cal National is FBOP ’s largest bank by branches .
Others that will now go under the U.S. Bancorp umbrella included BankUSA , Citizens National Bank , Madisonville State Bank , North Houston Bank , Pacific National Bank , Park National Bank , San Diego National Bank , and the Community Bank of Lemont .
“ This transaction is consistent with the growth strategy that we have outlined many times in the past , which includes enhancing our existing franchise through low - risk , in - market acquisitions , ” said Rick Hartnack , vice chairman of consumer banking for U.S. Bancorp .

“ This transaction adds scale to our current California , Illinois and Arizona footprints . ”
NEXT BIG HEADACHE
In the “ near future , ” all nine lenders ’ branches will be re-branded U.S. Bank , which is the California - focused unit of U.S. Bancorp ’s that operates a network of more than 770 branches across Illinois , Arizona and California .
U.S. Bancorp did not specify what would happen to the new employees it inherits .
Cal National operates 68 branches across Southern California with more than $ 7 billion in assets .
As of June 30 , the lender maintained five times as much foreclosed property on its books and twice as many non-current loans as it had a year earlier , according to the Los Angeles Times , which first reported news of its evening takeover on Friday .
Cal National lost about $ 500 million on heavy investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred shares , the newspaper added , referring to securities rendered nearly worthless by the government takeover of the mortgage firms last year .
According to FDIC data , Cal National was the fourth biggest bank failure this year in terms of assets , just edging out Corus Bank , seized Sept 11 with a flat $ 7 billion of assets .
A bank official who answered the main number at Cal National ’s headquarters said they could not talk at the time .
Banks are still cleaning up their balance sheets from the recent credit boom that fueled banks ’ appetite to extend loans , many with poor underwriting and triggers that caused borrowers ’ payments to spike to unaffordable levels .
More lenders are expected to go under this year as the industry tries to get a handle on commercial real estate loans that will continue to worsen , as more strip malls go vacant and residential developments stall .
Banks held about $ 1.7 trillion in commercial real estate loans at the end of September , according to Federal Reserve data , or about 15 percent of their total assets .
But to the extent these loans weaken , small banks are likely to be hit the hardest because larger banks were better diversified .
Banks that analysts say could risk big losses include Salt Lake City ’s Zions Bancorp , Columbus , Georgia ’s Synovus Financial Corp and Dallas - based Comerica Inc .
Before FBOP , U.S. Bancorp bought Downey Savings of Newport Beach and PFF Bank & Trust of Pomona when those thrifts failed last November , the newspaper said .
Just this month , U.S. Bancorp bought 20 Nevada branches from BB&T Corp , which had acquired them as part of its deal to buy Colonial BancGroup Inc , it added .

One telephone conversation , one visit and a total change of the geo-energy landscape only several hours before the visit of the Bulgarian minister of the economy , energy and tourism Traycho Traykov in Moscow .
Late last night the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev held a telephone conversation with his Turkish counterpart Adbullah Gul who informed him that Turkey had already given all permissions necessary for geological research in the Turkish waters in the Black Sea for the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline .
Today , the Russian head of state went to Belgrade from where he will go home with an agreement for the Serbian section of the pipeline .
According to the agreed in our Western neighbour , two joint companies will be created in which Gazprom and Serbiagaz will share 51 % and 49 % respectively .
By 30 days will be established the joint project company South Stream Serbia AG .
With these two not very abrupt movements , if we look at the map we will find out that Bulgaria has been bypassed .
Whether this is tragedy or a good thing we will have to find out in the future .
But the fact is that South Stream has the support of large EU member states because its main goal is to avoid some hard to negotiate with transit countries , like Ukraine .
But this does not solve the slightly larger problem with the diversification of the gas suppliers for Europe .
And if Europe has a great interest in having good relationship with Russia , not only because some of its member states are very dependent on Russian natural gas , Bulgaria might feel totally isolated ahead of the winter when the financial problems of Ukraine might lead to a repeat of the January gas crisis this year .
With these developments in the energy geopolitics in recent days , on the 22nd of October the Bulgarian minister of economy , energy and tourism Traycho Traykov will travel to Moscow to discuss with the deputy prime minister Sergey Sobyanin " the progress on clarification of the positions of the mutual energy projects after the meeting between minister Traykov and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shmatko on the 18th of September 2009 in Sofia " , according to the press release of the Ministry of the economy , energy and tourism ( MEET ) .
But to get a better picture of the moods in Russia before this visit I will quote here the website EurActiv which makes an analysis of the Russian press on the topic .
" Russia has obtained all the permits necessary to build its ' South Stream ' gas pipeline through Turkish territorial waters , discarding Bulgaria as one of the project 's transit countries .
This happened on Monday in Milan in an event , which was hosted by Italian Economy Minister Claudio Scajola in Milan on Friday ( 19 October ) , eliminated Bulgaria as a transit country for the Gazprom - favoured pipeline , the daily writes .
Bulgaria was also evicted from the Burgas - Alexandroupolis oil pipeline project " , the EurActiv writes , quoting the Russian newspaper " Kommersant " .
This part of its analysis the Brussels based website has titled " Milan intrigue " because , initially , Russia went to Milan to discuss its possible involvement in the Samsun - Ceihan oil pipeline project , which is designed to bring crude from a Turkish Black Sea terminal in Samsun to the Turkish Mediterranean oil terminal in Ceihan , bypassing the Bosporus .
Obviously Russia , who initially was not very interested in the project , later had changed its mind , abandoning earlier plans to build the Burgas - Alexandroupolis oil pipeline , which would bring crude from the Bulgarian port city of Burgas to the Greek port of Alexandroupolis in the Aegean .
With this move , the Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin gave a clear response to the new Bulgarian premier Boyko Borisov who recently told him that his government " needed time " to decide on major energy projects with Russian participation .
The conclusion that could be derived from these developments is quite unpleasant for Bulgaria because it reveals the lack of continuation in Bulgaria 's foreign policy , its total division from the economy as well as the contradictory political messages .
And as I mentioned earlier above , the EU definitely needs Russia and that is why it will do everything possible to protect its own interests by , in the same time , allowing Russia to guarantee its deliveries for the thirst for natural gas Europe .
In this situation Bulgaria was the most affected country during the January gas crisis .
And if for the past 4 years Bulgaria had reasonable foreign policy but which suffered from a lack of transparency and desire for public discussions of important energy projects , now the situation is even more desperate .
With a foreign minister that will wait until the very last moment for her not quite big chances to become the next Bulgarian European commissioner and the uncertainty of the new minister of energy who beside the energy and economy is also responsible for tourism , thus making the profile of his position a little non-serious , the situation is getting even worse .
There is no other way to call the reality , except an acute geopolitical short - sightedness , the impact of which will be estimated by history and by the economy in the future .
But this short - sightedness deprives us of the quite comfortable thesis that this is our fate - always being the poorest EU member state which less and less even in the EU someone might need .
A large part of the history of the Russian - Bulgarian energy relationship you could read on the links to the right .
The Congressional Budget Office puts out a long term analysis examining the economic health of the United States each year .
In major recessions like the one we are in right now , these reports provide a projection into the future but the most important indicators like taxes are in a state of flux .
It is also the case that we have never spent so much money with bailouts and fiscal stimulus in a time of peace .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are betting it all that their actions will stabilize the economy .
Wall Street has stabilized but the employment situation is still up for debate .
Yet looking at the report it is clear that the bill is coming due .
Either we increase taxes or cut spending .
I ’m not pushing one or the other but this is a basic math problem here .
Let us take a look at the projections as put out by the CBO :
Notice that quick spike in “ Other Federal Noninterst Spending ” which shows the current bailout programs and fiscal stimulus .
Largest spike in government spending on the chart so this should tell you the magnitude of the current recession .
It is also the case that revenues are falling rapidly and that trend has not reversed .
Spending is up and tax collections are down .
You can tell that after 2012 , the entitlement programs are going to grow at an exponential rate .
We really are n’t dealing with these issues currently .
At the moment all measures are focused on that blip on the chart in attempting to stabilize the economy .
I agree that the economy needs stabilization .
But bailing out the banking industry with $ 12 trillion in explicit back stops was not the way .
The FDIC has a reserve fund that is at zero and it backs up over $ 9 trillion in deposits .
Is it smart to give this industry the right to $ 12 trillion in taxpayer money when clearly the CBO shows other important expenditures ?
Probably covering the savings of depositors is fine but this is a minor issues .
Did we need to convert Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into banks with easy access to the Federal Reserve ?
The bailouts focused on toxic debt like residential mortgages and the coming $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate problems .
From the chart above , it is also clear that the CBO expects income to shoot back up rather quickly and once again regain a steady course for the next 5 decades .
Clearly these are rough estimates .
Let us look at the latest balance sheet report from the U.S. Treasury :
In other words , we are spending a gigantic sum more than we are bringing in .
Now this is n’t something new for us .
We have been doing this for years .
Yet the magnitude of the current spending is enormous .
If we really want to get a sense of the actual revenues and spending let us look at the U.S. Treasury monthly report :
This is where the big recovery talk is lost on many .
Last year in 2008 , September was a horrible month for us .
The entire year was troubling but September was a tipping point .
With that said , the government managed to pull in $ 272 billion from U.S. taxpayers .
Now with the supposed recovery and all the bailouts , how did the government do in September of 2009 ?
The government pulled in $ 218 billion or a year over year decrease of approximately 20 percent .
This is enormous .
Yet when we are hearing about all these record banking profits clearly the money is n’t going back to the government even though taxpayers bailed out these institutions .
This is a major recession and the balance sheet of the government reflects this .
Look at the year to date deficit above .
We are running a $ 1.4 trillion deficit .
Just incredible in terms of how much we are spending yet on the tax side , the government is still not collecting enough revenues to cover current expenditures .
That is why some things will shift in the next few months .
Either taxes will go up or spending will need to be cut .
This pace is unsustainable .
Raising taxes on everyone is not a smart move .
Just look at California .
It raised sales taxes , a largely regressive tax on everyone and overall collections are actually down .
Being smart about tax increases would probably make more sense .
Since Wall Street investment banks and every bank is pretty much dependent on the U.S. taxpayer , why not tax their profits by 80 to 90 percent ?
After all , they need to pay back the trillions in bailouts so if they are making money why not have it come back to the people ?
Plus , banking should never be a big profit center for an economy .
It should serve primarily to allocate capital to the best real economy industries .
Banks should not make the bulk of their money gambling on Wall Street .
If you want to see an infuriating stat , Goldman Sachs which came inches away from imploding with horrible bets is now sitting on cash while numerous states sit at the edge of bankruptcy :
“ ( CNN ) More than a million Americans have filed for bankruptcy this year , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute .
A September survey of state finances by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank found that state governments faced a collective $ 168 billion budget shortfall for fiscal 2010 .
Goldman , by contrast , is sitting on $ 167 billion in cash , in the name of making sure it can withstand another market meltdown if that day comes . ”
Goldman ’s bonus pool is on pace to reach $ 21 billion for 2009 .
At the same time , 27 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed .
Until we reform Wall Street we are going to see the standard of living for the average American dwindle away .
It is time to look at these balance sheets and see where the money is going .
If you follow it , you will realize that the best interest of the nation is not being pursued .

It ’s been an eventful week in many arenas , and so it is now time for the weekly “ Chaos Theory ” edition of the RLF blog … where I quickly attempt to get caught up on all the other strange political news items , leftover for the week .
Let ’s get started …
THE HEALTH CARE CARNIVAL OF DESPAIR :
Most people had n’t heard of Representative Alan Grayson ( R - FL ) before … but they have now .
In a wonderful , congressional , “ oh , no you did n’t ” moment … Grayson laid out in simple terms the terrible truth about the Republicans on Health Care Reform : tens of thousands of Americans are dying because they do n’t have insurance … and the Republicans have offered NOTHING but opposition to changing this …therefore , they must just want people to just “ not get sick ” and if they do … they should “ die quickly : “
POLITICIANS BEHAVING BADLY :
Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) has some new problems … stemming from his old problems .
It ’s been very odd to watch a Senator , busted for soliciting prostitutes , question the morality of Democrats and claim that he and other southern Republicans are the ones representing “ true values .
“ Perhaps he mistakenly believed that the scandal was behind him …well , “ not so ” says the Louisiana Office of Disciplinary Counsel .
Apparently ( who knew ? ) , soliciting prostitutes just might violate the State ’s laws regarding professional misconduct for a lawyer .
The law states that lawyers may be charged with misconduct and subsequently disbarred if they “ commit a criminal act especially one that reflects adversely on the lawyer ’s honesty , trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects .
“ Ooops .

The Health Care bill contains a provision for health clinics to be established in schools , since studies show that access to health services can greatly increase academic performance .
This gave Representative Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) all that she needed to formulate a new “ anti- reform ” conspiracy theory .
Bachmann tells us …that these would actually be “ sex clinics ” where kids could go to get ABORTIONS without their parents knowing about it : “ The bill goes on to say what ’s going to go on – comprehensive primary health services , physicals , treatment of minor acute medical conditions , referrals to follow - up for specialty care — is that abortion ?
Does that mean that someone ’s 13 year - old daughter could walk into a sex clinic , have a pregnancy test done , be taken away to the local Planned Parenthood abortion clinic , have their abortion , be back and go home on the school bus that night ?
Mom and dad are never the wiser .
“ Of course … Michelle only read item ( II ) under section 2511 of the bill … if she had bothered to read item ( I ) RIGHT BEFORE IT she would have known that the bills says : “ SBHC services will be provides in accordance with Federal , State , and local laws governing – ( I ) obtaining parental or guardian consent ; and ( II ) patient privacy and student records , including section 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and section 444 of the General Education Provision Act ; “ Your choice : bad reader …or just a liar ?
” where kids could go to get without their parents knowing about it : “ “ Of course … Michelle only read item ( II ) under section 2511 of the bill … if she had bothered to read item ( I ) RIGHT BEFORE IT she would have known that the bills says : “ “ Your choice : bad reader …or just a liar ?
Governor Sanford of South Carolina …having been asked by both his fellow Republicans and his constituents to resign over his actions regarding the abandonment of his duties to pursue an illicit affair … now asks that the state ethics panel does n’t release its findings .
I wonder why .
Hear that sound ?
It ’s the sound of Sanford ’s fingernails dragging across the State of South Carolina …clinging on like grim death so that he can stay in office for just a little bit longer .
The “ Republican ” brand name ?
Not doing so hot …and given the types of things I ’m reading and posting each week , this should surprise NO ONE .
THE MEDIA : PUNDITS , HACKS , AND OTHER INVETERATE LIARS :
FOX ’s Sean Hannity is so consistently wrong in terms of his facts and historical data , that Jon Stewart was able to dedicate almost a third of one Daily Show episode … just to pointing out Hannity ’s RECENT mistakes .
I submit this clip for your enjoyment and edification :
Bernard Goldberg , a media critic , usually appears on FOX shows …to DEFEND the network against the constant stream of accusations that they have an obvious , right - wing bias .
So …you can imagine that people were a bit shocked to see him appearing on the O’Reilly Factor , and saying … that in many ways , FOX is to be held responsible for creating this perception , especially when it does things like “ promoting ” Tea Party protests rather than simply “ reporting on ” Tea Party protests :
Once again , Shepard Smith , host of FOX ’s “ The Fox Report ” has chosen to speak the truth rather than simply parrot the talking points .
On a recent segment , a guest tried to levy criticisms at the current Health Care Reform proposals …by pointing out that Canada ’s single - payer system is less than perfect .
Shepard is quick to point out that it seems like a false and deceptive comparison , since NONE of the bills in Congress propose a single - payer system .
When Shepard ’s guest then tries to create a classic “ straw man “ /” slippery slope ” argument …
Shepard was n’t going to allow that either .
Good for you Shep :
Senator Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , at a recent discussion in front of powerful Washington “ movers and shakers , ” came right out and said that the “ birther ” conspiracy theorists are “ crazy , ” that Obama is certainly not a “ closet Muslim , ” and that Glenn Beck “ is not aligned with any party .
He is aligned with cynicism and there has always been a market for cynics .
But we became a great nation not because we are a nation of cynics .
We became a great nation because we are a nation of believers . “
Wow …could there finally be a Republican who might realize that the votes you get from siding with the extremists … ARE NOT WORTH IT .
THE OLYMPIC FLAME …FIZZLES :
Even after President Obama flew to Denmark to make the case for the 2016 Summer Olympics to be held in Chicago … the prize went to someone else .
In a shocking turn of events , Chicago did n’t even make it past the first round of voting … Tokyo would fall in the next round … and at the end Rio de Janeiro won over Madrid the right to host the games .
In a display that can only be described as exceedingly puerile , conservative commentators / columnists including RedState ’s Erick Erickson , Michelle Malkin , and Rush Limbaugh have been , quite literally , CELEBRATING the fact that America will not be hosting the 2016 games … simply because it allows them to claim that “ Obama failed at something . “
That ’s right : Conservatives are CELEBRATING , during an economic crisis , that America will NOT get the projected $ 22 billion in revenues , the 315,000 new jobs , and the $ 11 billion in new income that those jobs represent .
They ’re willing to cheer against the best interests of the country … if it means a “ failure ” for the President .
Remember this , when listening to these same people discuss Health Care Reform , or anything else : these people would rather America suffers … as long as it denies Obama check in the “ win ” column .

While the President was unable to convince the voting members of the IOC to permit the games to be held in America… top White House Advisor David Axlerod is correct at saying there is more involved than the President ’s charm .
It ’s a well established fact that the IOC is an extremely political body , and that its voting process often produces unexpected results .
In recent years , the IOC has come under increasing pressure to allow the games to be hosted in a country OTHER than the United States , the nations of Europe , and the countries comprising Asia …and preferably a South American country .
Given this pressure , the decision to hand the honor over to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil …starts to make more sense .
PALINWATCH – HOW CAN WE MISS HER IF SHE WON ’T GO AWAY :
Politico ’s recent polls suggest that ex-Governor Sarah Palin is not well regarded among her fellow Republicans , Republican advisors consider her to be “ electoral poison , ” and many of her former supporters either tired of her during the Levy / Bristol business , or do n’t respect her resigning the governorship before completing her term … but there is still a demographic that absolutely LOVES her : Evangelical Christians , and Republicans living in small , country towns … and of course , there ’s some overlap between those two groups .
I do n’t think I even need to say anything else on the subject … draw your own conclusions .
her : Evangelical Christians , and Republicans living in small , country towns … and of course , .
I do n’t think I even need to say anything else on the subject … draw your own conclusions .
The New York Post reports that Palin ’s new career as a “ highly paid speaker ” is not going so hot …perhaps due to the limited number of people ( mentioned in the previous item ) who still think she ’s “ bright ” and “ adorable . ”
In fact , one industry expert told the Post : “ The big lecture buyers in the US are paralyzed with fear about booking her , basically because they think she is a blithering idiot …
Palin is so uninteresting to so many groups – unless they are interested in moose hunting .
What does she have to say ?
She ca n’t even describe what she reads .
“
And as with the previous item … I really can’t think of anything that I need to add to that .
“ And as with the previous item … I really can’t think of anything that I need to add to that .
In a surprise move …perhaps due to her inability to book speaking gigs at $ 100,000 a pop…it was announced that Palin ’s memoir would be released November 17 , which is four months ahead of schedule .
The announcement regarding the book ’s title generated even more surprised looks : “ Going Rogue – An American Life . “ It seemed strange to some … that Palin would want to reference “ going rogue , ” as it was a comment that McCain campaign insiders made referring to how Palin ’s off - book , off - message , inconsistent , and completely unprepared remarks were TANKING MCCAIN ’S PRESIDENTIAL BID .
In other words … it was n’t meant as a compliment .
Pre-orders for the book suggest very brisk sales , causing some on the left to ascribe to a conspiracy theory that conservative groups and churches must be buying up the books in large numbers to increase the sales figures .
In reality … people just need to realize that not everybody who buys the book necessarily admires Sarah Palin…many will get it just for the likely entertainment value , the same way millions of people each day go out on YouTube and watch people ride bicycles into walls , fall off skateboards , and slip and fall while dancing .

Want a good laugh ?
Here ’s Ann Coulter , appearing on Joy Behar ’s new show on CNN … asserting that the effect of Sarah Palin ’s “ death panel ” tweet shows that Palin is “ a powerful woman ” and that people listen to her because she is so “ coherent . ”
Joy …took particular exception to the “ coherent ” part .
Many more excepts may be viewed here .
MISCELLANY :
Remember Valerie Plame ?
The undercover CIA agent whose identity was leaked to the press after her husband criticized the Bush administration ?
Remember the Bush administration agreeing to “ chat ” with investigators , but not on the record or under oath … and how Scooter Libby was eventually “ volunteered ” to take the fall for leaking the information , despite the fact that conventional wisdom suggested it was Vice President Cheney ’s idea ?
Thursday , a federal judge , against the wishes of both the Bush and Obama administrations , ruled that the FBI ’s notes of their interview with Cheney must be publicly released .
This could be embarrassing …on the upside , if Cheney ’s statements are embarrassing / incriminating enough , maybe he ’ll finally stop appearing on talk shows .
Fingers crossed …
Just last week , I was criticizing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for not being assertive enough , in terms of getting Senate Democrats to do what ’s right and not “ what ’s best for insurance companies . “
Apparently , Reid HAS grown enough of a backbone to send letters to President Obama and Secretary of Defense Gates …asking them to finally step up and lend their support to the fight to repeal the military ’s “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” policy , which is causing highly trained interpreters , war heroes , technical experts , and other brave soldiers / sailors / airmen , to be discharged from the armed services … just for being gay .
Reid wrote , “ As Congress considers future legislative action , we believe it would be helpful to hear your views on the policy , ” he writes .
“ Your leadership in this matter is greatly appreciated and needed at this time , ” and then goes on to include stories of highly valuable and distinguished soldiers being discharged under the policy .
Obama has voiced his opposition to both DADT and DOMA ( The Defense of Marriage Act ) … but so far his administration has done more to squelch challenges to the various anti-gay rights policies and laws , than it has done to repeal them .
At a minimum , they should be lending their support to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - NY ) , who has been fighting the good fight in the Senate .

Turns out that the Secret Service ’s investigation of the Facebook user who created a poll asking if the President “ should be killed , ” has identified a juvenile as the perpetrator .
No charges will be filed … but many are missing the obvious topic for discussion : while the poll may not have represented a viable threat to the President , does n’t it say something when the tone of our national discourse has become SO irrational , SO violent , SO hateful … that a child asks such a terrible question ?
Glenn , Michelle , Rush , Sean , Ann , Bill , and others … wo n’t you please think of the children ?
That ’s all from the Reality Liberation Front for this week – have a good weekend , and we ’ll see you on Monday .
President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Monday requiring all arms of the federal government to reduce greenhouse gas output in an effort to curb climate change .
Each federal agency will have to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions from its buildings , fleets and workers ' commutes , and has 90 days to tell the White House how it plans to measure and limit emissions by 2020 .
Targets for employees ' commutes and travel are due in June 2010 .
" As the largest consumer of energy in the US economy , the federal government can and should lead by example when it comes to creating innovative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , " Obama said in a statement .
The government mandate comes as the Obama administration begins to demand greenhouse gas reductions from car manufacturers and large industrial facilities .
The White House is anxious to show some progress on emissions before more than 180 nations meet in Copenhagen in December to hammer out a new international treaty on global warming .
The president wants Congress to pass a bill setting mandatory limits , but this is unlikely to occur before the Copenhagen negotiations begin .
The bill would require refineries , factories and power plants to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 % by 2020 , and roughly 80 % by the middle of the century .
The latest order also compels agencies to curb petroleum use , conserve water and curtail waste , extending and expanding on an executive order issued by the former president , George Bush , in January 2007 , which became law earlier this year .
Bush 's order , unlike Obama's , did not require agencies to set emissions targets .
Nevertheless , it was unclear how challenging the targets would be , or how much of a dent the proposed reductions would make in total US emissions .
Yay , Whoop - de - dooo , the Dow Jones hit 10,000 !!!
Yay !!!
The fat cat , thieves , company rapers have replenished their cash !!!!
Yay !!!
That is the problem .
The average Joe and Joesetta do n't give a mickey - fick about the Dow Jones hitting 10,000 points , THEY DON'T , but they understand that the rich people on Wall Street got over AGAIN .
That is the real problem .
Former President George W. Bush and current President Barack Obama forged ahead by bailing these crooked banks and Wall Street out with the tax payers dollars .
We sat back this time last year and saw the bonuses out of this world , thanks to us , the tax payers making it so .
Now we have to deal with this again ?
The Obama Administration can talk all day and all night until the cows come home about Wall Street and greed , but until they fully are BEHIND regulatory measures to change what has happened to banking and this crooked industry , it will continue to be talk .
And the public does understand the rich raking it up with a 10,000 Dow Jones and unemployment at 10 % .
Yeah , they get that picture fully .
It may be hard to believe but there was a time , almost 25 years ago , when Wall Street and Main Street were n't so far apart -- at least when it came to the average worker 's salary and the average financial industry employee 's annual bonus .
Back in 1985 , the average annual salary for all workers across the country was actually a bit higher than the average bonus ( $ 19,000 to $ 13,970 ) .
( Note : these numbers are not adjusted for inflation )
How times have changed - while the average bonus soared almost 14 times higher ( by 2006 ) , the average salary has essentially been stagnant sine the mid-1980s .
Though bonuses slipped sharply in 2008 amid the financial crisis , they 're rebounding this year and Wall Street firms are set to pay out record amounts to their employees .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner recently told reporters that banks will be making " significant changes " to the way they pay their employees , and called bonuses being paid out by bailed - out firms " deeply offensive . " read more here ...
Well , Geithner said significant changes would be made when all this went down early in the year , and as we see it the game still remains the SAME with the banking industry .
Again , until the Obama Administration is for real about real banking regulatory changes , it is just words going in one ear and out the other .

War has officially been declared after months of skirmishing .
First to the front was Fox News ' latest star , Glenn Beck , who laid out the battle plan with a map , a couple of toy tanks and a plastic attack helicopter .
" What a bunch of warmongers we have in the White House .
America is fighting the war in Iraq , they 're fighting in Afghanistan , Osama bin Laden , al - Qaida , the Taliban .
And now these people have taken on another enemy : Fox News , " said the anchor who once wept out of patriotic fervour as he introduced Sarah Palin .
" I want to show you right where the enemy is located , " Beck added as he circled Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News headquarters in green ink on a map of New York .
" This is the enemy , America ! "
Like many wars , it was n't hard to see this one coming , but the formal declaration of hostilities still caught almost everyone off guard .
Anita Dunn , the White House communications director , fired the first shot of the formal conflict at the weekend when she said that Obama had refused to appear on Fox News last month - at a time when he was doing a round of interviews on other stations to promote healthcare reform - because the most - watched cable news channel in America dealt in rightwing propaganda , not news .
" Fox News often operates either as the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican party , " she said .
" They take their talking points , put them on the air ; take their opposition research , put them on the air .
And that 's fine .
But let 's not pretend they 're a news network the way CNN is ...
We 're going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent . "
Fox 's two most excitable presenters , Beck and Bill O'Reilly , are spearheading the counterattack .
" They 're more worried about the war on Fox than the actual war in Afghanistan , " Beck said .
O'Reilly claimed that the criticism he gets from different quarters is evidence that he is even - handed .
He then went on to attack the rest of the press for " rhapsodic " coverage of Obama and described the New York Times as " as far left as you can get " .
Fox News said the White House was failing to distinguish between its news reporters and commentators who , the channel readily admits , are conservatives .
But the administration says that is because it is almost impossible to make the distinction when the network is so often actively involved in promoting a political agenda .
Scott McClellan , a press secretary to President George Bush , has said that the White House regularly gave talking points to Fox News to promote the administration 's agenda .
Fox News ' vice president , Bill Shine , has described the channel as " the voice of the opposition on some issues " .
To its critics , it is more like an attack dog .
The network has riled the White House by vigorously promoting conservative " tea party " protests against Obama earlier this year , named after the Boston Tea Party revolt against British rule .
Fox gave great publicity to the demonstrations beforehand and then extensive live coverage as its presenters revelled in what they characterised as a spontaneous populist revolt against an increasingly burdensome government .
At one point , a Fox News producer was filmed telling part of the crowd at a " tea party " protest in Washington when to cheer for the cameras .
Similarly , Fox News gave great prominence to opposition to Obama 's plans for healthcare reforms , heavily promoting meetings at which the president was characterised as a Nazi and a communist .
At other times , Fox News appears guided by a philosophy of Keep Fear Alive .
Viewers are regularly reminded of the government 's terror alert level , although it seldom changes .
The administration is also attacked for endangering America with its proposals to dismantle the prison at Guantánamo Bay .
O'Reilly has wrapped himself in the flag of patriotism - he sells mugs and caps on his website with the legend " American Patriot " - and persistently questioned the loyalty of those with views different to his own .
This includes Obama for his efforts to improve relations with the rest of the world .
What might have remained robust political differences entered a different realm in July after Obama criticised a white policeman who arrested the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates .
Beck accused the president of " a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture . "
" I 'm not saying he does n't like white people .
I 'm saying he has a problem .
This guy is , I believe , a racist , " Beck said .
That has prompted an advertising boycott of Beck 's show or Fox News as a whole by more than 20 companies , including Waitrose in Britain .
Yet even some of those sympathetic to the White House 's view of Fox question the wisdom of open confrontation with a major news network .
Fox News is revelling in the publicity , using it to portray itself to a growing viewership as the only network prepared to stand up to the president .
It has some commentators repeating an old adage about newspapers , repeated by Bill Clinton when he was president : " Never pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel . "
The issue that becomes important is the fact that the amount of oil , coal , natural gas or uranium that can be economically extracted varies with the price of the fuel .
In trying to estimate the size of the problem that will face the world as the available reserves of fossil fuel begin to decline , one has to make some assumptions about the size of the volumes that are available .
It is a debate that can lead to people talking past one another if they make different assumptions about the size of those reserves .
This holds true in discussions that dot the web sites of those that write about energy , whether writing about oil , natural gas , coal or uranium .
This current post was motivated by a couple of different stimuli , firstly there was an article on Seeking Alpha about the natural gas reserves of the USA and then I was asked a question about the coal reserve assumptions for Alaska .
The natural gas article illustrates , in some ways , the problem of discussing the remaining gas that the United States has available , and whether we have a problem in future supply .
With a consumption of around 23 tcf per year , it questions whether the remaining gas reserve is 337 tcf or 1,747 tcf .
It was followed , interestingly , by a second article on natural gas that points out the folly ( as it turns out ) of being in the natural gas market this past year , as an example of the “ no free lunch ” argument .
“ Natural gas is probably the best demonstration of the ‘ no free lunch ’ law in commodity indexing , as evidenced by the S&P GSCI Natural Gas Index which commenced at 100 in January of 1994 , ended September at 2.63 .
Over the same period , the natural gas future has increased about 125 % .
While 2008 served as a strong reminder ‘ to know what you own , ’ 2009 has reminded investors ‘ to know how to be properly exposed to commodities . ’ ”
This ties into estimating the size of the reserve , because , in raising money to develop reserves , you have to be confident that the money that you invest will give you a financial return on that investment .
If the price of natural gas has tumbled to $ 3 or less ( per kcf ) then you may not make that return , and may even lose money .
You will therefore look more cautiously at what are potential sources and be more selective on where you drill .
Some of the more questionable areas will no longer be sites that justify the investment .
And thus these areas move from being in the reserve account into that of being a resource that is available , but not justifiable as being exploitable AT THE PRESENT TIME .
Yes I know I was shouting , I did because it is that qualifying clause that gets overlooked time and again when discussions arise over what the fossil fuel base is for the world .
The condition as to whether the volume has enough worth to justify being developed changes with conditions .
Coal in the UK had a considerable future before the oil and gas reserves of the North Sea were developed .
At that time the reserve was proven at over 45 billion tons and the coal was being mined at around 200 million tons a year - but times change , and the cheapness of the liquid fuels , relative to the cost of mining , meant that a lot of the coal , although still there , is currently too expensive to produce – relative to the alternative .
It is thus no longer counted as being part of the reserve .
Now this gets into the climate change debate a little , since one of the arguments that are raised is that the users of coal do not pay the full price , since the price they do pay does not include some of the social and environmental costs associated with burning the product .
Since the customer ultimately pays for the product , this seems in part to be an argument to justify raising the price of coal based energy to the point that other sources become cost effective .
The problem is that in some locations it is hard to find current technologies , even at cost equality , that can provide a replacement for coal as oil and natural gas supplies run down .
Which gets us back to the question as to how much of a reserve of oil and gas we have , and how long will it last before we have to face the reality of a return to coal .
And this is where the price of the product controls , transiently , the volume of fuel available .
In the short term natural gas prices are down and it becomes harder to justify continuing to drill new wells , if they are n’t going to make money .
But as more folk stop drilling , then with the very transient life of the existing wells , the supply will shorten , and after the stored volumes begin to be used up , then prices will rise to the point that an effective market can be reestablished .
How long will that take ?
Probably until sometime next year is my current guess , though it depends in part on how hard a winter Europe and North America experience this year .
In the longer term there are so many power plants that now rely on natural gas that demand will sustain a higher price , and lead to an increase in the drilling rate , until price : supply and demand reach a more stable platform .
At that time the reserve volumes that are currently moving into the resource category will start to move back and the projections for a longer “ age of Natural Gas ” will start to assume a little more reality .
However I would like to throw a small caveat into that debate , at the beginning of the year the SEC changed the rules for counting the validity of an oil or gas resource , loosening the requirement that the fuel be “ proved ” to be there .
This is a link to the new regulations .
The ramifications of the new rules are likely to have some impact on this debate .
The US government is on an unsustainable path .
Deficits are soaring and the Obama administration is planning massive tax hikes .
Moreover , businesses have little reason to hire already because of massive overcapacity .
Add increasing health care costs to the list of reasons for businesses not to hire .
Given that government spending crowds out private investment , these policies all but assures that unemployment is going to remain high for a long time as noted in Structurally High Unemployment For A Decade .
Killing The Goose
Last week in Thoughts on the Economy : Problems and Solutions I listed the problems and some of the solutions facing the economy .
It was a discussion between John Mauldin and I about his weekly E - Letter Killing The Goose .
John and I agreed on many , but not all solutions .
I would also like to add something I have proposed before , killing the Davis - Bacon prevailing wage act .
Muddle Through Where Art Thou ?
Back in 2002 , the usually optimistic Mauldin proposed the economy would somehow manage to " Muddle Through " .
However , because of the unsustainable path we are on .
John has changed his mind .
Please consider these excerpts from Muddle Through , R.I.P ?
I defined a Muddle Through Economy in the past as one of slow growth ( in the area of 1 - 2 % ) and a slack employment environment , such as we had in 2002 and the early part of 2003 .
In early 2007 , I suggested we would return at some point to such an environment at the end of the recession I was predicting .
However , gentle reader , never in my wildest dreams did I think we could be
looking at government deficits of $ 1.5 trillion dollars and actually budgeting future
deficits of over $ 1 trillion as far as the eye can see .
And there is real reason to think that under current plans , $ 1 trillion deficits are optimistic .
Look at the graph above from the Heritage Foundation .
They suggest that current policy would bring us closer to a $ 2 trillion deficit by 2019 .
And that assumes nominal growth that is north of 3 % and unemployment dropping back below 5 % in reasonably short order .
Japanese Disease
Some readers wrote this week telling me I am far too worried about a rising government deficit .
Right now we are at roughly 42 % of debt to GDP .
In 1989 , at the
start of the lost decades , Japan had a debt - to - GDP ratio of 51 % .
Now it is at 178 % , and the world has not come to an end for them .
In fact , they are running massive government deficits today and plan to do so for a long time .
Why , I am asked , ca n’t we be like Japan ?
In 1989 , private Japanese debt ( businesses and consumers ) was at a debt - to - GDP
ratio of 212 % .
Now it is at 110 % .
And the total of both government and private debt is roughly the same ( within 5 % ) of where it was 20 years ago .
Along with running large trade surpluses , private debt has been exchanged for government debt .
Savings have fallen from the mid-teens to about 2 % today , as the country is rapidly aging and now using its savings to live on .
And how much has all that government spending helped the country ?
Before I answer that , read these paragraphs from Hoisington Asset
Management ’s latest letter ( last week ’s Outside the Box ) :
“ The federal government ’s promise to extricate the U.S. economy from this
recession involves more spending ( increasing public debt ) and more subsidies for
consumers , such as car rebates and home buying incentives ( more private debt ) .
In other words , more debt is supposed to solve the problem of over - indebtedness .
The truth is that this policy merely indentures its citizens further without providing any income for repayment of debt .
“ This means there is no long term income benefit from stimulus programs .
According to the latest academic research , the most recent $ 800 billion stimulus plan will boost economic activity in the short run , but will surely depress economic activity over time .
The government problem is complicated by the fact that the tax multiplier is 3 , meaning that a 1 % change in taxes will change GDP by about 3 % over time .
More recent research ( Barro & Redlick , September 2009 , " NBER Working Paper 15369 " ) suggests that a 1 % cut in the marginal tax rate would raise GDP in the ensuing year by 0.6 % .
With the deficit rising due to a zero spending multiplier , the tendency will be to try to raise taxes to pay for this higher level of expenditures , which will further depress aggregate spending and output . ”
For all intents and purposes , Japan has had no growth for almost two decades .
Their nominal GDP is where it was 17 years ago , and the number of employed people is at 20 - years - ago levels .
An aging population has masked their unemployment problems , as older citizens retire .
Their savings went to government debt .
Taxes were raised numerous times .
Since government deficit spending has no long - term multiplier effect , growth has been nonexistent .
( By the way , that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer , the chairman of the current President ’s Council of Economic Advisors , and further explored by European economists .
There is general agreement on these facts . )
Large government deficits choke off the very investment that we need to create
jobs .
In the name of doing good , the unintended consequence is to make it more difficult for small businesses to start up and create jobs .
And we all know that small business is the engine for job creation .
The New Muddle Through Economy
This is not a prescription for a return to normal growth .
We are headed for a New
Normal that is less than what the market currently believes .
Unless the deficit comes
under control at some point , we face the real prospect of catching Japanese Disease and suffering yet another lost decade .
Can we Muddle Through ?
We have no choice but to do so .
But it will not be fun .
It will not be long - term 2 % growth and employment going back to 6 % any time soon .
Can we reverse the course ?
With a different attitude and leadership in Congress , maybe we can .
But it wo n’t happen next year , and it ’s unlikely in 2011 .
I am afraid we will have to put my old friend Muddle Through , as I previously
defined him , back in his box for a while .
Japan Rethinks A Dam
The clatter of construction machinery still fills this forested mountain gorge , where legions of men in hard hats busily pour concrete , clear hillsides and erect a huge , unfinished bridge whose concrete supports tower over the valley floor like crucifixes in an immense graveyard .
It seems an apt analogy .
Japan ’s new government has suspended the $ 5.2 billion Yamba Dam being built here and turned this valley four hours north of Tokyo into a symbolic final resting place for the nation ’s postwar order , which relied on colossal public works spending .
The Democratic Party government of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has chosen this dam as the first of 48 national government - financed dams that it wants to scrap , worth tens of billions of dollars .
Japan had around 60 large dams under construction in 2005 , making it the world ’s fourth largest dam - building nation , according to The International Journal on Hydropower and Dams , despite having a land area smaller than California’s .
Decades of pouring concrete have been widely blamed in Japan for cluttering rural areas with needless dams and roads to nowhere .
They have also saddled the country with the developed world ’s largest national debt — nearly twice its $ 5 trillion economy .
Mr. Hatoyama ’s party has vowed to replace Japan ’s postwar “ construction state ” and the jobs it created with something closer to a European - style social welfare system .

PRINCETON , NJ -- A majority of Americans , 56 % , believe that a solution to America 's race - relations problem will eventually be worked out -- a figure that is roughly the same as those Gallup found in the years prior to last fall 's historic election of Barack Obama as president .
Responses to this long - standing trend today are almost exactly where they were in December 1963 , when Gallup first asked this question .
Fifty - five percent of Americans in 1963 were hopeful that a solution to the race - relations problem would eventually be worked out .
Now , some 46 years later , the " hopeful " percentage is an almost identical 56 % .
In short , despite all that has happened in the intervening decades , there is scarcely more hope now than there was those many years ago that the nation 's race - relations situation will be solved .
Still , the similarity between attitudes in 1963 and 2009 masks a good deal of movement on this measure in the intervening years .
" Among blacks , optimism about an eventual solution to race - relations problems has decreased since last summer , from 50 % to 42 % . "
The all - time low point for the " hopeful " alternative -- 29 % -- came in October 1995 , shortly after a Los Angeles jury acquitted O.J. Simpson of murder .
By 1998 , views that a solution to race problems would eventually be worked out had improved slightly , to 41 % , and they increased still more , to 50 % , by 2002 .
By last summer , when there was general recognition that a black man , Barack Obama , would receive the Democratic nomination for president , the percentage of Americans believing in an eventual solution to the race problem had risen to 58 % .
Gallup conducted a one - night poll on Nov. 5 of last year , the day after Obama 's electoral victory over John McCain .
The percentage of Americans giving the positive alternative to the race - relations question in that survey jumped to 67 % .
Now , about a year after Obama 's election , optimism that a solution to the country 's race problem will eventually be worked out has settled back down to 56 % .
This certainly remains higher than in a number of previous years , particularly at points in the 1990s .
But the current reading is not significantly improved from the sentiment that prevailed in more recent years prior to Obama 's election .
Blacks continue to give much more negative responses to this question than do whites .
The majority of whites are optimistic that a solution will eventually be worked out ; the majority of blacks disagree .
Among blacks , optimism about an eventual solution to race - relations problems has decreased since last summer , from 50 % to 42 % .
In fact , the current 42 % is essentially the same percentage that Gallup measured among blacks on several previous occasions .
Equal Job Opportunities ?
A second Gallup trend question asks if blacks have as good a chance as whites " in your community " to get any kind of job for which they are qualified .
In the current poll , 79 % of Americans say blacks have equal employment opportunities .
This is technically the highest positive response measured to date , albeit just two points higher than what Gallup measured in the 1998 survey .
Compared to last summer , the current figure represents an increase of eight percentage points .
There has been significant change on this measure over the last four and a half decades .
In March 1963 , when Gallup first asked this question , less than half of Americans ( 43 % ) said blacks had equal opportunities in terms of jobs .
In the summer of that year , the percentage of Americans who perceived that there was equal opportunity for blacks dropped to the all - time low of 39 % .
There was a sea change in attitudes by the time Gallup next asked the question , in 1978 , with 67 % of Americans in the summer of that year agreeing that blacks had equal opportunities .
Sentiment remained at roughly this level through the mid-1990s , and then rose to 75 % in 1997 and 77 % in 1998 .
Here again , as was the case for the broad question about eventual solutions to the race - relations problem , Americans ' attitudes today are positive , but not dramatically or significantly higher than at various points prior to Obama 's election .
Blacks are decidedly more pessimistic about equal job opportunities for blacks than are whites .
A large majority of whites say blacks have as good a chance as whites to get any type of job for which they are qualified .
Blacks , on the other hand , are divided in their views .
The current perceptions among blacks of the job situation for blacks represents an improvement from recent years , although at one point in 1995 -- after O.J. Simpson 's acquittal -- blacks were slightly more optimistic than they are now .
Racism
A third Gallup trend asks Americans about racism against blacks in the U.S.
At the beginning of last summer -- after Obama had essentially clinched the Democratic nomination -- 56 % of Americans agreed that there was widespread racism against blacks in the U.S.
That percentage has now dropped to 51 % .
The slight drop over the last 20 months has occurred to some degree among both blacks and whites .
There has been a slight uptick ( from 41 % to 44 % ) in the percentage of Americans who perceive widespread racism against whites in the U.S. Again , the overall increase reflects increases among both blacks and whites .
Bottom Line
Despite the election of the first black president in U.S. history , Americans ' optimism about a solution to the race problem in the U.S. and their views about the prevalence of racism against blacks are not substantially more positive now than they have been in previous years .
In fact , optimism about race relations is now almost identical to where it was 46 years ago , when Gallup first asked the question .
Blacks remain significantly more negative than whites about their status in society and about the potential for an eventual solution to the race problem .
The data do not suggest that blacks have become disproportionately more positive than whites as a result of Obama 's election as president .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,521 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 16 - 19 , 2009 , including an oversample of 408 blacks , consisting of 102 interviews done as part of the random national sample and 306 interviews with blacks who had previously participated in national Gallup polls and agreed to be re-interviewed at a later date .
The data from the national sample and re-interviews are combined and weighted to be demographically representative of the national adult population in the United States and to reflect the proper proportion of blacks in the overall population .
For results based on this sample of national adults , the maximum margin of error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 408 blacks , the maximum margin of error is ±6 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 933 non-Hispanic whites , the maximum margin of error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
All About Shops
What Is a Shop ?
A shop is essentially a premise or an establishment where the retail buying and selling of goods and services takes place .
It is sometimes referred to as a retail store .
Opening a shop is often considered an exciting venture despite taking up a substantial amount of your time , effort and money .
To get started , here are a few basics that you should consider knowing first .
What Are the Requirements Needed to Open a Shop ?
a. Come Up with the Proper Shop Layout
Each shop layout is supposed to be ideally suited to the type of commodities dealt in .
It is also important to factor in how different clients shop depending on the industry .
For commonly sold goods , you can easily carry out your research on the appropriate shop layout that properly showcases them .
For the more unique commodities , consider seeking the advice of a retail design agency since they are better equipped to provide solutions to complicated design layouts .
Read more about retail design agency
b. Decide on the Legal Structure of Your Business .
One of the most important decisions to make before opening your shop is choosing whether it should be a limited liability or unlimited liability business .
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of availability of capital , decision making and spreading of risk .
Choose one that you find most suitable for your situation .
c. Select a Name
The name of your shop should be able to clearly communicate what you are offering to prospective clients .
The business name often proves to be a valuable marketing and branding tool for independent retailers .
d. Decide on the Commodities You Intend to Sell
Picking a commodity that has the appropriate level of demand in the prevailing market is critical to the success of any shop .
Most goods also require some form of service to support them , such as warranty , repair and installation services for electronic merchandise .
You may consider dealing in good or service that you are passionate in .
What Are the Different Types of Shops ?
Shops vary depending on their size , organizational structure and the types of commodities sold .
The main similarity in most of them is that trade happens in retail .
Some examples include :
1. Speciality Shop
It is a type of shop that deals in a specific line of products that has an extensive assortment .
The assortment may vary in terms of size , model , colour , style and other features .
2. Department Shop
It is a massive retail premise that deals in a wide array of commodities that have each been organized into different departments .
This is meant to facilitate the buying , promotion and regulation of the products .
3. Convenience Shop
It is a shop that is situated close to a residential area .
It is normally small and operates for long durations .
It stocks a limited number of products that have a relatively high price .
Why Do People Open Shops ?
People usually decide to open shops to earn an income that may enable them to sustain themselves or their families .
You may also be seeking to make a difference in your community or would like to give those around the chance to improve their lives by working with you .
The passion for serving others may also motivate you to open a shop .
Capt Robert Mansell ( Pic courtesy of St Maarten Island Time.com )
The final mayday call from a British pilot who died after ditching his passenger plane in the Caribbean Sea has been released .
Robert Mansell , 32 , originally from Knowle , West Midlands , was hailed a hero when he died while saving his nine passengers by ditching his plane .
In the recording he tells the controllers he has lost an engine .
He was flying between the south Caribbean islands of Curacao and Bonaire on Wednesday when he crashed .
In the recording , Captain Mansell asks for the aircraft controller 's attention , then says : " Divi aero one four requesting a switch to Flamingo and priority landing Flamingo , I 've lost one of my engines . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Captain Mansell was five minutes short of the destination when he was forced to ditch the twin- engine Britten - Norman Islander .
His employers , Divi Divi Air , said he had used his skills as a " good pilot " to save lives .
Simon Janzen , from the company , said : " He 's a hero .
All the passengers survived and he is the only one missing .
If he was n't a good pilot , he could n't have ditched it so everyone could be saved .
" Other pilots would n't have known what to do but he landed the aircraft so that everyone could get out safely . "
Bonaire , which along with Curacao is part of the Netherlands Antilles , lies about 50 miles off the coast of Venezuela .
Ah , the good old days .
Remember when your computer ’s uptime hit 365 days ?
Were n’t you proud ?
If you never got there , you probably saw 100 , and were impressed with yourself and happy to get to triple digits .
For a long time , a system ’s uptime was considered a badge of honor .
Almost perversely , the higher the uptime , the more hesitant we were to bring down the machine for updates or repairs .
I remember this stage very well .
I ran Slack .
Heck , that was Slack ’s big claim to fame .
The boxes were so stable , they could literally run for years , and inevitably the hardware conked out before the software did .
At some point during the last decade or so , system administration as a whole wised up , or at least a lot of us did .
Software patching , kernel updates , security fixes , they all combine to rob of us the big numbers when we run ‘ uptime ’ .
Uptime is really just an ever increasing number , though .
Why did we ever get attached to it in the first place ?
Sure , humans in general “ like ” increasing numbers .
We relate to them , and the bigger they are , the more awe we feel .
Just look at the brouhaha about Y2 k .
I do n’t mean the completely legitimate “ computers are going to break ” concern , I mean the “ end of the world Jesus is coming look busy ” concern that people felt .
It ’s just a big round number .
We like that sort of thing .
If you doubt me , how many pictures of odometers would it take to convince you ?
But on a more obvious level , we were proud of our systems .
Uptime was a signal of what good shepherds we were .
A system with a multi- year uptime had been providing uninterrupted service .
It could be relied upon , and by extension so could we .
Definitely a badge of honor for the sysadmin who had the longest - running machines .
Now the pendulum has swung the other way .
We do n’t have increasingly bigger uptime to brag about , and if someone tries , the first question they get asked is “ what ’s the matter , do n’t apply security patches ? ”
There ’s a valid argument there , too .
Look at an exploit database and tell me you do n’t want to update your kernel as soon as you read through it .
Ironically , though individual machines ’ uptime has decreased , there has been a concerted effort by sysadmins to increase the reliability of the service that their servers provide .
As paradoxical as it sounds , lower uptimes really can contribute to meeting ( or exceeding ) your service level agreement .
The trick ?
Redundant servers .
Five years ago , in most small shops , you probably had a web server .
It was n’t a particularly beefy machine , unless you had a very busy website .
It was probably a previous - generation fileserver , or something similar .
If it needed the kernel updated or rebooted for something , you grumbled and came in at night to take it down , then came in late the next day ( if you were lucky ! ) .
Now , for a couple thousand dollars , you can get a hardware load balancer and put a few old servers up as web servers .
Now when one needs an update , you just do it .
The load balancer detects that the machine is down and seamlessly forwards traffic to the other servers .
The machine comes back up , and suddenly it ’s in rotation .
For less than the price of a new server , a load balancer is an incredible deal , and it does all sorts of services , not just web .
Likewise with file servers .
Where it used to be one big tower with a ton of disks , now it ’s a lightweight SAN device that you paid a few thousand for , but the benefit is that you can have several servers all reading from the same data ( using clustering or what have you ) , allowing you to take down any one of them without a loss of service .
Where this has gotten us is to a place and time where uptime as we knew it is dead .
In its place is a new sort of uptime , where the length should be measured not by running the “ uptime ” command , but by the months and years between service outages .
Design your infrastructures such that the loss of no single machine will destroy your service uptime and your customers will be very happy .
Incidentally , many IT organizations create Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) which give them targets to achieve for system availability .
If you do n’t have one , consider the possibility .
There are articles available to give you more information on the subject , so look around .
I ’m interested in hearing about what you do to engineer your systems to be more reliable .
Also , if you ’ve got an SLA ( or are thinking about one ) , I ’d be really interested to learn about it .
I do n’t have one yet , and although my company is n’t that structured yet , I can see it heading in that direction .
Thanks !

Internet users , do n't worry — papa Comcast 's lookin ' out for you .
The company announced that it has begun rolling out a service that will warn its broadband customers when they could be infected with malware based on their traffic patterns .
The service , dubbed " Constant Guard , " is really aimed at reducing botnet traffic on Comcast 's network with the spin that the company wants to protect customers , and a trial has already begun in Denver , Colorado .
The warning will come as an in - browser pop-up that will trigger if there 's an unusual spike in traffic from a customer 's home , or if mass numbers of e-mails suddenly start going out of that user 's account .
The pop-up will instruct users to go to Comcast 's Anti-Virus Center to help diagnosing and fixing the problem ( Comcast has partnered with McAfee for virus removal software ) .
For those concerned that Comcast has begun monitoring all those pornos lolcat pictures you have been downloading , put down your pitchforks .
Comcast has posted a draft of its ISP Web Notification System to the Internet Engineering Task Force that details how the monitoring can be done without resorting to Deep - Packet Inspection ( DPI ) .
The notification system design is based on the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol and uses Squid Web Proxy , the GreasySpoon ICAP server , and Apache Tomcat .
Comcast is one of the first major ISPs to take a proactive approach to helping customers deal with viruses and malware , and customers have reportedly responded positively — after all , most Internet users need all the help they can get in this area .
One thing we were left wondering , however , was what happens if a user chooses to ignore the warning , or if that person gets too many false alarms and wants to turn it off .
Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas confirmed that users can simply click to close the warning if they want to ignore it , but the Customer Security Assurance team will send the message again in seven days if they continue to believe the customer 's machine has been compromised .
As for those who think they 're above being infected : " We have found examples of people who are confident that they do n’t have a virus or malware , but it actually turns out they had been infected , " Douglas told Ars .

A film about referees .
Now I have to say I find this very interesting indeed and I 'm also surprised that nobody has ever thought of using a referee ( or indeed an umpire in any other sport ) as a vehicle for fiction .
Surely referees are every bit as capable of being existential heroes as Peter Handke ( and Albert Camus ) imagined goalkeepers to be .
Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski , in Why England Lose ... ( of which more later ) also left referees out from their broad - ranging economic survey of the game .
I 've always been interested by the sort of men ( and , these days , women ) who voluntarily step into a position that brings glory to few and vicious invective to most .
And many of them do it at a very young age ; becoming a whistler is to assume an older , middle - aged persona it can only be comparable to being a Young Tory , or , these days , joining the priesthood .
The referee must surely be the ultimate masochistic archetype .
Museum staff are now cleaning some of the affected shoes
The famous shoe collection of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos has survived the recent floods in Manila .
Staff at the Marikina Shoe Museum moved hundreds of pairs just before water swamped the building 's ground floor .
Marikina was one of the areas worst hit by Typhoon Ketsana , which killed more than 300 people in the Philippines .
The huge shoe collection is often seen as a symbol of the lavish tastes of Imelda and her husband , former President Ferdinand Marcos .
About 1,220 pairs of shoes were discovered in Imelda 's rooms at the Malacanang presidential palace , after the couple fled to the US after " people power " protests in 1986 .
Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989 , and Imelda now lives back in the Philippines .
Shoe industry
The Marikina Shoe Museum showcases Imelda Marcos ' collection as well as other footwear worn by former Philippine leaders .
Imelda Marcos had more than 1,200 pairs of shoes
When Typhoon Ketsana was about to hit , employees grabbed as many as they could and put them upstairs or on the top shelves of display cabinets .
" We managed to haul about 750 pairs upstairs , " 73 - year - old curator Sylvia de la Cruz told the French news agency AFP .
Only about 100 shoes are thought to have got wet .
Marikina , to the east of Manila , is the centre of the Philippines ' shoe industry .
Thousands of Marikina residents remain homeless after Typhoon Ketsana and the resulting floods , and tons of mud and debris are still littering the streets .
DLC is coming to Borderlands before the end of the year , though the premise of the first expansion may not be all that creative .
2K Games has released details on the first DLC expansion pack coming to Gearbox 's Borderlands .
Borderlands is a shweet looking co-op shoot - and - loot ( I'm trademarking that ) coming to the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and PC later this month .
Borderlands ' first expansion is called The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned .
It features an island called Jacobs Cove , with zombies on it , and a guy named Dr. Ned .
Okay , there 's a bit more to it than that : Dr. Ned was supposed to protect the island 's inhabitants , but he seems to have gone a few steps too far into the deep end , and has made them into zombies to keep them alive instead .
Zombies are notoriously hard to control , and now players must work with Dr. Ned to cure the inhabitants of Jacobs Cove , while killing as many of them as possible and looting lots of guns presumably .
I love myself some zombies , preferably the old - school ones that have n't learned how to run and chase me up ladders , but this expansion 's premise could be considered a little played out .
I do n't really care though , because Borderlands is the type of game that would actually suffer if it did n't contain an island full of zombies to annihilate .
The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is planned for release before the year 's end , and will be priced at 800 Microsoft points , or $ 9.99 in real money .
As will be the case with all of Borderlands ' DLC expansions , it will include new guns , enemies , quests , guns , rare loot drops , guns , and guns .
Borderlands has lots of guns in it .

On Wednesday , in a dispute over the price of steel pipe , the US Fires Opening Salvo In Trade Wars With China .
Late Friday evening , trade wars heated up again as Obama Fired the US ' Second Shot In Trade War With China .
In what is widely considered a test case of the president 's union support , Obama slaps duties on tire imports from China .
U.S. President Barack Obama slapped steep additional duties on tire imports from China on Friday in a move that pleased domestic labor groups but drew a strong rebuke from Beijing .
The United Steelworkers union , which represents workers at many U.S. tire production plants , filed a petition earlier this year asking for the protection .
It said a tripling of tire imports from China to about 46 million in 2008 from about 15 million in 2004 had cost more than 5,000 U.S. tire worker jobs .
An additional 35 percent duty will be placed for a year on Chinese - made passenger vehicle and light truck tires , the White House said in a statement .
" For far too long , workers across this country have been victimized by bad trade policies and government inaction .
Today , President Obama made clear that he will enforce America 's trade laws and stand with American workers , " United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said .
The ITC had recommended starting with a 55 percent tariff that would fall to 45 percent in year two and 35 percent in year three .
The steelworkers asked initially for a quota of 21 million that would grow by 5 percent each year .
Analysts expect Friday 's action to encourage other labor groups or domestic manufacturers to seek relief under Section 421 , which does not require petitioners to prove unfair trade practices are responsible for a surge in imports .
No American tire manufacturer supported the case and one , Cooper Tire , publicly opposed it .
" We are certainly disheartened that the president bowed to the union and disregarded the interests of thousands of other American workers and consumers , " said Marguerite Trossevin , counsel to the American Coalition for Free Trade in Tires .
Obama Faces an Early Trade Test
ALBANY , Ga. --
At the vast Cooper Tire plant here , workers heard for years about their rivals in Chinese factories .
The plant employed 2,100 people in this small south Georgia city is being shut down , and the troubles afflicting the U.S. tire industry are at the core of what many consider to be one of President Obama 's first major decisions on trade policy .
From 2004 to last year , the number of Chinese tires imported to the United States more than tripled , and their share of the U.S. market rose from 5 percent to 17 percent .
Over the same period , the share of the U.S. market served by U.S. factories declined by a similar amount .
More than 5,000 U.S. jobs were lost .
Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allows the United States to impose tariffs and other protections if a surge in Chinese imports damages a U.S. industry .
China agreed to the provision while negotiating to join the World Trade Organization .
The general " safeguard " provisions of the law have never been invoked , however .
The Bush administration was asked four times to impose measures to protect a U.S. industry , but it declined each time .
The proposed tire tariff represents the first such case presented to Obama , and his action will be closely watched and weighed against his campaign promises to " crack down on China " and " work to ensure that China is no longer given a free pass to undermine U.S. workers , " as his Web site put it .
The United Steelworkers union , which represents many of the nation 's tire workers and brought the complaint , helped Obama win the presidency .
The other side , meanwhile , boasts the aid of several former U.S. trade officials , who are representing the Chinese manufacturers and U.S. companies that import from China .
" You do n't keep jobs here by forcing companies into unprofitable lines of business , " said Marguerite Trossevin , who represents a coalition of U.S. tire companies that import Chinese tires to sell under their brands .

China might put import duties on meat hurting US farmers , or perhaps they decide to buy planes from Airbus instead of Boeing .
Perhaps they simply buy fewer planes from Boeing
Just two days after the decision by the United States to levy heavy import tariffs on Chinese tires , the government here has reacted by launching an anti-dumping and anti-subsidies investigation into automotive and chicken exports from the US .
The Ministry of Commerce ( MOFCOM ) Sunday did not label it as retaliation against the tire dispute , but said it acted simply in a response to domestic concerns .
The probe , which is in line with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) rules , follows complaints from Chinese manufacturers that US - made products entered the nation 's markets with " unfair competition " and harmed domestic industries , said the ministry in a statement .
Washington played down the dispute on Saturday , claiming it is simply " enforcing the rules " and did not expect the move to escalate into a trade war .
" Chinese tire producers pose no direct competition to those in the US , " he said before adding that China 's tire exports to the US had not witnessed a remarkable increase as claimed by the USW .
Last year , the country 's tire exports to the US grew by just 2.2 percent compared to 2007 and , in the first half of this year , fell 16 percent compared to 2008 , explained [ MOFCOM spokesman ]
Yao .
Analysts claim the actions of the Obama administration are at odds with its public statements about how protectionism could deepen the ongoing crisis .
USW 's International President Leo Gerard hailed the tariff hike by saying it " sent the message that we expect others to live by the rules , just as we do " .
However , Marguerite Trossevin , legal counsel to the American Coalition for Free Trade in Tires , a pro-business group , said : " We are certainly disheartened the president bowed to the USW and disregarded the interests of thousands of other US workers and consumers . "
Chinese Exporters Ask For Retaliation
The chairman of the China Rubber Industry Association was especially incensed as he feels the decision was made based on " bunch of lies " .
" The new tariff will be highly damaging to China 's tire industry and may cause 100,000 Chinese tire workers to lose their jobs , " said an emotional Fan .
He urged the Chinese government to adopt mandatory retaliatory measures against US manufacturers of agricultural products and automobiles .
He Weiwen , council member for the China Society for American Economy Studies , said China would be justified in taking retaliatory measures .
" We could levy higher tariffs on tires and automobiles imported from the US .
China should not let the US car firms make easy money from its vast car market .
We should teach them a lesson , " said He .

The municipal workers association of Nikea stand in solidarity with anarchists occupying the city hall since Saturday
As the occupation of the city hall of Nikea enters its third day , the support of locals so visual during the protest march regarding the police torture and death of Mohamed Karman Atif , which led to serious clashes with the police and 8 arrests last Saturday 17/10 , has been expressed in a communique by the municipal worker 's association of Nikea .
Communique of Workers Association of the municipality of Nikea about murder–detentions - occupation
Nikea City
Hall is occupied by anarchist groups from the afternoon of Saturday after a protest , for the death of the unfortunate Pakistani immigrant that took place in the Police Station of Nikea .
The Workers Association demands that the forces of repression leave from within the boundaries of the historic City of Nikea .
The occupation of the City Hall by the protesters is a political act , and the attempt to criminalise it is unacceptable and undemocratic .
The workers of Kokkinia [ red neighborhood ] disapprove strongly the attack of the forces of repression against the demonstrators and the mindless use of chemical gasses in a densely populated area .
The police rule imposed cannot intimidate protesters and workers .
We demand the immediate clarification of the case of the death of our fellow human being , the immigrant .
We call the Minister of Protection of Citizens [ Minister of Public Order ] to deal himself with this dark case and not attempt to conceal or whitewash this tragic case .
The Association of Workers protests strongly against xenophobia and racism that extreme - right centers and para - centers are trying to impose on Greek society .
WE DEMAND
-THE REPRESSION FORCES NOT TO RAID THE NIKEA CITY HALL .
-THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE POLICE FORCES FROM WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CITY OF NIKEA .
-THE CLARIFICATION OF THE CASE OF THE DEATH OF THE PAKISTANI IMMIGRANT .
-THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF GREEK POLICE AND THE FIRING OF EXTREME - RIGHT ELEMENTS IN ITS RANKS .
AMERICAN FORK , Utah - Four
Utah teenagers have been cited for disorderly conduct after they rapped their order at a McDonald 's drive - through .
The teens say they were imitating a popular video on YouTube .
They rapped their order , which begins with , " I need a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce ... " once quickly before repeating it more slowly .
Spencer Dauwalder says employees at the restaurant in American Fork told him and his friends they were holding up the line and needed to order or leave .
Dauwalder says nobody was in line .
The group left without buying anything .
The teens were later cited by police officers who tracked them to a high - school volleyball match .
The Associated Press on Thursday left messages seeking comment with the American Fork police and Oak Brook , Ill. - based McDonald's .

CSS has become the standard for building websites in today ’s industry .
Whether you are a hardcore developer or designer , you should be familiar with it .
CSS is the bridge between programming and design , and any Web professional must have some general knowledge of it .
If you are getting your feet wet with CSS , this is the perfect time to fire up your favorite text editor and follow along in this tutorial as we cover the most common and practical uses of CSS .
We ’ll start with what you could call the fundamental properties and capabilities of CSS , ones that we commonly use to build CSS - based websites :
Once you are comfortable with the basics , we will kick it up a notch with some neat tricks to build your CSS website from scratch and make some enhancements to it .

1. Padding vs. Margin
Most beginners get padding and margins mixed up and use them incorrectly .
Practices such as using the height to create padding or margins also lead to bugs and inconsistencies .
Understanding padding and margins is fundamental to using CSS .
What Is Padding And Margin ?
Padding is the inner space of an element , and margin is the outer space of an element .
The difference becomes clear once you apply backgrounds and borders to an element .
Unlike padding , margins are not covered by either the background or border because they are the space outside of the actual element .
Take a look at the visual below :
Margin and padding values are set clockwise , starting from the top .
Practical example :
Here is an < h2 > heading between two paragraphs .
As you can see , the margin creates white space between the paragraphs , and the padding ( where you see the background gray color ) gives it some breathing room .
Margin And Padding Values
In the above example of the heading , the values for the margin and padding would be :
margin : 15 px 0 15 px 0 ; padding : 15 px 15 px 15 px 15 px ;
To optimize this line of code further , we use an optimization technique called “ shorthand , ” which cuts down on repetitive code .
Applying the shorthand technique would slim the code down to this :
margin : 15 px 0 ; /*-- top and bottom = 15 px | right and left =
0 --*/ padding : 15 px ; /*-- top , right , bottom and left = 15px --*/
Here is what the complete CSS would look like for this heading :
h2 { background : # f0f0f0 ; border : 1 px solid #ddd ; margin : 15 px 0 ; padding : 15 px ; }
Quick Tip
Keep in mind that padding adds to the total width of your element .
For example , if you had specified that the element should be 100 pixels wide , and you had a left and right padding of 10 pixels , then you would end up with 120 pixels in total .
100 px ( content ) + 10 px ( left padding ) + 10 px ( right padding ) = 120 px ( total width of element )
Margin , however , expands the box model but does not directly affect the element itself .
This tip is especially handy when lining up columns in a layout !

2. Floats
Floats are a fundamental element in building CSS - based websites and can be used to align images and build layouts and columns .
If you recall how to align elements left and right in HTML , floating works in a similar way .
According to HTML
Dog , the float property “ specifies whether a fixed - width box should float , shifting it to the right or left , with surrounding content flowing around it . ”
The float : left value aligns elements to the left and can also be used as a solid container to create layouts and columns .
Let ’s look at a practical situation in which you can use float : left .
The float : right value aligns elements to the right , with surrounding elements flowing to the left .
Quick tip : Because block elements typically span 100 % of their parent container ’s width , floating an element to the right knocks it down to the next line .
This also applies to plain text that runs next to it because the floated element cannot squeeze in the same line .
You can correct this issue in one of two ways :
Reverse the order of the HTML markup so that you call the floated element first , and the neighboring element second .
Specify an exact width for the neighboring element so that when the two elements sit side by side , their combined width is less than or equal to the width of their parent container .
Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) has been known to double a floated element ’s margin .
So , what you originally specified as a 5 - pixel margin becomes 10 pixels in IE6 .
A simple trick to get around this bug is to add display : inline to your floated element , like so :
. floated_element { float : left ; width : 200 px ; margin : 5 px ; display : inline ; /*--IE6 workaround--*/ }

3. Center Alignment
The days of using the < center > HTML tag are long gone .
Let ’s look at the various ways of center - aligning an element .
Horizontal Alignment
You can horizontally align text elements using the text - align property .
This is quite simple to do , but keep in mind when center - aligning inline elements that you must add display : block .
This allows the browser to determine the boundaries on which to base its alignment of your element .
. center { text - align : center ; display : block ; /*-- For inline elements only --*/ }
To horizontally align non-textual elements , use the margin property .
The W3C says , “ If both margin - left and margin - right are auto , their used values are equal .
This horizontally centers the element with respect to the edges of the containing block . ”
Horizontal alignment can be achieved , then , by setting the left and right margins to auto .
This is an ideal method of horizontally aligning non -text - based elements ; for example , layouts and images .
But when center - aligning a layout or element without a specified width , you must specify a width in order for this to work .
To center - align a layout :
. layout_container { margin : 0 auto ; width : 960 px ; }
To center - align an image :
img.center { margin : 0 auto ; display : block ; /*-- Since IMG is an inline element --*/ }
Vertical Alignment
You can vertically align text - based elements using the line - height property , which specifies the amount of vertical space between lines of text .
This is ideal for vertically aligning headings and other text - based elements .
Simply match the line - height with the height of the element .
h1 { font - size : 3em ; height : 100 px ; line - height : 100 px ; }
To vertically align non-textual elements , use absolute positioning .
The trick with this technique is that you must specify the exact height and width of the centered element .
With the position : absolute property , an element is positioned according to its base position ( 0,0 : the top - left corner ) .
In the image below , the red point indicates the 0,0 base of the element , before a negative margin is applied .
By applying negative top and left margins , we can now perfectly align this element both vertically and horizontally .
Here is the complete CSS for horizontal and vertical alignment :
.vertical { width : 600 px ; /*-- Specify Width --*/ height : 300 px ; /*-- Specify Height --*/ position : absolute ; /*-- Set positioning to absolute --*/ top : 50 % ; /*-- Set top coordinate to 50%--*/ left : 50 % ; /*-- Set left coordinate to 50 %--*/ margin : - 150px 0 0 - 300 px ; /*-- Set negative top / left margin--*/ }

4. Ordered vs. Unordered Lists
An ordered list , < ol > , is a list whose items are marked with numbers .
An unordered list , < ul > , is a list whose items are marked with bullets .
By default , both of these list item styles are plain and simple .
But with the help of CSS , you can easily customize them .
To keep the code semantic , lists should be used only for content that is itemized in a list - like fashion .
But they can be extended to create multiple columns and navigation menus .
Customizing Unordered Lists
Plain bullets are dull and may not draw enough attention to the content they accompany .
You can fix this with a simple yet effective technique : remove the default bullets and apply a background image to each list item .
Here is the CSS for custom bullets :
ul.product_checklist { list - style : none ; /*-- Takes out the default bullets --*/ margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; } ul.product_checklist li { padding : 5 px 5 px 5 px 25 px ; /*-- Adds padding around each item--*/ margin : 0 ; background : url(icon_checklist.gif ) no -repeat left center ; /*-- Adds a bullet icon as a background image --*/ }
Resources for list items :
Using Unordered Lists for Navigation
Most CSS - based navigation menus are now built as lists .
Here is a breakdown of how to turn an ordinary list into a horizontal navigation menu .
HTML : begin with a simple unordered list , with links for each list item .
< ul id =" topnav " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Services </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Portfolio</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > About </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Contact</a></li> </ul >
CSS : we remove the default bullets ( as we did when we made custom bullets ) by specifying list - style : none .
Then , we float each list item to the left so that the navigation menu appears horizontal , flowing from left to right .
ul #topnav { list - style : none ; float : left ; width : 960 px ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; background : # f0f0f0 ; border : 1 px solid #ddd ; } ul#topnav li { float : left ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border - right : 1 px solid #ddd ; } ul#topnav li a { float : left ; display : block ; padding : 10 px ; color : # 333 ; text - decoration : none ; } ul#topnav li a : hover { background : # fff ; }

5. Styling Headings
The heading HTML tag is important for SEO .
But regular headings can look dull .
Why not spice them up with CSS and enjoy the best of both worlds ?
Once you have the main styling properties set for your headings , you can now nest inline elements to target specific text for extra styling .
Your HTML would look like this :
< h1 >< span>CSS</ span >
Back to Basics < small > Tips , Tricks , & Practical Uses of CSS </ small ></h1 >
And your CSS would look like this :
h1 { font : normal 5.2em Georgia , " Times New Roman " , Times , serif ; margin : 0 0 20 px ; padding : 10 px 0 ; font - weight : normal ; text - align : center ; text - shadow : 1px 1px 1px #ccc ; /*-- Not supported by IE --*/ } h1 span { color : # cc0000 ; font - weight : bold ; } h1 small { font - size : 0.35 em ; text - transform : uppercase ; color : # 999 ; font - family : Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; text - shadow : none ; display : block ; /*-- Keeps the small tag on its own line --*/ }

6. Overflow
The overflow property can be used in various ways and is one of the most useful properties in the CSS arsenal .
What Is Overflow ?
According to W3Schools.com , “ the overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element ’s box . ”
Take a look at the following examples to see how this works .
Visually , overflow : auto looks like an iframe but is much more useful and SEO - friendly .
It automatically adds a scroll bar ( horizontal , vertical or both ) when the content within an element exceeds the element ’s box or boundary .
The overflow : scroll property works the same but forces a scroll bar to appear regardless of whether or not the content exceeds the element ’s boundary .
And the overflow : hidden property masks or hides an element ’s content if it exceeds the element ’s boundary .
Quick tip : have you ever had a parent element that did not fully wrap around its child element ?
You can fix this by making the parent container a floated element .
In some cases , though , floating left or right is not a workable solution – for example , if you want to center - align the container or do not want to specify an exact width .
In this case , use overflow : hidden on your parent container to completely wrap any floated child elements within it .

7. Position
Positioning ( relative , absolute and fixed ) is one of the most powerful properties in CSS .
It allows you to position an element using exact coordinates , giving you the freedom and creativity to design out of the box .
You have to do three basic things when using positioning :
Set the coordinates ( i.e. define the positioning of the x and y coordinates ) .
Choose the right value for the situation : relative , absolute , fixed or static .
Set a value for the z - index property : to layer elements ( optional ) .
With position : relative , an element is placed in its natural position .
For example , if a relatively positioned element sits to the left of an image , setting the top and left coordinates to 10px would move the element just 10 pixels from the top and 10 pixels from the left of that exact spot .
Relative positioning is also commonly used to define the new point of origin ( the x and y coordinates ) of absolutely positioned nested elements .
By default , the base position of every element is the top - left corner ( 0,0 ) of the browser ’s view port .
When you give an element relative positioning , then the base position of any child elements with absolute positioning will be positioned relative to their parent element – i.e. 0,0 is now the top - left corner of the parent element , not the browser ’s view port .
An element with a value of position : absolute can be placed anywhere using x and y coordinates .
By default , its base position ( 0,0 ) is the top - left corner of the browser ’s view port .
It ignores all natural flow rules and is not affected by surrounding elements .
The base position of an element with a position : fixed value is also the top - left corner of the browser ’s view port .
The difference with fixed positioning is that the element will be fixed to its location and remain in view even when the user scrolls up or down .
The z - index property specifies the stack order of an element .
The higher the value , the higher the element will appear .
Think of z - index stacking as layering .

Adding Flavor With CSS
Now that you understand the basics , step up your game by adding a bit of flavor to your CSS .
Below are some common techniques for enhancing and polishing your layout and images .
We ’ll also challenge you to create your own website from scratch using pure CSS .
9. Background Images
Background images come in handy for many visual effects .
Whether you add a repeating background image to cover a large area or add stylish icons to your navigation , the property makes your page come to life .
Note , though , that the default print setting excludes the background property .
When creating printable pages , be mindful of which elements have background images and include image tags .
Using Large Backgrounds
With monitor sizes getting bigger and bigger , large background images for websites have become quite popular .

Text Replacement
You may be aware that not all standard browsers yet support custom fonts embedded on a website .
But you can replace text with an image in various ways .
One rather simple technique is to use the text - indent property .
Most commonly seen with headings , this technique replaces structured HTML text with an image .
h1 { background : url( home_h1.gif ) no-repeat ; text - indent : - 99999 px ; }
You may sometimes need to specify a width and height ( as well as display : block if the element is inline ) .
.replacethis { background : url( home_h1.gif ) no -repeat ; text - indent : - 99999 px ; width : 100 % ; height : 60 px ; display : block ; /*-- Needed only for inline elements --*/ }
ul.product_checklist { list - style : none ; /*-- Takes out the default bullets --*/ margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; } ul.product_checklist li { padding : 5 px 5 px 5 px 25 px ; /*-- Adds padding around each item--*/ margin : 0 ; background : url(icon_checklist.gif ) no -repeat left center ; /*-- Adds a bullet icon as a background image --*/ }

CSS Sprites
CSS Sprites is a technique in which you use background positioning to show only a small area of a larger single background image ( the larger image being actually multiple images laid out in a grid and merged into one file ) .
CSS Sprites are commonly used with icons and the hover and active states of images that have replaced links and navigation items .
Why use CSS Sprites ?
CSS Sprites save loading time and cut down on CSS and and HTTP requests .

Police in South Africa shot dead 556 people – including 32 bystanders – last year , the highest annual total for a decade .
The increase was revealed as the father of a 30 - year - old hairdresser mistakenly shot dead by police blamed calls for a shoot - to - kill policy from the president , Jacob Zuma .
The death toll of 556 suspects and others up to April this year was the fourth consecutive rise recorded by the Independent Complaints Directorate .
It was almost double the 281 deaths that resulted from police action in 2005 - 06 .
The toll has almost returned to the levels of the apartheid era .
David Bruce , of the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation , told South Africa 's Mail & Guardian newspaper that an estimated 653 people were shot dead by the police in 1976 , the year of the student uprising in Soweto .
Police tactics ahead of next year 's World Cup are under scrutiny after the killing this month of 30 - year - old Olga Kekana , who was on her way to a party in a car with three friends near Pretoria .
Police allegedly sprayed the grey Toyota with at least 13 bullets after mistaking the occupants for hijackers .
Kekana died after being shot in the head , and two others were injured .
Kekana 's father , Frans Makgotla , blamed the police actions on Zuma 's rhetoric .
The president has backed the demands of the new national police commissioner , Bheki Cele , for a return to apartheid - era legislation making it easier for officers to open fire on suspects without fearing the consequences .
The controversy deepened yesterday when Zuma 's African National Congress was accused of politicising Kekana 's funeral .
Angie Molebatsi , an ANC MP , reportedly told mourners : " One way or another we are all going to die , regardless of whether a cop shoots you or you were ill .
Let 's not lose hope towards the police .
Let 's keep on trusting them .
Forgiveness is what God wants .
This was her destiny , let 's not blame the police . "
Dianne Kohler Barnard , the shadow police minister , called on Molebatsi to apologise for the comments .
" Quite understandably , according to the reports , her comments were received very poorly by mourners , " she said .
" Ms Molebatsi 's comments were callous and cold , and she ought to publicly apologise immediately . "
Cele has announced plans to rebrand the police as a force instead of a service , with a military - style command structure of generals and lieutenants .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A man brutally beaten in New York City was targeted because he is openly gay , the New York Police Department said Monday .
Two men shouting " anti-gay remarks " viciously beat Jack Price , 49 , as he left a 24 - hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens early Friday morning , police said .
No further details where available about the attack .
Price is being treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens , where " he is in fair condition and his vital signs are stable , " said hospital spokeswoman Camela Morrissey .
Police arrested Daniel Aleman , 26 , and charged him with assault and aggravated assault as a hate crime .
" When someone is attacked for being who they are , and for being proud of who they are , there is no other explanation for that attack than hatred and bigotry , " said New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , the first openly gay speaker of the city council .
" I know the Queens community is outraged that hate has tainted their streets , and I know they will join with us in helping the local authorities find the second suspect . "
The police department 's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident .
No court date has been set for Aleman .

Demonoid remains one the most popular BitTorrent sites on the Internet , despite a fairly colorful and turbulent past .
Sadly its thousands of users could soon find themselves without their favorite site , as technical difficulties are set to cause possibly extended downtime .
Demonoid is one of the biggest torrent sites around .
Now fairly peacefully hosted to the west of Russia in Ukraine , the site has previously received unwanted attention from both music and movie companies .
So when the site goes offline a lot of people start to think of the worst , especially if there is little or no warning .
During the next few days , maybe hours , Demonoid may go down due to some serious - sounding technical issues .
They have already caused some damage to the site so the operators want to limit further damage .
“ We are experiencing power outages that have caused some ram and hard drive issues .
We might have to shut down everything to fix and prevent further damage , ” they say in a statement .
The downtime could be extended , “ … days maybe , until we can change the power circuit , ” they add .
Several Demonoid users already report connection issues , but the site is still accessible to most people at the time of writing .
The blackout wo n’t mean much to millions of Russian and Ukrainian BitTorrent users though , since they are already blocked from the site .
Over the years Demonoid has had its fair share of downtime .
In June 2007 Demonoid was pressured to leave their host in the Netherlands , mainly because of legal threats from the Dutch anti-piracy outfit , BREIN .
The site then relocated to Canada , but after threats from the CRIA , it decided to shut down there as well .
In 2008 the site eventually reappeared in full glory after being offline for six months .
This time the downtime should n’t last that long .
Any Demonoid users stuck for ideas on alternatives if the site goes down , can check here .
If you ’re looking for high speed downloads you could also consider to try Usenet instead ( our Usenet guide ) .
The wait is finally over .

I ’m currently in Jackson Hole , Wyoming where I just got out of the press conference for Roland Emmerich ’s upcoming disaster flick “ 2012 ” during which he spoke about two of his upcoming projects .
One is his plan to adapt Isaac Asimov ’s “ Foundation ” which we first heard about in January of this year .
But the other film and the one he plans to start shooting this March came as a major shock to me because the movie is about William Shakespeare .
For those that do n’t know Emmerich also directed “ Independence Day ” and “ The Day After Tomorrow ” so this is a major shift for him .
The film is called “ Anonymous ” and he planned to make the movie back in 2005 under the name “ Soul of the Age ” .
This new script is by John Orloff ( “ Band of Brothers ” , “ A Mighty Heart ” ) and Emmerich says it ’s his next movie .
Hit the jump for details on both films .
Before I get to the full transcript , I have to admit that I ’m kind of fascinated by Emmerich doing “ Anonymous ” .
On the one hand , I think it ’s exciting anytime a director who ’s been widely associated with one kind of film does something that ’s completely different and going from destroying the Earth to Shakespeare is about as different as you can get .
Obviously , the big concern is whether or not Emmerich can pull off this kind of small - budget , character driven film .
But that question alone gets me interested in this film and when you do this kind of story within the context of an Elizabethan political thriller , then I ’m intrigued .
I ’m still indifferent towards “ Foundation ” but that ’s due mostly to me not having read any of the books .
Could you talk a little bit about the movie you ’re planning to do about William Shakespeare ?
ROLAND EMMERICH :
It ’s been eight years I ’ve been trying to do this project .
It was always supposed to be my next movie but this time I ’m really doing it because I ’m already set to shoot on March 22nd and I ’m the casting process right now which for me is the most kind of nerve - racking because you have to make decisions .
And I start shooting in four or five days the first plates in England .
What is it about ?
EMMERICH :
It ’s about how it came to be that William Shakespeare was not the author of his plays .
It ’s not [ Christopher ] Marlowe , it ’s [ Edward ] de Vere , the 17th Earl of Oxford .
It ’s kind of like a political thriller .
It ’s about who will succeed Elizabeth and the cause of that thriller , the Essex Rebellion , we take on , and we learn how the plays were written by somebody else .
In what context does the action take place ?
EMMERICH :
Well it ’s very well researched .
The writer is John Orloff ( “ A Mighty Heart ” ) and he ’s been working on the script for two years before I got involved and he did a really , really good job and I just discussed it with several actors who are very knowledgeable about that time and I ’m really pleased how accurate it is .
Naturally , for dramatic reasons you sometimes alter facts but it ’s pretty well - researched .
With Isaac Asimov ’s “ Foundation ” series , how do you plan to handle such a large mythology ?
Will it be an original take or a literal adaptation ?
EMMERICH : Well I was interested in Asimov before and I think with “ I , Robot ” they changed everything and fans kind of hated the movie so I did n’t want to do that .
On the other end , The Foundation is a similar problem in that you have all these short stories and then they were combined into a book and so in a way there is not one character and I spoke with the Rob [ Rodat , writer of “ Saving Private Ryan ” ] and he said we have to consolidate the characters and that ’s what we did and it worked really , really well in the context and I think if Asimov would have conceived this as a science fiction trilogy or series from the very beginning , he would have done that too but he did n’t so I think in spirit it ’s totally “ Foundation ” but has consolidated characters that go through the three movies .
Have you read the script yet ?
EMMERICH : No , but he keeps calling me and saying , “ It ’s fantastic , Roland !
I ’ve never read such a good script ! ” and I say , “ Well , maybe you should send it to me … ? ” I love him .
He ’s a great , great guy but I think I ’ll get it soon .
He promised me he ’d get it to me before “ 2012 ” comes out .

AMERICAN FORK - Sunday night , a celebrated Utah high school band honored a music instructor who died trying to save a busload of students the night before .
That bus , carrying the American Fork High School Band , swerved off I - 15 north of the Utah - Idaho and landed on its side .
Thirty - three - year - old woodwind instructor Heather Christensen died at the scene .
Students and friends from two schools came together Sunday to remember the woodwind instructor .
One parent described the tightly knit group of students and their families as one large family .
They are accustomed to many hours together in rehearsal , in travel and now in grief .
Hundreds came out to the vigil , including Gov. Gary Herbert .
The American Fork High School gymnasium was so packed , staff had to bring in extra chairs .
All were there to remember a teacher they say gave everything to her students .
The award - winning American Fork marching band was on their way home from a competition when their bus driver suddenly passed out .
Christensen grabbed the wheel and tried to gain control of the bus .
It rolled , and Christensen was the sole fatality .
Hayley Lund , a student who was on the bus , told KSL , " I saw her stand up and jump for the wheel .
Before I knew it , the bus was off the road and we started bumping , and then we hit a really big bump .
And everyone went flying in their seats . "
Richard Flores said , " Away from the freeway there 's this really rocky area , so if we would have kept going , it would have been a lot worse . "
Christensen 's sister , Jana Hogenson , said Heather had always been her hero , but now the term takes on new meaning .
" I talked to the girl that sat right next to her last night on the bus , and she said had it not been for her , a lot of them would have died , " Hogenson said .
Three hours after the fatal crash , crews still worked the investigation and cleaned up debris .
Sgt. Mike Winans , with the Idaho State Police Department , said , " This was quite a chaotic scene . "
Around 7:20 , the American Fork High School band was headed home from a band competition at Idaho State University in Pocatello .
Two miles north of McCammon , as the four buses moved down the interstate in caravan , the second bus suddenly veered off the road and crashed .
" With a bus full of people , there could have been a lot more people injured or killed , " said Sgt. Winans .
Early investigation shows the driver had a medical condition which caused the crash .
Students on the bus say the driver passed out and Christensen tried to take the wheel to try to keep the bus on the road .
She was unsuccessful and fell out the window as the bus tumbled off the road .
On board were approximately 50 students , two adults , plus the driver .
Two students were airlifted to a Pocatello , and medical personnel treated several other students , all of whom will be OK .
The driver was also taken to a hospital .
" This is something that a first responder does n't usually see , " said Sgt. Winans .
" A bus full of people that 's been overturned .
Everyone here performed admirably . "
Ellen Wilson and her husband had traveled to Idaho with the band because two of their children are in the band .
They were finishing dinner in Pocatello when they got a call from their 15 - year - old daughter and rushed to the scene .
" I could tell she was upset .
I said , ' What is wrong Ashlyn ? , ' and she said , ' The bus in front of us just flipped , ' and I was stunned , " Wilson said .
The band went from a real high to an incredible low .
They had just won the competition in Pocatello before the crash .
" Monday is going to be extremely difficult for the kids , extremely , " said Wilson as she wiped away tears .
John Miller , director of bands of American Fork High School , called it a terrible night .
He said three students were initially trapped in the bus , then saved by emergency responders .
" It 's just a pure blessing there were n't more kids severely damaged or killed , " Miller said .
" It was amazing . "
The Idaho State Police Department will finish the investigation with the help of the National Transportation Safety Board .
A program and vigil was held tonight at American Fork High School in her honor .
A viewing for Christensen will be held Friday evening at the Anderson & Sons Mortuary , located at 49 E. 100 North , American Fork , from 6 to 9 p.m .
Another viewing will be held Saturday morning at the Alpine Tabernacle from 9 to 11:30 a.m. , with the funeral immediately following .
Other schools are showing support for American Fork High school .
Students at Riverton High held their own vigil in honor of Heather Christensen Sunday night .
Christensen was the band director at Riverton for six years .

What in the recent past seemed exotic and foreign is now almost routinely folded into “ the fold . ”
Buddhism is not only accepted as a mainstream American religion , it is a path increasingly trod by faithful Christians and Jews who infuse Eastern spiritual insights and practices such as meditation into their own religions .
When John Weber became a Buddhist at age 19 , his devout Methodist parents were not particularly pleased .
In recent years , however , they ’ve invited their son , a religious studies expert with Boulder ’s Naropa University , to speak at their church about Buddhism .
“ That never would have happened before , ” Weber said .
“ They would have been embarrassed . ”
The Pew Forum ’s Religious Landscape Survey in 2007 found that seven in 10 Americans who have a religion believe there is more than one path to salvation .
A growing number of people are contemplating more than one each .
And they are contemplating contemplation itself .
There are Jubus — Jews who bring Buddhism into their practice of Judaism — and Bujus , who are Buddhists with Jewish parents .
Then there are UUbus , or Unitarian Universalist Buddhists , and Ebus , or Episcopalian Buddhists .
There are Zen Catholics .
“ There is a definite trend and movement that will not be reversed , ” said Ruben Habito , a laicized Jesuit priest , Zen master and professor of world religions at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ We are in a new spiritual age , an inter-religious age . ”
Search can lead back home
People are hungry for a deeper spiritual experience — meditation , mindfulness , personal transformation , deep insight , union with God or the universe .
Habito , who calls himself a Zen Catholic , is one of the experts who say the search is a little like Dorothy and her ruby slippers .
The quest for meaning ultimately leads some , like Dorothy , to their own backyards .
Judaism , Catholicism and Islam have rich traditions in contemplative practices , yet these had all but disappeared from everyday congregational life .
For many Christians cut off from the past , or alienated from the faith of their upbringing , Buddhism has served as the bridge to ancient wisdom .
“ The problem is the contemplative tradition in the Christian Church has had its ups and downs over the centuries , ” said Father Thomas Keating , a Trappist monk and leader in the Centering Prayer movement , a modern revival of Christian contemplative practice .
“ We sensed that the Eastern religions , with their highly developed spirituality , had something we did n’t have , ” Keating said .
“ In the last generation , 10 to 20 years , some did n’t even think there was a Christian spirituality , just rules — do ’s and don’ts and dogma they did n’t find spiritually nourishing .
It ’s important to recover the mystical aspects of the gospel . ”
Christian contemplative practices were lost or weakened in the Protestant Reformation and later in the Great Awakening — religious revolutions in colonial America that advanced the themes of Protestantism .
“ There is growing permission to turn back to some of the early church practices and pieces that helped us to be whole , ” said the Rev. Stuart Lord , an ordained Baptist minister and new president of Naropa University , a Buddhist - founded institution .
“ I ’ve been studying Buddhism and meditation for about seven years .
I look at it as helping a person lead a fuller Christian life . ”
Cultivating an inner life
Buddhist scholar Judith Simmer - Brown , a professor at Naropa , said Christian denominations are working hard to rediscover contemplative traditions as one way to combat people leaving their churches .
“ They literally have rebuilt their Christian meditative forms , ” Simmer - Brown said .
“ Some borrow heavily from Buddhism . ”
Lord said the interdenominational yearning for meditation and deeper spiritual experience is not reflective of a desire for different doctrines or ethos — or a taste for Asian cultural trappings .
“ It ’s about cultivating an inner life , not the outer appearances , ” he said .
“ You do n’t have to shave your head . ”
The Buddha was non-dogmatic and non-authoritarian — a compassionate guide , not a god , Buddhist texts say .
The Buddha was silent on the subjects of a supreme being and the immortality of the soul .
“ Buddhism is more about spiritual practice than believing in certain doctrines , ” Habito said .
“ There are more definitive and particular requirements for saying ‘ I am a Christian . ’ ”
Yet the fusion of strong Buddhist elements with mainstream Christian religion has created a backlash , Simmer - Brown said .
The nomination early this year of the Rev. Kevin Thew Forrester to become an Episcopal bishop in Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula created a stir when it was learned he also practiced Zen Buddhist meditation .
Forrester ’s nomination failed .
Problems of religious rivalry
Blogger Greg Griffith , of StandFirminFaith.com , criticized the “ progressivism ” and the church ’s willingness to fuse differing religious beliefs that paved the way for Forrester ’s nomination in the first place .
“ It starts with labyrinths , continues with Buddhist monks constructing mandalas in a cathedral , and over the background noise of pagan priests and books about love spells , proceeds to Muslim priestesses and now a Buddhist bishop , ” Griffith wrote .
Methodist Rev. Toni Cook , a founder of St. Paul ’s Buddhist Christian InterSpiritual Community in Denver , said religious rivalry creates more problems than reconciliation .
About 14 years ago , a gang member had laughed when Cook and a group of clergy asked how they could help get young people out of gangs .
“ How are all the religions any different from street gangs ? ” he asked .
“ You mark off your own territory and defend it to the death . ”
Cook decided : “ There ’s got to be a way to share sacred space without trying to convert one another . ”

170 percent Increase of adherents during a Buddhist “ boom ” between 1990 and 2000 , according to the American Religious Identity Survey

An Indiana appeals court has upheld the ruling of the state ’s workers ’ compensation board that an employee at a pizza restaurant is eligible for treatment for obesity under a workers ’ compensation policy .
The ruling is similar to one recently handed down by the Oregon Supreme Court , which ruled that weight - loss surgery can be covered by state workers ’ compensation insurance , provided it is needed to treat a job - related injury .
The Indiana appeals court , in Boston ’s Gourmet Pizza vs. Adam Childers , agreed that because Childers massive weight gain was a result of an injury he sustained while working at Boston ’s Gourmet Pizza , he is “ entitled to receive a certain secondary medical treatment and the continued payment of temporary total disability benefits . ”
Childers was 25 years old and a cook at the restaurant in March 2007 when he was injured when a freezer door hit him in the back while he was working .
Childers was six feet tall , weighed 340 pounds and smoked around 30 cigarettes a day , according to court documents .
In the months following the accident , Childers ’ back pain increased and underwent a number of treatments and examinations .
He was determined to be a candidate for spinal fusion surgery , but by that time his weight increased to 380 pounds .
His doctor said because of Childers ’ increased weight there was a high risk that the surgery would fail .
He recommended lap band surgery “ so that he will lose some substantial weight and potentially improve his back symptoms and possibly even avoid surgery , ” the court wrote in its opinion .
The workers ’ compensation board found that Childers was entitled to the lap band surgery for weight loss “ as a pre-cursor to his primary entitlement to back surgery to directly repair the result of his work - related accident . ”
The restaurant objected , saying Childers ’ weight was a pre-existing condition and not covered under the policy .
The appeals court found that Childers work related injury , which did not respond to various non-surgical treatments , was partly the cause of Childers ’ additional weight gain because he was unable to exercise subsequent to the injury .
It also noted that the record “ contains evidence that Childers ’ efforts to lose weight by other means had been unsuccessful . ”
Additionally , the court said no evidence had been presented “ that Childers ’ weight at the time of the injury precluded successful resolution of his pain , and there is evidence that after the weight gain , further treatment for his pain was ‘ doomed to failure . ' ”

Anthony Lynn has already done more shuffling to the Los Angeles Chargers offensive line over the first three weeks than most coaches do in a season .
Unfortunately for Lynn , more changes might be in store as the Chargers prepare to face one of the league 's more aggressive defenses .
Right tackle Bryan Bulaga and right guard Trai Turner did not practice Wednesday as the Chargers ( 1 - 2 ) began preparations for Sunday 's contest at Tampa Bay .
Ever since being introduced to Web 0.1 — also known as flyer - to - print - to - photo - to - print - to - scan - to - web design — I 've come to realize that there 's a whole parallel universe of web development out there .
A bizarro world if you will , where HTML is used to display images of formatted text , CSS serves to define < B > as " font - style:italic " , and aaaaaaaaaaaaaa is a linebreak .
Of course , since most of these examples do n't come from the professional world of web development , they only show up on The Daily WTF on days I feel like breaking the " professionals only " rule .
Like today .
The first specimen from the bizarro web was discovered by Steve Green .
On first glance , it appears to be a standard contact form .
Upon closer inspection of how it is to be submitted , it 's apparent that it is , in fact , a standard contact form ... for the world of Web 0.1 .
Our next form specimen comes from Jake C , who did n't quite find a Web 0.1 form , but instead a user .
" I 'm a student worker in the IT department at my college , " Jake writes , " and generally I like to think the staff here have a passable knowledge of computer technology - at least enough to do their jobs .
After today , however , I am reconsidering .
We just got this in the mail .
Not e-mail , more the dead - tree kind that 's delivered by a postman . "
" Yes , " Jake continues , " instead of using a web - form and hitting ' submit ' to send electronically , this clever person decided to print the form , fill it out with a typewriter , and then send it to us via the campus snail - mail .
Strangely absent was the request , ' I only have a typewriter ' . "
And finally , we have this story from Stephen , whose client wanted to make sure that his paper forms stayed paper .
I work for a company that provides print and mail services — i.e. creating paper copies of user - supplied documents and mailing them to user - supplied addresses — to all sorts of businesses .
When we get a new account , one of the final stages to our set - up process is new client training , where we show them how to use our website and manage the details of their account .
I recently was training a new client and , when we got to the " Custom Messages " section of our site , where clients can create text that will appear in specific spots on the documents that we print .
As the client typed in the contact details for their company , the website address automatically turned into a link .
Then the client paused for a second .
" I have just one thing that makes me uneasy about this whole thing , " he said , " when we mail these documents to our customers , I do n't want them to be able to click on that link to go to our site . "
Perplexed , I responded , " well these documents are printed out ... on paper ... and mailed to your customers .
So ... they ... uh — " " Yeah , " he jumped in , " but they 're still links .
Wo n't they be able to click them ? "
I nervously chuckled , waiting for him to laugh back .
But he was serious .
" Do n't worry , " I explained , " when we print this on the paper we make sure to disable the link . "
" Good , " he said , " I think our customers would be too clueless to realize what happened . "
A researcher has unearthed fresh evidence of cyber criminals ' growing attraction to Apple 's OS X platform with the discovery of a now - disbanded group that offered 43 cents for every infected Mac .
Mac-codec.com was just one of hundreds of " codec - partnerka , " a term researcher Dmitry Samosseiko uses to describe the well - organized affiliate networks that pay a small bounty each time their malware is installed on an unsuspecting end user 's computer .
What makes this one stand apart is its dedication to the Mac platform .
" It 's very infrequent , " Samosseiko told The Register , referring to the finding he made earlier this year .
" We discover new ones extremely rarely compared to Windows platforms . "
The site advertised various promotional materials Mac - based " video players " and offered " webmasters " the fee in exchange for each installation on Macs that visited their exploit sites .
The 43 - cent fee is slightly lower than the 50 cents to 55 cents the codec - partnerka pay for infections of Windows - based machines , Samosseiko said .
The outfit was holding out the offer in January and February of this year , but has since closed its doors , said Samosseiko , who is manager of Sophoslabs in Canada , a research arm of anti-virus firm Sophos .
He presented his findings as part of a larger discussion about codec - partnerka presented at this week 's Virus Bulletin conference in Geneva .
The groups ' malware typically masquerades as legitimate video codecs or anti-virus software .
" I suspect that it was n't as profitable to target the Mac platform at that point , " he explained .
Mac-codec.com " probably closed because it was n't commercially viable for them to conduct business . "
Infiltrating the highly secretive networks is by no means an easy task .
Most of them are based in Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe , and interlopers must first gain the trust of other members .
Although Mac-codec.com is no longer active , Samosseiko does n't believe that 's the end of the bounty program for infected OS X systems .
" I suspect there are others targeting other Mac users , " he said . ®
An ad released by the Los Angeles Police Department urging the public to participate in an anti-terror snooping program is being described by numerous observers and news sources by a single word : Creepy .
The one - and - a - half minute spot , which can be viewed below , features a multicultural line - up of speakers explaining why they participate in iWatch , a “ neighborhood watch for the whole city , ” as the ad describes it .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If you see , hear , or smell something suspicious , report it .
Reporting is easy .
Use the web or the phone , ” the speakers state .
“ A single report can lead to actions that can stop a terrorist attack .
Think about that .
Think about the power of that .
Think about the power of iWatch . ”
And indeed plenty of people are now thinking about the power of iWatch , and many observers are not impressed .
Allison Kilkenny , on her TrueSlant blog , says it wo n’t be long before iWatch will be exploited by people for their own purposes .
These kinds of anonymous hotlines are ripe for abuse , and there exist endless possibilities of innocent citizens being reported by their neighbors for the crime of “ Living While Being Arab . ”
After the 9/11 attacks , we were told the solution to terrorism was to have citizens spy on each other , and not to , say , elect a competent government .
That ’s when TIPS ( Terrorist Information and Prevention System ) was born , an initiative to recruit one million volunteers in 10 cities across the country that encouraged them to report suspicious activity that might be terrorism - related .
An investigative political journalist , Ritt Goldstein , observed in Australia ’s Sydney Morning Herald that TIPS would provide America with a higher percentage of “ citizen spies ” than the former East Germany had under the notorious Stasi secret police .
The LAPD is “ creeping out America ” with the ad , states KNBC in Los Angeles .
The station cites outgoing LAPD Chief William Bratton , who said that “ a single terrorism incident would do more harm to the city ’s image and economy than 50 gang murders . ”
“ Absolutely true — but do we really have to be so creepy with the promotional videos ? ” asked the station in its report .
“ This is LA .
There are probably one or two writers , actors and directors that would be willing to cut out some of that creepiness . ”

Tina Dupuy at the media - affairs blog MediaBistro writes that the ad “ is universally thought to be creepy and not unlike we ’ve imagined PSA ’s on Orwell ’s telescreens to be like . ”
But our reaction is why did this take so long ?
Hello !
September 11th 2001 was like eight years ago .
It ’s taken the LAPD this long to ask Angelenos to be on the look out for anything suspicious in regards to terrorism ?!
What , did they get stuck in traffic for the better part of a decade ?

A week or so ago , I sat metaphorically open - mouthed at a London think - tank , as a series of speakers systematically demolished all the arguments commonly advanced in support of the British - US " special relationship " .
What was said , in summary , was this .
Britain had to accept that she was a medium - sized power , with size , wealth and reach very different from those of the United States .
The relationship would only ever become more unequal , as the US pursued global ambitions , and China hove into view .
Britain 's military and other capabilities would be distorted – to our disadvantage – if we tried to keep up with the US .
And identifying our national interests so closely with those of the United States placed us in the demeaning position of having to change our foreign policy whenever the US elected a new administration , even though our own government was the same .
The conclusion was that our future foreign and defence policy alignment had to be with the European Union , although for the time being membership of Nato and the EU could be reconciled .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
My general astonishment , though , was only partly a response to the arguments being set out from the platform , cogent though they were .
Mostly it was because the audience , rich in frontline military , defence and diplomatic experience , and of an age to be Atlanticist by temperament , seemed to be more in agreement with what was being said than not .
No one challenged the view that Britain not only had to cut its coat according to its cloth , but needed , for defence and foreign policy purposes , to be part of something bigger – and that something was probably the European Union .
In the space of a couple of hours almost every sacred defence cow was slaughtered , from Britain 's moral responsibility to engage in humanitarian intervention around the globe to the expense of renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent .
Our engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan were discussed not as demonstrations of our global reach , but as chastening experiences illustrating the limits of our capability .
There was no suggestion that either venture should , or could , be repeated .
Many trends converge here , but together they make for a comprehensive rethink of Britain 's diplomatic direction .
One is certainly the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan , that have turned out to be rather more cruel than the cakewalk someone promised .
Another is President Obama 's tendency to see Britain as part of Europe , rather than a beloved old comrade - in - arms .
But there are many others .
The economic crisis , more acute in Britain than in many other countries , because of the emphasis deliberately placed on financial services , will necessitate public spending cuts from which defence and diplomacy will not be spared .
Bernard Grey 's report on defence procurement – just published , after a delay – points up current extravagance , but also a future bill running into billions that not only cannot be paid , but covers advance orders that have no hope of matching long - term requirements .
There are calls for more and better advance planning and for a US - style four - yearly defence review – one is already in the offing .
The Prime Minister 's decision to reduce our four nuclear submarines to three may , with hindsight , be seen as the point at which Britain 's late 20th century ambitions began to shrink .
How far this reassessment of Britain 's relations with the outside world was reflected in the front ranks of government , as opposed to the corridors of power , was nonetheless hard to gauge .
Until yesterday , that is , when the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , gave one of the most Europhile – and least Atlanticist – speeches ever delivered to a British audience by any minister since Labour took office 12 years ago .
Setting the scene for Britain to enact its foreign policy primarily through the EU , Mr Miliband effectively buried the " special relationship " .
He insisted that Europe was " no replacement for Britain 's partnership with the United States " , but everything else he said dictated otherwise .
The US featured as just another big power .
" Europe , " he said , " is our continent . "
It is tragic , of course , that just as its authority is ebbing away , this government – or at least this foreign secretary – is discovering his inner European .
And while Mr Miliband 's speech might have been more a personal pitch for a European job than a comprehensive reorientation of government policy , in the end it scarcely matters .
What we seem to be watching is yet another lamentable piece of mis-timing .
Even as the preponderance of our diplomatic and defence establishment is accepting Europe as the logical arena of Britain 's influence , we look set to vote into office a government more Eurosceptic than any since we joined the EU .
At a time when Britain could have blended with the European mainstream , David Cameron is swimming against the tide of history , his only allies on the margins .
The one consolation for Britain 's pro-Europeans must be that , before he takes on Brussels , Mr Cameron could be heading for a train - wreck on the Europe question here at home .

When we 're battling psychological problems and go see a therapist for treatment , we tend to trust that it 's doing us good .
But should we ?
Not according to three clinical psychologists who have written a 145 - page document for the November issue of the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest .
The three authors contend that far too many therapists are poorly trained and using outdated or unproven methods -- while neglecting to use ones that actually work .
Timothy Baker , Richard McFall and Varda Shoham say that a lack of science - based training in many programs is the problem .
They fault some PsyD programs and for - profit training centers especially .
And they 're calling for a reform of clinical psychology training programs and an overhauled accreditation system to deal with the issue .
( Such a system is already under development . )
As an example of what they mean , Baker , McFall and Shoham note that only 30 % of therapists are trained in cognitive behavioral therapy approaches for treating post traumatic stress disorder -- even though this mode of treatment has been shown in studies to be the most useful treatment for such patients .
And , further , only half of those who are trained in the method use it for these patients .
You can read the whole report here .
And here 's a Newsweek article you might want to check out , Ignoring the Evidence ( by Sharon Begley ) .
The report -- yes , it 's long !-- makes an interesting and not -very - flattering comparison between the state of general medicine in the early 1900s , before it began to move toward more science - based practice , and today 's practice of psychology .
The authors say such reform is more important now than ever , given the increasing number of people diagnosed with mental disorders .
And they say that increased health costs have both exacerbated the problem -- by shunting more treatment away from trained psychologists toward general medical health settings -- but also make it more important that effective treatments are chosen .
In an accompanying editorial , Columbia University psychologist Walter Mischel calls the report 's analysis and call to action " long overdue " and one that " will be welcomed by those who grieve the widening gulf between clinical practice and scientific progress in psychology . "
Mischel also quotes the late psychologist Paul Meehl as noting " that most clinical psychologists select their methods like kids make choices in a candy store :
They look around , maybe sample a bit , and choose what they like , whatever feels good to them .
For many of us who initially became clinical psychologists because we were inspired by the scientist - practitioner ideal , Meehl ’s comment was as heartbreaking as it was accurate . "

Iran concealed a partially - built second uranium enrichment plant in defiance of calls for transparency over its nuclear plans , US President Barack Obama says .
The US , UK and France said the UN had to be given immediate access and urged tough new sanctions , while Russia also said it was " seriously concerned " .
But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denied that the facility was in breach of IAEA rules .
The Western leaders would regret their statements , he added .
Iran told the UN about the plant on Monday , saying it was not operational yet and would provide nuclear energy .
Tehran has previously acknowledged it has one enrichment plant , at Natanz .
Iran must abandon any military ambitions for its nuclear programme
Gordon Brown
UK Prime Minister
Full text : Leaders ' comments Israel restrained but determined Send us your comments Iran 's decision to build a secret facility represented a " direct challenge to the basic compact " of the global non-proliferation regime , US President Barack Obama said , making a statement in Pittsburgh , where he is hosting a G20 summit .
Despite Iran 's assertions that the facility was for peaceful purposes , the new plant was " not consistent " with that goal , the US president said .
' Line in the sand ' Speaking alongside UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Mr Obama said it was time for Iran to begin meeting its international commitments .
ANALYSIS BBC World Affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds Iranian ambitions for this site are not known .
It could be that they wanted a back - up in case their main plant at Natanz was attacked .
But another fear is that they intended to enrich uranium more highly at the secret plant , to a level suitable for a nuclear explosion .
The discovery will strengthen the demands by the US and its allies for further sanctions to be imposed on Iran unless it suspends all enrichment , as required by the Security Council .
Iran on defensive over secret site " Iran must comply with UN Security Council resolutions and make clear it is prepared to meet its responsibilities as a member of the community of nations , " Mr Obama said .
Tehran would be held accountable for any failure to meet these responsibilities , he said .
Speaking after Mr Obama , the French and British leaders used strong language to insist that Iran would now have to disclose full details of its entire nuclear programme or face new and tougher sanctions .
Gordon Brown stressed that the US , France and UK were " at one " on the issue , and accused the Iranians of " serial deception " .
There was now " no choice but to draw a line in the sand " over the nuclear issue , he said .
" Iran must abandon any military ambitions for its nuclear programme . "
Mr Sarkozy said the situation was a challenge to the entire international community .
" Everything must be put on the table , " the French president said , adding that the world needed to see a " step change " from Iran in the coming months .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , informed of the plant 's existence by Mr Obama this week , said the second plant was against the requirements of UN Security Council resolutions .
Iran must co-operate fully with the UN watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Mr Medvedev said .
China also said Iran should work with the UN watchdog , a foreign ministry spokesman said in Pittsburgh .
Underground plant Speaking in New York , where he has been attending the UN General Assembly , Iran 's President Ahmadinejad struck a defiant tone after the Pittsburgh proclamations .
" It 's not a secret site .
If it was , why would we have informed the IAEA about it a year ahead of time ? " he said .

He insisted Iran was acting within the boundaries of IAEA rules , saying it does not need to inform the agency of any new site until 180 days before any nuclear material is placed within it .
The existence of Iran 's first enrichment plant , at Natanz , was only confirmed after intelligence emerged from Iranian exile groups several years ago .
Western governments are said to have known of the existence of the new enrichment plant for some time .
Mr Obama was first told about it during the " transition " period before he took office in January , officials say .
In Washington , US officials said the Western nations decided to reveal their intelligence assessments when the Iranians realised the plant 's secrecy was compromised .
IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES
Iran insists that all its nuclear facilities are for energy , not military purposes Bushehr : Nuclear power plant Isfahan : Uranium conversion plant Natanz : Uranium enrichment plant , 4,592 working centrifuges , with 3,716 more installed Second enrichment plant : Existence revealed to IAEA in Sept 2009 .
Separate reports say it is near Qom , and not yet operational Arak : Heavy water plant
Key nuclear sites in detail
The new facility is said to be underground at a mountain on the site of a former missile site belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , north - east of the holy city of Qom .
Construction on the facility - believed by the US to be large enough to contain 3,000 centrifuges , not large enough for commercial work - started in earnest in mid-2006 , diplomatic sources said .
Iran 's letter to the UN watchdog , the IAEA , on Monday informed it that " a new pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction " .
Iran told the agency that no nuclear material had been introduced into the plant , and enrichment levels would only be high enough to make nuclear fuel , not a bomb .
In response , the IAEA has requested Iran to " provide specific information and access to the facility as soon as possible " , an IAEA statement adds .
The disclosure of the new plant comes one day after world leaders stressed the need for greater co-operation against nuclear proliferation and shortly before Iran is due to resume talks with international powers on the issue .
Since taking office in January , Mr Obama has told Tehran than he is ready for direct talks on the nuclear issue , but has had no firm response from Iran .
Earlier this month , Tehran agreed to " comprehensive " talks on a range of security issues - but made no mention of its own nuclear programme .
The talks are due to be held in Geneva on 1 October with Tehran and the five permanent UN Security Council members - US , UK , Russia , China and France - plus Germany .

I made something gruesome and delicious .
No , really , it was good .
This is meatloaf .
Meatloaf with cheese on top .
And some ketchup .
The nails are made of onion .
The wrist bones are onion too .
Where are you going ?
This is how I made it :
Since August I ’ve had a post it note over my desk that simply said “ meat hand ” .
I mulled over how to make it for a while .
I realized that the old formed inside a plastic glove thing would n’t work since the fingers would cook so much faster than the rest of the hand .
It was n’t until I saw this hand gelatin mold that I had my plan :
I shot several angles to show how it has a base built in , meaning I could probably use it to mold meatloaf .
I made the basic meatloaf recipe from How to Cook Everything using a food processor to chop the onions and carrot to a very fine mince so I could fill in the details of the mold without trouble .
One meatloaf recipe using 2 pounds of meat will make two hands .
I sprayed the inside of the mold with cooking oil spray and it came out fairly easily .
I put it on top of a rack to allow the fat to run off as it cooked .
I did a few versions , learning as I went along .
Version # 1
The first one was straight meatloaf .
I surrounded it with mashed potatoes and kale ( or brain matter and swamp greens if you have kids , or just act like kids ) .
It looked ok , sort of creepy :
Version # 2
The next time I tried adding fingernails made of onion , which were just like press on nails :
To make the fingernails I sliced a thin round off of a single layer of an onion , then used kitchen scissors to trim it into a nail shape keeping the lines in the onion running the length of the nail .
I kept the thinnest end of the onion slice at the tip of the nail .
( Shown here using a red onion as it ’s easier to see details . )
I also covered it with ketchup before cooking :
It turned out gross :
This time to better define the fingers I piped mashed potatoes around the hand to define the shape .
I just used a ziploc bag with a small corner snipped off to do the detail inbetween fingers , then I snipped off a larger corner to pipe around the hand .
I smoothed down the mashed potatoes with a silicone spatula .
The results where pretty creepy .
Version # 3
The ketchup covered hand made me pretty happy but …
I had this idea .
My mom used to throw a slice of cheese on top of her meatloaf before cooking it and the cheese always turned out browned and crispy .
I wondered how that would work with my relatively delicate hand .
I also had the idea to use the smaller inner layers of the onion to create a cartoon -y wrist bone sticking out .
I made two versions .
The first used white onion and was simply covered in cheese .
The second used red onion and was covered with ketchup and then cheese .
I used slices of provolone cheese because I knew it would n’t slide off completely as it melted .
( Maggi suggested it , thanks Maggi ! )
This time I used the version of meatloaf with spinach , again from How to Cook Everything .
Here are some pre-cooked pictures :
I peeled an onion until I got to the smaller inner layers and simply pressed it into the wrist :
I trimmed the cheese to fit around the fingernails :
If I were to do it again I would have put less cheese around the fingers , or rather , I would have put narrower pieces .
The cheese pooled inbetween the fingers and made it more difficult to diguise later on .
This cheese thing , it worked a bit too well .
We could n’t bring ourselves to actually eat either of them ( though , we had been eating a lot of meatloaf lately ) .
Here is a picture showing them side by side .
They were cooked at the same time and the one with the ketchup beneath the cheese ( white fingernails ) browned a bit more .
You can also see that piping the detail more carefully can make a difference :
The wrist bone of the white onion was pushed out a bit as the meatloaf cooked :
The smaller onion piece of the red onion write bone was n’t as impressive :
The red onion fingernails were creepier , but the white onion fingernails might get the point across more quickly :
Here is a cute pumpkin pancake chaser :
Just in case you need it .
The death knell for freedom has been tolling for some time , and only now are people starting to hear it .
It started tolling faintly , decades back , and has slowly progressed in volume , until today its tolling is impossible to ignore .
“ Therefore , send not to know for whom the bell tolls , It tolls for thee .
” — John Donne ( 1572 -1631 )
“ The common enemy of humanity is man .
In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill .
... The real enemy then is humanity itself .
Democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead . ” — From the Club of Rome ’s “ The First Global Revolution ” p. 71,75 1993
The United States of America — that “ shining city on a hill ” — had a good run of it , and made a gallant effort at establishing liberty for all .
But as the old saw would have it , all good things must come to an end .
Liberty , after all , is an aberration in mankind ’s history — a light that has flared here and there over the centuries , only to dissolve back into the darkness .
America is barreling towards becoming a bit player on the world ’s stage , and its vaunted middle class — once the envy of the world — is on the verge of being eliminated .
For the good of the planet , for the good of Gaia . for the good of the collective .
Freedom is being replaced by servitude , capitalism by socialism , and property rights by “ sustainable development . ”
I ’m not talking about something we need to be on guard against .
It ’s all already in place .
It has been going on for quite some time , and it will continue to go on , at a greatly accelerated pace .
We are at the “ end game ” point .
And the Globalists know it .
Why do you think the Democratic ( and many Republican ) political hacks on Capitol Hill are so dismissive of the American people ?
They are essentially putting on a “ dog and pony show ” for public consumption , while the final pieces for America ’s defeat are slid into place .
No , they are not worried about upcoming free elections .
To a great extent the Globalists own the mass media , the entertainment industry , our schools , and the Judicial , Executive , and Legislative branches of government .
Why should they worry ?
Already , several generations have been indoctrinated , via our school systems , to value globalization and “ social justice , ” over personal responsibility and free enterprise .
They have been repeatedly sold the idea that they should , “ Think globally , act locally . ”
God has been demeaned , marginalized , and eradicated , at every turn .
Our religions are , in many cases , a watered down and diluted mimicry of true spirituality .
The Globalists have come out from the closets , the woodwork , and from under rocks .
They know that their time of hiding is at long last over .
They are brazen about , and proud of , their anti-American / pro-global stance .
Their arrogance and hubris is palpable .
Call them Communists , Marxists , Fascists , or Globalists — call them what you will , they are collectivists who despise America ’s middle class , capitalism , and free enterprise .
They have been duplicitous , Machavellian , clever , and patient .
And it has paid off ; the trap has been sprung .
How did this happen ?
America got hit high , and America got hit low .
We suffered sudden catastrophic sneak attacks from without , and insidious long - term betrayal from within .
We were hit low by Alinskyesque “ community organizers ” in our streets , and propagandists in our schools .
We were hit high by “ think tanks ” like the Trilateral Commission , the CoR ( Club of Rome ) , and the CFR ( Council for Foreign Relations ) .
They have divided us with special interest groups , vociferous “ talking point ” attacks , and identity politics .
They have infiltrated our schools , and indoctrinated our children .
They have opened floodgates using the Cloward - Priven Strategy — overwhelming our judicial system , banking establishment , and border security .
They have encouraged corruption and greed at the lowest , to the highest , levels of government .
They have twisted and perverted the U.S. Constitution .
They have promoted and encouraged anything and everything that would help bring America down .
They intend on taking over the planet , but first they needed to destabilize , and then destroy , the United States of America .
Because we were a powerful bulwark of freedom , we had to go first .
And to a large extent , go we have .
In this article , I will focus on the contributions made by the CoR and Agenda 21 , to America ’s defeat .
The Club of Rome ( CoR ) was founded 1968 , in Italy , by Aurelio Peccei , an Italian scholar and industrialist , and Alexander King , a Scottish scientist .
Over the years the list of its members has included ex-presidents , prime ministers , kings , queens , diplomats , and billionaires .
Its membership roster reads like a “ who ’s who ” of the world ’s “ movers and shakers . ”
It includes U.N. bureaucrats , scientists , economists , and business leaders from around the globe
After its inception , it split into two more branches : The CoB ( Club of Budapest ) , and the CoM ( Club of Madrid ) .
The CoB focuses on social and philosophical issues , while the CoM concentrates on political issues .
In addition , there are over thirty affiliated organizations in other countries — such as the USACoR in America .
The CoR first garnered public attention with its 1972 report “ The Limits to Growth , ” which went on to become the best selling environmentalist book of all time .
Simply stated , its main thesis is that economic growth cannot continue indefinitely , because of the limited availability of natural resources , particularly oil .
It ’s sort of an industrialized version of a Malthusian nightmare .
Twenty years later , the CoR published “ The First Global Revolution ” — a quote from the book appears at the start of this article .
This book also made a big splash , and helped to re-energize and expand the whole environmentalist movement .
Another quote from the book worth keeping in mind is , “ It would seem that humans need a common motivation , namely a common adversary … such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy , either a real one , or else one invented for the purpose … . ”
“ One invented for the purpose . ”
Enter global warming and greenhouse gases .
But something even more important happened the year before “ The First Global Revolution ” came out .
At the instigation of the CoR , and their ilk , in 1992 the United Nations held the Conference on Environment and Development — informally known as the Earth Summit — in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
.
At the Earth Summit , 178 nations signed an agreement called Agenda 21 — so called because it dealt with the United Nation ’s agenda for the 21st century .
It consists of numerous chapters detailing the role that different parts of society should play in implementing “ sustainable development . ”
There are chapters for central governments , local governments , businesses , and community organizations .
George Bush senior , then President of the United States , flew down and committed the United States to the U.N. FCCC ( Framework Convention on Climate Change ) agenda .
Ever since then , the Executive Branch — Republican and Democrat — has been bypassing Congress , and passing “ soft laws ” foisting Agenda 21 on the American public .
Check out the U.S. Department of Energy website .
Check out the U.S. Department of Agriculture website .
Check out the U.S. Department of the Interior website .
No matter where you go , environmentalism permeates the U.S. Government bureaucracy .
Sometimes it ’s blatant and out front ; other times you may need to dig a little — but it ’s always there .
The Agenda 21 Globalists wine and dine each other , and hold conventions and conferences around the world .
They give each other praise , pats on the back , and prestigious awards .
The Norwegian Globalists just gave Obama the Nobel Peace Prize , and for the same reason that they gave one to Al Gore — heavily pushing Agenda 21 .
Gore ’s movie “ An Inconvenient Truth ” also received an Oscar from the Hollywood elite .
These honors have been bestowed on Gore , not for exposing the truth — for “ An Inconvenient Truth ” is merely a slickly packaged lie — but because the film spreads the falsehoods of Agenda 21 so well .
It can only be shown to school children in the U.K. if accompanied by a disclaimer .
The U.K.‘s “ The Daily Mail ” reports that “ ... teachers will have to warn pupils that there are other opinions on global warming , and they should not necessarily accept the views of the film . ”
The Daily Mail also noted that the lawyer who successfully sued to have the disclaimer attached , said it did not go far enough .
“ He said ‘ no amount of turgid guidance ’ could change the fact that the film is unfit for consumption in the classroom . ”
Yet American students see it over , and over .
With no disclaimer .
This past June , NASA said that global warming is caused by solar cycles — i.e. the sun .
Unsaid was the fact that the greenhouse gas theory is full of holes .
Actually it ’s a fairy tale , a convenient lie to force the world to bend to the will of the globalists .
Al Gore , the CoR , the U.N. , and all of the environmental organizations and their adherents , do n’t care what the truth is .
They could care less about what causes global warming .
They have their “ outside enemy … invented for the purpose , ” and they are not about to let go of it .
The Globalists actually tried Global Cooling first , but for various reasons it did n’t fly .
Look at page 22 in the 1974 Annual Rockefeller Report , and you ’ll find the mention of a conference called to investigate “ ... the future implications of the global cooling trend now underway … . ”
Things sure warmed up in a hurry .
So what is the “ purpose ? ”
What ’s really behind all the global warming hoopla ?
Power .
It ’s the same old Marxist / Communist / Fascist collectivist schtick , dressed up in new clothes .
Global warming is all about a power grab by a wealthy elite and their collectivist sycophants — using the U.N. as a cover and tool .
As always , there are numerous “ useful idiots ” who swallow the party line whole .
Some of them are simply misguided idealists , and some of them are nuts — dangerously nuts .
Behind it all , is a relatively small group of people who are manipulating the world for their own sick , narcissistic ends .
It ’s a perfect cover .
Think about it — who does n’t feel that fresh air , clean water , and healthy environments are admirable ends to work towards ?
Any sane person supports such ideals .
But hidden in back of the admirable goals are some diabolical designs .
Do n’t take my word for it , and do n’t dismiss me without research .
We all need to know what ’s headed our way shortly .
If you are n’t aware of these facts already , then educate yourself on the internet .
At least check out The Green Agenda , and check out Freedom Advocates .
What I ’ve been discussing in this article is not “ conspiracy theory ” nonsense — look at those two websites I just mentioned ( maybe watch a Michael Shaw video or two ) , and decide for yourself .
What have we seen since the Obama Administration took over ?
The brainiacs in charge of America ’s finances have been ignoring our debts , and eagerly proposing ways to sink us deeper into the quagmire .
A lot deeper .
At first I thought that they were simply corrupt , venal , self - serving idiots — all of which is undoubtedly true , but they ’re also destroying America ’s financial foundation , cleverly and intentionally .
They want the American dollar replaced by a new global currency .
They want America ’s middle class to hang in the wind , and die on the vine .
They ’re Globalists , and they want America to fail .
It ’s so easy to see , once you realize what ’s going on .
Why else would they add trillions to an already staggering debt ?
Why else would they try to rush through a Cap and Trade bill that will , in Obama ’s words , make electricity prices “ skyrocket . ”
Why else would they try to jam government - run ObamaCare down America ’s throat ?
Why else would Obama say he ’d bankrupt anybody who built a new coal plant ?
Once you grasp Agenda 21 , and the sly machinations of the United Nations , and globalizing NGOs like the CoR , it all makes sense .
It ’s “ The Plan . ” Ruin America ’s economy , destroy her middle class , and put a stranglehold on her energy grid .
At the U.N. Summit at Rio in 1992 , the Conference Secretary - General , Maurice Strong , said “ Is n’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialized civilization collapse ?
Is n’t it our responsibility to bring that about ? ”
He also said , “ Current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class — involving high meat intake , the use of fossil fuels , electrical appliances , home and workplace air - conditioning , and suburban housing — are not sustainable . ”
Club of Rome member , multi-billionaire George Soros , echoed Strong ’s statement last fall , when he told an Australian newspaper , “ America , as the center of the globalized financial markets , was sucking up the savings of the world .
This is now over .
The game is out , ’ he said , adding that the time has come for ‘ a very serious adjustment ’ in American ’s consumption habits . ”
We will be forced to do their will .
Count on it .
Forced to cut back on fossil fuel consumption .
Forced to cut back on water usage .
Forced to give up our property .
Forced to eat less .
Forced to warm or cool our homes less .
Forced to give up driving .
Forced to give up these , and many other things that we currently take for granted .
It ’s “ The Plan ” — you had better believe it .
Look at what ’s happening to California ’s Central Valley — once “ the world ’s breadbasket , ” and now a dust bowl .
All due to Agenda 21 .
I assure you that the globalists will not help the farmers .
As the saying goes , “ You ca n’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs . ”
The globalists want the land unplowed .
They want it to go “ back to nature . ”
They want to increase the price of food .
They want to ruin the middle class farming community .
It ’s all part of “ The Plan . ”
It is not just America this is happening to , of course .
Australia , Great Britain , Japan , Canada , Germany …
Every country is on the verge of being converted into a vassal state — part of a global hegemony run by the U.N and a power elite .
All this will be more easily accomplished with a greatly reduced population .
Did I mention population reduction and control ?
Behind all the warm and fuzzy terminology about “ smart growth , ” “ sustainable development , ” and “ think green , ” lies a very chilling fact .
The Agenda 21 folks want to reduce the earth ’s population — substantially .
In 1996 , Club of Rome member and CNN founder , Ted Turner , told Audubon magazine , “ A total population of 250- 300 million people , a 95 % decline from present levels , would be ideal . ” A 95 % reduction .
Recently he has said that getting rid of a mere two thirds of the world ’s population would suffice .
Getting mellow in his old age no doubt .
The hard - core environmentalists are all bio-centrists .
That is , they believe that humanity is no more important than any other species on this planet .
In fact , to hear them tell it , the world would be much better off without any people at all .
Anthropologist and anarchist David Graber put it like this in an L.A .
Times book review , “ Human happiness , and certainly human fecundity , are not as important as a wild and healthy planet .
...
We have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the Earth .
... Until such time as Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature , some of us can only hope for the right virus to come along . ”
Talk about joie de vivre , huh ?
Speaking of virus , do n’t you find it a little odd that the U.N’s WHO ( World Health Organization ) is making such a big deal out of what is essentially a run-of - the - mill flu ?
And the lame stream media goes right along with them .
Given the Globalist penchant for population reduction , I ’m much more leery of the U.N. ‘s vaccines , than the flu .
But that ’s just me .
At any rate , because these Globalists are bio-centrists , most of them do n’t believe in a divine spark in man , or unalienable rights , or God for that matter .
In short , they do n’t have many qualms about killing people .
Something else to keep in mind .
You know the sardonic comment “ Well excuse me for breathing ? ”
These people will take that statement literally — and probably wo n’t excuse you .
After all , you ’re adding to the earth ’s carbon dioxide level every time you breath out .
ICLEI ( Local Governments for Sustainability — I know , do n’t ask ) even has a personal Co2 calculator you can use .
ICLEI ( pronounced “ ick - lee ” ) believes you should know , and of course want to know , the amount of “ your yearly direct personal carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions . ”
To which I say , directly and personally , “ Get lost , ” or words to that effect .
My favorite eco-friendly slogan is “ Save the Planet — Kill Yourself . ”
There ’s something deeply disturbed , and disturbing , about too many of these folks , if you ask me .
For example , Yale professor and eco-nut , Lamont Cole , is of the opinion that “ To feed a starving child is to exacerbate the world population problem . ”
Jesus wept .
You should do yourself a favor and peruse the quotes on Free Republic ’s “ So you ’re an environmentalist … ” web - page .
If you do n’t come away convinced that most of these folks are nuttier than a “ Payday ” candy bar , then I do n’t know what to tell you .
Maybe — “ Get a life ? ”
Many of these “ useful idiots ” may be crazy and harmless , but they can also be crazy and deadly .
Behind them , pulling the strings , and waiting to take over , are the Global Elite and their one world government .
Do you honestly think that America will last as a free republic until the 2012 presidential elections ?
I do n’t think it will last until the 2010 elections .
Iran ’s leadership is aching to nuke Israel , and Israel ’s only going to wait so long before taking preemptive measures .
And there goes a large chunk of America ’s oil supply .
Long lines for gas — if you can get any at all .
America ’s power grid will flicker , and intermittently fail .
Time for the Globalists to make their final moves .
The curtain falls .
So America goes down the drain on our watch .
It ’s nothing to be proud of , that ’s for sure .
Is there no hope then ?
If there are still enough patriotic Americans who value personal integrity and freedom — there ’s a chance we can still turn this thing around , but it wo n’t be easy .
Far from it .
Make no mistake , if we lose this one , America and the world will sink into an abyss of tyranny for a very , very long time .
Laus Deo .

Construction began in 1817 and took eight years , thousands of workers , and $ 7.1 million to complete .
Solving engineering problems required sheer genius , and involved draining swamps , constructing aqueducts , making cement that hardened underwater , clearing forests , and building the massive locks .
When finished , “ Clinton ’s Ditch ” covered 363 miles , was about 40 feet wide and four feet deep , and rose 573 feet through a series of 83 locks .
When the waterway opened , in 1825 , it unlocked the floodgates to western settlement .
Even though within decades it would be eclipsed by the railway , the Erie Canal was an important — and cheap — mode of transporting goods across the state for more than a century .
The canal has been enlarged several times , and today looks like a languid river .
In many places it runs parallel to or completely obscures the original canal , which had towpaths on either side so mules could pull barges through the murky water .
Every so often I ’d spy what looked like Roman ruins made of limestone block — a bit of the old canal .
Cutting through farm fields , forests , and the outskirts of towns , the canal is used mainly by recreational boaters and state barges , and fishermen .
People fish from chairs bolted to flat - bottomed bass boats , and from rickety wooden docks jutting into the water .
At every opening in the lush vegetation along the shore , chairs face the water : plastic chairs , wooden chairs , Adirondack chairs , lounge chairs , kitchen chairs , and overturned buckets .
As the Cayuga sliced through the green water , spotted sandpipers ran along the stony banks .
Great blue herons stood on snags and docks and took off with slow flaps when I came too close .
Families of Canada geese — mother and father on either end with goslings in between — made forays into the canal .
Red - tailed hawks , ospreys , and turkey vultures flew overhead .
Belted kingfishers hunted from branches hanging over the water .
In one four - mile stretch along Montezuma — a malarial swamp during the canal ’s construction and now a national wildlife refuge — eight bald eagles , including one adult and two young birds in a nest atop a high - tension pole , considered my passing .
Toward dusk , metallic - blue barn swallows with orange bellies swooped and dived in front of the boat , hunting for insects .
The Cayuga ’s top cruising speed is 5.6 mph , not much more than the canal ’s original speed limit of 4 mph .
Each lock — and there were often several in a day ’s journey — could take up to 40 minutes to navigate .
Upon approach , I would radio the lockmaster and let him know whether I needed east - or westbound passage .
Then I would control the Cayuga while the water rushed in or out through valves in the lock ’s floor .
When given the green light , I would pull the boat into the lock , place her along the cement sidewall ( a feat with a boat that acts like a bath toy because it has no keel ) , and grab hold of a weighted line that ran down the side of the lock — slick with ooze from the canal water and sometimes covered with zebra mussels , the scourge of the Great Lakes .
Huge metal gates would slowly shut behind me , and the lock would either fill or empty .
The Cayuga might rise only six feet or , in the case of the double lock at Seneca Falls , the height of a five - story building .
Online .
Kicking and punching cold , invisible opponents you 'll never see , you 'll never meet .
Alex Valle is a Street Fighter II player living in a Street Fighter IV world .
And he 's ready to kick your ass .

" Arcades are where you can truly level up your game against many opponents with no lag issues or rage - quitters , " Valle says .
" Maybe those rage - quitters can still leave mid-match and cause a scene or something .
Playing online on a console is more of a tool for execution and strategy . "
In short : Play online if you want to practice , play in arcades if you want to fight .
Advertisement
As with most in his generation , the 31 year - old Valle came of age when online home console gaming was n't event a glint in SEGA 's eye , an age American arcades got golden again .
Players slapped down stacks of quarters and could find SFII cabinets anywhere the things could fit — not only the obvious slick carpet - covered arcades , but also dingy laundromats and musty corners in gas stations .
" I 'm an arcade gamer , " says Valle , " so I was used to playing the arcade version of whatever fighting game there was available . "
And that means , playing at a stand - up cabinet , standing next to your opponent .
" Back in the 90s you either played sports , decked out your car , or played Street Fighter II , " says competitive fighting champ Valle .
And some , like Valle , played SFII like it was a sport .
Valle would walk into arcades with his gelled hair and wife - beater tee and other players would whisper , " Hey , it 's that Ryu guy . "
When he was n't getting kicked out for winning too much , Valle was drawing crowds — first in local tournaments , and then in national and international ones .
Street Fighter was the game he started playing competitively , and not just in arcades against punters , but against the best of the best .
Players needed guts of iron .
Way back in ' 96 , Valle put himself on the map with his fight at Southern Hills Golfland arcade with rival John Choi at the B3 : Battle By The Bay , the unofficial West Coast Street Fighter Alpha 2 arcade grand championship .
Two years , at the SFA3 World Tournament , Valle went head - to - head against Daigo Umehara ( yes , that Daigo ) in Daigo 's first international fight .

Before he went on to dominate to tournament scene between 1996 - 2001 , a young Valle first cut his teeth on early arcade fighter Karate Champ .
It was n't until later that he began seriously playing titles like Street Fighter II , Virtua Fighter and Tekken .
Born in Lima , Peru and raised in Los Angeles , Valle recalls his home country in context of gaming : " I went back to Peru around my 13th birthday , just around the time Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition was released .
Only thing I remember from Peru was that I gave up my old - school first - gen Gameboy to my cousin . "

Valle excelled at more than fighters — platformers , sports games , whatever .
But it was playing against others and playing against others in arcades that kept drawing him to the genre .
" I love fighters because of the different styles of competition and the satisfaction of winning more matches than anybody in any given day , " says Valle .
" Life is good when you made that guy break another 5 dollar bill in the quarter machine . "
His style was and still is aggressive .
Aggressive and relentless .
Relentless and brutal .
" Almost instantly , Valle understands your game , and from there he gets inside your head and just violates you , " says Seth Killian , long time Valle pal and resident Street Fighter expert at Capcom .
" While some other top players would hang back and try and grind you down , he pioneered his own ' rushdown ' style , where he was on you so fast , and in so many different ways , you were constantly on the defensive .
While you were trying to figure out what just happened , he was on you again with a new setup , so his opponents would really just fall apart .
It 's paralyzing . "
Valle explains , " There is n't much time to think when the game starts , so my strategy involves overwhelming my opponent before they can adapt . "

As the 1990s drew to a close , more and more arcades fell by the wayside .
Home console kept gaming in the living room .
" Our beloved Southern Hills Golfland closed down as well as a lot of other arcades soon after , " Valle recalls .
" Competition was very rare to find and no new games to play either . "
While Valle initially had slight difficulty in adjusting to playing fighters on consoles ( " I 'm an arcade gamer , " he points out ) , he 's completed the transition and plays Street Fighter IV on Xbox LIVE Arcade evenings after his day job at an MMO company doing Spanish QA and web functionality for our game portals .
He 's not simply blowing off steam from a day at the office , and these sessions are less " playing " and more " training " for the upcoming EVO Championship Series in Las Vegas this July .
Valle enters EVO , because of his history with the tourney — it goes way back to when it was the B series .
" EVO also knows how to cater to fighting game community better than any organization out there , " he says .
" Plus , EVO is the hardest tournament to place in the US as a national tournament . "

As American arcades have diminished and declined , the gap between consoles and arcade hardware has closed .
" Console and arcade versions used to be vastly different back in the day , " Choi says .
" But that is no longer the case today and arcade and console ports are 99 % accurate for the most part . "
The usual gameplay differences , Choi continues , are due to the hardware processing speed and minor bugs .
" General gameplay is usually the same . "
Advertisement
General gameplay , but not arcade gameplay .
They 're different , and anyone who has played both knows it .
" I 'm just fortunate to have grown up at a time where fighting game competition was at every corner , " Valle says .
" The experience from crushing my opponents on a 2 - player , side by side arcade cabinet far outweighs online gaming . "
According to Valle , the younger generation will take time to overcome that type of pressure from playing someone up close and personal .
" Sometimes the best chance of winning is the presence of confidence rather than the skill at hand . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A court - appointed trustee sued the brother , sons and a niece of imprisoned fraudster Bernard Madoff on Friday for $ 198 million , accusing them of milking the family - run business while they were executives of the firm .
Bernard Madoff walks back to his apartment in New York in this December 17 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton / Files
“ The Family Members were completely derelict in duties and responsibilities .
As a result , they either failed to detect or failed to stop the fraud , thereby enabling and facilitating the Ponzi scheme , ” trustee Irving Picard said in the lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York .
“ Simply put , if the Family Members had been doing their jobs honestly and faithfully the Madoff Ponzi scheme might never have succeeded , or continued for so long . ”
He alleged that a total of $ 198,743,299 of customer money was misappropriated by Madoff ’s brother Peter , sons Mark and Andrew and niece Shana ; all were officers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in New York .
The lawsuits are civil actions and none of the family members has been criminally charged .
Each dismissed Picard ’s allegations as baseless ; they said they had “ no prior knowledge ” of Bernard Madoff ’s crimes .
Madoff , 71 , was arrested last December and told the FBI he had confessed to his sons that he orchestrated a worldwide , decades - long , multibillion dollar fraud .
He is serving a 150 - year prison sentence after pleading guilty in March to the scam involving as much as $ 64.8 billion , a Ponzi scheme in which early investors were paid with money from new clients .
His wife , Ruth Madoff , was sued in July for $ 44.8 million by Picard , whose team of lawyers is working to find as much money as possible to return to the thousands of people bilked in Wall Street ’s biggest investment fraud .
Madoff ’s brother Peter was chief compliance officer at the company .
He was also a director , manager , and shareholder of Madoff Securities International Ltd in London .
Sons Mark and Andrew each worked at their father ’s firm for about 20 years and held the titles of co-heads of trading .
The sons were also owners and directors of the London branch .
Shana Madoff was a lawyer at the firm with responsibilities to ensure that it met its legal and regulatory obligations .
Nine months after the spectacular fraud unraveled in the declining economy , the trustee has recovered $ 1.5 billion so far under the Securities Investor Protection Act ; but his lawyers expect to collect more over time .
The case is Irving Picard , Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC v Peter Madoff et al 09-01503 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ( Manhattan )
A disbarred Florida lawyer who has been vocal in his opposition to violent video games sued Facebook this week over comments on the social networking site that he considers to be a threat to his personal safety .
Facebook said it would contest the suit in court .
A disbarred Florida lawyer who has been vocal in his opposition to violent video games sued Facebook this week over comments on the social networking site that he considers to be a threat to his personal safety .
Facebook said it would contest the suit in court .
Jack Thompson said that Facebook groups calling for users to smack him in the face for $ 50 or to hit him with an Atari game system have caused him great harm and distress , and he is seeking $ 40 million in damages from the social networking site .
Thompson made headlines in 2005 after he appeared on " 60 Minutes " and called video game series " Grand Theft Auto " a " murder stimulator . "
Thompson was being interviewed about Devin Moore , who murdered three men and later referenced video games in his confession .
" But for the video - game training , he would not have done what he did , " Thompson said of Moore at the time .
Soon after his appearance , Thompson said he started receiving threats online , over the phone , and in person .
One teenager was jailed after calling Thompson 's home and threatening to kill and castrate him .
In September 2008 , Thompson was disbarred by the Supreme Court of Florida for obstruction and submitting false evidence , among other things .
According to court documents filed with a Florida district court , Thompson last month became aware of anti-Jack Thompson groups on Facebook , like " Jack Thompson should be removed from the populace " and " Jack Thompson should be smacked across the face with an Atari 2600 . "
Thompson said he sent a fax to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg twice in August and again in September asking Zuckerberg to remove the offending material .
Thompson claims Facebook refused to accept or acknowledge the faxes .
He filed suit on September 29 .
" This conduct by Facebook constitutes a willful and wanton disregard of the rights and safety of plaintiff and warrants an award of punitive damages against Facebook , " according to Thompson 's suit .
" This suit is without merit and we will fight it vigorously , " a Facebook spokesman said .
" Additionally , it is our practice to remove content that threatens an individual when it is brought to our attention . "
Facebook said it has repeatedly asked Thompson to point to specific content that he would like removed , but until now , he has been unwilling or unable to do so .
Thompson disputed Facebook 's account .
" Facebook never contacted me in any fashion , " Thompson wrote in an e-mail .
Eric Goldman , an associate professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and director of the High Tech Law Institute , said Thompson has no case .
" Thompson has absolutely no chance holding Facebook liable for these user postings , " Goldman said in an e-mail .
Facebook is immunized from liability by a section of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 that says
Web sites are not liable for user - supplied content , Goldman said .
" It does n't matter if Facebook receives notice of a problem and fails to act , or if Facebook has acted in similar situations and has n't acted here , " he continued .
" Regardless of any of these facts , [ the Telecom Act ] says that Facebook categorically is n't liable . "
Looking at the groups in context , " I think it 's pretty clear that these posts are not intended to be taken seriously , " Goldman said .
" The more interesting question is why Facebook has n't voluntarily taken down the groups nonetheless .
Facebook is n't legally compelled to do so , but it 's certainly within its prerogative to do so . "
Parry Aftab , a lawyer and executive director of WiredSafety.org , questioned why Thompson chose to contact Facebook via fax .
" With a site that has 300 million users you do n't send a fax to the CEO  not if you 're dealing in good faith , " Aftab said .
" If he really was legitimately wanting to have that taken down , he should 've reported it to Facebook [ electronically ] . "
" I chose to go to the CEO because he's in charge , " Thompson responded .
" The company got the information from me , obviously , and they chose to do nothing , thinking I would go away .
I did not . "
To report abuse , Facebook has small " report " links on comments within groups , and it allows users to also report the administrators of groups by clicking a similar link on their profiles .
Editor 's Note :
This story was updated at 10 am Eastern time Friday with additional comment from Thompson .
An analysis of the search terms revealed that the Beatles have outshined Jesus in terms of popularity on the Google search engine .
During September , more people searched the rock band on Google than Jesus , the son of God .
However , during the past twelve - month period more people searched for the son of God as compared to rock band .
It is worth mentioning here that over 40 years back late Beatle , John Lennon was slammed by Christians for claiming that his Beatle rock band was more popular than Jesus .
In 1966 , John Lennon had told the Evening Standard , " I do not know what will go first , rock 'n 'roll or Christianity … we 're more popular than Jesus now . "
The Guardian was the first to publish the report .

Morrissey triumphed at the Royal Albert Hall in London last night , just three days after he collapsed with breathing difficulties in Swindon .
Receiving a phenomenal reception as he walked on , Morrissey launched into set opener ' This Charming Man ' , the only song of the set at the Swindon Oasis Leisure Centre before he was taken ill .
After successfully getting through the track , Morrissey joked to the sell - out crowd : " Fasten your seatbelts , it is going to be a bumpy ride " Energetic and looking a picture of health , the 50 - year - old dipped into a set mixed with B - sides , solo favourites and Smiths classics .
Shortly after performing fourth track , Morrissey joked “ Thank you Swindon ! ” and later said “ the doctor said I should n't smile , and I told him I usually do n't ” .

Barney Frank Submits Bid to Delay UIGEA
With implementation of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) approaching on the calendar , the efforts to delay that implementation are becoming more frequent and forceful .
The latest salvo from the pro-poker side : A letter from Barney Frank ( D - MA ) to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , co-signed by 18 Congressmen , requesting that their agencies delay implementation of the proposed UIGEA rules .
Frank ’s letter follows a similar letter issued by a broad coalition of groups opposed to the UIGEA , including the Poker Players Alliance and American Greyhound Track Operators Association .
That letter argued that implementation should be delayed for logistical reasons , claiming that the amount of institutions that would be unable to comply with the rules would essentially render them ineffective .
Frank ’s letter makes a similar point , and goes on to argue that the current economic crisis makes supplementation of the rules uniquely inadvisable .
With financial institutions already facing challenges , Frank posits , subjecting them to the additional burden compliance with UIGEA represents will drain resources that need to be focused elsewhere .
What ’s the issue for banks ?
Basically , the UIGEA forces them to block certain transactions , but the type of transactions that should be blocked are far from clear .
Banks have to sort through a complex web of laws and a dynamic industry that will constantly be searching for ways to circumvent the regulations .
Frank ’s letter does n’t represent anything binding , but it does place pressure on Treasury to ensure that compliance with the rules is not only feasible , but also wo n’t result in any unnecessary economic harm .

Williams chief Frank Williams says his team must make an " imminent " decision on its engine plans for the 2010 season .
Williams , currently using Toyota engines , was believed to be interested in a deal with Renault , but a possible agreement was delayed by the French squad 's involvement in the race - fixing scandal .
Now the Grove team is still considering its options , but Williams has made it clear that , from a technical point of view , the decision must be made very soon .
" You 've got to get on with it and make up our minds - it must be imminent , " said Williams .
" It 's a technical choice and it requires a thorough vetting and consideration period by Patrick [ Head ] and Sam [ Michael ] plus some negotiations by Adam [ Parr ] once it 's decided .
" We have to hurry up because we do n't want to get behind on designing our car . "
When asked if people get excited at the idea of Williams - Renault , the team boss said : " Absolutely . "
Williams also suggested Cosworth was still possibility .
" Cosworth is an independent company .
The warmth that a manufacturer 's engine provides is a useful feeling , " he said .
Red Bull boss Christian Horner said his team , using Renault power units , was in a similar situation .
" We 're in a situation where we need to get off the fence in the relatively near future , but nothing is fixed at this point in time , " Horner said .
Happy Halloween , dear readers !
I kinda figured I needed to post something Halloween related , so I stupidly decided to postpone the almost completed strip I originally had for today , and instead make this one from scratch only hours before deadline .

The Galleon hedge fund fraud , the largest insider trading scandal in US history , has had a fallout in India with McKinsey Director Anil Kumar , one of the six accused in the case , being asked to step down voluntarily from the board of Hyderabad - based Indian School of Business ( ISB ) today .
Kumar has been director on the board of ISB , which is affiliated to Wharton , Kellogg and London School of Business , for four or five years .
Confirming the decision of the board , which is headed by Rajat Gupta , a senior partner of McKinsey & Co , ISB ’s current dean Ajit Rangnekar told Business Standard , “ The board is scheduled to meet in January .
Anil Kumar has asked for leave of absence for the board meeting .
It is up to the board to decide .
I am not a board member .
There is no communication to me personally from Anil Kumar . ”
Agencies report that Kumar , 51 , was also on a leave of absence from McKinsey , a spokeswoman said .
She said the firm “ was looking into the matter urgently . ”
Kumar was permitted to be released on a $ 5 million bond by the US District Court in Manhattan .
Asked whether the B - school would review governance standards , Rangnekar described the incident involving Kumar as a “ stray ” one , adding that the B - school was not responsible for it .
This , however , marks the second time in less than a year that a senior ISB member has been associated with a financial scandal .
Earlier this year , Rammohan Rao had to resign as ISB ’s dean after Ramalinga Raju , founder of Satyam Computers , confessed to a long - term multi-crore accounting fraud .
Rao was a director on the Satyam board at the time and stepped down along with other board members , including leading management consultant Krishna Paleppu , amidst questions over the role of independent directors on corporate boards .
Rao has also chaired the meeting of the Satyam board in December 2008 when the company had decided to acquire Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties , the two companies run by Raju ’s family members , a decision that was reversed following strong shareholder protest .
He was , however , not informed when the acquisition deal was called off .
Rao later resigned as the dean of ISB voluntarily as the ramifications of the Satyam scandal unfolded in quick succession .
Rao ’s action has been stated to have aimed at upholding the prestige of the premier institution but the latest episode of Kumar ’s involvement in another corporate fraud is likely to cast a shadow on a B - school that aimed to set new standards in management education in India .
PITTSBURGH ( AP )  Cincinnati Reds fan Charles Trimble may consider switching his allegiance to Pittsburgh 's team after bystanders at a Pirates game helped save his life .
The 60 - year - old Trimble suffered cardiac arrest during a Pirates - Reds game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on Aug. 23 .
After he slumped over in his seat , a doctor sitting nearby began CPR .
Stadium staff grabbed a portable defibrillator , and a nurse and emergency medical technician in the crowd also helped out .
Trimble , who lives in the northwestern Pennsylvania town of Corry , was still recovering in a Pittsburgh hospital Tuesday .
He was in good spirits -- and wore a Pirates cap .
But Trimble says he 's still a Reds fan at heart .

This morning 's Washington Post 's account of Stanley McChrystal 's Afghanistan review is n't very surprising .
We already knew that McChrystal sees the Taliban as a formidable enemy and thinks the U.S. needs an ambitious coutinerinsurgency to succeed .
What is striking is the back - and - forth , by means of background quotes , between the White House and the Pentagon in the Post 's accompanying analysis piece .
In the wake of the tainted Afghan elections , Barack Obama sounds increasingly wary about a major escalation in America 's support for a government widely seen as illegitimate ( not to mention corrupt ) .
Important people in the White House , including Joe Biden , understand that you can't wage a winning counterinsurgency on behalf of a broadly distrusted government .
( For more on Biden see my print story this week , not yet online ) .
But the military establishment obviously wants to proceed , and is increasinly relying on press leaks to pressure the Obama team to deliver the boots .
Here 's the most vivid example from the Post :
But Obama 's deliberative pace -- he has held only one meeting of his top national security advisers to discuss McChrystal 's report so far -- is a source of growing consternation within the military .
" Either accept the assessment or correct it , or let 's have a discussion , " one Pentagon official said .
" Will you read it and tell us what you think ? "
Within the military , this official said , " there is a frustration .
A significant frustration .
A serious frustration . "
And from the White House , we get this irritated retort :
The president , one adviser said , is " taking a very deliberate , rational approach , starting at the top " of what he called a " logic chain " that begins with setting objectives , followed by determining a methodology to achieve them .
Only when the first two steps are completed , he said , can the third step -- a determination of resources -- be taken .
UPDATE : A Huffington Post report Friday indicates that Democrats believe they are one or two votes shy of having a filibuster - proof majority to pass a public health insurance option .
More here .
The names of those who are n’t on board for a filibuster is unknown , but at least one senator ’s office — that of Florida Sen.
Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) , would n’t say how the senator will vote .

Support for including some version of a public option in the Senate ’s version of a healthcare overhaul appears to be solider than initially believed .
In a series of comments that have received little attention , conservative Democratic senators — even those who ’ve publicly said they oppose a public option — say they are unlikely to join a Republican filibuster to block it .
Under Senate rules , Democrats would need to convince 60 members to support the ability to vote on healthcare legislation with the public option ( cloture ) , and then just 51 to pass it .
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) told a reporter earlier this week that she would n’t join Republicans in voting against cloture .
“ I ’m not right now inclined to support any filibuster , ” Landrieu said .
“ For the Republican Party to kind of step out of the game is very unfortunate , ” she added , referring to the Senate Republicans ’ intransigence on healthcare reform proposals .
“ I ’m not going to be joining people that do n’t want progress . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Indeed , Landrieu ’s sentiment — that joining foes of healthcare reform would be an impediment to progress — may be the catnip that keeps Democrats on board .
Sen. Mark Pryor ( R - AR ) , a moderate Democrat from the South , said Thursday he was open to some form of a government - run health insurance competitor .
“ It depends on how it ’s structured on whether I can support it , ” Pryor remarked .
“ I just have n’t decided . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But regardless of how he votes on the final package , he says he wo n’t join Republicans in filibustering the bill .
Tellingly , he also signaled that he did n’t believe any other Democrats would either .
“ I do n’t think you ’ll see me or any other Democrats do that , ” Pryor told liberal blogger Mike Stark .
ADVERTISEMENT
One conservative Democrat refused to tip his hand .
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) occasionally joins Republicans on controversial issues .
“ I believe in playing chess , but that ’s about three moves ahead of me , and I ’m not prepared to make those moves until I see some other moves in between , ” Nelson told a reporter this week .
Jake Thompson , Nelson ’s Communications Director , told Raw Story that he “ would decline to comment ” about how Nelson will react to a potential Republican filibuster .
ADVERTISEMENT
Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) has said he ’ll support a public option as well .
Specter defected from the Republican Party to the Democrats earlier this year , against the backdrop of a tough primary challenge from his right .
In an interview Thursday evening with MSNBC’s Ed Schultz ( video below ) , he sounded confident that Democrats had the 60 votes to prevail .
“ We have 60 votes without Sen .
Snowe , so we can still invoke cloture and move to a vote on the public option , ” Specter said .
“ With 50 votes plus the Vice President and my vote is going to be for the public option , robust public option , we can get it passed , even without Sen.
Snowe .
I hope we have her , but we may be able to do it without her . ”
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) was the only Republican to join ranks with Democrats in approving a version of healthcare legislation that passed through the Senate Finance Committee .
That version did n’t include a public option .
That said , Democrats need lose only one member to lose the battle for the public option .
A 60 - vote majority would also need to include independent Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , who ’s tangled with Democrats on various issues in the past .
ADVERTISEMENT
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) wo n’t say how many votes he has in his arsenal on a government run plan .
In a statement Thursday evening , he said only that he was looking to pass a bill with as many votes as possible .
“ We ’ll continue to work together to seek broad consensus on the key issues before us and to craft the strongest possible bill that can garner 60 votes , ” Reid said .
“ We will also continue to do our best to represent the views of all members of the Senate who have a genuine desire to see reform succeed .
But our mission is clear : the American people want quality , affordable health insurance and failure is not an acceptable option .
I am optimistic that we are close to laying a proposal before the full Senate that will do just that . ”
In the House , some version of a public option is almost certain to pass .
The version will likely be more liberal than that of the Senate ’s , as Democrats hold a larger majority in the lower chamber .
President Obama ’s position on the public option remains unclear .
A Politico report Friday said that Obama prefers a “ trigger option , ” under which a public insurer would only be created if private insurers fail to meet key pricing standards .
The White House , however , says Obama has n’t taken a position either way .

There is a request for 40,000 US troops for Afghanistan US Senator John Kerry has said it would be irresponsible to send more US troops to Afghanistan before the result of the presidential election there is clear .
Mr Kerry 's comments came as foreign officials pressed Afghan President Hamid Karzai to accept that he might have to face a run-off .
A fraud investigation is expected to bring Mr Karzai 's vote count below the 50 % needed to avoid a second round .
Washington is debating a request for 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan .
Gen Stanley McChrystal , the US and Nato commander in the country , recommended sending the extra troops as the US reviewed its strategy .
US and international troops are fighting resurgent Taliban forces in Afghanistan , an effort that observers say has been complicated by uncertainty over the 20 August election .
' Good governance '
In comments to CNN to be broadcast on Sunday , Mr Kerry advised against a troop increase before the result of the vote was clear .
AFGHAN FRAUD ALLEGATIONS 13 Oct : Karzai casts doubt on fair functioning of ECC , but his opponents accuse him of manufacturing his concerns 30 Sep : UN recalls envoy Peter Galbraith following row over the vote recount process 15 Sep : ECC chief says 10 % of votes need to be recounted 8 Sep : IEC says votes from 600 polling stations " quarantined " 3 Sep : Claims 30,000 fraudulent votes cast for Karzai in Kandahar 30 Aug : 2,000 fraud allegations are probed ; 600 deemed serious 20 Aug : Election day and claims 80,000 ballots were filled out fraudulently for Karzai in Ghazni 18 Aug : Ballot cards sold openly and voter bribes offered
Election : Main fraud allegations
In an interview from the Afghan capital , Kabul , the senator said it would be " entirely irresponsible " for US President Barack Obama to commit more troops " when we do n't even have an election finished and know who the president is " .
" When our own ... commanding general tells us that a critical component of achieving our mission here is , in fact , good governance , and we 're living with a government that we know has to change and provide it , how could the president responsibly say , ' Oh , they asked for more , sure , here they are ? ' " he said .
Mr Kerry , who chairs the US Senate 's foreign relations committee , was one of several senior international figures in Kabul this weekend meeting Afghan leaders .
Initial results from August 's election gave Mr Karzai 55 % of the votes , with his nearest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , getting 28 % .
Hamid Karzai is said to be angry at the prospect of facing a run-off
But the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) launched an investigation into the vote following allegations of widespread electoral fraud .
It will report to the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , which could adjust the final tally , bringing Mr Karzai 's vote total below 50 % and triggering a run-off .
Officials say Mr Karzai is furious over the prospect of facing a second round , threatening to delay or block attempts to hold a second round .
He has refused to accept the ECC 's findings before they are released .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown telephoned the main candidates on Friday , urging Mr Karzai to accept the findings of the ECC 's fraud investigations .
The French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner was also in Kabul to meet Mr Karzai and Mr Abdullah .
The ECC had been expected to announce its findings on Saturday .
But the reported confrontation with Mr Karzai may delay the official announcement of results .

Guys in the barbershop are gassing about quarterback Charlie Conerly as if some skinny cat tossing the pigskin is more important than a fullback going straight up the middle .
Mark my words , it will be the end of football 's popularity if this forward - pass fad catches on .
There is even a rumor -- I wish there were some way of checking rumors , other than sending mimeographed questionnaires by mail -- that a high school coach in Ohio named Glenn Ellison just debuted a formation he calls " the spread . "
There are four wide receivers , no tight end , no fullback , and the quarterback stands far back behind the center !
This will never catch on , of course .
Three - yards - and - a - cloud - of - dust always will dominate football .
Still , the very idea of four wide receivers is upsetting to Tuesday Morning Quarterback -- which now arrives in the mail on Saturday afternoon .

ABC will televise the new upstart American Football League .
With one NFL game on NBC each Sunday and another on CBS , if there 's also a game on ABC , that means three pro football games on TV in the same week !
Add the one college game , and that 's four televised football games weekly .
Plus , ABC says it 's going to bring two complete camera crews to each game , instead of the standard one fixed midfield camera .
Good golly Miss Molly !
Football on television has reached nirvana -- it can't get any better than this .
If only my set 's rabbit ears would bring in CBS .

Besides Monday night 's throwback doubleheader on " Monday Night Football , " there are nine more contests this season in which both teams will wear throwback uniforms , led by New England , which will wear its throwbacks four times -- four outings for Pat , the guy in the Minuteman duds hiking the ball on the old Boston Patriots ' helmet .
Tennessee 's throwback helmet , from the franchise 's days as the Houston Oilers , features an oil derrick -- quite a logo for a squad called the Titans .
Regrettably , the Dallas Cowboys will not appear dressed as the Dallas Steers , the team 's original name .
The Jets ' original name was the " Titans of New York . "
Maybe today they should be the " Jets of New Jersey . "
The Oct. 11 Cowboys at Chiefs game is Dallas at Dallas in throwback terms , since the Chiefs began as the Texans .
The Sept. 27 Titans at Jets contest is Oilers at Titans in throwback terms .
The Nov. 15 Bills at Titans game is Bills at Oilers in throwback terms -- so if Buffalo falls behind 35 - 3 , do n't turn it off !
Last week on " The Brian Kenny Show , " I said I like Colts versus Saints for the Super Bowl .
( This season , TMQ will be on ESPN News on Tuesday afternoons and on Kenny 's show Tuesday evenings . )
That was my thinking - based prediction , and thus sure to be wrong .
Traditionally , Tuesday Morning Quarterback proposes that the team goin ' to Disney World will be one that does not appear on " Monday Night Football . "
This year 's Monday night shutouts are Cincinnati , Detroit , Jacksonville , Kansas City , Seattle , St. Louis and Tampa .
An unimposing group to be sure , but if the league braintrust thinks they will all be bad , one is sure to be good .
Therefore , once again , I predict the Super Bowl winner will come from among the teams not on " Monday Night Football . "
I am 2 - for - 9 on this prediction so far -- the Rams and Patriots won in seasons they did not play on Monday night .

In cultural news , the upcoming super - ridiculous movie " 2012 " supposes that the Mayans were right and the world will end in that year .
What if the world actually is about to end , because the sun is about to fail ?
See some disturbing evidence below .
Stats of the Week No. 1 : Santonio Holmes had the last touchdown of the 2008 season and the first touchdown of the 2009 season .

Sweet Play of the Week : After catching the deflected pass on a play that will be seen on highlight films until the universe ends , Brandon Stokley of Denver raced downfield , reaching the Cincinnati 1 with about 16 seconds showing on the game clock .
Instead of immediately crossing into the end zone , Stokley jogged sideways along the white line , using up clock .
He could do this because no Bengals speed player was in sight ( see below ) .
By jogging along the end zone line , Stokley burned an extra five seconds of clock on his 87 - yard TD .
Great presence of mind -- especially considering it was the only time he touched the ball on the day !
Bear in mind , however , officials can whistle the play dead if the ballcarrier is not attempting to advance .

The linesman chased him at full speed .
How come the Bengals did n't ?
With Philadelphia leading host Carolina 17 - 7 and having possession on the Cats ' 9 , all Eagles blocked to the left ; Donovan McNabb faked a spread - style handoff to Brian Westbrook running left ; tight end Brent Celek , who had been blocking left , spun and ran into the right flat ; McNabb rolled right and hit Celek for the touchdown .
With Philadelphia now leading by the New Economy score of 24 - 7 , the Nesharim had possession on the Panthers ' 4 . McNabb rolled right -- remember , last time in this position , McNabb rolled right and threw right -- then flipped a shovel pass underneath to Westbrook , who scored behind a terrific pull - block by undrafted free - agent guard Nick Cole .
Cats meltdown note : Coach John
Fox says he 's sticking with Jake Delhomme at quarterback , who in his last two outings has thrown nine interceptions and lost two fumbles .
Carolina went into the season gambling that the team did not need a quarterback of the future .
Sweet Sequence of the Week :
In one sequence in the Steelers - Flaming Thumbtacks collision , Ben Roethlisberger pumped hard left , the safeties bit , and the result was a 29 - yard completion deep to Hines Ward .
On the next snap , Roethlisberger pumped hard left , the safeties bit , and Roethlisberger connected with Santonio Holmes for a 34 - yard touchdown .
Two snaps later : Kerry Collins pumped hard left , the Pittsburgh safeties bit , and Collins had a 57 - yard completion to Kenny Britt .
Sour Play of the Week : With Cincinnati facing fourth - and - 2 on the Denver 42 , the Trick - or - Treats sent the punt team onto the field -- yet another fraidy - cat kick on the edge of the Maroon Zone .
At least , that 's what Denver assumed as it dropped a returner back .
But wait , the Cincinnati punt unit had no punter !
The ball was quick - snapped to up - back Brian Leonard , who ran for the first down .
Denver never noticed the absence of a punter on the " punt " team .

Sweet ' N ' Sour Matched Plays : Miles Austin -- undrafted out of Division I - AA Monmouth , and looking better than megabucks fellow wide receiver Roy Williams -- made a sweet spin move for a 42 - yard touchdown .
Austin spun at the sideline , where City of Tampa cornerback Elbert Mack lightly shoved him , thinking he was already out of bounds .
But he was n't !
That was sour .
Mario Manningham of the Giants took a simple hitch pass on third - and - 8 and legged it to the end zone , after breaking a sloppy tackle attempt by Kareem Moore at the line .
That was sweet .
Halfway through the run , always - boasting megabucks cornerback DeAngelo Hall gave Manningham a light shove at the sideline , thinking he was already out of bounds .
But he was n't !
That was sour .
Plus , where oh where were the Redskins ' safeties ?
As Manningham crossed the goal line , only linebacker London Fletcher and defensive end Phillip Daniels had bothered to chase him .
NFL players spend all year elaborately training , then game time rolls around and they can't be troubled to tackle a runner or chase an opposition player headed for the end zone .

Pictures Contemplate this photo for a moment , and then try telling us it came from a great motion picture .
How About 10 Nobel Peace Prizes Every Year ?
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -- what a name , there is a science to making a buddy road flick -- just expanded the Oscar nominees category for Best Picture from five to 10 .
( In keeping with the pretense , the Academy has a Science and Technology Council -- not a committee , a council ! )
Studios want any excuse to slap the words " Best Picture " on movie adverts , even if " nominated for " must appear underneath in six - point type ; now twice as many flicks will be promoted in this manner .
The proximate cause of the expansion was that many complained " Wall - E " and " The Dark Knight " were not Best Picture nominees in 2008 .
" Wall - E " was a terrific flick , the finest Hollywood romance in years , despite starring two mute robots ; " The Dark Knight " was a terrible film .
People felt " The Dark Knight " had to be praised owing to the death of Heath Ledger ; that movie was terrible .
The big chase scene at its center made absolutely no sense -- no matter what street the van turned down , the Joker 's tractor - trailer truck was already on that street and approaching from the opposite direction .
Huh ?
The Joker made no sense .
How did he know where everyone in Gotham City was at every moment ?
How did he enter guarded buildings without being detected ?
How did he command an army of super - competent ultra-loyal henchmen , including engineers and surgeons , despite having no money and boasting of murdering his own assistants for amusement ?
And that scene of gibberish pseudo - philosophizing about society by the Joker , puh-leeze .
If there were 100 Best Picture nominees , " The Dark Knight " should not have been one .
For the Pulitzers , the National Book Award , the National Magazine Award , and other prizes , there are already far more than 10 nominees -- because writers , newspapers and magazines nominate themselves .
Anyone can be " nominated " for a Pulitzer Prize ; just fill out the form and send it in .
It 's only a matter of time until some slapdash thriller is marketed as " Nominated for the National Book Award ! "

" Monday Night Football " Analysis :
So , why were n't the TV announcers dressed in throwback uniforms ?
The players , officials and cheerleaders wore 50 - year - old styles .
Why were n't the " Monday Night Football " booth crews attired in black - and - white suits , narrow ties and fedoras ?
Jon Gruden should have had a buzzcut .
Ron Jaworksi should have worn thick horn - rimmed glasses and an " I Like Ike " button .
Buffalo endured its third consecutive " Monday Night Football " loss in the final minute .
The killer mistake did n't come when Leodis McKelvin ran a kickoff out of the end zone with the Bills ahead by five at the two - minute warning .
Sure , the Buffalo " hands " " team was in , so McKelvin had no wedge , but he 's a good return man .
The killer mistake was when McKelvin struggled to try to gain an extra yard after he was under tackle by two Patriots .
Get on the ground !
He 'd brought the ball back to the 31 - yard line -- reaching the 32 was completely irrelevant .
He 's a super - highly - paid first - round - drafted NFL player -- does n't he know the desperate Patriots will try to strip the ball ?
Get on the ground !
Often all a football team needs to do is the obvious , and things will be fine .
Had McKelvin simply gone to the ground once he was hemmed in , Buffalo 's chances of victory would have been good .
Instead , it 's yet another humiliation for a squad that once operated in the NFL 's elite .
Buffalo lacks the football IQ necessary to win .
The Bills ' no-huddle offense only resulted in the Patriots running 29 more offensive plays and holding a 14 - minute edge in time of possession .
Predictably , this caused the Buffalo defense to tire at the end ; Buffalo 's defenders played well for the first 55 minutes , then in the final five minutes they surrendered 112 yards and 12 points .
The no-huddle is supposed to make the opposing defense tired -- but often it makes your own defense tired , because quick three - and - outs send the defense back onto the field .
To compensate for tired pass rushers , Buffalo began blitzing in the final five minutes , and of course you know how that worked out .
After a shaky start , the New England offensive line returned to normal form in the second half .
After a shaky start , Tom Brady returned to his 2007 form in the fourth quarter and did what smart quarterbacks do -- he took what the defense offered .
Buffalo was blitzing linebackers but keeping its safeties deep to prevent a long strike to Randy Moss .
That meant the short throws had to be open , and here are the completions by Brady on the Flying Elvii 's final two drives : 18 yards , 16 , 13 , 10 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 6 , 5 and 4 .
You do n't see many dramatic comebacks based on 8 - yard flare passes to the tailback .
But Brady has football IQ , so he took what worked .
And when he recognized that Buffalo blitzing meant tight end Ben Watson was covered by a linebacker , he looked to Watson for both last - minute touchdowns .
Every NFL quarterback has a strong arm -- seeing the field and knowing where to put the ball is the greater skill .
Brady sure has that .
Out in Oakland , the narrative was amazingly similar , but it just happened after the East Coast hit the hay .
A once - proud franchise ( Raiders ) faced a current darling ( Chargers ) and lost in the closing seconds .
The Raiders also played their opponent well defensively until the middle of the fourth quarter , after which they gave up 166 yards and 14 points .
When the Bolts reached the Raiders ' 10 with 46 seconds remaining and a timeout , trailing by three , it was Darren Sproles , not LaDainian Tomlinson , on the field for the deciding plays .
Sproles carried the ball to the Oakland 5 , and then the Raiders , with 21 ticks showing , inexplicably called timeout , in effect granting the Chargers an extra snap .
( San Diego needed to conserve its own timeout for a field goal attempt to tie and force overtime . )
On the bonus snap , Sproles ran for the winning touchdown .
Where was Oakland 's football IQ ?
And did the Raiders actually bring in dirt from the year 1960 for the middle of their field ?

Sweet Team of the Week : OK , they were playing Detroit .
But New Orleans had the league 's No. 1 offense in 2008 , and the Saints picked up where they left off with 45 points , six touchdown passes and 515 yards of offense .
Drew Brees , scorned by San Diego and Miami , has become a marvelous quarterback -- is he now the NFL 's best ?
New Orleans has allowed just 13 sacks on its 670 pass attempts since the start of 2008 , which means the team has enjoyed excellent line play and that Brees is extremely adept at sidestepping rushers while keeping his eyes downfield .
On his 15 - yard touchdown throw to Jeremy Shockey , Brees sidestepped a pass - rusher , but did so efficiently -- he did n't run around like mad , he just took three sideways steps , then got his shoulders square before releasing .
Hall of Famer Steve Young contends you can tell how a quarterback is playing by watching his feet , and Brees now has the best footwork in the NFL .
The Saints ' high school - based spread offense is fun tactically , too .
Defensive coordinators are now terrified of facing the Saints ' spread , so shifting out of it is a surprise .
Leading 7 - 0 , New Orleans had first - and - 10 on the Lions ' 39 and came out in a full - house backfield with two tight ends .
The defense was confused -- New Orleans never goes full house !
If you looked closely , one of the tight ends was skinny speed receiver Robert Meachem .
Brees play - faked behind a " max protect " package and looked deep for Meachem , who was open in the end zone for six .

Proposed Solution -- Launch Al Gore Into the Sun : I do n't wish to alarm you , but the sun is supposed to be covered with spots right now -- according to solar - cycle charts , this should be an active year for sunspots -- and instead is eerily clean .
" Blank , " in space - weather lingo .
Here , you can click on " latest Mauna Loa image " to see how the surface of the sun looked on Monday ; additional daily solar images are here .
In March 2006 , the National Center for Atmospheric Research predicted the next solar cycle would begin no later than 2008 , and that by 2009 , much of Sol 's surface would be sunspots .
Also in 2006 , NASA 's David Hathaway , a prominent solar physicist , predicted a " ferocious " sunspot cycle happening around now .
Power and communications companies were advised to expect substantial disruption from solar storms -- the nascent cell - phone business has not yet coped with a solar maximum .
Instead all is quiet on the surface of the sun .
National Weather Service / Space Weather Prediction Center
Where are its spots ?
Sunspot cycles are thought to be caused by rhythmically changing currents in the sun 's magnetic fields , but that 's only the leading guess .
Though human life depends on the sun , NASA has spent just a tiny fraction of its resources studying our star -- plunking a Motel 6 on the moon obviously is far more important !
Astronomers have known of sunspots since ancient times , but detailed observations date only to 1755 , and the concept of the solar cycle was not proposed until 1843 , by the astronomer Samuel Schwabe .
Solar luminosity is thought to decline slightly when sunspots are absent -- during the " Maunder Minimum " and then " Dalton Minimum , " periods covering much of 1650 to 1850 , sunspot activity was below average and Europe had cold winters followed by late springs .
Professional doomsayer Al Gore endlessly declares that the last two decades have been " the warmest on record " -- he does n't add that the " record " of reliable temperature data begins in the late 19th century , just when prolonged solar minima were ending and Earth entered a period of recovery from cool centuries .
( Meaning temperatures likely would have risen in the 20th century whether man existed or not ; I believe greenhouse gases should be regulated , it 's just that it would be nice if Gore were honest about the evidence . )
Lack of current sunspot activity may help explain why , though all computer models predict increasing artificial global warming , the last couple of years have been slightly cool .
( Slightly cool years do not disprove global warming . )
Cosmologists are in broad agreement that Sol is a " main sequence " star which should continue to burn at uniform power for at least several hundred million years ; other stars similar to Sol appear to burn uniformly for very long periods .
Stars like the sun are n't supposed to change output over time horizons that matter to people , though do gradually become warmer , as gravity compresses them .
A core mystery of climate is why , though the sun has been growing moderately warmer for perhaps a billion years , past epochs were much hotter than today -- when the dinosaurs lived , Antarctica was forested -- while the past 40 million years have been characterized by cyclical ice ages .
There is no scientific consensus on the cause of geologically " recent " ice ages .
But they should n't be happening , at least for solar reasons , if the sun is gradually warming as cosmologists believe .
Why did The Experts forecast a ferocious sunspot cycle only to observe , so far , quietude ?
Lack of knowledge of the sun is surely the primary explanation .
The secondary explanation might be desire to get media attention by predicting something that sounds like a made - for - TV sci - fi movie .
Then again , maybe the sun is about to fail .
The sun has probably gone through countless periods of surface quietude in the past , and we are only now noticing .
Here 's what to lose sleep over .
Standard solar models predict the sun should be producing huge numbers of neutrinos , but elaborate , expensive attempts to detect neutrinos streaming from the sun do n't find them .
Standard solar models further predict a star like Sol would stop producing neutrinos when it is about to fail .
Theory says the sun should be producing lots of sunspots and lots of neutrinos .
It 's making neither .
A new concept says " neutrino oscillation " may account for why neutrinos could be absent but the sun remains fine .
Let 's hope this concept is right .

This book speculates on the sun failing .
Diverting sci-fi .
Ca n't happen .
Right ?
The late sci - fi writer Arthur Clarke 's " The Songs of Distant Earth , " published in 1986 , concerns what would happen if the sun is about to die .
In the book , early in the 21st century it is realized that Sol is failing and will go supernova relatively quickly in cosmic terms .
( A physicist by training , Clarke was much more concerned with neutrino absence than sunspots . )
In the novel , determined attempts to discover warp drive produce nothing .
The only idea anyone can come up with to preserve life is to build cargo vessels bearing robots , supplies , seeds and human and mammal embryos , then send the vessels on lengthy journeys at a fraction of the speed of light .
When the vessels arrive at a habitable world , the robots would go down to build shelters and plant crops ; once it was safe , the embryos would be allowed to develop , tended by robots until new generations began .
In " The Songs of Distant Earth , " for several centuries humanity devotes itself to launching gigantic cargo vessels packed with thousands of tons of robots , supplies , medical equipment and records of Earth , then dispatching them one by one toward distant star systems .
At last , a sort of unplanned Golden Age occurs -- nations no longer fight , rather , concentrate their efforts on cooperation to spread life elsewhere .
As expansion of the sun approaches , people stop having children , and Earth 's population declines dramatically .
Then a few years before the expected calamity , stardrive finally is invented -- and all energy is focused on construction of a magnificent starship to hold the final million people in suspended animation for a journey of 10,000 years to a world that resembles Earth .
As human beings leave their cradle for the last time , the ship travels into a galaxy where many planets now have Earth - based life , spread by the robot vessels .
The ship stops along the way to see what worlds might be like with transplanted humanity , but none of humanity 's historical disputes and hatreds .
" The Songs of Distant Earth " is a fun book -- read it to keep your mind off the possibility the sun is failing .

Mark Sanchez 's first NFL touchdown pass , 30 yards to Chansi Stuckey , came against a six - blitz -- Stuckey was so open there was no safety to be seen anywhere in the television tetragon .
New Orleans had Detroit on the ropes at 28 - 10 and facing third - and - 6 ; a six - blitz allowed a 64 - yard completion to Calvin Johnson and a Detroit touchdown on the series .
Tony Gonzalez 's Irish step - dancing touchdown move came as Miami was blitzing seven .
All Gonzalez did was run a quick turn - out ; the catch itself was the easiest one of his career .
Arizona blitzed seven on what would prove to be San Francisco 's game - winning throw to Frank Gore , who ran directly into the area vacated by a blitzing safety .
Kansas City led Baltimore 14 - 10 and had the Nevermores facing third - and - 8 -- six blitz , easy Baltimore touchdown .
Later , score tied at 24 , Baltimore faced third - and - 8 again and expected a blitz , since the Chiefs were predictably blitzing on third - and - long .
Kansas
City rushed eight , a tactic almost never seen because it's like handing out an engraved invitation to score a touchdown , which is what the Ravens did : 31 yards to Mark Clayton for what would prove to be the winning points .
Kansas
City big - blitzed more than a dozen times , and as a result , the low - voltage Ravens offense gained 501 yards .
Of course , the blitz sometimes works ; Chicago 's Danieal Manning dropped Aaron Rodgers in the end zone on a safety blitz .
( Thus , a safety safety . )
TMQ's point is that it backfires just as often , especially on long - yardage downs , when blitzing is expected .

Adventures in Officiating : Darren Sharper of New Orleans was called for a personal foul for giving a Detroit receiver a forearm after the pass sailed by .
TMQ wishes this foul were called more often : Defenders should n't get a free shot at receivers on an incompletion .
On the next snap , from the Saints ' 1 , Kevin Smith of the Lions ran straight ahead , was stood up and stopped advancing .
A Saints player ripped the ball out of Smith 's hands , and officials ruled that when Smith 's forward progress stopped , the play was over .
Does n't forward progress always stop exactly at the instant a ballcarrier loses possession of the ball ?
If forward progress negates loss of possession , how can there ever be fumbles ?
TMQ has long thought the rules need to be clarified on this point .
Plus , had Smith hit the pile , stopped , bounced backward and then ran outside for a touchdown , the score would have counted .

" Batting cleanup , the glyptodont . "

Untouched Touchdown Run of the Week : Julius Jones ran 62 yards against Les Mouflons for the game - icing touchdown behind great blocking by the left side of the Seattle line , including tackle Sean Locklear and guard Rob Sims .
It 's pretty fun to run 62 yards for a touchdown if everyone in front of you has already been knocked to the ground .
Why Tactics Matter :
As TMQ noted last month , going no -huddle all the time is just another way to be predictable , plus leads to rapid three - and - outs that send the defense back onto the field ; but going no - huddle once in a while creates the element of surprise .
Taking the ball after the kickoff which began overtime , Pittsburgh went no-huddle and surprised Tennessee , marching down the field for the winning figgie .
Overtime is also a good moment to go no -huddle because by then the defense is tired .
Starting a game no-huddle , as Buffalo did at New England , does n't accomplish much because the defense is not tired .
Michigan surprised Notre Dame by going no -huddle for the entire game , but the key word is surprised .
Buffalo's bumbling Dick " Cheerio , Chaps " Jauron over the summer elaborately announced his intention to play New England no -huddle .
When is the last time Bill Belichick elaborately informed the rest of the league what tactics he would use ?
Proof of the Decline of Western Civilization : Attendance numbers for SEC spring football scrimmages .
Additional Proof of the Decline of Western Civilization : ESPN went live to Ed Werder so that he could describe Brett Favre walking from the locker room timeout to warm - ups .
TMQ contends the player in question should now be called Brett Favre Brett Favre Brett Favre ; his number should be 444 .
Maybe you heard that Minnesota won and Adrian Peterson ran wild .
What struck me about the game was that undrafted free agent safety Abram Elam , who weighs 205 pounds , twice blew through enormous Vikings left tackle Bryant McKinnie , once to sack Favre Favre Favre and once to drop Peterson for a loss on third - and - 1 . Elam was the hidden gem in the Mark Sanchez trade .

Buck - Buck - Brawckkkkkkk No. 2 : Trailing 31 - 7 , Carolina faced fourth - and - goal on the Philadelphia 4 with 1:45 remaining before intermission .
That can't be the field goal unit !
You can't be serious !
A touchdown here is the only hope of getting back into the game !
If you 're going to kick you might as well quit and go have blueberry - almond martinis .
Carolina kicked , and went on to a 38 - 10 defeat .

Can They Get DirecTV at NFL Network Headquarters ?
In good football broadcasting news , NFL Network finally signed a peace treaty with Comcast .
TMQ wrote two years ago that the core problem was the NFL had ignored econ 101 by attempting to charge more than the market would bear .
" As soon as the NFL drops the NFLN asking price to the market - clearing level , " yours truly supposed , the dispute would be resolved .
And yea , verily , this came to pass .
NFL Network dropped its price from about $ 8.50 per household per year , too much for a niche network that covers only one sport , to about $ 5.50 .
Immediately peace broke out .
In bad football broadcasting news , the NFL extended until 2014 DirecTV 's monopoly over NFL Sunday Ticket .
As TMQ annually notes , millions of American homes and apartments for technical reasons cannot receive the DirecTV satellite signal -- my house can't -- so the monopoly effectively bans millions of Americans from purchasing Sunday Ticket and deciding for themselves which NFL contests to watch .
Sunday Ticket is offered on cable in other nations ; anyone with a cable connection in Canada or Mexico can watch any NFL game .
But in the United States , the NFL continues to refuse to offer Sunday Ticket via cable , thus denying choice to the very people whose taxes make NFL stadia and profits possible .
Why does n't Congress pass legislation to end this restraint of trade ?
My argument is not with DirecTV , which is a fantastic product -- wish I could buy it !
My argument is with the NFL 's reaping profits in stadia paid for by taxpayers , then creating a monopoly arrangement that prohibits many millions of Americans from signing up for Sunday Ticket and deciding for themselves what to watch .
As part of the peace pact with Comcast , the NFL offered Red Zone Channel to cable .
I watched Red Zone Channel on Sunday and it is the cat 's meow -- basically a live around - the - league highlights show happening while games are in progress .
Red Zone Channel is an exciting new way to watch football , and if it were a network , it would out - draw many games .
So far , of cable carriers , only Comcast and Verizon have purchased Red Zone Channel .
Time - Warner , Cox , all the rest :
Get on the stick and buy this channel .
Your viewers will be pleased .
Though lots of fun , Red Zone Channel also teases viewers with glimpses of what it would be like if they could choose for themselves which games to watch .
Come on Congress , this is a cause with populist appeal : Break the NFL monopoly over viewer choice .
Gruntled Quarterback Update : TMQ is on record as suspicious of Jay Cutler , who heave - hoed four interceptions in his debut for the Bears .
One second - quarter Chicago series : dropped interception , dropped interception , interception .
But Cutler has also gone from Denver , where pass blocking is terrific -- only 12 sacks allowed in 2008 -- to Chicago , where " pass blocking " seems a controversial concept .
On Cutler 's second pick , guard Frank Omiyale did an olé on Clay Matthews , practically stepping out of the rusher 's way ; Matthews hammered Cutler as he threw .
On Cutler 's third interception , Omiyale barely brushed his man , then stood watching , doing nothing , as the quarterback was hammered during his throw .
TMQ notes that it is amazing how often , during an NFL down , there is at least one gentleman simply standing there , doing nothing at all .
If the gentleman doing nothing at all is one of your pass blockers , it 's going to be a long night .
The four interceptions allowed Green Bay to win despite being substantially outgained by Chicago ; in effect , the Bears had five turnovers , adding a botched fake punt that gave the Packers possession on the Chicago 30 .
Why did the Bears try a fake on a fourth - and - 11 , when conversion is unlikely ?
It was an " automatic " -- the snapper thought he saw Green Bay with too many men on the field , and snapped to the up - back hoping to draw a flag .
Some teams have " automatics " for punt formation :
If the snapper or up - back sees a defensive error that allows a chance to convert , he shouts a code that turns the punt into a fake , coaches never consulted .
In this case , not only did the 12th Packer get off the field in time -- since it was fourth - and - 11 , a penalty would have made it fourth - and - 6 , and the Bears would have punted anyway .
He Hatched Sorted Schemes on a Sleaveless Night : " Without further adieu . "
Actual line in a Washington Post column last month ; it should have been spelled , of course , " ado . "
Obscure College Score of the Week : Pomona - Pitzer 20 , Puget Sound 14 ( overtime ) .
Located in Claremont , Calif. , Pomona College and Pitzer College are small liberal - arts schools that combine athletic facilities in order to field teams .
Both schools use the same sports nickname , the Sagehens .
The sagehen is a sexually dimorphic grouse , with males having puffed - out chests and performing elaborate strutting rituals to attract females ; I do not know what this says about gender roles on the Pomona and Pitzer campuses .
Though Pomona is an elite college , it boasts that " students let off steam by hitting the beach and the slopes on a same day . "
Mom and Dad , you might check to be sure you are getting your $ 50,568 worth .
Bonus Obscure College Score of the Week : Birmingham - Southern 35 , Campbell 28 ( overtime ) .
Located in Birmingham , Ala. , Birmingham - Southern College formally denies that it hosts a Satan - worshipping fraternity .
Weasel Coach Watch : Readers , including Diana Weingart of Boulder , Colo. , noted Dan Hawkins theatrically promised he would not leave Boise State , then bolted out the door to Colorado the instant money was offered .
The Buffalos are now 13 - 26 under Hawkins and were just blown off the field by a mid-major , the Toledo Rockets .
TMQ's immutable law of weasel coaches holds :
When you hire a coach who 's only in it for himself , you get a coach who 's only in it for himself .
Why do colleges think someone willing to walk out on an existing commitment is the kind of person good to have around ?
The Football Gods Chortled : In the Clemson - Georgia Tech game , Clemson botched a fake field goal attempt , and Georgia Tech returned the ball for a touchdown .
On the next Georgia Tech possession , the Yellow Jackets ran a fake field goal attempt , and Clemson was caught unsuspecting ; no one covered the target , and the Yellow Jackets scored a touchdown .
You just ran a fake field goal , and were tricked by a fake field goal !
' Tis Better To Have Rushed And Lost Than Never To Have Rushed At All : Leading 34 - 31 , Notre Dame had second - and - 10 on its own 29 - yard line with 2:29 remaining and Michigan holding two timeouts .
Notre Dame twice threw incomplete , politely stopping the clock ; the Wolverines scored the winning touchdown with 11 seconds remaining .
Had Notre
Dame simply run up the middle for no gain on each of its final two snaps , the action most likely would have come down to Michigan attempting a long field goal to force overtime .
Instead , the Irish let Michigan preserve its timeouts , which proved critical during the final minute .
In the endgame , run to advance the clock !
Often all a football team needs to do is the obvious , and things will be fine .
That Win Really Messed Up the Streak : Detroit has lost 24 of its past 25 games .

A buck - buck - brawckkkkkkk kick doomed the Buckeyes .
Fortune Favors the Bold !
Reaching fourth - and - goal on the Ohio State 2 , USC did the manly - man thing , went for it , and scored a touchdown .
Reaching fourth - and - goal on the USC 2 , Ohio State did the fraidy - cat thing and launched a field goal .
These decisions were the key to a game won 18 - 15 by the Trojans ; had the Buckeyes gone for it , Ohio State likely would have prevailed .
You 're playing at home in front of a zillion screaming people dressed as school logos , you always lose big games , you need 2 yards : show some courage !
Ohio State would have been better off going for it and failing -- thus pinning USC against its goal line -- than launching a fraidy - cat kick .
By going for it , OSU coach Jim Tressel would have sent his players the message that he was challenging them to win the game ; by kicking , he sent the message that he expected to lose and wanted to make sure Ohio State got to double - digits on the scoreboard , so the boosters would n't call for his head the following day .
Check Tressel 's wimpy postgame comments here -- he did n't think his own team could gain 2 yards at home !
Three weeks ago , TMQ contended that coaches often kick on fourth - and - short in order to avoid criticism .
As the field goal team trotted out for the kick that would doom OSU 's chances , Kirk Herbstreit said on ESPN , " Jim Tressel got criticized a lot for going for it on fourth - and - 2 against Navy , he needs to avoid being criticized again . "
This strategy does n't even work !
What is happening now ?
Everyone 's criticizing Tressel .
Note that in the pros the following day , Chicago went for it on fourth - and - 1 and scored a touchdown on the drive .
Jacksonville went for it on fourth - and - 2 and scored a touchdown .
Indianapolis went for it on fourth - and - 1 from the Jaguars ' 35 at the two - minute warning and failed , but still won the game ; by going for it , rookie coach Jim Caldwell sent his players the message that he was challenging them .
Reader Comments : Jonathan Nixon of Newport , N.C. , writes , " College Gameday just posted Ohio State 's record of 44 - 10 over the last 4 seasons .
Against teams that played in BCS bowl games , they are 2 - 10 ; against everyone else , they are 42 - 0 .
That 's a lot of cupcakes . "
Joseph Cross of Fort Worth , Texas , notes that my list of cupcake triumphs on opening weekend of college action failed to include Richmond , the defending Division I - AA champion , besting Duke at Duke .
And Mindy Keffler of Ann Arbor , Mich. , notes my list of big - money football programs that opened against cupcake schools failed to include Michigan State hosting Division I - AA Montana State , winning 44 - 3 .
Add these two neglected games and the combined score of football factories over cupcakes on opening weekend was 670 - 139 .
Gimmick sked note :
Over the weekend Oklahoma relentlessly ran up the score on Division I - AA Idaho State , winning 64 - 0 , while Cincinnati relentlessly ran up the score on Division I - AA Southeast Missouri State , winning 70 - 3 .
Leading 56 - 3 , Cincinnati was still throwing the ball trying to run up the score .
For these egregious displays of bad sportsmanship , Oklahoma and Cincinnati are likely to be punished by the football gods with unhappy seasons .
The Curse Lives : Last week , Oklahoma State was on the cover of Sports Illustrated , which subscribers receive on Thursday .
On Saturday , Oklahoma State lost to mega-underdog Houston .
If Rep. Joe Wilson's Apology Is Accepted -- What About the Apology by LeGarrette Blount ?
Serena Williams was fined $ 10,000 for cursing out and threatening to harm a line judge in the U.S. Open .
It 's not just that in the Masterpiece Theater environment of tennis , the hushed crowd can hear a player curse ; threatening another person with physical harm is in most states a crime akin to simple battery , such as throwing a punch .
Williams , who is wealthy , was assessed a minor fine -- yet LeGarrette Blount of Oregon loses his entire senior season for throwing a punch .
Blount 's punch was wrong and punishment was required , but taking away his senior season -- in high school and college football , the senior season is the most important season by far -- for losing his cool in the heat of the moment is excessive punishment .
What Blount did is not hugely different from what Williams did .
Yet she is slapped on the wrist while he is severely punished .
[+]
Enlarge Bob Levey / Getty Images Once again , the Texans ' cheerleaders had more flash than the Texans .
Plus , whatever happened to the value of the apology ?
Blount apologized to Byron Hout , the player he struck , and Hout graciously accepted .
Life is full of screw - ups .
The apology , if accepted , lets us go forward without nursing grudges .
Rep. Joe Wilson was incredibly rude to President Barack Obama last week .
Wilson apologized ; Obama accepted .
The matter should now be closed .
Blount 's apology was genuine , and ought to count for a lot .
Football spectators , TV fans and boosters are hypocritical to demand violent contact during games , then theatrically call for extreme punishment of a player whose heat - of - battle emotions had not cooled a mere two minutes after the contest ended .
The suspension against Blount was imposed by his school , and so could be changed .
Oregon , show clemency -- let Blount play the second half of the season .
High School Notes :
One of the very best prep schools for a male athlete is DeMatha , a Catholic boys ' school outside Washington , D.C. , which not only produces strong sports teams but also has a genuine emphasis on academics .
There are high schools with excellent sports but the athletes barely attend class .
TMQ has little regard for these places ; a kid who goes on to college sports from DeMatha is a kid who will study hard and graduate .
Anyway , on Saturday , DeMatha had one running back rush for 392 yards and another back rush for 129 yards in a wild 56 - 35 win against a high school that is a traditional power .
You do n't see a lot of 500 - plus rushing days in contested games .
Meanwhile , reader Jason Fond of Fort Worth , Texas , points out this Texas high - school game that ended 70 - 63 as the winning quarterback threw for 541 yards .
Single Worst Play of the Season -- So Far : Just maybe you 've seen a highlight of the Brandon Stokley play that won the Denver - Cincinnati game .
Forget the ball bouncing or Stokley running , where were the Bengals ?
Leading 7 - 6 with 28 seconds remaining and the opponent pinned on its 13 , Cincinnati coaches sent only a nickel , not a dime , onto the field .
At the snap , the deepest safety was only 12 yards off .
Once Stokley grabs the tipped pass , linebacker Dhani Jones is the sole Bengal who chases him all - out .
Other Broncos , and Bronco coaches , ran down the sideline with Stokley .
The linesman ran with him almost stride - for - stride .
Where are the other Bengals ?
Safety Roy Williams , a former high - first - round draft choice , jogged half - heartedly behind the play .
Cornerback Leon
Hall , a former high - first - round draft choice , simply lies on the ground , watching Stokley motor .
I could n't tell from film who the other safety was , because he never runs toward the action .
Cincinnati Bengals , you are guilty of the single worst play of the season -- so far .
Next Week : All 11 Bengals try lying down and watching during a game .
File this under : ” Strange Lego Creations ” A Lego builder decided to create this fully functional “ semi-automatic pump- action Lego crossbow that took four blocks in the handle and one in the chamber ” — along with 300 hours of work put in .
It ’s capable of firing a standard Lego brick 20 yards .
One potential negative , the crossbow is n’t very accurate .
Lots more pics after the jump .
One day I was making a simple little elastic gun to shoot Lego blocks and I thought to myself , ‘ it would be cooler if it had some kind of trigger . ’
The next thing I knew , I was involved in a competition with my own self
