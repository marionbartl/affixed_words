Venom fans rejoice .
While Sam Raimi screwed the pooch on the character of Venom ( who he admitted disliking from the get go ) in his wildly uneven and poorly thought - out Spider - Man 3 , Sony is letting a new crop of filmmakers have a crack at the character .
Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick of Zombieland fame are in charge of this one .
Sci -Fi Wire has more .
My experience with the Venom character is limited to the Spider - Man animated television series … in which the character was a badass .
I ’m interested in how you do a Venom movie with no Spider - Man at all , and I ’m guessing that this movie will not even make an attempt to keep continuity with the Spider - Man films .
I have mixed feelings about that .
I love how Marvel is creating an umbrella of continuity and interconnectivity with their properties , and I ’d love for Spider - Man to be a part of that .
But I guess the Sony ship has sailed .
I ’m reserving judgement on this one , but I ’m cheering for it .
Venom could be a very interesting and cool character if he is fully realized .
Originally the metro was seen as a way to ease chronic overcrowding on western suburbs CityRail services by utilising the mostly empty country platforms at Central for these trains , instead of having them continue through the city and over the Harbour Bridge .
Under the plan , at least 26 trains an hour in the peak would shift to the country tracks and terminate at Central .
Passengers would be forced to change to empty metro carriages at a new station beneath Central 's western forecourt .
But senior government officials have realised it is impossible to terminate so many trains hourly at Central because there is no way to get a sufficient number of trains back out of the station in time .
Sources have told the Herald that this plan to change the CityRail network , originally submitted to Infrastructure Australia , has been withdrawn and is being revised .
Alec Brown , a spokesman for the Sydney Metro Authority , said : " It is normal in these kinds of circumstances for a proposal to be altered or revised during ongoing discussions between agencies , to get the best outcome for commuters .
The metro system and heavy rail will be compatible at the opening of the CBD Metro in 2015 . "
But if these western line trains do not terminate at Central and continue on to the North Shore , as they do now , via Town Hall and Wynyard , so few people are likely to use the CBD Metro that it will be an outright failure .
In that scenario , there will be no reason for passengers to change to the metro because their trains already travel to their final destination stations in the northern parts of the city .
At Central , the first problem is that three of the 15 platforms have to be quarantined for country trains , which are too long to terminate anywhere else on the network .
For 26 trains an hour to use the other 12 platforms , at least 14 trains an hour must move out of their way .
And because there is just a single pair of tracks returning west , these 14 trains have to cross the flow of the 26 trains entering the yard - a task which RailCorp bureaucrats have acknowledged is unattainable .
" It is virtually impossible to manage that level of frequency at a terminal station , " one insider said .
The plan faces other huge challenges .
A big railway flyover at Blacktown would have to be remodelled at enormous cost to allow Richmond line trains access to the country tracks that terminate at Central .
Similarly , a vital track junction at Strathfield would have to be overhauled , which could have severe effects on Strathfield station .
And new automated signalling systems , not yet in use anywhere in the CityRail system , would be required between Strathfield and Chatswood and between Parramatta and Central Station - almost a quarter of Sydney 's entire network .
Experts put the cost of this resignalling at more than $ 2 billion and say the concept is unproved on the scale required in Sydney .
OFF THE TRACKS * Metro is announced in October before robust feasibility analysis .
Within weeks the cost balloons by $ 800 m .
* The Ministry of Transport warns in December of " potentially competing objectives " between the metro and an upgrade of Victoria Road .
* RailCorp warns the Department of Planning in January that the metro's proposed route would block a vital CityRail extension .
* Infrastructure Australia board advises the metro does not merit federal funds .
* Pyrmont light rail company demands compensation of up to 50 per cent of its revenue should the metro go ahead .
Emergency services are at the scene in Saltley , Birmingham .
Police have surrounded a man inside a car in Birmingham city centre with " canisters " surrounding his body and his hands bound .
Fire crews , an Army bomb disposal team and negotiators with West Midlands Police are at the scene in Saltley .
Ch Supt Tom Coughlan said it was unclear whether the man was conscious and whether he was there of his own accord or was a victim of crime .
A police cordon has delayed trains at the city 's New Street rail station .
Some people have been evacuated from their homes and were being offered shelter at Saltley Leisure Centre by the local authority , police said .
A no -fly zone has also been imposed over the immediate area .
Trains delayed
The incident at the junction of Clarel Avenue and Landor Street started just before 1030 BST on Sunday when the car was spotted by a passing lorry driver .
Mr Coughlan added : " Inside the vehicle his hands seem to be bound and his body seems to be surrounded by what is being referred to at the moment as a number of canisters . "
Inquiries have been made in an attempt to identify the registered keeper of the vehicle but police said this had not so far led to an identification of the man inside the car .
A 500 m cordon is in place and although some homes have been evacuated , the area is predominantly surrounded by industrial premises , police said .
Trains between New Street and Nuneaton , Warwickshire , and Tamworth , Staffordshire were facing delays of up to 50 minutes .
The incident has affected services run by CrossCountry and Virgin Trains and caused the closure of the Wheels adventure park .
For some time now , an application named Pocket God has consistently been at the top of the iPhone application store list of bestselling apps .
One review describes Pocket God as “ an entertaining app that lets you explore multiple ways of tormenting your cute little islanders . ”
But see for yourself :
I just wonder how it is that Apple finds an application in which people can throw shoes at a virtual Bush unacceptable , but find the virtual torture of Pacific Islanders perfectly OK ?
And how is it that after weeks of being one of the bestselling iPhone games , hardly anyone has commented upon the game ’s racism ?
Just imagine , for instance , a game in which one were presented with a virtual shtetle filled with Jews one could torture , or a plantation full of African slaves ?
How is it that such applications would certainly be rejected by the Apple Store , and yet Pocket God does not even provoke controversy ?
I suppose that most people who play this game think of the island ’s inhabitants as fictitious primitives , rather than representatives of a particular ethnic group .
I doubt people playing the game bear any hatred towards Pacific Islanders .
And yet , I ca n’t help but see our inability to view cartoonish depictions of indigenous peoples , such as sports mascots , as representations of living peoples as problematic .
In particular , I feel it ties in with the myth of a vanishing race , of a people who , defined in terms or their primitivism must have already given way to the forces of modernity , their very existence denied .
UPDATE : I do n’t personally think Apple should be in the business of censoring applications based on content , but here is another story that is relevant to the current discussion :
The release ( and subsequent removal ) of an iPhone app called Baby Shaker this week has Apple in hot water with angry parents and children ’s groups , who are demanding answers from Apple .
UPDATE : Seems that Canterbury University Lecturer Malakai Koloamatangi is now raising a stink about the game .
See here and here ( via Indigeneity )
UPDATE : Looks like the developers are going to make some changes in response to criticisms .

Engineers have successfully ejected the dust cover from NASA 's Kepler telescope , a spaceborne mission soon to begin searching for worlds like Earth .
" The cover released and flew away exactly as we designed it to do , " said Kepler Project Manager James Fanson of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" This is a critical step toward answering a question that has come down to us across 100 generations of human history - are there other planets like Earth , or are we alone in the galaxy ? "
Kepler , which launched on March 6 from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , will spend three - and - a - half years staring at more than 100,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy for signs of Earth - size planets .
Some of the planets are expected to orbit in a star 's " habitable zone , " a warm region where water could pool on the surface .
The mission 's science instrument , called a photometer , contains the largest camera ever flown in space - its 42 charge - coupled devices ( CCDs ) will detect slight dips in starlight , which occur when planets passing in front of their stars partially block the light from Kepler 's view .
The telescope 's oval - shaped dust cover , measuring 1.7 meters by 1.3 meters ( 67 inches by 52 inches ) , protected the photometer from contamination before and after launch .
The dust cover also blocked stray light from entering the telescope during launch - light that could have damaged its sensitive detectors .
In addition , the cover was important for calibrating the photometer .
Images taken in the dark helped characterize noise coming from the instrument 's electronics , and this noise will later be removed from the actual science data .
" Now the photometer can see the stars and will soon start the task of detecting the planets , " said Kepler 's Science Principal Investigator William Borucki at NASA 's Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
" We have thoroughly measured the background noise so that our photometer can detect minute changes in a star 's brightness caused by planets . "
At 7:13 p.m. PDT on April 7 , engineers at Kepler 's mission operations center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics , Boulder , Colo. , sent commands to pass an electrical current through a " burn wire " to break the wire and release a latch holding the cover closed .
The spring - loaded cover swung open on a fly - away hinge , before drifting away from the spacecraft .
The cover is now in its own orbit around the sun , similar to Kepler 's sun-centric orbit .
See an animation of the event at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/videos/cover.html .
With the cover off , starlight is entering the photometer and being imaged onto its focal plane .
Engineers will continue calibrating the instrument using images of stars for another several weeks , after which science observations will begin .

Surely everybody in the whole world knows that the base price of the PS3 makes it currently the most expensive of this generation of consoles , and it probably does n’t take a financial genius to work out that you probably sell more of something if it costs less .
The story of a PS3 price cut has never really gone away , it has been around practically as long as the PS3 itself , but now it may be , just about , possibly be almost time for it to happen .
Reports are coming out of the US that an employee at EB Games has knowledge that a price cut will occur on March 22nd , with the price of the 80 GB falling from $ 399 to $ 300 .
Should we hold this information on a pedestal and take an unnamed employee ’s word ?
I do n’t think so , but C&VG are also reporting that they have received word from a major UK retailer ( GAME & GameStation ) that they have been contacted by Sony saying that PS3 & PSP price cut is definitely coming soon .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
If we add the two sources together does that make the rumours any more credible ?
Possibly , but Sony are n’t going to say that because it will only harm sales in the run up to a price drop .
It could be said that there is a case for not having a price cut , because in a way ( in the UK at least , and possibly Euro - zone ) we ’re already benefiting from one .
The PS3 has retail price of £ 299 , however a quick look around the Internet and you ’ll see it ’s available for far less than that , for example it ’s available from Amazon for £ 289 bundled with Killzone 2 ( which they sell for £ 35 ) so in that particular deal the PS3 is technically only £ 255 , being roughly 15 % below the recommended price .
It could even be argued that there is the case for a price increase , if we were to take into account that the GBP is around 20 % down against the Euro which is also down against the Yen , then an increase in price equal to this fluctuation would n’t have been surprising .
Thankfully that has n’t happened , but a price cut might finally be just around the corner .

The solution to the age - old problem of weakening battery capacity may soon emerge thanks to tech wizzes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , or MIT .
Scientists there have discovered an efficient way of powering electronic devices using bacteria - infused batteries .
No , this is n't a late April Fool 's joke or a long - lost X - Files plot .
It 's true ; the new batteries use a kind of bacteria that can construct an anode after being protected by a layer of cobalt oxide and gold .
Once this process is complete , the bacteria batteries can be formed into a nanowire .
This makes them drastically different than your regular old batteries that use a pair of anodes , one positive , one negative .
The genetically engineered battery bacteria poses no threat to human beings .
( Source : crn.com )
Over 100 Charges While Maintaining Capacity
In recent tests , the MIT researchers have been able to genetically engineer the bacteria so that it first protects itself with an iron phosphate being attaching to carbon nanotubes .
This process makes for a tight network that is highly conductive ; according to early reports , to the point where someone can charge and discharge a battery over one hundred times without losing its original capacity .
Some have criticized the research because regular lithium - ion batteries on the market today can , in some cases , be recharged far more than just one hundred times .
However , representatives for MIT believe that by the time their ' organic ' batteries hit the market they " will be able to go much longer , " than their competitors .
The Organic Battery
The fact that these batteries can even get close to their traditional competitors that is truly impressive .
Because the batteries are considered ' green technology ' and ' organic , ' the expectation is that they not only last longer than other batteries but break down easier once they 've been discarded .
After all , the primary thrust for the technology is a harmless bacteria that , as far as it sounds , should present only a fraction of the threat posed upon nature by those lithium - ion batteries .
It 's hoped that this radical and exciting technology will one day find its way into automobiles , digital media players , and cellphones .
However , MIT has been working on this tech for about three years , so its practical , marketable application may still be a ways off .

In 2000 , a group of senior Canadian officers was summoned to the top floors of National Defence headquarters in Ottawa for what seemed to be a particularly far - fetched kind of war game .
Their orders were to study the globe and pinpoint the very worst destination on Earth to send a Canadian force .
Headquarters wanted an intractable bundle of military and political problems to see what their planners could make of the situation .
Among the conditions would be fierce local resistance , unfriendly neighbouring countries , a harsh landscape and a logistical nightmare that had bedeviled would - be occupiers in the past .

( Musadeq Sadeq / Associated Press )
By a wide margin , the clear and dubious winner was Afghanistan .
Former commander of the army , Gen . Mike Jeffery , remembers the exercise as a warning : " We chose what we believed was the most demanding piece of terrain , most difficult to get to , most demanding to support strategically , most difficult to operate in , and guess where we were ? "
At the time — this was before 9/11 , remember — intervention in Afghanistan seemed remote .
A year later , however , following the attack on the Twin Towers , NATO plunged into famously isolated and rugged Afghanistan with forces that were demonstrably too small for the task of stabilizing that profoundly damaged mountain nation .
It was NATO 's first combined - forces operation overseas and eight years later it remains locked in a grinding counter - insurgency against the Taliban that is as militarily frustrating as it is deadly .
Supply - side nightmare
From the beginning , the loose - knit NATO command , including its U.S. contingents , underestimated the staying power of the Taliban in their craggy redoubts in the east and in the south of the country where Canada 's forces are now stationed .
They also failed to anticipate how Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province would become an invulnerable sanctuary for indigenous Pashtun guerrillas , which make up the bulk of the Taliban 's combat formations .
A U.S. soldier patrols the outskirts of Bagram , north of Kabul , in March 2009 .
At least 17,000 more U.S. soldiers have been ordered to Afghanistan to bolster the 38,000 already in the country .
( Rafiq Maqbool / Associated Press )
So far in this conflict , media attention has been concentrated on the combat operations against the Taliban as well as on the casualties caused by improvised roadside bombs .
Less note has been paid to Afghanistan as a logistical nightmare where every aspect of geography and climate works against the critical need to supply , feed and arm the 50,000 NATO and other foreign troops , along with 65,000 allied Afghan soldiers .
That is a difficult challenge under the best of conditions .
But Afghanistan is a vast , landlocked nation that is a quarter larger than Iraq and roughly the same size as Germany , and it remains remarkably difficult to get around .
At its centre is a vast series of mostly trackless mountain ranges .
The nation is tied together only by one national highway running around its edges , a modest two - lane strip of pavement that for generations has been the prime target of guerrillas , bandits and local warlords .
Death pass
Afghanistan is surrounded by Iran on the west , Pakistan to the east and south , and the three " stans " Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north .
Even China gets a look - in along the northeast border .
Further to the north , Russia remains a sombre shadow overhanging all .
To military planners and diplomats the need to placate Afghanistan 's neighbours during this conflict has turned into an increasingly expensive struggle to keep basic supply lines functioning as the war escalates .
Over the past nine months , the logistical dilemma for NATO has grown to alarming proportions .
Over 80 per cent of all supplies , including almost all fuel and heavy equipment , has to be brought in through Pakistan , along one of the most hazardous choke - points on Earth , the notorious Khyber Pass , which is now largely dominated by Taliban units and allied tribes .
Given the inability of the Pakistan government to exert security control in this frontier region , military and civilian convoys are now ambushed with growing frequency .
During February , a key supply route was disrupted by several attacks on bridges and roads in the Khyber Pass .
An added uncertainty is the continued willingness of civilian transport drivers to operate in the face of increasing Taliban death threats .
Russia 's ' help '
The growing vulnerability of this route has sent NATO scrambling to find safer alternatives down through the Russian Caucasus , across the Caspian Sea and into Afghanistan via the " Stans . "
To achieve this northern route , Washington needs Moscow 's approval and active support , which has only come , hesitatingly , and at a steeply rising diplomatic price .
Kyrgyzstan President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sign a $ 2 billion aid agreement from Moscow after which Bakiyev said he would be ending American use of a key airbase in his country .
( Mikhail Klimentyev / Kremlin Press Service / Associated Press )
Recently , the first NATO supply train has been permitted to rumble through Russian territory en route to Afghanistan .
Its cargo enters Afghanistan from Uzbekistan , with future shipments expected to come via neighbouring Tajikistan as well .
These new routes are very welcome right now .
But they will be hard pressed to handle the more than 5,000 extra containers a month that will be needed once President Barack Obama follows through with his pledge to send in 17,000 more U.S. troops this spring and summer .
At the moment , these northern routes seem able to handle fewer than 1,000 containers a month .
But even this modest gain has been offset in part by the threatened loss of a functioning NATO airbase at Manas in Kyrgystan , used until now as an important transit point for troops .
Pushed by its benefactor , Moscow , which wanted to put pressure on the new Obama regime , Krygystan 's parliament voted in February to shut down the base later this year .
Cold War politics
Logistical reality has forced the Obama White House to show immediate flexibility and overt good will towards Putin 's Russia in order to get full Russian cooperation on supply .
Some attempt at improved U.S. - Russia relations was in the cards in any case , but the Kremlin knows how to drive a hard bargain .
Now , it appears willing to cooperate on condition that ( a ) it hears no more criticism of Russia 's invasion of Georgia last summer ; ( b ) the U.S. scraps the Bush administration plans for a missile defence program in nearby Poland ; and ( c ) there is a clear indication the U.S. respects Russian concerns about its " near abroad " in Eastern Europe .
This is the price tag and now Pentagon and White House planners are likely looking askance at what Afghanistan has dragged all of NATO into .
A mission that was designed to be wrapped up within a year is now dependent for its very lifeblood on a mistrusted Kremlin inner circle and a little known trio of potentially unstable Central Asian neighbours to avoid the problem of an ambush - alley running through Pakistan .
All these difficulties might have been foreseen had military planners had more time to consider the Afghan invasion following 9/11 .
But civilians throughout NATO were hungry for a tactical win in the new War on Terrorism and seemed not to have taken account of Napoleon 's most famous dictum : " civilians talk tactics ; professionals discuss logistics . "
Ron Paul , the Texas congressman and darling of Libertarians everywhere , has an idea on how the United States can deal with the Somali pirates plaguing international shipping in the Indian Ocean : hire and train some bounty hunters .
The idea , unlike some of Paul ’s proposals , is actually gaining traction in Congress .
The U.S. Navy is too big for the mission .
So , hiring and training bounty hunters to go after the pirates is , as Political Machine put it , “ a classic case of fighting fire with fire . ”
The mechanism would be a little - known power in the Constitution called marque and reprisal .
The provision was used often during the Revolution and the War of 1812 , but not since .
Basically , the law allows the United States to hire private citizens to keep international waters safe .
“ If we have 100 American wannabe Rambos patrolling the seas , it ’s probably a good way of getting the job done , ” said Competitive Enterprise Institute ’s Eli Lehrer .

If Congress does start using the provision , it might want to consider a few amendments .
Under current law , bounty hunters are allowed to keep the ship and any treasure they capture .

Gay and GOProud
Perhaps it ’s a sign of the times .

When even Iowa is signing up for gay marriage , maybe it was inevitable that gay Republicans -- the sacrificial lamb that political guru Karl Rove used to assure George W. Bush ’s 2004 reelection -- would experience growing pains .
That ’s just one possible explanation for a new political organization .
Called GOProud , the new 527 ( tax - exempt ) organization promised a traditional conservative agenda to fill what it called a void in gay Republican politics .
“ Until today , no organization has stood up for gay conservatives and their conservative allies , ” said Jimmy LaSalvia , the group ’s executive director .
That will be news to the granddaddy of the gay GOP movement -- the Log Cabin Republicans , a 30 - year - old organization that has pushed for more inclusiveness in the party ’s politics .
Advertisement
But to hear the GOProud crowd talk , you ’d think that advocating against workplace discrimination is somehow wimpy .
And if you read the organization ’s manifesto -- advocating repeal of inheritance taxes , fighting against global extremists and defending gun rights -- you ’ll notice an allegiance to President Reagan ’s core principles .
“ There are lots of organizations on the gay left working on issues like hate crimes and federal employment discrimination , ” said Christopher Barron , GOProud ’s chairman .
“ But there is no organization working on issues like tax equity , free - market healthcare reform , Social Security reform and other traditionally conservative issues . ”
All of which bemuses William McGurn , former Bush speechwriter , who wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the irony that “ it is the gay wing of the Republican Party which is now advocating for a return to the party ’s Reaganite roots . ”
The group could be a wild card in GOP politics .
An estimated 1.5 million gays and lesbians voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Would that number have been higher if Palin ’s name had been on top ?
That ’s what GOProud is counting on .

In the past , evangelicals and other hard - core conservatives have tried to block the doors of the Republican Party .
But now , with Barack Obama in the White House and the demographic profile of the country leaning Democratic , party leaders are reaching out to young and minority voters , installing Michael Steele as Republican National Committee chairman and promoting Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on the national stage .
The key question : Has Republican public opinion moved on from the Rove strategy of 2004 when he used gay marriage as a wedge issue -- or will this group too be used as a scapegoat ?

The economy ’s gone bust , and so have they .
Scores of professional New York women stripped of their six - figure jobs are now working as “ gentlemen ’s club entertainers ” at upscale Manhattan jiggle joints .
Former Wall Streeters , fashion executives and real - estate agents are pole dancing and stripping for as much as $ 1,500 a night — but also because they like the flexible hours .
Randi Newton used to work at Morgan Stanley before the crash but is now an “ independent contractor , ” pole dancing at Rick ’s Cabaret in Murray
Hill three or four nights a week .
She says she makes “ $ 160,000 a year on tips alone . ” .
She said : “ I went with friends to a strip club and the manager offered me a job as a dancer .
I thought it was different .
And fun . ”
Peter Feinstein , owner of the Sapphire Club on East 60th Street , which opened in January , said , “ I am receiving a lot of applications from women who recently lost their jobs — in particular New York City real - estate agents . ”
Katie Haverton , 27 , is one of them .
She worked as a broker for a large real - estate company for three years until January , when she says she had n’t made a sale in six months and had $ 2 left in her bank account .
She now performs at Flash Dancers in Midtown .
“ With real estate , you can work 10 hours a day showing people apartments and you never know when the next sale will be , ” said Haverton , who lives on the Upper East Side .
“ But with dancing , the money is instant .
Now that I make better money as a stripper than as a real - estate agent , I ’m going to buy my own apartment . ”
Becky , 24 , who lives in the East Village , was a pastry chef before becoming a “ massage girl ” recently at Rick’s .
“ I could n’t find anything after I got laid off because it ’s hard to land a chef job these days , ” said Becky , who asked that her last name be withheld .
Jiggle - joint owners say they are hiring more “ talent ” than ever right now , due to a surge in business .
A rep for Flash Dancers said it receives 40 applications a month to fill just five positions , while 50 candidates a week vie for positions at Rick ’s , said its president , Eric Langdan .
“ These places give men hope , ” Langdan said .
“ Even in the worst of times , for us it ’s the breast of times . ”
Ever wondered about the environmental impact of all those off - brand erectile enhancer pitches and money transfer offers from African ex-royalty ?
Wonder no longer .
According to a report published by computer antivirus and spam filter seller McAfee , the annual sending , receiving and hand - deleting of 62 trillion email spams consumes 33 terawatt hours of energy every year .
Producing that energy emits about 20 million tons of greenhouse gases .
In the translational shorthand of environmentalism , that ’s enough juice to power Chicago for two years , and the greenhouse equivalent of driving 1.6 million cars around the Earth .
The findings have met with a mixed reception .
The report " strikes me as reminiscent of those insipid lost - productivity studies that blame the global recession on March Madness office pools , " wrote Paul McNamara at Network World .
" I ’m just not ready to translate every human endeavor into an environmental forum . "
Though nobody likes having every last decision turned into a morality play , there ’s nothing good about spam .
March Madness pools at least make office life a bit more fun .
Spam , on the other hand , is entirely worthless , and it accounts for between 85 and 97 percent of all email activity .
And though worrying about spam ’s environmental impact is a bit like complaining about the Titanic ’s deck chairs , it ’s still worth fixing .
Eradicating spam might not save the polar ice cap , but the world would be a bit cleaner without it .
Naturally , McAfee did n’t commission the report out of charity .
They say more than half of spam ’s carbon footprint is produced during its end - stage , when users scroll through messages and delete the junk .
That ’s exactly where their product offerings fit .
The report claims that spam filtering reduces end - stage energy consumption by nearly 75 percent .
But that confluence of interest does n’t necessarily invalidate the findings .
My own spam filter — which is not , for the record , a McAfee product — has already plucked 22 messages out of my email stream today , and saved me the trouble of deleting them manually .
" It ’s not just a nuisance , it ’s not just clogging your inbox .
It has a quantifiable environmental impact , " said McAfee researcher Dave Marcus .
" This is a different way of looking at something people can take control of . "

A fund it created with $ 1 million to pay for medical treatment for needy families raised an additional $ 5 million from other donors and has provided treatment to date for some 1,200 families , while a pilot program to use art to enhance learning , currently operating in two New York City schools , attracted $ 937,000 from the federal Department of Education .
“ This is really tragic , ” Jeanne B. Mullgrav , commissioner of the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development , wrote in an e-mail message to Mr. Rosenthal .
“ You and your organization have been such a great partner to the city , the nonprofit sector and to the communities who need support . ”

An indication of where American policy is heading ...
Indeed , one of the most valuable aspects of following news from the UK is that so many of its laws and policies hop across the pond ... sometimes quickly , sometimes in a few years .

Under the program , noncustodial parents certified by a state as having arrearages exceeding $ 2,500 are submitted by the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement ( OCSE ) to the Department of State ( DoS ) , which denies them U.S. passports upon application or the use of a passport service .

As First Lady you have the ability to set the table for what our nation ’s children eat by adding a plank of food justice to your platform .
Many ideas have already been sent your way , including starting an organic garden on the White House lawn and appointing a First Farmer .
But where should you start ?
I request that you make the health of our nation ’s children your platform priority .
Especially with two growing girls to nurture and nourish , you must understand that we will only be successful as a nation when all children in our country are healthy and well - fed .
You have the support of the 44th President .
The Secretary of Agriculture , Tom Vilsack , was quoted yesterday in the Washington Post explaining President Obama ’s goals for the USDA , “ The vision is , he wants more nutritious food in schools . ”
Vilsack went on to depict the role of local foods in that mission : “ In a perfect world , everything that was sold , everything that was purchased and consumed would be local , so the economy would receive the benefit of that . ”
You have a ripe opportunity to make great strides toward that vision with the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act , which is the federal legislation that establishes the guidelines for our nation ’s school meal programs and the Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) program .
Every four or five years , there ’s an opening for all of those concerned with the health of our nation ’s children to evaluate , defend , and improve the federal Child Nutrition Programs .
That time is now as the current Child Nutrition Act expires in September 2009 .

With at least 35 to 40 percent of children ’s daily eating occurring during the school day , a reformed cafeteria could improve the health and increase the capacity to learn for the 30 million children that eat at school 180 days per year .
When you invited Chef Sam Kass into the White House Kitchen , your spokeswoman said “ he happens to have a particular interest in healthy food and local food . ”
Mr. Kass has spoken out previously on the need to change the school lunch menu by decreasing the high levels of sugar and fat .
He ’s right .
Earlier this month the results of the latest school nutrition dietary assessment study by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association exposed that in the 2004 - 2005 school year , only 6 % to 7 % of schools met all nutrition standards .
This is unacceptable .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 25 % of children between the ages of 6 and 11 were overweight in 2007 .
In the late 1970s , that number was only 6.5 % .
The oft - quoted statistic that one in three children born in 2000 will be diabetic in their lifetime ( make that one in two if the child is black or Hispanic ) demonstrates we can’t wait a moment longer to act .
If you make the health of our nation ’s children your priority , you could save countless lives and potentially save us billions of dollars .
Consider the economic stress of diet - induced diseases such as Type II Diabetes , now inflicting youth .
The insulin , needles , test strips , blood sugar monitors , doctor ’s appointments , etc. take a considerable chunk of change .
The average annual expense for a person diagnosed with diabetes is $ 11,744 , of which $ 6,649 is directly attributed to the disease .
Those with diabetes have medical expenses that are 2.3 times higher than those with working pancreases .
Sasha and Malia are fortunate to be eating nutritious local , organic lunches at Sidwells Friends School .
This is what your girls ate at lunch on Tuesday , February 10th :
Organic Vegetarian Chili , Carrot Apple Soup , Roasted Local Beet Salad , Salad du Jour , All Natural Beef Chili , Brown Rice , Steamed Zucchini and Grapefruit Slices
The above shows the solution can be delicious .
How wonderful that you and the President can provide local , fresh and healthy foods for the First Daughters , but what about kids in the rest of the country ?
From your previous neighborhood on the south side of Chicago to your new community in Washington , D.C. with the highest childhood obesity rates in the country , the nutritional divide that stymies the development and potential of youth is an open wound .
The average school cafeteria unfortunately operates on the lowest common denominator of cost , not quality .
The USDA currently reimburses schools $ 2.57 for every free lunch it serves and lower amounts for reduced cost and full price meals .
This leaves about one dollar to cover actual food costs , once labor and overhead costs are factored in .
What do you expect food service directors to feed our kids with on a $ 1.00 ?
Thankfully , kids , parents , food service staff , teachers , farmers , school administration , and other community members have a taste for change and have been working to incorporate fresh , local product — no matter the perceived barriers — through what is called “ farm to school ” programs .
The farm to school movement has not waited for the federal government to make children a priority .
There are over 2,000 known programs in 39 states as reported by the National Farm to School Network , a joint project of the Center for Food and Justice at Occidental College and the Community Food Security Coalition .
Even though I promote from scratch cooking , you do n’t have to start from scratch in your platform .
The Child Nutrition Forum , a collaboration of many groups , including , National Farm to School Network , School Nutrition Association , Food Research and Action Center and School Food FOCUS , has a statement of principles that outlines key issues to champion immediately .
From there you can delve into an extensive menu of ideas such as establishing a national farm to school grant program or strengthening nutrition standards for school meal programs .
On February 26 , I invite you to attend one of two Congressional briefings on farm to school and hear directly from those working every day for a healthy America .
Fulfill your wish to be America ’s Mom - in - Chief by making sure that every child has the nutrients necessary to carry our country forward — now that is a stimulus plan I can believe in .
Sincerely ,
Debra Eschmeyer
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
The Afghan government will change a law that critics say legalizes rape within marriage for Shia Muslims , President Hamid Karzai told CNN Thursday .
Critics had feared that Afghanistan 's new Shiite law would set the nation backward .
Karzai told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he and others were unaware of the provision in the legislation , which he said " has so many articles . "
Karzai signed the measure into law last month .
" Now I have instructed , in consultation with clergy of the country , that the law be revised and any article that is not in keeping with the Afghan constitution and Islamic Sharia must be removed from this law , " Karzai said .
The president 's comments came one day after several hundred demonstrators faced off over the law , which critics say prevents women from declining their husband 's request for sexual intercourse and essentially legalizes marital rape .
The measure applies to the 20 percent of Afghans who are Shia Muslims .
It was part of a nearly 270 - page piece of legislation that was written to solidify the identity of the Shia minority in Afghanistan .
The bill languished in the country 's parliament for a year - and - a - half before it was recently pushed through in what one legislator called a " chaotic " vote .
Women from various parts of Afghanistan marched in the capital Wednesday to protest the law , which has also been criticized by human - rights groups and Western leaders , including U.S. President Barack Obama .
Watch Karzai react to controversial law ahead of Thursday 's comments »
When the demonstrators reached a mosque housing a school run by a conservative Shia cleric who helped implement the law , students came out yelling and cursing and pelted the women with gravel , said Fawzia Koofi , a female member of the Afghan parliament .
Koofi said police did little to protect the women , but a spokesman for the country 's interior minister disputed that .
" Police played a completely neutral role , " said spokesman Zamarai Bashiri .
" The police were able to control the demonstrations very well . "
About 300 to 500 women protested the law while 600 to 700 demonstrators marched in support of it , he said .
The marchers who opposed the law included several female members of Afghanistan 's parliament .
" Both sides were able to express their thoughts and expressions , " Bashiri said .
The law has drawn much criticism .
Watch a report on the law »
" I think this law is abhorrent , " Obama said recently .
" We think that it is very important for us to be sensitive to local culture , but we also think that there are certain basic principles that all nations should uphold , and respect for women and respect for their freedom and integrity is an important principle . "
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also weighed in .
" We very much hope that the draft piece of legislation is to be withdrawn , " Merkel has said .

The solar energy ballot item known as Measure B went down to defeat Thursday , as election officials in Los Angeles finished their count of the remaining 49,000 mail - in , provisional and damaged ballots .
Sixteen days after the election , city officials announced that Measure B had fallen short of a majority , with 50.5 % of voters opposing the plan and 49.5 % in favor of it .
The final count left the measure trailing by 2,644 votes .
The defeat dealt a blow to the hopes of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who had spent $ 145,000 from a campaign committee on behalf of the measure and appeared in a blitz of television commercials promoting it .
But it was also a setback for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , whose top officials had proposed Measure B .
London Gold Fix ( PM ) , Quoted in Dollars
Gold rallied from $ 135 an ounce in 1978 to $ 860 an ounce in 1980 .
The late 70s - 80s gold rush was caused by consumer fears about inflation .
The monthly CPI reading reached 1.5 percent in 1980 .
Gold peaked along with the inflation rate .
From 1980 until late 1999 gold prices trended down .
Gold bottomed near $ 250 an ounce in 1999 .
When gold was making its lows in 1999 , most of the major Central Banks around the world announced they intended to sell - off a large fraction of their gold reserves ( 400 tonnes a year , 2000 tonnes total ) .
Central banks are still selling their gold reserves in 2009 under the most recent agreement made in 2004 ( 500 tonnes a year , 2500 tonnes total ) .
Central banks continue to sell gold and the price continues to rise .
Since the late 1980s the purchases of gold by institutional investors has been rising .
This trend continues and seems to be picking up momentum .
Demand for gold rose sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 , up 27 percent to $ 26.7 billion ( year over year , Q4-2007 versus Q4 - 2008 .
Why gold is going up and should continue to go up .
The strong seasonal tendency in gold .
Gold usually goes down from March to October and usually soars from October to March .
I 'll explain why .
Why the Chinese are fascinated with gold and are likely to purchase enormous amounts of gold .
Why I believe gold is going to perform much like the bull market we saw in oil during 2007 - 2008 .
And , the best ways to invest in gold .

Larry Kudlow acts like gold near $ 1000 is a new thing .
If Larry had been paying attention he would have noticed that gold traded at $ 1000 per troy ounce back in March , 2008 .
After that peak in gold , the price of gold proceeded to crash down to the $ 700 level in November , 2008 .
Gold is now moving up sharply again and it seems that this is disconcerting to Larry .
Perhaps he should look at the current supply / demand statistics and the growing number of institutional investors that see gold as a good alternative investment in their portfolios .
Here is some background and history on gold since 1980 .
The current sharp increase in the price of gold can be explained by the sharp increase in demand .
Much of this demand is coming from retail investors ( GLD ) , institutional investors , and large purchases from China and India .
Central banks continue to sell gold and are in the process of formulating a new plan for selling gold into the market .
The fact that the market continues to take these central bank sales indicates there is good ongoing demand for physical gold ( since 2000 ) .

If “ massive ” is the first word that comes to mind in describing a supposedly green home , chances are you have an oxymoron on your hands .
So before Google ( s GOOG ) cofounder Larry Page gets too far with his plans to build a two - story , 6,000 - square - foot , four - bedroom , GreenPoint - rated house next to his current $ 7 million home in Palo Alto , Calif .
( local building codes prohibit him from putting up one big , big house ) , we ’re going to make like Google Suggest and throw our 2 cents out there .
To be sure , Page plans to use some pretty cool stuff : Recycled materials that have low levels of volatile organic compounds ( or none at all ) , a rooftop garden , solar panels , zinc cladding and pervious pavement , according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
And the planned structure will likely take advantage of smart energy tools —
IT technology that can help the homeowner better manage and reduce energy consumption — in particular Google ’s PowerMeter .
But for all the green building materials and energy - saving devices , it will still be a big , new house requiring more materials and fossil - fuel - burning shipments to build , more energy to heat , cool and light than homes built ( or renovated ) on a smaller scale .
As Salon reported when the “ green mansion ” trend started to take off a few years ago , most of the green elements people incorporate into their homes shrink the environmental impact by some 10 - 50 percent .
But even if you ’re on the high end of that , as Page can afford — and seems inclined — to be , a 50 percent reduction is offset by doubling the home ’s size .
So Page will not only get new digs , but a much bigger carbon footprint .
As Fatima Fedayee clutched a banner that read " Equality Is Our Right , " an angry man charged toward her and knocked her to the ground .
As soon as she picked herself up , another man hurled stones at her .
Then a group of men surrounded her , screaming unsavory epithets .
But Ms. Fedayee kept holding the banner , chanting " Islam means equality ! "
She kept up the rallying cry for more than an hour Wednesday , alongside nearly 300 other women , protesting a law that they say would greatly restrict women 's freedoms .
These demonstrators belong to a women 's movement that has emerged with unusual boldness in recent weeks to fight the law .
Unlike other campaigns around gender issues , this marks one of the few times women have openly confronted the conservative attitudes in this country – and the first time in years they have demanded their rights in a public demonstration .
Like Fedayee , many have withstood hostile , even violent , opposition – sometimes from other women .
" We 've been silent for all of these years , but we can't tolerate this anymore , " Fedayee says .
Law would empower husbands
The law that sparked the outrage – which was passed by both houses of parliament and signed late last month by President Hamid Karzai – regulates the actions of women of the Shiite minority , which makes up about 15 percent of the population .
Among the bill 's many articles , activists point to a few particularly oppressive statutes : that women should get their husband 's permission before leaving the house , and husbands have the right to have sex with their wives whenever they wish .
An outpouring of international criticism has pushed President Karzai to shelve the bill for now and pledge to reconsider any portions of the law that contradict the Afghan constitution , which guarantees equal rights for men and women .
The measure also stipulates that no law should contradict Islam – a fact some conservatives use to argue that the law in question can be reconciled with the constitution .
Although the majority of local opposition to the law started with nongovernmental organizations , the movement has spread to students and others .
Still , the women were vastly outnumbered by angry demonstrators who favor the law – including hundreds of burqa - clad women , who chanted , " God is great !
Long live Islam ! "
Many of these counterprotesters hurled stones and spat on their rivals .
' Do n't make empty promises ! '
The women say they are not cowed .
In recent weeks they have been planning various actions , including media campaigns and phone calls to legislators .
One group formed last week and signed a resolution asking for amendments to the law .
" It is difficult to organize such things in this country , because the conservatives have the power here , " says Fatima Hussaini , who participated in Wednesday 's protest .
The movement is very decentralized , with no individual or group leading it .
At one point during Wednesday 's protest a few women rose with loudspeakers and debated on the spot when they should hold the next protest .
Later , a parliament official emerged to promise that the law would be reviewed .
" When ?
Do n't make empty promises ! " shouted women in the crowd .
" Soon , just give us some time , " the official pleaded .
The women demanded to be heard by high - ranking authorities immediately .
Finally , the man relented .
The women huddled together and nominated some among themselves to enter the Parliament .
Movement draws the young , educated
The women in this new movement are young and educated – most are in high school or university .
Activists say that their ranks number in the hundreds , although it is possible that more support their cause in secret .
Some are NGO workers , others are journalists , and some are teachers .
Many have repatriated from Iran , which is more culturally liberal than Afghanistan .
A few of the women involved say they have experience working on gender issues through NGOs , though none had participated in open political activism before .
Some analysts suggest the Revolutionary Association of Women of Afghanistan , an underground women 's group that resisted the Taliban and mujahideen governments of the 1990s , could be helping to organize the demonstrations .
They remain underground because of their vigorous advocacy of women 's rights , which can be very dangerous here .
Women against women
The biggest challenge the women face may be from other women .
" I can say with confidence that most women support this law , " says activist Fatima Ahazul .
Many say that they have tried in vain to convince friends and relatives to support them .
Afghanistan is widely regarded as one of the world 's most conservative societies , and independent - minded women here are under constant threat .
Some TV presenters and outspoken women 's rights activists have been assassinated in the past .
Earlier this week , the Taliban gunned down a government official and gender equality activist , Sitara Achakzai , in the southern city of Kandahar .
In general , women cannot leave their homes without permission from their husband or father .
Women who back the law say they see it as imposing conditions little different from their daily experiences , and view the controversy surrounding it as a Western attempt to undermine their culture .
" But such women are mainly housewives and illiterates , " argues Ms. Ahazul , the activist .
" Only open - minded and well - educated women oppose the law . "
Cuthbertson Tracked VehicleAround 1958 , this strange looking vehicle conversion was launched by James A Cuthbertson & Sons , of Biggar , in Scotland .
It was designed to go further in adverse off - road conditions than the conventional Land Rover .
A standard Series II long wheelbase Land Rover minus its wheels was dropped onto a sub- frame , and a track fixed around bogeys at each corner with a sprocket that replaces the Land Rover ’s road wheels .
The front tracks are steerable in the conventional way , the tracks turn as a whole for steering - aided by substantial power steering driven from the engine crankshaft pulley .
However when 4 - wheel drive is engaged , each track is powered at each corner with a different motion .
This stops the side to side scrubbing of tracks when turning which tends to happen on conventional tracked vehicles .
The main advantage of this conversion was that it greatly reduced the ground pressure , making it ideal for marshy and wet ground .
The main problem was that it was poor at climbing ' steps ' ( i.e.. banks ) or over obstacles because they lack the front " ramp " of typical tank tracks ..
The tracks would tend to spin if the Rover hit a steep bank whilst traversing marshy land .
The height was both an advantage and a disadvantage .
Ground clearance was increased , but stability was reduced .
Of the estimated 15 examples made , the last of these is thought to have been built around 1972 .

The Recording Industry Association of America 's plan to recruit Internet service providers in its battle against illegal file sharing is now underway .
AT&T and Cox both confirmed to PC World that they have begun cooperating with the RIAA in some form .
Comcast did not say it was working with the RIAA , but did say it was forwarding messages on the behalf of the recording industry to customers .
Still a mystery is to what extent ISPs are cooperating with the RIAA and what it takes to get booted from your ISP for illegally swapping copyright protected content online .
The RIAA announced the shift in its strategy last December : Instead of targeting individual file sharers with lawsuits , as it had done in the past , the organization would work with ISPs to find suspected offenders and -- after a series of warnings -- potentially cut off their Internet access altogether .
The RIAA initially said " major ISPs " would participate , revealing neither specific companies nor a firm timeframe for the program 's launch .
A string of media reports and blog postings today fueled speculation about participation by AT&T , Cox Communications , and Comcast .
Much of the information cited , however , came from unnamed sources and contained conflicting information .
I spoke with representatives from each of the three companies to sort it all out .
RIAA 's Original Plan
The RIAA 's original announcement outlined the following procedure :
• The RIAA contacts an ISP after identifying a suspected illegal file sharer on its network .
• The ISP then forwards a formal warning on to the customer .
• If the activity does n't stop , the ISP sends one or two more warnings .
• If the activity still does n't stop , the ISP may slow down the customer 's access , or ultimately discontinue it .
Cox Communications
That process appears to be essentially what Cox now has in place .
The company passes along any RIAA warnings , a spokesperson tells me , and works with the customer to pinpoint and stop the problem .
It 's the same process Cox has used for years with copyright infringement cases , the spokesperson says , and it has rarely resulted in any complete cutoffs .
" Since the time we implemented our DMCA ( Digital Millennium Copyright Act ) notification process , we 've sent hundreds of thousands of warnings to customers but have only had to terminate the accounts of a tiny fraction of them , " says Cox 's David Deliman .
Less than one - tenth of 1 percent of cases have resulted in account termination , Deliman says .
What 's not clear is what determines whether an account will be terminated , and whether that judgment comes from Cox or from the RIAA .
My request for that information was not answered prior to our publishing deadline .
AT&T
AT&T is participating in a trial program related to illegal file sharing and the RIAA , a spokesperson confirms .
It does not , he says , involve " takedown notices " or a " three strikes and you 're out " type of system .
" This trial is about customer education and deterrence , " AT&T 's Mike Balmoris explains .
" We do not assume or make any accusations of wrongdoing by the customer . "
Aside from stating that the trial was not a " three strikes " plan , as some media outlets had reported , Balmoris would not directly confirm nor deny whether any customer accounts had been or could potentially be terminated as part of the process .
Rather , he simply stated that the company had found the majority of customers stopped the behavior on their own after receiving the notices .
Comcast
Some early reports had suggested Comcast was also involved in an RIAA - oriented plan ; however , a Comcast spokesperson says its policies and procedures have not changed .
" Comcast , like other major ISPs , forwards notices of alleged infringement that we receive from music , movie , videogame , and other content owners to our customers .
This is the same process we 've had in place for years , " says Comcast 's Charlie Douglas .
" While we have always supported copyright holders in their efforts to reduce piracy under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , and continue to do so , we have no plans to test a so - called ' three - strikes - and - you ' re - out ' policy , " he adds .

The Chinese government has again blocked access to YouTube just over a year after it shut off access to the site for hosting footage of the Tibet protests .
China 's firewall allows sporadic access to services like YouTube , but access was shut off on Monday .
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Chinese government was not afraid of the internet - China has more people online than any other nation .
" China 's internet is open enough , but also needs to be regulated by law in order to prevent the spread of harmful information and for national security , " the spokesman said , according to Reuters .
In August last year YouTube pulled a video of a Free Tibet protest after getting a takedown notice from the International Olympics Committee .
This month is the 50th anniversary of the failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule and there have been widespread protests .
Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was more outpsoken than usual when he described life in the country as " hell on earth " and said Tibetan culture and religion was " nearing extinction " .
Chinese authorities have taken similar action against the BBC in the past .
In January they targeted 19 websites , including Google and Baidu , accused of " violating public morality and harming the physical and mental health of youth " .
Thailand , Turkey and Pakistan have all previously banned the video sharing site . ®

The 100 + Most Controversial Films of All - Time
Movie Title Screen Film Title / Year , Director Screenshots
Carnal Knowledge ( 1971 )
D. Mike Nichols
Moviegoers expecting to be titillated were taken aback by this drama 's raw , taboo - breaking examination of misogyny and dysfunctional relationships .
The prurient title of this raw , profanity - laden , taboo - breaking Mike Nichols film ( with a script by satirist and cartoonist Jules Feiffer ) , meaning ' sexual intercourse , ' brought millions of patrons into the theatres for its character - based tale of the exploits and sexual encounters of two Amherst college roommates : shy and naive Sandy ( singer Art Garfunkel ) and narcissistic , predatory womanizer Jonathan ( Jack Nicholson ) .
This striking film with adult subject matter told of their dysfunctional , misogynistic sexual attitudes and ' machismo ' relationships ( and breakups ) with women over a 20 - year period ( from the late - 1940s to the late 60s ) .
It illustrated their fragile male egos and bravado , as it further pushed the boundaries of sex in cinema and challenged the ratings system and the general morals of the time - although the film had little in the way of explicit sex .
A film print was seized by Albany , Georgia officials in 1972 , claiming that it violated obscenity laws , and the manager of the film theatre was arrested ( and convicted , but it was later overturned ) .
It was brought as a major case before the US Supreme Court , which found in 1974 that the film was not obscene and " did not depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way . "
The court ruled that a local Georgia law prohibiting the distribution of the " obscene " material had gone too far .
Nowadays , the film would be considered tame , with its minor amount of nudity or explicit sexual activity , although its dialogue was ripe , candidly frank and open for its time .
It began with the two males ' difficult initiation into sex ( " scoring " with coeds ) during their 1940s student days at Amherst ( with among others , Candice Bergen as the pretty , respectable and intelligent Smith College student Susan whom they both dated ) .
Sandy awkwardly tried to feel Susan 's breasts through her clothes during a date , details of which he later shared with Jonathan .
In the meantime , Jonathan betrayed his friend and dated Susan ( " Myrtle " ) and she lost her virginity to him , unbeknownst to Sandy , although eventually Sandy married Susan and had a family in a typical surburban setting .
The story continued with playboyish Jonathan 's later difficult relationship to voluptuous , big - breasted TV model Bobbie ( Oscar - nominated Ann - Margret ) who he first felt was his sexual salvation - and she soon became his live - in mistress : ( " I took one look at the tits on her , and I knew I 'd never have trouble again " ) .
Jonathan soon resented Bobbie 's hints at becoming more domestic and trapped - hitched , as she vulnerably drowned in depressing despair .
He then berated and insulted her ( " Answer me , you ball - busting , castrating , son of a cunt bitch !
Is this an ultimatum or not ? " ) .
When she cried out and pleaded : " I want you ! " , he answered : " I 'm taken --- by me ! "
He added : " For God 's sake , I 'd almost marry you if you 'd leave me . "
In a revealing close - up , a naked Bobbie sat up against a blank wall ( filmed from the chest up ) , lost in her own thoughts of depression and suicide , and soon after took an overdose of pills .
The film then followed Jonathan into his divorced , burnt - out life in the late 60s and 70s , when he looked back and called ex-wife Bobbie " Queen of the Ballbusters . "
Meanwhile , Sandy was dating 18 year - old free - love advocate and hippie chick Jennifer ( Carol Kane ) in the late 60s .
Finding himself dysfunctionally impotent , Jonathan resorted to using the pleasuring services of paid prostitute Louise ( Rita Moreno in a cameo ) to massage his ego ( and more ) in the film 's final scene .
Obsessively , he had her recite a carefully - worded script ( he yelled at her - " God -damn it !
You 're doing it all wrong " - when she deviated ) while she kneeled between his legs .
After accepting payment of $ 100 , and as he reclined back on a couch , she reassured him as she stroked his thighs : " I do n't think we 're gonna have any trouble tonight . "
She called him " a real man , a kind man " and then went on to encourage him to rise up and be manly : I do n't mean the weak kind the way so many men are .
I mean the kindness that comes from enormous strength , from an inner power so strong that every act , no matter what , is more proof of that power .
That 's what all women resent .
That 's why they try to cut ya down , because your knowledge of yourself and them is so right , so true , that it exposes the lies by which they , every scheming one of them , live by .
It takes a true woman to understand that the purest form of love is to love a man who denies himself to her - a man who inspires worship , because he has no need for any woman , because he has himself .
And who is better , more beautiful , more powerful , more perfect ... you 're getting hard ... more strong , more masculine , extraordinary , more ... bust .
It 's rising , it 's rising ... more virile , domineering , more irresistible .
It 's up - in the air ...
A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 , UK )
D. Stanley Kubrick
The second ( and last ) X - rated Best - Picture nominee , Stanley Kubrick 's evocation of a dystopian future appalled some viewers with its ultra-violence .
At the time , Stanley Kubrick 's randomly ultra-violent , over - indulgent , graphically - stylized film of the near future - and most controversial film - was one of only two movies rated X on its original release ( the other was Midnight Cowboy ( 1969 ) ) that was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award .
The subversive film was hotly debated when it was released - both highly praised and objectionable for its bleak outlook , and for its pairing of comedy with ' ultra - violence ' - including two rape scenes .
[ Two other films that were highly criticized a few years earlier for breaking similar taboos were Sam Peckinpah 's bloody western The Wild Bunch ( 1969 ) , and Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) . ]
The dystopic film about fascist social conditioning and free will , adapted from Anthony Burgess ' novel , was heavily criticized and opposed by religious groups for its sexual and violent content .
Feminists were outraged with some of the misogynistic images - such as the obscene female poses of the supine furniture in the Korova bar , the prolonged rape of a big - breasted ' devotchka ' ( Shirley Jaffe ) on an empty opera house stage to the tune of Rossini ’s The Thieving Magpie , a gigantic penis sculpture being used as a murder weapon on the Cat Lady , a sped - up orgy ( within a threesome composed of two females and a male ) performed to the tune of the William Tell Overture , and a view of the protagonist 's snake gliding toward a woman 's vagina .
The most infamous was the rape scene of a couple in an ultra-modern , opulent house by sociopath Alex 's ( Malcolm McDowell ) gang of derby - hatted droogs ( Pete , Georgie , and Dim ) who were wearing masks with comical noses .
Both victims : red pajama - suit - wearing writer 's wife Mrs. Alexander ( Adrienne Corri ) and elderly husband Frank Alexander ( Patrick Magee ) were bound and gagged , with a rubber ball painfully inserted into their mouths and wrapped with long strips of Scotch tape around their heads .
He was assaulted and kicked on the floor ( with vicious blows of boots to his mid-section ) by Alex who ironically punctuated and timed his rhythmic , soft - shoe kick - dance to his gleeful singing and tap - dancing of the lyrics of Gene Kelly 's tune Singin ' in the Rain .
Mr. Alexander was also forced to helplessly watch the ugly disrobing and choreographed rape of his own wife when Alex cut away her skin - tght jumpsuit and attacked her breasts .
He snipped off two circles of jumpsuit cloth around them to expose them and then in the mode of ' Jack the Ripper , ' he slit her entire suit off from her pant leg upward .
After unzipping and pulling his own pants down prior to her rape , he mocked the husband : " Viddy well , little brother .
Viddy well . "
There was also a gruesome murder with a giant phallic art sculpture that was conducted in a gallery filled with erotic paintings , when lead droog Alex attacked Catlady ( Miriam Karlin ) with a over - sized porcelain dildo .
In a later scene , Alex was subjected to corrective treatment and reprogramming -- experimental aversion therapy imposed by the state in which he was behavioristically conditioned ( with his eyes clamped wide - open in order to view scenes of violence in films while drugged to induce nausea and forced to listen to his beloved Beethoven ) to suppress his violent and aggressive sexual drives and urges - and in the process gave up his own individual and personal rights to become a model citizen .
Alex experienced an orgy dream of eating grapes while surrounded by half - naked , bare - breasted handmaidens ( Jan Adair , Vivienne Chandler , Prudence Drage ) .
That was all that was left to him , to feed his violent and sexual personality .
In a second demonstration to the tune of Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary , he was tempted before a stage actress ( Virginia Wetherell ) - a half - nude woman wearing only bikini panties .
Eyes glazed and on his knees ,
Alex lustfully reached out for her breasts ( filmed both from a low angle and an overhead shot to emphasize their firm ripeness ) .
As he cupped his hands tantalizingly close to her pink - nippled , fleshy protuberances , his urge for sex instantly turned to an urge to vomit and he fell to the floor belching to his former passion .
By the film 's conclusion , Alex , now supposedly " cured , " returned to his former self .
An enigmatic dream - like image came on the screen - with both his free will intact and with his old proclivities for sex and violence .
The final explicit scene emphasized the enormity of the state 's hypocrisy .
In his Ascot fantasy , a nude Alex had found peace and fantasized copulating ( making love to / raping ? ) with a beautiful blonde woman ( Katya Wyeth ) who wore only black silk stockings .
They were frolicking in slow - motion on piles of white snow , while two rows of genteel - looking , Victorian Londoners ( ladies and gentlemen ) , the men dressed in top hats and the women carrying parasols , looked on and sedately applauded toward them .
Alex had reverted to his old , pre-conditioned , natural behavior .
In voice - over , he triumphantly and sardonically uttered : " I was cured all right . "
Because of the copy - cat violence ( some gangs in the UK dressed as droogs sang " Singin ' in the Rain " as they carried on violently ) that the film was blamed for by the media and courts , Kubrick withdrew it from circulation in Britain about a year after its release .
Some believed it was because it was rumored that Kubrick and his family had received death threats .
It was n't officially available there again - in theaters or on video - until 2000 , a year after his death .
The Devils ( 1971 , UK )
D. Ken Russell Ken Russell 's historical drama about womanizing priests , sex - crazed nuns , hypocrisy and hysteria in 17th - century France was banned in deeply Catholic Italy .
Ken Russell directed this blasphemous , shocking and excessive depiction of the repressive 17th century when sexuality was equated with Satanism - a loose adaptation of Aldous Huxley 's " The Devils Of Loudon . "
The film 's setting was the fortified city of Loudon , 150 miles southwest of Paris , in the year 1634 .
It provoked protest and outrage from Christian groups and viewing audiences everywhere .
It was banned outright in Italy and its stars ( Redgrave and Reed ) were threatened with three years ' jail time if they entered the country .
The film was vilified and met with outrage in its story of a womanizing ( non-celibate ) , vain , libertine , rebellious activist renegade - priest Father Urbain Grandier ( Oliver Reed ) who faced questioning and persecution for his " diabolic possession " of the local , repressed Ursuline nuns .
It included Vanessa Redgrave as tormented hunchbacked Sister Jeanne , who had unfulfilled , warped sexual desires for Grandier and expressed them through self - mutilation and self - flagellation .
The only way the monarchy of Inquisition - obsessed France ( including Cardinal Richelieu ( Christopher Logue ) and King Louis XIII 's ( Graham Armitage ) establishment ) could destroy the Protestant - leaning French town of Loudon was to attack the liberal religious leader as a sorcerer and practitioner of witchcraft .
When the priest impregnated nobleman 's cousin Philippe ( Georgina Hale ) , married wealthy heiress Madeleine Dubroux ( Gemma Jones ) in secret , and then refused to remove the city walls around his fortified town , fanatical witch - hunter and exorcist Father Barre ( Michael Gothard ) was quickly dispatched to question , torture ( headscrews , nails into hands , etc ) , tie up , and execute the profligate priest .
During the proceedings , possessed nuns , led by Sister Jeanne 's denunciations , performed orgiastic rituals publicly in Church to bolster claims against him .
In the controversial staged mock exorcism scene , dubbed the orgiastic " rape of Christ " sequence , the sexually - hysterical nuns acted as if they were possessed , due to threats of execution from one of the church 's accusers .
The crazed nuns displayed full - frontal nudity , and masturbated with ( or raped ) a large - sized crucifix or effigy of Jesus that they pulled down from the wall , while Father Mignon ( Murray Melvin ) watched from afar and committed self - abuse under his robe ( an excised scene before the film 's release ) .
As a result , Grandier was convicted of obscenity , blasphemy , and sacrilege , and burned alive at the stake .
Prior to the film 's release , the " rape of Christ " sequence was censored .
And the scene of Grandier 's burning - at - the - stake torture as a heretic was shortened .
A scene at the end of the film was mostly edited out - of Sister Jeanne masturbating with the charred thighbone of Grandier after he was executed .
The film contained graphic depictions of open sores and medieval medicine treatments for the plague ( with hornets ) .
Dirty Harry ( 1971 )
D. Don Siegel Was San Francisco cop Harry Callahan 's contempt for modern criminal - justice protocols a liberal critique of vigilantism or reactionary propaganda ?
Debate raged .
Director Don Siegel 's sensational police drama was a seminal vigilante film of the decade , appealing especially because of its overt violence and occasional glimpses of nudity .
Dirty Harry took its name from the fact that its unorthodox title character , San Francisco Inspector Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) , became embroiled with the most challenging and controversial ( ' dirty ' ) cases of urban crime , often using tactics of police brutality and an attitude of " take - no - prisoners " that ignored criminals ' rights in order to restore victims ' rights and create public order .
Callahan 's open contempt for normal Miranda law restrictions illustrated his belief that criminals must be stopped - by any means , since traditional law enforcement ( " by the book " ) tactics were n't effective .
He followed his own unconventional philosophy of justice by using " excessive force , " ruthless methods , and " the end justifies the means " principle without much regard for the rules and legal regulations of his profession .
Often , his methods were as vicious , taunting , sadistic and violent as the behavior of the criminals he opposed .
Advertising posters for the film read : " You do n't assign him to murder cases ... You just turn him loose , " and " He does n't break murder cases .
He smashes them . "
The film reflected a pervasive fear of crime during the early 1970s .
This seminal vigilante film of the decade , joined The French Connection ( 1971 ) , the UK's Get Carter ( 1971 ) , Death Wish ( 1974 ) featuring a vengeful vigilante killer Charles Bronson ( and an awful rape sequence ) , Walking Tall ( 1973 ) , The Seven - Ups ( 1973 ) , and the Australian film Mad Max ( 1979 ) with Mel Gibson .
Countless other cop-action films have been made to copy this original law - and - order film that was one of the first to appear on movie screens .
Siegel 's film was considered sensational because of its overt violence ( reflecting the early 70s era of rising crime and calls for ' law and order ' ) and occasional glimpses of nudity .
The duelling combatants ( the cop and the criminal ) throughout the film were an individualistic , unconventional , neo - fascist , super - hero police detective with a .44 Magnum weapon who threw away the rule book , and his complementary opposite - a pathological , malevolent and sadistic criminal named Scorpio ( similar to SF 's real - life Zodiac Killer , played by Andy Robinson ) who demanded an extortionist ransom of $ 100,000 , both shared traits of brutal violence and insanity .
The police thriller spawned many debates about the political stance of the film and the complex issue of the conflicting rights of victims , suspects , and society .
Was it a reactionary message piece against imperfect , " liberal " judicial trends that let ' sicko ' criminals get away , literally , with murder ?
Or was Siegel encouraging audiences to empathically identify with the indiscriminate vengeance of the violent , fascist , anarchic , unrestrained vigilante ' killer ' on the side of the law who acted as an autonomous police power ?
The Last Picture Show ( 1971 )
D. Peter Bogdanovich
Obscene or mature ?
Peter Bogdanovich 's melancholy look at adultery , alcoholism and promiscuity in 1950s Texas divided moviegoers and critics .
Director Peter Bogdanovich's R-rated frank and realistic black and white drama told about the dreams and loves of small - town Texans in the early 1950s , confronting various issues such as adultery , alcoholism , and promiscuity .
Although the adult - themed film was nominated for eight Oscars ( with two wins for supporting performers ) , some considered it obscene for its full frontal nudity and explicit sexual situations .
The film was reportedly banned in Phoenix , Arizona in 1973 after a showing at a drive - in theatre , following complaints by the city attorney that it violated a state obscenity statute .
Arguments in federal court focused on the nudity in a nude swimming party scene , and eventually the courts disagreed over whether it was obscene , and threw the case out .
The film 's most controversial scene was at an indoor pool party in which the country - club - set teenagers enjoyed skinny - dipping ( with full frontal nudity of both sexes ) .
At the pool party , a stark naked Bobby Sheen ( Gary Brockette ) greeted Lester and rich , ravishingly beautiful , self - centered town tease Jacy Farrow ( Cybill Shepherd in her debut film ) when they arrived , labeling them : " New victims . "
While the others engaged in water fights , Bobby ( who joked about being " dressed informally " ) stepped out of the water to shake Lester 's hand .
His nude girlfriend Annie - Annie Martin ( Kimberly Hyde ) also emerged from the private indoor pool , joined Bobby and asked the newcomers : " Wanna join the club ? "
Neophyte Jacy was challenged to get undressed out on the diving board as part of the initiation rites ( " so everybody gets to watch " ) .
The whole naked group of teenaged boys and girls eagerly sat by the edge of the pool to watch " the strip show . "
Nervously and gingerly , Jacy removed her white shoes and white coat and climbed out onto the diving board for a strip - tease .
Fearing that she would lose her balance , Jacy complained : " Goodness , I hope I do n't fall off this thing . "
She slowly removed her full - length dress , her silky white slip , unhooked her garters and slid off each stocking , and then took off her garter belt .
As she was unfastening her bra top , she almost fell and prevented tumbling into the water by sitting down on the board .
Then in one dramatic gesture , she yanked off her bra top and flung it on top of her pile of clothes .
Finally , she slid off her panties and tossed them at Bobby 's ten year old brother who surfaced beneath the end of the board .
She was cheered as she hopped into the water - completely naked , although she had forgotten to remove Duane 's present .
Realizing that the watch had stopped working , she shrugged and smiled at Bobby .
Neophyte Jacy's bid for acceptance from the rich set of kids had succeeded - she had attracted the attention of the wealthy young playboy .
In another scene , the calculating , fortune - hunting Jacy experienced an aborted deflowering with football - playing boyfriend Duane Jackson ( Jeff Bridges ) in the Cactus Motel in the dying Texas town .
Ducktailed Duane entered Room 8 where he found Jacy standing in the room wearing a thin nightgown .
They kissed and embraced , vowing their love .
They sat on the bed and Duane began unbuttoning the top of Jacy 's gown , and then exposed her breasts .
As she laid back on the motel bed and half - closed her eyes , she encouraged him : " Oh Duane , hurry . "
He hurriedly and eagerly removed his clothes and lay on top of her .
But then she asked in an annoyed tone why he was taking so long to penetrate her while being suspended over her : " Are n't you gonna do it ?... What do you mean ?
How could anything be wrong ?
Just go on and do it . "
She blamed his Mexico trip for his limp impotence : " No telling what you got down there .
I just hate you .
I do n't know why I ever went with you . "
She was furious about his sexual incompatibility and their aborted love - making , and ordered him to put his clothes back on ( " You think I wanna sit around here and look at you nekkid ? " ) .
And she feared that she might " never get to not be a virgin " - and thereby win Bobby Sheen 's heart .
She was also worried that classmates might ridicule them when they found out about their unsuccessful and clumsy encounter , and she confirmed what her mother had forecast : " I think you 're the meanest boy I ever saw .
My mother was dead right about you . "
She instructed him to " not tell one soul - you just pretend it was wonderful , " and then threw her panties at his face .
She told her admiring girlfriend - classmates : " I just ca n't describe it in words . "
Later , at the same motel in Room 9 , Jacy gave Duane a second chance to deflower her - using him to provide an entree to dating Bobby Sheen .
This time , he succeeded without an audience outside to witness the post -rites of passage .
Straw Dogs ( 1971 , US / UK )
D. Sam Peckinpah
A graphic double rape and its aftermath made Sam Peckinpah 's movie about a mild - mannered mathematician driven to explosive violence a hot - button topic .
This disturbing film further ignited controversy over screen violence and misogynistic sexual abuse of women in the early 70s , especially due to its graphic double rape scene , which led to a cathartic eruption and escalation of violence .
[ The film was remade in 2011 by director Rod Lurie in a contemporary Deep South setting with the same amount of violence . ]
The unflinching film from Sam Peckinpah ( following his equally divisive film The Wild Bunch ( 1969 ) ) starred Dustin Hoffman as David Sumner , a bookish , mild - mannered American mathematician on sabbatical living in a rural England town - the childhood village of his teasingly - seductive young bride Amy ( Susan George ) .
To incite the sexual interest of local roof construction workers , Amy removed her sweater and deliberately stood topless in full view next to an upstairs window , although her husband had cautioned her : " Do n't forget to draw the curtains . "
After she flaunted herself flirtatiously in view of the local townsfolk , in the scene preceding the rape ( the first of two ) , the provocative Amy invited local laborer - thug ( and ex- boyfriend ) Charlie Venner ( Del Henney ) into her isolated farmhouse for a drink .
He forcibly kissed her and although she protested unconvincingly ( " Please leave me " ) .
He dragged her by the hair to the sofa , as he struck her again and began tearing at her blue robe and continued kissing her .
He tore her white top , leaving her breasts exposed , before he raped her .
The controversy stemmed from the idea that Amy was sexually excited by the aggressive violation that she was facing .
At first , she struggled and called out " No , " but then surrendered to his kisses .
In some ways , she did n't resist but submitted , although she was under tremendous duress .
When he held her down , ripped off her panties and began removing his shirt , she helplessly begged : " Easy , " and meanwhile fantasized about her husband above her .
She showed obvious enjoyment and lovingly kissed her assailant and stroked his shoulders and chest during and after being entered , and begged for comfort : " Hold me . "
However , she was also shedding tears , feeling both humiliated and disgraced .
However , that was n't the case when she was forcibly raped a second time by local workman Norman Scutt ( Ken Hutchison ) .
The film was accused of implying that she brought on the assault ( possibly as a means to insult her impassive husband ) and actually might have enjoyed the first rape ( a glamorization of rape ) .
The climactic , stunning and barbaric ending also appeared to morally endorse vigilante violence , especially because of the main character 's redemptive yet unsatisfying homicidal rampage .
It was re-edited for an R-rating and faced censorship bans in England for 30 years .
The UK newspaper the Sunday Times which regularly compiles a Rich List has now made a Green Rich List .
The world ’s wealthiest seem to have a recession proof taste for investments in areas as diverse as electric cars , solar power and geothermal energy .
The total wealth of the Green 100 is nearly £ 267 billion ( $ 375 billion ) .
There are 100 tycoons or wealthy families worth £ 200 m or more who have made either serious investments in green technology and businesses or hefty financial commitments to environmental causes .
The list is dominated by America ’s wealthiest financiers and entrepreneurs such as Warren Buffett ( worth £ 27 billion ) and Bill Gates ( worth £ 26 billion ) .
Top dogs amongst the world ’s richest tycoons and entrepreneurs who have embraced environmentalism and sustainability .
These legendary investors , who regularly swap places at the top of Forbes magazine ’s annual list of world billionaires , have spent some of their financial firepower on areas such as wind power and electric cars in Buffett ’s case , while Gates has backed alternative fuels such as oil from algae .
We are not talking trifling sums here .
Buffett has invested $ 230 m in the Hong Kong battery - maker BYD .
Many of the 35 Americans in the Top 100 are drawn from Silicon Valley .
Having made their first fortunes in microchips , the internet or software , the likes of Google ’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin ( each worth £ 7.5 billion ) are turning to green investments with all the entrepreneurial zeal that made their first fortunes .
Not doubt even more spurred on by the Obama administration and it ’s huge stimulus package involving the very technologies that green investors are focusing on .
Even tycoons who are not in President Barack Obama ’s camp have moved into alternative energy , none more so than T Boone Pickens , oil explorer , corporate raider and a Texan Republican to his core .
He is using part of his £ 1.8 billion fortune on filling the huge and windy Texas Panhandle with turbines as part of his Pickens Plan to wean America off its dependence on foreign energy .
American money may be chasing smarter and greener technologies , while the Chinese rich on our list are definitely about mass production of green technologies .
The 17 Chinese tycoons in the Top 100 are concentrated at the bottom end of the list and they are almost exclusively involved in solar and electric - car technology .
It is a ferociously competitive market with unremitting pressure to cut costs and gain market share .
The Chinese fortunes have plunged as share prices have dropped sharply .
A year ago , many would have been in the Top 50 , but not now .
Indeed , some of them will not survive the steep downturn they are now battling through .
But out of it will emerge winners selling much cheaper and more technically advanced products to a huge market worldwide .
None of the 10 Brits on the list are competing with the Chinese in mass production .
And they are not taking the German route .
The seven German tycoons are largely involved in wind turbines and the like .
This is a bespoke market — meat and drink to the German industrial sector .
The pity is that aside from Sir Richard Branson , who is investing in alternative fuels , there are no real British equivalents of Aloys Wobben .
A German engineering graduate , Wobben started Enercon in 1984 , building his first wind turbine in his back garden .
Today the company employs 6,000 staff and exports sophisticated turbines all over the world .
German entrepreneurs who have made their fortunes elsewhere are also moving into green technology in a serious way , defying the prevailing economic gloom .
Twins Andreas and Thomas Strungmann built a £ 6.8 billion pharmaceutical fortune .
Having sold their pharma business , they put many millions into saving a German solar company early last year just as the economic outlook worsened .
America ’s wealthy are not just investing in new technology , they are also spending their fortunes on direct environmental activism , saving large tracts of wilderness from developers , endowing university research into green energy , climate change and the like .
This can have a huge impact in changing the mood in favour of more green activism on the political front , making the climate right for Obama to push through radical green initiatives that would not have been contemplated in George Bush ’s presidency .
There is little evidence of any appetite among Britain ’s super - rich for this approach .
Firmly rooted in property , finance or retailing , they have little time or surplus wealth for anything other than lip service to green issues .
They are also involved in firefighting to keep their businesses afloat .
When the recession is over , there are precious few forecasters who think the City and the like will return to its glory days .
And with traditional factories and industries closing in record numbers , the only hope is with small ecopreneuers such as Dale Vince of Ecotricity .

Israeli human rights organizations say , in response to the Israeli military 's speedy closing of internal investigation files of war crimes in “ Operation Cast Lead ” :
The speedy closing of the investigation raises suspicions that sole purpose in opening it was to clear the military of any blame for illegal activity during the operation .
The internal investigation ignored a significant amount of material that was collected and that coincides with soldiers ' testimonies recently publicized in Israeli media .
In addition , the Military Advocate General disregarded allegations that several of the commands given during the military operations were illegal .
It is clear that in this case , the Military Police Criminal Investigations Department ( MPCID ) has decided to focus on the individual soldier , a measure which is neither effective nor reliable .
" The closing of the military 's own investigation only strengthens the need for the Attorney General to allow for an independent non-partisan investigative body to be established in order to look into all Israeli military activity during ‘ Operation Cast Lead ' , " say the organizations .
MILAN ( Reuters ) - Sunny
Italy expects to more than double its installed photovoltaic capacity used to turn sunlight into power to 900 megawatt ( MW ) by the end of 2009 on the back of government incentives , state - run agency GSE said on Friday .
Italy saw 338 MW of photovoltaic ( PV ) capacity installed in 2008 alone , the third - biggest annual rise in PV capacity in the world , on a par with the United States and behind Spain and Germany , the power management agency said in a statement .
Italy ’s PV market got a boost after the government approved new incentives for the sector in 2007 .
The incentives , considered by experts among the most generous in Europe , lured investors ranging from families to sports car maker Ferrari .
As of April 1 , about 34,000 new PV installations with a total capacity of 435 MW had started up in Italy after the new incentives kicked in in mid-2007 , GSE said in an update of the country ’s PV capacity .
That compared to about 2,500 PV installations with a total capacity of 22 MW which were launched over about 2 years after the first incentive scheme was introduced in 2005 , according to GSE data .
“ If the requests for incentives ( which follow the installation of modules ) continued at the current pace , the number of installations operating in Italy could exceed 70,000 by the end of 2009 with a total capacity of 900 MW , ” GSE said .
GSE ’s forecast is more ambitious than that of the Italian PV industry group GIFI which last month estimated the total installed PV capacity in Italy would rise to 600 - 650 MW by the end of this year .
Italy ’s total PV installed capacity stood at about 440 MW at the end of 2008 , according to GSE data .
As of April 1 , Italy ’s southern region of Puglia had the biggest installed capacity , of 56.5 MW , while the northern region of Lombardy had 5,372 installations , the largest number in the country , GSE data showed .
Blowing Bubbles
by Doug French by Doug French
This article is the introduction to Doug French ’s new book Early Speculative Bubbles and Increases in the Supply of Money .
As all the world economies writhe in financial pain from the cleansing of the largest bubble in financial history , the same question is being asked — how could this happen ?
Of course the usual answers are trotted out — human greed , animal spirits , criminal fraud , or capitalism itself .
Modern financial history has been a series of booms and busts that seem to blend together making one almost indistinguishable from the next .
The booms seduce even the most conservative into taking what in retrospect appear to be outlandish risks speculating on investment vehicles they know nothing about .
In response to the financial meltdown , central banks are slashing interest rates to nearly zero and growing their balance sheets exponentially .
With no more room to lower rates , central bankers now speak of a “ quantitative easing ” policy which in plain English means “ creating money out of nowhere . ”
But no one is shocked or horrified by this government counterfeiting .
All this , after the US central bank ( the Federal Reserve ) has already , at this writing , increased the M2 money supply by 11 times since August of 1971 when the US dollar ’s last faint ties to gold were severed .
While history clearly shows that it is this very government meddling in monetary affairs that leads to financial market booms and the inevitable busts that follow , mainstream economists either deny that financial bubbles can occur or that the “ animal spirits ” of market participants are to blame .
Economists running central banks even claim that it is impossible to identify asset bubbles .
Meanwhile , the Austrian school stands alone in pointing the finger at government intervention in monetary affairs as the culprit .
Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. Hayek ’s Austrian business - cycle theory provides the framework to explain speculative bubbles .
The Austrian theory points out that it is government ’s increasing the supply of money that serves to lower interest rates below the natural rate or the rate that would be set by the collective time preferences of savers in the market .
Entrepreneurs react to these lower interest rates by investing in “ higher order ” goods in the production chain , as opposed to consumer goods .
Despite these actions by government , consumer time preferences remain the same .
There is no real increase in the demand for higher order goods and instead of capital flowing into what the unfettered market would dictate — it flows into malinvestment .
The greater the monetary expansion , in terms of both time and enormity , the longer the boom will be sustained .
But eventually there must be a recession or depression to liquidate not only inefficient and unprofitable businesses , but malinvestments in speculation — whether it is stocks , bonds , real estate , art , or tulip bulbs .
This book was my master ’s thesis ( with just a couple slight changes and additions ) written under the direction of Murray Rothbard and examines three of the most famous boom and bust episodes in history .
Government monetary intervention , although different in each case , engendered each : Tulipmania , the Mississippi Bubble , and the South Sea Bubble .
As the 17th century began , the Dutch were the driving force behind European commerce .
Amsterdam was the center of this trade and it was in this vibrant economic atmosphere that tulipmania began in 1634 and climaxed in February 1637 .
At the height of tulipmania , single tulip bulbs were bid to extraordinary amounts with the Witte Croonen tulip bulb rising in price 26 times in a month ’s time .
But when the market crashed : “ [ s ] ubstantial merchants were reduced almost to beggary , ” wrote Charles Mackay , “ and many a representative of a noble line saw the fortunes of his house ruined beyond redemption . ”
What made this episode unique was that the government policy did not expand the supply of money through fractional reserve banking which is the modern tool .
Actually , it was quite the opposite .
The Dutch provided a sound money policy that called for money to be backed one hundred percent by specie , which attracted coin and bullion from throughout the world .
Free coinage laws then generated more money from this increased supply of coin and bullion than what the market demanded .
This acute increase in the supply of money fostered an atmosphere that was ripe for speculation and malinvestment , manifesting itself in the intense trading of tulips .
The Bank of Amsterdam , which was at the center of tulipmania , was an inspiration for one of history ’s most notorious currency cranks — John Law .
Gifted in math , Law learned the banking business from his father in Scotland .
But after his father died , the young Law had more interest in games of chance and women .
During the day he would write pamphlets on money and trade while enjoying the social life at night .
Law made various proposals to governments around Europe for what we would call today a central bank and was turned down until 1716 when one of Law ’s partying friends , the Duke of Orléans , assumed control of the French government after Louis XIV died .
The French government was on the verge of bankruptcy , and its citizens were fed up with their government ’s currency depreciation , recoinage schemes , and increased tax collections .
The situation was ripe for Law ’s monetary magic .
Law sought to “ lighten the burden of the King and the State in lowering the rate of interest ” on France ’s war debts and to increase the supply of money to stimulate the French economy , with the opening of General Bank , owned 25 percent by Law and 75 percent by the King , and the formation of a series of companies that when ultimately merged together were known as the Mississippi Company .
Two years into his system , the regent granted Law ’s request that the General Bank be made part of the state , becoming the Royal Bank , patterned after the Bank of England .
With the Royal Bank creating vast amounts of paper currency , Mississippi Company share prices took off which led Law to issue more shares , using the capital to refinance more of the government ’s debt .
Ultimately , the scheme unraveled , despite Law demonetizing gold and silver so that only royal banknotes and Mississippi Company shares would circulate as money .
An outraged French public ultimately forced the regent to place the once - revered Law under house arrest .
While John Law was struggling to keep his Mississippi bubble inflated , across the English Channel , a nearly bankrupt British government looked on with envy , believing that Law was working a financial miracle .
It was anything but , however Sir John Blunt followed Law ’s example with his South Sea Company , which in exchange for being granted monopoly rights to trade with South America , agreed to refinance the government ’s debt .
As the price of South Sea Company shares rose , as in the case of Law ’s system , more shares were sold and more government debt refinanced .
The company had no real assets , but that did n’t matter as speculators bid the share price higher and higher , spawning the creation of dozens of other “ bubble companies . ”
The South Sea Company lobbied the British government to pass a Bubble Act that would shut down these new companies that were competing for investor capital .
Ironically , it was the enforcement of that act that burst the bubble with South Sea Company shares falling nearly 90 percent in price .
Beloved British statesman Sir Robert Walpole reorganized the technically bankrupt South Sea Company , and it remained in business for years .
Although these episodes occurred centuries ago , readers will find the events eerily similar to today ’s bubbles and busts : low interest rates , easy credit terms , widespread public participation , bankrupt governments , price inflation , frantic attempts by government to keep the booms going , and government bailouts of companies after the crash .
Although we do n’t know what the next asset bubble will be , we can only be certain that the incessant creation of fiat money by government central banks will serve to engender more speculative booms to lure investors into financial ruin .

Swimmer Nick D'Arcy could face a maximum two - year jail sentence over an assault which led him to be dropped from the Australian squad for the Beijing Olympics .
D'Arcy has pleaded guilty to punching Simon Cowley at a Sydney bar in 2008 .
The attack left the former Olympian with five metal plates in his face .
At D'Arcy 's pre-sentence hearing in Sydney , the Crown said intoxication and poor impulse control led to his crime .
Earlier , D'Arcy 's lawyers said Cowley had slapped the swimmer just before the attack and had then moved towards him to shake his hand .
It was then that D'Arcy punched the former Olympian .
D'Arcy 's lawyers argue the attack was not premeditated and it was possible he thought he was defending himself .
He will be sentenced at the end of March .
' Proving his manhood '
Magistrate John Favretto said it was clear D'Arcy had little self - control when drinking , but was not necessarily using excessive force when he punched Cowley .
" He is a young man , a very fit young man , " he said during sentencing submissions in Sydney 's Downing Centre Local Court .
" It is not that he necessarily used excessive force ... sometimes it's how the punch is thrown .
" Young people in particular seem to need to prove their manhood and they do that physically and violently instead of walking away . "
D'Arcy 's lawyer , Richard Jankowski , said his client should not be given a custodial sentence because he had already suffered enough .
As well as being booted off the Olympic squad , D'Arcy had endured intense " media harassment " , he said .
He had shown sufficient contrition and remorse , pleaded guilty and admitted having a drinking problem requiring treatment , Mr Jankowski said .
" His real problem has been consumption of alcohol followed by a change of attitude , " he said .
" Other than that there 's nothing on his record or nothing in his history that suggests he would offend in any other way . "
Mr Jankowski said D'Arcy needed to undergo treatment for his drinking problem to minimising the risk of reoffending , and a custodial sentence was not necessary .
" He should be allowed to continue to develop and to mature and to fulfil that potential that clearly is demonstrated in his curriculum vitae , together with what is expressed by his referees , " Mr Jankowski said .
Mr Favretto was also asked to consider not recording a conviction , as it could jeopardise D'Arcy 's future swimming career overseas .
However , prosecutor Peter Aitken argued D'Arcy should be jailed , then given a supervision order and forced to give up alcohol altogether once released .
But Mr Favretto said a total alcohol ban would be setting D'Arcy up to fail and could damage his chances of rehabilitation .
" Consistent with maturity and rehabilitation , the ability to consume alcohol is a proper social part of ordinary life and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with it , " he said .
" It could be detrimental to his rehabilitation . "
Mr Favretto said taking control away from someone who was being treated for an impulse control problem was not a good idea .
D'Arcy left the court flanked by his lawyers and declined to talk to waiting media .

China says cyber attacks are a global challenge
China has denied involvement in the electronic spy network which researchers say infiltrated computers in government offices around the world .
The spokesman of the Chinese embassy in London said that there was no evidence to show Beijing was involved .
He suggested the findings were part of a " propaganda campaign " by the Tibetan government in exile .
The research was commissioned by the Dalai Lama 's office alarmed by possible breaches of security .
' Pieced together '
In an official statement , Liu Weimin writes that the report by Canadian researchers at the Information Warfare Monitor is " just some video footage pieced together from different sources to attack China " .
Mr Liu stresses that in China " it is against the law to hack into the computers of others " .
Cyber attacks , he says , are " a global challenge " requiring global co-operation .
" China is an active participant in such co-operation in the world . "
The report said that the electronic network had infiltrated 1,295 computers in 103 countries , including computers belonging to foreign ministries and embassies .
' No conclusive evidence '
The Canadian researchers had been approached by the office of the Dalai Lama , who feared the computers of his Tibetan exile network had been infiltrated .
The researchers said that while the network was based mainly in China , there was no conclusive evidence China 's government was behind the infiltration .
They said ministries of foreign affairs of Iran , Bangladesh , Latvia , Indonesia , Philippines , Brunei , Barbados and Bhutan appeared to have been targeted .
Compromised
The researchers said hackers were apparently able to take control of computers belonging to several foreign ministries and embassies across the world using malicious software , or malware .
" We uncovered real - time evidence of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems , extracting sensitive documents from the private office of the Dalai Lama . "
They said they believed the system , which they called GhostNet , was focused mainly on governments in Asia .
Oh , God , a thousand times YES !!!!!!!!
This torture business may be causing me sleepless nights , due to the sheer enormity of the evil we ’re talking about , but at least it ’s leading to hilarious developments now and again .
First , Christopher Hitchens got waterboarded , an act suggested by his editor because of Hitch ’s reputation as a total asshole spectacular journalist :
And now , even douchier Sean Hannity just offered to be waterboarded for charity .
From Charles Grodin ( he has a show ? ) :
GRODIN : You ’re for torture .
HANNITY : I am for enhanced interrogation .
GRODIN : You do n’t believe it ’s torture .
Have you ever been waterboarded ?
HANNITY : No , but Ollie North has .
GRODIN : Would you consent to be waterboarded ?
We can waterboard you ?
HANNITY : Sure .
GRODIN : Are you busy on Sunday ?
HANNITY : I ’ll do it for charity .
I ’ll let you do it .
I ’ll do it for the troops ’ families .

L行ってきた たぶん自分のマイブームと発表のあったテーマ色々が一致したためだと思いますが、
今年は例年と比べても特に楽しかったです。
Ypsilon の藤田さんと同じ部屋だったりして色々お話聞かせていただいた。やっほい。
様相論理とステージ計算（要は quote と unquote みたいなのがあるλ計算）の間の同型対応の話が何件もあってどれも面白かったです。 " ◇ " の計算的意味はなんだろう、というのがまだ自分の中で確固としたイメージにならずもやもやしています。 考えたい。 あとは、↓の方を見ていただければおわかりのように自分の中で限定継続ブームだったので、
そちら方向の発表もどれも興味深かったです。
亀山先生の発表に出てきた例で、うろおぼえですが (* ' general ' fibnacci : gib x y n で初期値x , yのフィボナッチ的関数の第n項 *) let gib x y = let rec loop n = if n = 0 then x else if n = 1 then y else loop ( n - 1 ) + loop ( n - 2 ) という関数を、できるだけ構造を崩さずに、nを与えるとそのnに特化したコードを生成する関数に変えるというのがあって、
let sgib x y = let rec loop n = if n = 0 then x else if n = 1 then y else < ~( loop ( n - 1 ) ) + ~( loop ( n - 2 ) ) > これだと、こんな感じの < fun x y -> ~( sgib < x > <y > 5 ) > == > < fun x y -> ( ( y+x ) +x ) +( y+x ) +( ( y+x ) +x ) > y+x を何回も計算するコードになる。メモ化しても「このコードを高速に生成する関数」になるだけで、
「 高速なコードを生成する関数」にはならない。これをメモ化に加えて
shift / reset を使うことで < fun x y -> ~( sgib < x > <y > 5 ) > == > < fun x y -> let t0=x in let t1=y in let t2=t1+t0 in let t3=t2+t1 in let t4=t3+t2 in t4+t3 >
これが出せるようにする、という例がありました。再びうろ覚えで私が理解した範囲では要するに、 // 注意 : ここでは、継続の使い方のわかりやすさのためにコードの構造は大きく変えてしまっています。 // 実際の論文や発表で紹介されていたバージョンはもっとさらにgibの形に近いです。 function sgib ( varx , vary , n ) { @memoize function loop ( n ) { if ( n==0 ) return varx if ( n==1 ) return vary var t = generate_fresh_symbol ( ) return [ sgib ] < let ~ ( t ) = ~ ( loop ( n - 1 ) ) + ~ ( loop ( n - 2 ) ) in ~ ( return [ →sgib ] ( t ) ) > } return loop ( n ) } こういう雰囲気の限定継続の使い方をしていて、いままで自分が見たことのない効果的な使い方だったので、 なるほどなーと感心することしきり。 上位から loop ( n - 1 ) のような形で呼ばれるときには、 そこにはt0やt1のような変数を入れたいので、 まずいったん変数を返して（ return [ →sgib ] ( t ) ）全体の式を作らせてから、 その外に let 束縛を追加して改めて全体の式として返す、と。これは自分で一から書ける気がしない。すごいなあ。 ところで自画自賛ですが return [ →sgib ] 記法はやっぱりわかりやすいと思う。 追記： 参照→継続ベース部分評価 他には、id : keigoi さんの Session Type を Haskell の型クラスメタプログラミングで、というのがツボに入りました。
Functional Dependency の使いどころもっとちゃんと把握せねば。 その後の宴会でふと思ったのだけど、 型レベルプログラミング会議とかやったら面白いかなあ。自分の知っている限りでも
C++ と Haskell と D と OCaml のそれぞれで、結構特徴の違う型レベルプログラミング文化が発展している気がするのですよね。 いちど全部一同に会して見ると面白いんじゃないかと。問題は開催地だ…。 あとは……『木文法の構文解析を利用したプログラム逆計算』に Co-regular木文 法 [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
（文字列でいうと左線形文法に近い文法。文字列だと左も右もregularになるんですが、 木は右っぽいものだけ がregularになる） を考えてみると面白いと思う！と絡んでました。しかしよく考えたら、 あれって構文解析は何も考えられてなかったかもしれない…。 線形時間でできてもおかしくないと思うので帰りの新幹線でずっと考えていたんですが、 しかし思いつきませんでした。 『統合開発環境のためのプログラミング言語拡張フレームワーク』は、Eclipse の

13:51 09/03/08 PPL
明日から PPL 2009 に行ってきます。 聞きに行くだけですが。面白そうな発表が多いので楽しみにしています。 つれづれ Lexical scope にこだわってどこまで行けるかということで… function foo( ) { function bar ( ) { ... return [ →foo ] ... } } だけではなく function foo( ) { var returnFoo = return function bar ( ) { ... return [ →returnFoo ] ... } } まで許せば、つまり→の右に実行時の値を指定することを許せば、 かなり使い勝手が向上するのではないかということをぼんやりと考えています。 自分が下の方に書いたシンタックスシュガー展開後のコードならどうせここは動的な値になっていますし。 ただ、一歩一歩確実に意味論がわけわかんなくなってきているので、一度整理してみないと…。
18:00 09/03/07 追記 : return の話 そ れCyan と突っ込みいただきました。おおおお！ トップレベルだけ扱いが違うのか、shinhさんのコードそのままだとループしないみたいですが、 関数の中でやったら確かに上手くいきました。 main = ^( ) : globalVar = 0 hello = ^( ) : globalVar = return return ( 0 ) x = hello ( ) say x global Var( x+1 ) main ( ) Cyan = Pythonっぽい構文 ＋Lispっぽいマクロ＋Ioっぽいオブジェクトシステム、 という紹介を何度か聞いて、 チュートリアル見てもそれだけな感じに見えたので面白くなさそうだーと思ってスルーしてました。
すみませんすみません。全力で反省。ちゃんと言語仕様全部読んでから判断すべきでした。これはいい！
Shiroさん からは shift / reset の使われ方について。 " ほとんど call / cc ののりで使う shift " は、 確かに return [ xxx→yyy ] 的な感覚とはちょっとずれますね。なるほど。
resetは普通にresetのまま残して、上でresetがあったら問答無用でreturn[foo ]が勝手に限定継続取るようになるとか…うむむ… more追記 " call / ccは return に名前を変えた。こっちの方が分かりやすいと思う。 " おお！！今 kuzha もそんな感じになっていたりするのかな。あとでチェック…。 ブクマコメ の方については、普通の関数でも例外飛ばしたり中で実行終了したら後続の処理は行われないので、 そこはあまり本質ではないかなーと考えてました。 あと、最終形の return [ →f ]
まで行き着くと実際3回呼ばれるようになりますし。
11:09 09/03/07 ↑追記↑あります 思考実験 : returnを関数と思ってみる話 要旨 ： 「 C や JavaScript 等の関数から返 る" return " を、 first - class object と思ってみると面白いんじゃないでしょうか 」 function hello( x ) { return ( x+1 ) * 2 // hello から ( x+1 ) * 2 を返す } ふつうですね。 function hello( x ) { return ( ( x+1 ) * 2 ) // hello から ( x+1 ) * 2 を返す } 最近はあんまりここに括弧を付けるコードは見ないような気がしますが、付けてみました。 動作は変わりません。 ただ、なんとなく、return という名前の関数を呼び出しているように見えます。 「 helloから値を返す 」という動作をする関数。 function hello( x ) { var f = return f( ( x +1 ) * 2 ) // hello から ( x+1 ) * 2 を返す } 関数に見えてきたので、普通の関数オブジェクトっぽく、変数に代入したりできても良さそうな気がします。 もしできたらどうなるか考えてみます。 function hello( x ) { var f = return function world (y ) { f( y* 2 ) // hello から ( x+1 ) * 2 を返す！ } world ( x+1 ) } 変数に代入したら、クロージャというかなんというか、内部関数から使えて欲しいです。 function world (y ) { return y* 2 } だと world から y* 2 を返すだけですが、 外のスコープで var f = return したので、 上のコードは hello から一気に y* 2 を返してくれると楽しそうです。 this と同じで、return も、 関数が実行時に呼び出されたときに暗黙に値が決まる特別な識別子かなにかになるでしょう。 function find FirstNegative ( arr ) // 配列内の最初の負の数を返す { var returnFFN = return arr .forEach ( function ( elem ) { if ( elem < 0 ) returnFFN ( elem ) // find FirstNegative から elem を返す！ } ) throw " えらー " } find FirstNegative ( [ 123 , 45 , - 67 , 8 , - 9 ] ) // -67 たぶん、こういうことをするのに便利だと思います。 forEach のような制御構造の場合であれば、Ruby のブロックや D の opApply のような 「 ただの関数オブジェクトではな い return の飛び先を良きに計らってくれる言語機能 」
を使って書く手があったりすると思うんですが、
制御構造に限らず一般の再帰的な探索を内部関数で書いて、 一気に外の関数 をreturnで抜けられたりすると結構楽なこともあると思います。 シンタックスシュガーがあるともっと便利かも。 function find FirstNegative ( arr ) // 配列内の最初の負の数を返す { arr.forEach ( function ( elem ) { if ( elem < 0 ) return [ find FirstNegative ] elem // findFirstNegative から elem を返す！ } ) throw " えらー " } 上の var returnFFN = return するコードのシンタックスシュガー。 return [ 関数名 ] を見つけると、 処理系が、外側のスコープにある " 関数名 " という名前の関数の頭に var returnXXX = return を付け加えてから return [ 関数名 ] val を returnXXX ( val ) に置き換える感じの実装とします。 あくまで 「 return が first - class object である 」 という特徴を使いやすくするシンタックスシュガーなので、 function find FirstNegative ( arr ) // 配列内の最初の負の数を返す { arr.forEach ( function ( elem ) { var f = return [ find FirstNegative ] if ( elem < 0 ) f( elem ) // findFirstNegative から elem を返す！ } ) throw " えらー " } 依然として、変数に代入したりはできると嬉しい。 ちなみに Scala が private [ パッケージ名 ]
とかでスコープを指定したアクセス制御ができるらしいので、
シンタックスシュガーの構文はそちらを参考にしてみました。
続き : 何度でも return さて、実は、ここからが本題です 。
要旨： 「 " call / cc " って難しいので、 継続のプリミティブは " return " ということにしよう。特に手続き型言語では 」 return をただの関数と思う事にしたので、グローバル変数に代入できたっていいですよね。 var globalVar function hello ( ) { globalVar = return return 0 } var x = hello ( ) print ( x ) global Var( x+1 ) まず最初に 0 が return されるので、print ( 0 ) で 0 が表示されます。さて、次の global Var( x+1 ) はどう動くべきか？選択の余地があります。 globalVar は「 hello から値を返す関数 」だったけど、hello はもう既に実行終わっちゃってるので、 hello から値を返すなんて無理。実行時エラー。もしくは実行時に何が起きるかわからない未定義大暴走。 globalVar は「 hello から値を返す関数 」 だったので、意地でも hello から値を戻す。 global Var( x+0 ) を呼んだ瞬間に、 var x = hello ( ) のところにジャンプして戻って x に 1 を入れる。 以下繰り返しで、このプログラムは、0 、1、2、...
の無限表示するプログラムになる。 1番は実装が楽あるいは実装が楽もしくは実装が楽などのメリットがありますが、
ここは面白さを優先して、よりファンキーな感じの2番の動作をするバージョンを考察することにします。 そもそも、returnを普通の関数と思う事に決めたので、ある時点から突然呼び出せなくなる関数とかなってしまうのは、
ちょっと残念ですし…。 … と、考察といっても、returnがやることは、「とにかく意地でも対象の関数から値を戻す」だけなので、
まあ、それだけです。はい。別にこれ以上解説すべき点もなにもないと思います。簡単ですね。
☆ ただ、その「 それだけ 」 「簡単」というのが重要なのではないかと最近思い始めました。
話が一瞬飛びますが、これは first - class の 継 続( Continuation ) の理解しやすい構文として使えるのではないかなー、と。 実際 、" first - class return " があれば first - class continuation でできることは全てできます 。
Scheme , Ruby 等で継続を取り出すプリミティブである call / cc が function callcc ( f ) { return ( f( return ) ) } こう実装できるので。というか、first - class return の動作はまさ に 「 関数から戻った後の計算 」 という継続をキャプチャするというものなので、
何も新しいことはなくて、機能としては単に continuation を first - class object として扱っているだけです。 ☆ なにか難しそうな話になってきた…と思ったら、☆から☆までの中身は忘れて下さい。要りません。 " first - class return " さえ理解できていれば、 " 継続 " だとか " call / cc " だとかの用語を一切知らなくても、 そいつらで書ける機能は全て return でも書けます 。
「 継続」は別段そんなに難しいものではないと思うのですが、少なくとも、自分の中では、
難しそうなイメージがあります。そもそも「継続とはなんぞや」という用語の説明が要る時点で難しい。
ただ、この難しさの半分くらいは、 「 継続」の難しさじゃなくて call / cc の難しさなんじゃないでしょうか。 でも、 " first - class return " ならば、その機能は （たとえ今まで " first - class continuation " が理解できなかったという人でも、 何割かは） この記事のここまでの説明で完全に把握できた気分になれるんじゃないかと思うんです。そう信じる。 どうだろう … だめかな。 というわけで、ここまでひとまずの結論は 「 " 継続 " や " call / cc " という概念をを一切使わずに 、" first - class return " という名前の元でこっそり first - class continuation を導入したら、 以外と結構誰でも継続になじめるようになるのではないでしょーか。 」 ※ 実際、いくつかの処理系では、call / cc よりも first - class return に近いプリミティブで継続をキャプチャできるようになっています。 mozilla によ るJavaScript実装 Rhino では、 return の代わりに new Continuation ( ) と書けば、まったくそのまま同じ機能です。 // Rhino で実際に動くコード function hello( x ) { var f = new Continuation ( ) function world (y ) { f( y* 2 ) // hello から ( x+1 ) * 2 を返す！ } world ( x+1 ) } ruto さんの [ PDF ] 合成モナドのための call / ccに対する改善の提案 の get/cc も、これまたちょっと違いますが、
継続をキャプチャする処理を、それを処理ルーチンに渡す処理から分離するという点で似ているかなーと勝手に思っています。
※ 余談。なんで call / cc がわかりにくいかと感じるかというと、" current " continuation というのが call / cc を導入するまでは全く表に出てこない存在だからではないかと思っています。 たしかにどんな言語のどんな処理にも存在している " 継続 " ですが、普段は陽には現れていません。でも、例外があって、 return 文というのは継続の呼び出しが唯一陽に表に現れているポイントだと思う事ができます。 なので、こいつを一般化すること でfirst - class continuation を導入するのは、 元々目に見えていた物のパワーアップになるので、その分だけ類推で把握しやすいものになる…といいなあ。 類似品として 、" first - class break " や " first - class continue " を導入してもいいかもしれません。 一方で、要旨 に 「 特に手続き型言語では」と限定条件をつけたのもこの辺りの考えがその理由で、
全てが式の関数型言語だと return は陽に現れていないので、 結局それは " current " continuation と大差ない裏方度合いかもしれない…などと考えていました。 最終章：限定継続 実は、ここまでの内容は昔書いた記事の焼き直しでただの前置きでして、 なんとここからが本当に本当の本題です 。
要旨： 「難しいのは継続ではないcallccだ…とすると、 難しいのは限定継続ではなくshift/resetなのでは？ 」 限定継続 ( Delimited Continuation ) という、継続の仲間のようなさらにややこしいものがあります。 これがなかなかややこしくて未だにちゃんと把握できないでいるので、 自分が理解できないのは shift / reset や control / prompt という構文のせいだと思い込むことにしました。 first - class return のように、もっと自分に把握しやすいスタイルの限定継続があるのではないか…。 考えてみます。以下 、shift / reset 的な機能をなんとか表現する試み。 composable - continuations - tutorial の最後の方の例を考えてみます。foreachっぽい処理をする関数を受け取って、
リストをストリームに変える関数を返す関数…なんですけど、
ちょっと簡略化して、単純にリストをストリームに変える関数。
( define ( collection -> stream collection ) ( reset ( begin ( for - each ( lambda ( element ) ( shift k ( stream - cons element ( k ) ) ) ) collection ) stream - nil ) ) ) ( shift k BODY ) は何をするかというと、 k には、 「 shift から値を返して reset を抜けるまで 」 の処理をする関数が入った状態 でBODY が実行されます
BODY を実行し終わると、途中をすっ飛ばして、BODY式の値がreset式の結果になります。ジャンプ！ なので、 ( collection -> stream ( list 100 200 ) ) を呼ぶと、とりあえず普通に実行が進んで、 shift が終わったところで ( stream - cons 100 ( k ) ) がまずは帰ってくる。 で、このcdr側 の( k ) を呼び出すと、ループ2週目が始まって、 ( stream - cons 200 ( k ) ) が戻ってきて、も う1 回 cdr 側を呼ぶと、 stream - nil が来る。 これ、こう書けないでしょうか。 function collection2stream ( collection ) { collection .
forEach ( function ( elememt ) { return [ collection2stream ] StreamCons ( element , return [ →collection2stream ] ) } ) return StreamNil } return[ collection2stream ] は今まで通り、「 collection2stream から return」する関数
return [ →collection2stream ] はその双対、 「 collection2stream の return まで」実行する関 数
（正確には、 「 現在の関数のreturnからcollection2streamのreturnまで」かな。） 正直、まだ到底わかりやすいとは言えないですが、
限定継続を取り出してくる部分と reset のところまで飛ぶ部分を分離したことで、 多少は見通しがよくなっているような気分が自分ではしています。 function collection2stream ( collection ) { var returnC2S = return collection .
forEach ( function ( elememt ) { var returnUptoC2S = returnC2S.delimitedReturn ( ) returnC2S ( StreamCons ( element , returnUptoC2S ) ) } ) return StreamNil } こんな感じのコードのシンタックスシュガーのつもりです。
実装はちゃんと考えてませんが、.delimitedReturn ( )
メソッドが頑張って限定継続を切り出してくるということで。 あと、型システムに関しては本気で何も考えていないです。 function foo( ) { function bar ( ) { var whichNumberWillBeReturnedFromFoo = return [ →foo ] for ( var n=0 ;; ++n ) if ( whichNumberWillBeReturnedFromFoo(n ) > 10 ) return n } var x = bar ( ) // fooの 返値 が 10 を越えるような最小の自然数(= 4 ) を返す return x*x } 他の使い方の例。 議論 まず最初に。 return [ f→g ] というプリミティブだけでは、たぶん、 まだ shift / reset より真に弱い機能しか実現できません。 return [ →g ] は lexical scope を前提としていて、つまり 、
「 ソースコードのテキスト上で現在の関数の外側にある関数
g の return まで 」 という形で継続をキャプチャしようとします。 一方で 、shift は、自分の理解している範囲では、ある程度 dynamic scope 寄りで、 つまり 、 「 実行中のコールスタック上で現在の関数の外側にある reset まで 」 の継続をキャプチャします。 たとえば 、 [ PDF ] sprintfの継続による型付け の例は、 % to_str の関数定義の中の shift は、 ソースコード上でそれを囲む reset （そんなものは無いですが）までの継続を捕まえるのではなくて、 reset ( fun ( ) -> pat ) args という形で使われたときに、pat の外を囲っている reset までの継続を捕まえます。 これが return [ f→g ] 形式だと、できない。 ただ、変数スコープでも dynamic より lexical の方が好ましい（と最近はされている）のと同じで、 限定継続もできるだけ lexical scope で書くのが最終的には好ましい、ということになったりしないかなー、 と勝手なことを考えています。根拠は何もありません。sprintf の例だと、 sprintf だけでなく % もマクロにすると shift / reset が lexical に対応がつくようになって、 どうにかなりそうな気がする。 もっとも、自分は限定継続の実際の使われ方をほとんど知らないので、 もし dynamic scope であることが本質的な使い方が多いのであれば、 ちょっと return [ f→g ] だとパワー不足ですね。 実際どうなんでしょうか。あるいは 、Java の Checked Exception みたいに注釈を付けることで、 dynamic なんだけど lexical っぽいものを実現するとかしてみるとどうだろう… ☆ あと lexical にしたことの問題点はもう一つあって、 function foo ( ) { return function bar ( ) { return [ →foo ] ( 100 ) } } var b = foo( ) b() これどういう挙動になるべきなんだ、という。b を呼ぶ時点では foo は終わっちゃっているので、 「 fooのreturnまで」と言われても一体どこまで実行すればいいのかわからない。これってただの return 100 扱いでいいんだろうか。 あるいはエラーにするとすればどのタイミングでエラーにするべきか。 ☆ 実装…に必要な注意としては、 function collection2stream ( collection ) { collection .
forEach ( function ( elememt ) { return [ collection2stream ] StreamCons ( element , return [ →collection2stream ] ) } ) return StreamNil } 上の方のコードの再掲ですが、 return [ collection2stream ]
を単にフルの継続と思って、たとえば単純なコールスタックのコピーで実装するとおかしな挙動になります。
それがまさに、この例をとってきたSchemeのサンプルのcall/cc版ではset!が必要になっている理由で、 return[→collection2stream ] が呼ばれるたびに、 return[ collection2stream ] の戻り先を変更しないといけません。
これの効率的な実装は、普通に限定継続の効率的な実装とたぶん通じることろがあると思うんですが、
詳細はめんどくさいので深く考えないことにします。ただ、 return[f ] だけのサポートなら要らなかった工夫が、 return [ f→g ] を考え出すと return [ f ] 側の実装にも必要になるので注意、と。 ☆ return [ →g ] 以外の構文として、 function collection2stream ( collection ) { collection .
forEach ( function ( elememt ) { yield [ collection2stream ] StreamCons ( element , resume [ collection2stream ] ) } ) yield StreamNil } こういうのはありかなー、というのはちょっと考えています。resume[f ] は次の文からyield [ f ] までの継続を表す。 コルーチンに慣れている人なら行けるはず。たしか kmizu さんに教えてもらっ た Javaflow は、 要するにこれを更に少し制限した形でやっていることになるのかな。

Technology correspondent , BBC News website
Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg ruled out policing applications Facebook has been targeted by malicious hackers seeking to steal valuable data from members .
The social network site has been hit by five separate security problems in the last seven days , say security experts .
By creating fake messages padded with details of Facebook members the thieves are capitalising on the trust and social links that drive the network .
Security firms warn that the popularity of social networking sites makes them a tempting target for hi-tech thieves .
Trust network " It 's been a pretty bad week for social networking in general , " said Rik Ferguson , senior security advisor at Trend Micro .
In the last week , said Mr Ferguson , Facebook had been hit by four malicious applications as well as a new variant of the Koobface virus that first targeted members of the social site in December 2008 .
The rogue applications on Facebook all try to steal saleable information from the profiles of those who open it up , said Mr Ferguson .
One malicious application tried to trick people into adding it by claiming that their friends were having trouble looking at their profile .
If the application is added it spams itself to every Facebook friend that a member of the site has .
Mr Ferguson said the way that Facebook is built can make it tricky for members to spot malicious or rogue applications .
A lot of security software looks for malicious activity on a user 's own machine , he said .
By contrast , when Facebook members add an application it is servers operated by the social site that link to the third - party computers hosting that program .
So far , said Mr Ferguson , the rogue applications on Facebook have been scary and a nuisance more than anything else .
The Koobface virus uses fake YouTube pages to trick people " It 's almost as if the applications we have seen this week are a proof of concept , " he said .
" It would be much better for them to generate rogue applications that did not look like rogue applications . "
Mr Ferguson said he expected more sophisticated programs that hid their malicious intent to debut soon on social network sites .
He said it was time for Facebook to review its policy of approving applications .
Currently , it only vets them after they are offered to members and have been reported as causing problems .
In a Radio 1 Newsbeat interview with Mark Zuckerberg in late February , the Facebook founder rejected a call to vet all the applications showing up on the site .
He said : " Our philosophy is that having an open system anyone can participate in is generally better . "
A spokesman for Facebook said members should be vigilant and never give out their password .
He said Facebook did a lot of work behind the scenes to keep the site safe .
If anyone was unlucky enough to fall victim they should visit the Facebook security pages and follow the steps that lays out to get help , he said .
Writing on his blog , Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at anti-virus software developers Sophos , said : " One of the problems is that Facebook allows anybody to write an application and third party applications are not vetted before they are released to the public .
" Even as Facebook stamps out one malignant application , it can pop up in another place . "
Hitting Facebook users alongside the rogue applications has come a sophisticated variant of the Koobface virus that debuted in December 2008 .
The new variant uses a Facebook message to try to get people to visit a fake YouTube page and install the malware .
To make it look more plausible , said Mr Ferguson , the virus posts the image from a Facebook member 's profile on the video page .
Once installed the malicious program hunts for cookies on a victim 's computer and uses the details it finds in the small text files to log into other social sites that person may be a member of .
" This is not just restricted to Facebook , " said Mr Ferguson , " it 's a growing trend .
Though I 'm surprised it 's taken so long for social sites to be targeted . "

Forecasters at international organizations often find themselves in a delicate position .
On the one hand , they have unparalleled access to hard data and intelligence about what is happening in every corner of the world economy .
On the other hand , their main shareholders – the US and larger European countries – do not want to hear predictions that are inconsistent with their own preferred baseline .
And , in the case of the US today , nothing could be more sensitive : it ’s a relatively optimistic baseline , with a quick bounceback next year , that underpins the mild “ stress scenario ” being used for banks .
So if the World Bank or the IMF said that the world economy is going down and not coming back any time soon , that would raise major issues .
The World Bank clearly wants to speak truth to authority on this occasion , but ca n’t quite get the job done .
In a document prepared for the G20 meeting , the World Bank hints at more dire outcomes : global GDP will decline this year for the first time since WWII , with growth “ at least 5 percentage points below potential ” ( translation : roughly minus 1 percent ) .
But they do n’t give any supporting country - level detail and they are completely silent on the key question for the US banking stress test – what will happen in 2010 .
They must have worked through this level of detail , otherwise they would n’t feel comfortable saying that the world economy will contract , and their body language ( including the scale of funding requests for developing countries ) says that this is going to stay bad for a while .
But they ca n’t quite bring themselves to be explicit .
The document is a series of dire warnings , couched in rather indirect language – although , to an official ear , the general downbeat tone is quite clear .
Then you reach section VII , “ Urgent Priorities ” and the recommendation for the financial system is : “ restoring confidence ” .
This is completely vague and unhelpful – which , of course , is the point .
The President of the World Bank is , by tradition , appointed by the US government – specifically , in practice , by the Treasury .
And there have long been voices – including from some now at the Treasury – suggesting that this should change , perhaps in return for more resources for the Bank / IMF from those emerging markets that still have deep pockets , e.g. , China .
Still , what the odds that a more independent World Bank and IMF ( the governance of which could be reformed in parallel ) would ever play a decisive or even controversial oversight role vis-a - vis the US economy ?
The US is just too powerful to be contained or constrained by international institutions .
The idea of an global “ early warning system ” is therefore illusory .
We need to take this into account when redesigning our financial system .
No one will warn us and we will not warn ourselves .
QUITO , Feb 21 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Embassy official Ecuador kicked out this week on charges of meddling in national affairs was the head of the CIA in the drug - smuggling route country , President Rafael Correa said on Saturday .
But a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman declined to comment on Correa ’s account that the expelled official ran CIA operations in the Andean country , which is a crucial drug - smuggling route to drug gangs in neighboring Colombia and Peru .
Correa , a leftist ally of U.S. foe Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , expelled Mark Sullivan over charges he tried to handpick an officer heading a police unit partly financed by the United States .
“ Lets speak bluntly ; he was the head of the CIA in Ecuador , ” Correa said .
“ The U.S. Embassy was mad because they are used to handpicking police chiefs in exchange for a few computers . ”
Sullivan ’s expulsion came a bit over a week after Correa ordered another U.S. official to leave the country on similar charges , fueling tensions with Washington .
Correa has accused the CIA of having operatives inside his security forces , and aiding neighboring Colombian commandos raid a rebel camp inside Ecuador last year that raised the specter of war in the Andean region .
He said that as part of an unwritten agreement the U.S. embassy approved the naming of officers to head police units they financed .
The popular U.S. - educated economist had generally kept good ties with the United States even as his socialist allies in Bolivia and Venezuela clashed with Washington , including expelling U.S. ambassadors .
Still , Correa went on the offensive this month , declaring he would not bow to pressure from the United States and has now raised complications in establishing his relationship with U.S. President Barack Obama .
Local media has speculated Correa kicked out Sullivan because he was linked to the probe of a former government official arrested for dealing with drug bosses .
The police unit that sparked the diplomatic row was investigating the ex-government official .
Correa has denied those charges .
Analysts say Correa is trying to get attention away from mounting economic woes caused by plummeting oil revenues and immigrants ’ remittances that are starting to worry Ecuadoreans who had lived through a series of crippling crises .
The United States is Ecuador ’s main trading partner and the destination for much of its oil and banana exports .

The whereabouts of Baitullah Mehsud when this image was taken is unknown
This month the US state department has put up a $ 5 m ( £ 3.4 m ) bounty for information leading to the capture of one of the most wanted men in Pakistan .
Baitullah Mehsud heads the Pakistani Taleban and is believed to have been behind the murder of the Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto and the Marriott hotel bombing in Islamabad last year .
He has openly claimed responsibility for the attack on a police academy in Lahore that killed 8 cadets last month .
But is anyone likely to be tempted by this latest offer in what America calls its Rewards for Justice programme ?
" Overall the Rewards for Justice programme has been very minimal , " says Mike Scheuer , a former CIA intelligence officer who spent years trying to track down Osama Bin Laden .
" At least in terms of our Islamist enemies [ it has had ] almost no impact at all , no successes .
The only big success was the 1993 World Trade Center bomber , Ramzi Ahmed Yousef .
" And it was worth getting him , it was a good investment .
But he 's the only one , in almost 20 years . "
The Rewards for Justice programme has been going for years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In Afghanistan it has posters up of wanted men , their pictures printed on matchbooks , and leaflets distributed in local languages .
But both there and in Pakistan 's tribal territories , where some of the most wanted jihadists are thought to be hiding , the US is up against a centuries - old tradition called " pashtunwali " .
It is the Pashtun code of conduct that makes tribesmen resent any uninvited intruders , while protecting those seeking shelter .
Asif Durrani , the acting Pakistani high commissioner in London , believes this makes it harder for Washington to persuade local people to reveal the whereabouts of those accused of terrorism .
" I can tell you when it comes to honour , kicking the door itself is the biggest insult , so that also invites a sort of revenge , " he says .
" No - one can dare kick my door , " continues Mr Durrani , " it 's not allowed , because you are then declaring war against my household . "
Fear v temptation
But US government bounties have had their successes elsewhere , notably in Iraq .
Anyone caught betraying a fellow Muslim risks finding their family dishonoured for generations .
The former president , Saddam Hussein , was betrayed for money in 2003 and so were his two sons , Uday and Qusai .
No longer able to rule through fear and patronage , Saddam was just too tempting a prize for those who knew where he was hiding .
So why has the rewards system worked in Iraq and not in Pakistan ?
Terry Pattar , a counter - terrorism expert at Jane 's Strategic Advisory Services , thinks the key difference is that in Iraq it was clear that eventually the US would win whereas that is not the case in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" I think these kinds of rewards perhaps draw out the people who are more likely to give information where it 's clear they 'll be giving it to the side that is going to eventually win , " he says .
The most wanted militants are thought to be in Pakistan 's tribal territories " There 's less fear of reprisals .
They 've got more chance of claiming the money and safely using it . "
And that is just the problem .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan 's tribal territories , where the Taleban and al - Qaeda are resurgent , the US does benefit from a loose network of informants .
But anyone caught betraying a fellow Muslim risks finding their family dishonoured for generations .
Mike Scheuer believes this explains why after all these years Osama Bin Laden is still a free man .
" It 's very unlikely that any Muslim is going to turn him in to the Americans for money , " says the former CIA officer , making reference to al - Qaeda 's attacks on the US in 2001 .
" He 's been in Afghanistan since 9/11 .
It 's the third poorest place on the planet .
We have $ 200 m of reward money outstanding , including $ 50 m for Osama and no -one has come forward to take a cent .
" I think we need in the West to grow up a little bit , everything does n't pivot on money . "
" In the Islamic world , at least when it comes to Osama Bin Laden , it pivots off of religion , " Mike Scheuer says .

The Linux Collaboration Summit — which took place last week in San Francisco — primarily focused on the Linux platform , but one of the most vigorous discussions that took place during the event looked beyond the confines of the kernel and gave participants some insight into Linux 's relationship with the broader operating system market .
The operating system roundtable discussion , which was called " Why Ca n't We All Just Get Along , " included Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin , Sun community and developer vice president Ian Murdock , and Microsoft platform strategy director Sam Ramji .
Much of the discussion related to Microsoft and its rocky relationship with open source software .
Ramji , who runs Microsoft 's open source software lab and plays a role in influencing Microsoft 's open source strategy , faced some tough questions from fellow panelists and the audience .
He was not flustered by the inquisition and responded with cogent thoughts and some witty retorts .
He said that Microsoft 's commitment to delivering compatibility with open source software is largely driven by user demand .
Indeed , a growing number of companies are deploying Apache , PHP , and other open source software components on Windows - based servers .
Microsoft seems to have noticed this trend and has been working to build closer ties with the Apache community .
Microsoft joined the Apache Foundation last year and has already contributed some of its code to an Apache interoperability effort relating to service - oriented applications .
Microsoft also adopted Apache 's permissive open source license for its
Web sandbox initiative instead of using one of its own two OSI - approved shared source licenses .
Ramji said that one of his roles is to educate people — both within and outside of Microsoft — about the importance of open source software to the Windows platform .
There is no dichotomy between Microsoft and open source software , he claimed .
He said that open source software offers an opportunity for Microsoft and should exist across all platforms .
He also emphatically distanced himself from Microsoft 's anti-Linux marketing campaigns and said that he does n't support that approach to competition .
He expressed concern that critics of Microsoft wrongfully conflate Linux with open source .
In his view , competition between Windows and Linux does n't constitute opposition to the open source development model .
He said that there is a lot of potential for collaboration between Microsoft and the broader open source software community on a wide range of interoperability issues if the major stakeholders can come together as technologists rather than ideologists .
Patent disagreement
The problem , however , is patents .
In the past , Microsoft has refused to collaborate with certain vendors on interoperability issues and has forcefully said that it will not do so unless those vendors commit to intellectual property agreements .
The nature of these agreements is intrinsically hostile to unencumbered downstream redistribution , and they are consequently viewed as unpalatable by many within the open source software community .
Microsoft has since softened its position on this issue , but is still largely stonewalling on unencumbered interoperability .
When asked about the patent problem , Ramji said that individual patent concerns can be addressed one at a time , going forward .
He said that Microsoft is in favor of certain patent system reforms and is often one of the biggest victims of patent abuse under the current system .
Although it seems a bit distasteful for Microsoft to be playing the victim card in this case , it 's true that Microsoft is a very frequent target of patent infringement litigation and has been forced to pay out an enormous amount of money in patent dispute settlements .
Although Ramji said that Microsoft stands behind the need for change in the patent system , he also stated that the company sees valid reasons for keeping software patents intact .
Ramji cited university research as one example of an area where he believes that patents are encouraging technological progress .
His arguments in favor of software patents seem tenuous .
The cost of litigation has vastly outstripped the revenue generated by software patent licensing since the 90s .
It 's also worth noting that the software industry , and Microsoft itself , was enjoying significant profit and growth before software patents had even been deemed permissible in the United States .
Ramji cited Microsoft 's collaboration with the Samba project as an example of a situation where Microsoft encouraged interoperability by agreeing to license patents to an open source project under more permissive terms .
That agreement , however , was practically mandated by the European Commission under the terms of its 2004 antitrust ruling against Microsoft .
It seems unlikely that Microsoft would agree to such terms in the future if not forced to do so .
The agreement also required key Samba developers to sign controversial nondisclosure agreements .
When members of the audience were invited to question the panelists , Samba developer Jeremy Allison stepped up to the microphone and criticized Microsoft 's refusal to provide adequate clarity about which protocols can be safely implemented by third - parties without having to first obtain patent licenses .
Ramji suggested that Microsoft's Open Specification Promise could potentially serve as a vehicle for providing clarity on the issue , but he acknowledged that Microsoft can and should do more to provide predictability about which of its technologies are covered by patents .
Allison concluded the friendly confrontation by walking up to the stage and giving Ramji an award .
The certificate satirically refers to Microsoft as a FAT troll — a reference to the company 's recent patent battle with Linux - based GPS vendor TomTom over patents that cover backwards compatibility features in Microsoft 's FAT filesystem .
Although it 's clear that Microsoft still has a lot of work to do if it wants to earn the trust of the open source software community , Ramji 's presence at the event and participation in the panel reflects a willingness to engage in dialogue with the Linux community .
Zemlin , who criticized Microsoft during his keynote presentation earlier in the day , acknowledged that there is room for a productive — albeit somewhat antagonistic — relationship between Microsoft and the Linux community .
Despite " fundamental disagreements , " he says , they can keep each other honest .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
It was a night for neon pink bow ties and words like " disaster " and " monstrosity . "
It was not the night , however , to be Paris Hilton , Mike Myers or Uwe Boll .
Paula Einstein , Rebecca Marcotte and Kelie McIver do a parody of " Dancing Queen " to open the show .
The 29th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards honored the worst film achievements of the year in a small theater in Hollywood on February 21 .
The night opened with a parody of the " Mamma Mia " song , " Dancing Queen , " and ended with " Love Guru " being named worst picture .
" It was n't just the economy that tanked , so did the qualities of the movies being offered , " Razzie founder John Wilson told CNN several weeks before the show .
" I would suggest putting away all sharp [ instruments ] before putting the DVDs in your machine . "
Paris Hilton and Mike Myers came out on top -- or bottom -- for the awards .
Hilton earned both the worst actress and worst supporting actress awards for her roles in " Hottie & the Nottie " and " Repo : The Genetic Opera . "
She was also awarded worst screen couple for her on - screen time with her co-stars Christine Lakin and Joel David Moore .
Razzie host Gretchen Enders said that " Hottie & the Nottie " was " a vanity production in the worst sense ...
Hilton , who served as executive producer , has no one to blame but herself . "
Hilton 's film had a budget of $ 2 million but only earned about $ 27,000 at the box office .
" Under Obama 's new plan , they would n't even have to pay taxes , " Wilson deadpanned .
Myers added worst actor to the " Love Guru " worst picture and worst screenplay Razzies .
To save anyone else from having to watch it , Wilson shredded a DVD copy of the film on stage .
Parody films " Disaster Movie " and " Meet the Spartans , " each nominated in five categories , came away empty - handed .
However , that does n't mean the Razzie foundation thinks they were worthwhile .
" When you invest the kind of money that a mainstream , big - budget star film requires , you want some insurance that your investment is going to come back to you .
So ... you 're going to do what worked before , " Wilson said .
" Financially that may make sense , but in terms of the audience 's enjoyment , surprise or appreciation of what you 're doing , it does n't work . "
Enter " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , " this year 's winner of the worst prequel , remake , rip - off or sequel award .
" A fourth installment of a beloved franchise , but this one found itself loved by almost no one , " hosts Katsy Chappell and Josh Thoemke said .
The approximately 740 voting members of the Raspberry Foundation also found Pierce Brosnan 's singing voice sorely lacking .
His role in " Mama Mia " earned him the worst supporting actor award .
" An actor who could not sing , should not sing and arguably did not sing , in a role he should not have accepted , " Razzie hosts Chip Dornell and Kelie McIver said about the former James Bond .
But perhaps the biggest " winner " of the night was Uwe Boll .
Recipient of the worst director award , the foundation also recognized his lifetime work with the worst career achievement award .
Boll is the " worst living director on Earth , " Wilson told CNN .
Boll had a sense of humor about his Razzie success .
He sent in a video rejection speech from a fake set of Darfur , Sudan , saying the Razzies had ruined his life and he would never be back .
The Razzie team is already predicting next year 's nominees .
A few to watch out for : " Hannah Montana , " " Friday the 13th " and " Bride Wars , " -- the last of which has already grossed more than $ 50 million .
" It 's kind of like watching a train wreck , is n't it ? " Wilson said .
All About The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation • Mike Myers • Paris Hilton
If you want to find out how the Obama administration is spending the stimulus money , you can go to recovery.gov for detailed spending data .
Many executive branch agencies provide information about their activities via the government 's regulations .gov portal .
And the Library of Congress has the Thomas system , which gives the public free , searchable access to information about the activities of the legislative branch .
But the judicial branch is a conspicuous laggard when it comes to making public documents available online .
Theoretically , public access to federal court records is provided by a Web - based system called PACER .
Unfortunately , PACER locks public documents behind a paywall , lacks a reasonable search engine , and has an interface that 's inscrutable to non-lawyers .
The courts are coming under increasing pressure to address these flaws , and last year , RSS pioneer Aaron Swartz and open government activist Carl Malamud took matters into their own hands .
The courts had launched a pilot program that gave free PACER access to patrons of selected libraries , so Swartz and Malamud went to the libraries with thumb drives and used a Perl script to download as many documents as they could .
They got more than 2 million documents before the courts abruptly canceled the trial .
The documents — about 700 GB in total — are now available from Malamud 's website , but there are still terabytes of public documents locked behind PACER 's paywall .
On February 27 , Sen Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) ( a consistent advocate of public access to taxpayer - funded documents ) sent the courts a letter asking some pointed questions about PACER .
Noting that the 2002 E - Government
Act had instructed the courts to move toward free public access to court records , and that the judiciary had a $ 150 million surplus in its Information Technology Fund , Lieberman asked the courts to justify continuing to charge 8 cents a page for these documents .
On March 26 , the courts responded to Lieberman 's letter , arguing that the fees it collects are necessary to cover the costs of running the system .
It also pointed to a number of steps that have been taken in recent years to make PACER more accessible .
As we 'll discuss below , some of the claims in the letter were disputed by the experts
Ars talked to , and the courts declined to answer our follow - up questions .
In this feature , Ars takes stock of online access to federal court records in the United States .
We 'll discuss how the system got where it is today , look at where there 's room for improvement , and talk to two experts on open government about the prospects for reform .
The bottom line is that the courts deserve credit for the progress they made in the 1990s , but a lot more work is needed to bring PACER into the 21st century .
The importance of public access to the law
Public access to court records might seem like something only lawyers would care about , but James Grimmelmann , a professor at New York Law School , disagrees .
" If there are secret laws , it 's really hard to say that those are laws in any meaningful sense at all , " Grimmelmann says .
" There are lots of areas of law in which the statute is very short , but the case law is incredibly long and important . "
For example , the statutory definition of fair use is only about a paragraph long .
To understand how the concept will be applied by the courts , you need to review the hundreds of judicial opinions that have defined its contours .
To ensure broad public access , the courts have long held that court records are not subject to copyright .
Grimmelmann also points out that public access to court records keeps courts honest .
If court activities are secret , the public will have no way to verify that the court 's procedures and decisions are fair and consistent with the law .
Public access also promotes equality before the law by ensuring that those of limited means will not be disadvantaged by a lack of access to information .
To ensure broad public access , the courts have long held that court records are not subject to copyright .
That means that once a user has obtained a court document , he is generally free to redistribute it without payment .
But until the rise of the Internet , practical barriers limited the dissemination of legal records .
Courts produce millions of pages of documents every year , and it would have been impractical to distribute paper copies of every document to public libraries .
In principle , anyone could have physically driven down to a courthouse and asked to see copies of court records , but practically speaking only practicing lawyers and a handful of sophisticated journalists and academics knew how to navigate this system successfully .
Broader and more convenient access to court records allows greater public understanding and scrutiny of our legal system .
As information technology makes broader availability economically feasible , public officials have an obligation to respond by using those technologies to expand public access .
A great leap forward
There is plenty to criticize about PACER , but it 's also important to acknowledge what the courts have done right .
The initial creation of PACER in 1988 was a huge improvement over the existing system of paper records .
Working attorneys found it extremely convenient to be able to monitor the progress of cases they were working on from the comfort of their offices .
The system charged per-minute fees for dial - up services , but these were seen as a small price to pay for convenience , and such fees were not unusual for commercial online services at the time .
The courts steadily improved the system during its first decade in existence .
Steve Schultze , a fellow at Harvard 's Berkman Center , tells
Ars that the original dial - up system provided only basic case and docket information ; lawyers wanting the full text of documents still had to go down to the courthouse to retrieve them .
But during the 1990s , more and more documents were added to the system .
In 1998 , the system was moved to the Web .
Attorneys could access PACER using a Web browser rather than a proprietary dial - up service .
And instead of paying per-minute dialup fees , Web - based PACER users are charged on a per-page basis .
Falling behind
The courts are justifiably proud of the work they did to modernize PACER during its first decade .
Creating PACER and then moving it to the Web were great strides for open access to court records .
Unfortunately , in the last decade the courts have not been able to keep up with the pace of online innovation .
PACER continues to serve legal professionals well enough , but in an age where the rest of us have come to expect easy access to public documents , PACER is looking increasingly anachronistic .
Schultze argues that most of PACER 's problems can be traced back to the decision to put federal court records behind a paywall .
Before users can log into PACER , they must provide the PACER Service Center with registration information and a credit card number .
Users are charged eight cents per page , and HTML documents such as search results are broken up into arbitrarily defined " pages " for billing purposes .
Even an empty search result costs eight cents .
Paying eight cents a page is not a major burden for working attorneys , who can often pass these fees along to their clients .
But the paywall is a major deterrent to members of the general public who access court records only occasionally and are likely to be intimidated by the system 's clumsy search tools .
The paywall also makes it difficult for academics to perform comparative research on large numbers of court cases , and it makes it prohibitively expensive for third parties to improve access to the documents .
Google , for example , ca n't index or re-publish these documents ( as it has done with the patent database ) unless it is willing to pay millions of dollars in PACER fees .
As a result , ordinary users are stuck using the search tools PACER provides .
And Schultze points out that those tools leave a lot to be desired .
PACER is designed for finding particular cases based on characteristics such as date , case number , or the names of the parties .
There 's no full - text searching option , and only very limited keyword search .
Even worse , every federal court runs its own instance of the PACER software , each with its own idiosyncrasies .
There are alternatives for those willing to pay a premium .
Commercial databases such as LexisNexis and WestLaw offer more sophisticated search tools that span multiple courts , but these tools have flaws of their own : access is far more expensive than PACER ; the information in these databases may not be as current or as comprehensive ; and although their search tools are better than PACER 's , they 're not nearly as good as the leading Web search engines .

The number of bills to reach the governor ’s desk : One .
Meanwhile , major bills on windstorm insurance , transportation , reform of the state schools for the mentally challenged and modernizing the state ’s unemployment system are slogging through the halls of the state Capitol .
“ I have never seen a slower pace .
I have seen a few sessions in my day , but I have never seen one this slow , ” said state Rep .
Al Edwards D-Houston , who is in his 15th legislative session .
The only bill to reach Gov. Rick Perry is one to allow CenterPoint Energy and Entergy to recover the cost of Hurricane Ike cleanup and repairs through a rate increase at the Public Utility Commission .
CenterPoint estimates it will be adding $ 2 to $ 2.50 a month to the average customer ’s bill , while Entergy is predicting an extra charge of about $ 5.25 a month .
Without a doubt , the session has been one of the slowest paced in recent memory .
By this point in 2007 , there were nine bills on the governor ’s desk ; in 2005 there were three .
But numbers alone do n’t tell the story of the 81st Legislature .
Other than the state budget — which has passed the Senate and will be debated in the House on Friday and Saturday — very little major legislation has been moved from either the House or Senate .
The actual number of bills passed by the Senate was up — from 211 in 2007 to 340 as of Monday — only because the Senate has had two full calendars of uncontested legislation , meaning bills that do not require debate .
There had been 103 bills to move out of the House by Tuesday .
The opening - day Senate battle over voter identification laws dampened the collegial atmosphere there , some say .
And the fight over replacing House Speaker Tom Craddick with Speaker Joe Straus delayed the organization of committees by weeks .
Perry on Feb. 3 listed six topics as emergency legislation , including the CenterPoint / Entergy bill .
His emergency item on paying for state government losses from the hurricane will be heard for the first time on the House floor today , but windstorm insurance reform is stuck in House and Senate committees .
“ It ’s not what happens at the middle of the session , ” said Perry spokesman Mark Miner .
“ People are n’t concerned about the process , they ’re concerned about the outcome . ”
Rep. Senfronia Thompson , D - Houston , who passed the electric recovery bill along with Sen.
Tommy Williams , R - The Woodlands , said she is happy with the legislative session ’s more deliberate pace .
“ I ’m glad the pace has slowed down .
At least we are able to look at what we are doing and do a better job at reading the bills and discussing them in committee , ” Thompson said .
Slow as it is , this legislative session has had the most bills ever introduced : 7,494 .
Two years ago , there were 6,359 introduced .
“ We had a record number of bills introduced .
That ’s the bad news , ” said state Rep. Harvey Hilderbran , R- Kerrville .
“ The good news is that probably a record number of them will fail . ”

The word frequently heard in Washington for which there is the greatest gap between verbal use and actual practice is " transparency . "
Sadly , Barack Obama is widening the void .
This was apparent during the campaign if one simply looked a bit below the rhetorical massage .
I found nearly three dozens things Obama had done or said that should have raised eyebrows in liberal circles , but at a time when melanin reigned supreme , to even mention such matters was viewed as disloyal .
Now we are paying the price as Obama 's agenda remains in the shadows even as pieces of it fall silently into place - often without the media noticing and as the president continues to treat reality as though it were just one more campaign issue to spin .
If there was one safety valve during the past eight years it was that the Bush regime was not embarrassed in the slightest by the evil they did and so we did n't have to look too long under too many benches to find illegal wiretaps or discover water boarding .
Their perverted pride served as a strange form of transparency .
Now it 's different .
Important policy is being hidden away in stimulus packages ; the soporific semiotics flow like one of those bedside sound machines ; and the media and liberal think tanks are almost belligerently indifferent to what is going on .
Several of them - including Move
On , a group that would support self immolation if the right Democrat asked them to - are even out with ads promoting support for the president 's budget .
Not the country 's budget , not - as the Constitution would have it - Congress ' budget , but Obama's .
In fact , any budget is a huge conglomeration of the good and the bad and there is no way one can make a rational decision based on 30 seconds of propaganda .
One of the first indications of the administration hiding behind the curtains was Obama 's medical records bill , buried amongst the massive stimuli of the recent weeks .
Whatever one thinks about having the federal government decide how medical records are kept and what is in them , an even greater concern is the enormous threat to patient privacy .
Yet this measure flew through Congress like a resolution honoring some buddy of a long time representative , with no one asking what would happen if an alcoholic , drug addict , a HIV positive citizen or a mentally troubled patient had their records passed on electronically to someone pretending to be a doctor on their case , but actually with the FBI , an insurance company or their employer .
At the very least there should have been hearings , coverage and debate in the media and enough time to discover what was really going on .
Yet one gets the sense that Obama and the Democrats did n't want this .
There is the much larger issue of who the bank bailout beneficiaries really are and where the money is really going .
And the stunning lack of debate over a growing major war in Afghanistan .
By the time we were this far into Vietnam , it was already a substantial controversy .
On a smaller scale , should n't a democracy discuss the matter before giving four times as much to improve rail service for first class passengers as it does for ordinary riders ?
All this has involved the exact opposite of transparency , led by a president who seems to prefer spending his days finding new communications systems over which to spread his platitudes .
One case that particularly struck home because its dangerous invisibility was the attempt to include a formal study of a national draft into a measure increasing funding for the Peace Corps and Americorps .
At the last moment - perhaps because some conservative groups had noticed and complained - the provision was dropped from the bill but remains alive in new legislation pending in the House .
This is not a minor matter .
It is huge .
The reinstitution of mandatory national service could tear this country apart just like the last draft did .
And while this may explain the sneaky approach Obama and the Democrats have taken , it certainly does n't justify it .
And why , as the great issue of the 1960s rears its head again , are the liberals so quiet ?
The history of this is instructive .
In 2006 , Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , wrote a book called " The Plan : Big Ideas for America "
It that called for three months of compulsory civil service for all young Americans .
In it he said : " It 's time for a real Patriot Act that brings out the patriot in all of us .
We propose universal civilian service for every young American .
Under this plan , All Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five will be asked to serve their country by going through three months of basic training , civil defense preparation and community service .
. .
" Here 's how it would work .
Young people will know that between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five , the nation will enlist them for three months of civilian service .
They 'll be asked to report for three months of basic civil defense training in their state or community , where they will learn what to do in the event of biochemical , nuclear or conventional attack ; how to assist others in an evacuation ; how to respond when a levee breaks or we 're hit by a natural disaster .
These young people will be available to address their communities ' most pressing needs .
" During the last campaign we noted that Obama " favors a national service plan that appears to be in sync with one being promoted by a new coalition that would make national service mandatory by 2020 , and with a bill for such mandatory national service introduced by Rep. Charles Rangel .
" We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we 've set .
We 've got to have a civilian national security force that 's just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded , " Barack Obama said last July 2 in Colorado Springs , CO .
" On another occasion Obama spoke of the need for " universal voluntary public service , " although Michael Kinsley noted that service can be either universal or voluntary but not both .
At one point the Obama / Biden campaign website announced that Obama and Biden will expand Americorps and the Peace Corps with " a goal that all middle and high school students do 50 hours of community service a year .
. . "
When questions began to be raised , the words disappeared from the site .
The recent House bill , now approved by the Senate , contained up to the last minute of a provision for a commission that would consider " a workable , fair , and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people " and a possible requirement for " all individuals in the United States " to perform such service .
As the DC Examiner notes , " The section could be restored during the Senate - House conference committee meeting .
A new , separate bill containing that language has since been introduced in the House .
" The Examiner also argued : " Lurking behind the feel - good rhetoric spouted by the measure 's advocates is a bill that on closer inspection reveals multiple provisions that together create a strong odor of creepy authoritarianism .
The House passed the measure overwhelmingly , while only 14 senators had the sense and courage to vote against it on a key procedural motion .
Every legislator who either voted for this bill or did n't vote at all has some serious explaining to do .
. .
" The bill . . . summons up unsettling memories of World War II - era paramilitary groups by saying the new program should " combine the best practices of civilian service with the best aspects of military service , " while establishing ' campuses ' that serve as ' operational headquarters , ' complete with ' superintendents and ' uniforms ' for all participants .
It allows for the elimination of all age restrictions in order to involve Americans at all stages of life .
And it calls for creation of ' a permanent cadre ' in a ' National Community Civilian Corps . ' " " But that 's not all .
The bill also calls for ' youth engagement zones ' in which ' service learning ' is 'a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency . '
This updated form of voluntary community service is also to be ' integrated into the science , technology , engineering and mathematics curricula ' at all levels of schooling .
Sounds like a government curriculum for government approved ' service learning , ' which is nothing less than indoctrination .
"
The bill also changes the name of the existing Civilian Community Corps to " National Civilian Community Corps . "
Why the pointed addition of the word " national ?
" We do n't have to debate what sort of service corps we need to agree that there should be an open discussion about the issue and that the White House and Congress should n't be deliberately concealing what they are trying to achieve .
This is a malicious deception of the public .
Democracy only works with open debate and open agendas .
Letting media manipulators and lawyers cleverly conceal one 's purpose - whether on television or in legislation - as a deep affront to this country .
Bell Canada demanded yesterday that the Canadian government drop its plan to offer competing ISPs regulated access to Bell 's new fiber - to - the - node network .
Like most incumbent providers ,
Bell is n't thrilled about the line - sharing rules that currently govern its " last mile " copper wiring , and it wants to prevent them from being extended to next - generation networks .
The debate is a long - standing one .
Telcos complain that wholesale price regulation discourages investment , so while it may open up immediate DSL competition ( as it did in the US when line - sharing rules were enforced by the FCC ) , it might also prevent the underlying network from getting much faster .
What company wants to sink billions into a new fiber rollout if it is required to offer access to its own competitors ?
Bell 's tough - talking statement yesterday came right out and promised that Bell would pull its investment dollars during a time of economic uncertainty unless it could retain total pricing control over its " next - generation network services " ( whether fiber - to - the - node actually qualifies as " next - generation " is a question for another day ) .
" The alternative of regulated access will have significant implications for our network and other investments going forward , " said CEO George Cope .
" Despite current economic conditions , BCE has committed to investing more than $ 2.5 billion in the Canadian economy in 2009 alone . "
It was left to Kevin Crull , head of Bell Residential Services , to spell out the implied threat .
" By regulating who can sell our next - generation network services and how , the [ Canadian telecoms regulator 's ] decision alters the financial case for the $ 700 million we are investing in accelerating the deployment of our next - generation fibre over the next three years and puts further investment at risk , " added Kevin Crull .
The government 's current insistence on line - sharing regulation has given rise to numerous small ISPs , such as Wireless Nomad , which rely largely on Bell Canada 's copper wiring for last - mile access to customers .
Bell has for some time made life more difficult for these wholesale buyers , doing things like throttling P2P traffic on wholesale lines without giving the small ISPs advance notice .
Such moves make it increasingly difficult for the ISPs to differentiate themselves from Bell 's own residential ISP service .
Europe says yes to line - sharing
In Europe , where cable never made the same headway , line - sharing rules looked like the only feasible way to generate ISP competition , and they remain in place to this day in most countries .
BT , the incumbent carrier in the UK , even agreed ( under pressure from regulator Ofcom ) to split its phone business in two .
One unit , called Openreach , would handle the maintenance and sale of last - mile circuits , while another ( and financially separate ) unit would have to buy access from Openreach just like any other competitor .
Openreach now has more than 400 phone companies and ISPs accessing its lines .
Because BT is now just another Openreach customer , Openreach has ( in theory ) no worries that upgrading to fiber would simply help its competitors .
But the investment issue remains a real one .
As Openreach starts work on a fiber project of its own known as " Next Generation Access , " it is demanding greater price flexibility from the government to make sure it can pay for the scheme .
Earlier this month , Ofcom announced the rules : Openreach would have " pricing freedom " over the service so that investors can make an " appropriate return . "
In other words , no price controls .
But Openreach is required to offer the same wholesale price to anyone who wants it .
Ofcom is convinced that simply requiring the UK setup has little effect on investment .
An Ofcom presentation from 2008 collected data from across Europe to make its grammatically mangled point that " functional separation has not impacted negatively on investment current nor next generation . "
In Denmark , regulators are going even further , this week requiring the country 's main cable company to open its broadband network to competitors .
The European Commission indicated yesterday that it supported the plan .
Denmark is in a unique situation , though , since the incumbent telecoms operator , TDC , is also the owner of the largest cable network , and the two networks do n't compete in places where they otherwise might .
And France has gone whole - hog for line - sharing , creating a host of different DSL competitors that made enough money to start laying their own fiber networks through Parisian sewers and Metro tunnels ( which the government makes quite easy ) .
The US context
Line - sharing rules were also in place in the US — at least for the phone companies — during the 1990s .
Access to the " last mile " had to be offered at " nondiscriminatory " rates , though an attempt to extend the plan to cable systems was shot down by the Supreme Court in the Brand X case .
The FCC eventually ruled that neither telcos nor cable companies would have to abide by the line - sharing rules ; the thinking was that the two would compete against each other and that would be competition enough .
So duopoly is largely the name of the game now .
Companies like AT&T do still sell their lines at wholesale to competing ISPs , but they are no longer under price constraints and few ISPs make much use of the system .
Fortunately , the surge in wireless Internet access , the speed boost coming to cable from DOCSIS 3.0 , and Verizon 's FiOS system are all strengthening US broadband options .
There 's no serious political debate at the moment about returning to line - sharing rules here , just as there 's little debate about the basic principle of loop unbundling over in Europe .
But in Canada , the debate is alive and well , and the conflict between Bell Canada and the government may govern the shape of next - gen network access in the Great White North .
/* Problem : Getting murdered by PHB 's for using goto */
While priming her political machine for a likely 2012 presidential primary run , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has fomented a scandal that threatens to further erode her reputation in the Last Frontier .
In March , Palin nominated Wayne Anthony Ross for attorney general .
Ross , a colorful far - right lawyer and longtime Palin ally who sports his initials , W.A.R. , on his Hummer ’s vanity plates , was once considered a shoo - in for confirmation .
However , his nomination was thrown into grave peril when his opponents presented evidence that he called homosexuals “ degenerates , ” leveled invective against an African - American student offended by a statue of a Klansman , vowed to undermine the sovereignty of Native American tribes , and allegedly defended men who rape their wives .
According to two sources close to the confirmation hearings , Palin may ask Ross to withdraw before his appointment comes to a vote .
According to Burton , who detailed the allegations for me , Ross allegedly declared during a speech before a 1991 gathering of the “ father ’s rights ” group Dads Against Discrimination , “ If a guy ca n’t rape his wife , who ’s he gonna rape ? ”
Palin ’s hopes for a swift confirmation process were dashed April 10 when Leah Burton , a veteran lobbyist on children ’s issues and domestic violence , submitted a letter to the Alaska State Judiciary Committee claiming that Ross publicly defended spousal rape .
According to Burton , who detailed the allegations for me , Ross allegedly declared during a speech before a 1991 gathering of the “ father ’s rights ” group Dads Against Discrimination , “ If a guy ca n’t rape his wife , who ’s he gonna rape ? ” ( In a subsequent letter , Ross denied the remark and claimed , “ I do n’t talk like that ! ” )
Burton said Ross ’s statement was consistent with his overarching attitude toward women ’s issues .
She claimed that he once said during a debate on the Equal Rights Amendment , “ If a woman would keep her mouth shut , there would n’t be an issue with domestic violence . ”
Burton also maintained she has been in touch with “ a number ” of domestic - violence victims who witnessed Ross make “ horrible ” statements , but are too intimidated to speak out .
“ Alaska is a very small state and it ’s terrifying for these victims to come forward because they ’re afraid of retribution , ” Burton told me .
Since Burton ’s testimony , her father , former Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Richard Burton , wrote a letter of his own demanding to Ross that he withdraw his nomination .
“ You sir , speak and act like the kind of bully I met many times when responding to domestic - violence calls , some of the most dangerous situations police officers are often in , ” Burton wrote .
Ross reacted with characteristic fury to the Burtons ’ broadsides , barking to reporters that if “ anybody said that to me , we'd have a little confrontation because that 's a bunch of crap . ”
At the same time , a grassroots group raising support for Palin 's presidential bid called Conservatives4 Palin attacked Leah Burton as an anti-Christian " fringe nutcase . "
But as pro-Palin forces attempted to push back against Ross ’s critics , dozens of op - eds Ross authored during the 1980s and 1990s surfaced as key exhibits in the case against his confirmation .
Among them is a 1993 piece entitled , “ KKK ‘ art ’ project gets ‘ A ’ for courage , ” in which Ross defended a local college student who had offended an African - American classmate by creating a statue of a Klansman with a cross in one hand and a flag in the other .
“ It might have been fun to see [ the African - American student ] try to remove the display , ” Ross wrote .
“ Then she could have been arrested and her future as a student of the university could have been resolved through the university disciplinary proceedings . ”
During the early 1980s , while Anchorage residents grappled over renaming the city ’s 15th Street as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard , and state legislators mulled establishing a state holiday honoring the assassinated civil - rights leader , Ross wrote several manifestoes attacking King as a communist subversive , according to University of Alaska - Anchorage music professor and local progressive activist Phil Munger .
Munger also told me Ross has routinely appeared at public events beside his friend , Don Tanner , a white nationalist who moved to South Africa for a period during the 1980s to support its apartheid government , and who reveled crowds of conservatives with anti-black “ South African jokes ” upon his return to Alaska .
A glance at Ross ’s published archive shows he never limited his resentment to minorities .
He taunted environmentalists ( “ It is time we quit crying over the oil spill ” was the title of an editorial he wrote in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster ) ; he denounced homosexuals as “ degenerates ” during a 1993 legal fight over a local gay - rights ordinance ; and announced that his final wish before dying was to overturn Roe v. Wade .
While rising through the ranks of the NRA ’s national leadership in the 1980s , Ross published a piece in the mercenary magazine Soldier of Fortune , defending the right to form antigovernment militias .
“ Ross ’s profile fits where Palin wants to go after the current legislative session ends , ” Munger remarked to me .
“ She seems to be planning some behind - the - scenes movement to stir up the crazies , especially by convincing them the federal government is going take their guns away .
So nobody here is surprised by this selection . ”
While Ross sustained withering criticism for his views on social issues , Native American tribes denounced his vociferous opposition to their subsistence rights .
The tribes were especially disturbed by his vow during a 2002 gubernatorial debate to “ hire a band of junkyard dog ” attorneys to gut federal laws guaranteeing natives subsistence preferences .
“ It almost looked like she was rubbing our face in Anthony Ross ’s appointment , ” said Tim Towarak , co-chairman of the Alaska Federation of Natives , told The Bristol Bay Times .
“ Like rubbing our face on the ground , saying ‘ Here , take this . ’”
With increasingly powerful tribal groups mobilizing a united front against Ross , Palin was compelled to defend her own record , pleading , “ Obviously I am not anti-Native and would never appoint anyone who is . ”
If Palin withdraws Ross ’s nomination , she could end another embarrassing political spectacle before it registers on the national press corps ’ radar .
Alternatively , if she manages to ram his appointment through , Palin can begin implementing a hard - right legal agenda that will appeal to the elements she is cultivating as the base of her likely 2012 presidential campaign .
However Palin decides to proceed with W.A.R. , by nominating him , she has staked out the culture war as the fuel for her national ambitions .

I 'm a chronic procrastinator , and I want to change .
I have hundreds of ideas jotted down on a notepad I keep on my table , but I never get around to implementing those .
There just seems to be this inertia that stops me from ever starting to work on my tasks .
" I 'll do it next month , I have exams right now " , " Now ?
I ca n't work in this state of mind ! " , " Let me just finish reading my RSS feeds .
I got to keep myself updated " are some of the excuses I give myself .
Of course , once I do start working on something , I get in the zone and completely lose track of time .
Once in the zone , I 'll work at a task until I 've completed it .
Overcoming the " inertia " is the difficult part .
This is what I 've done to combat my situation : I 've started keeping a TODO list .
I 've also cleared my desk of unneeded items and removed useless feeds from my RSS reader .
I 'm getting into the habit of putting my MacBook to sleep when I 'm not working .
That way , I can't wander off to Digg or the WTF subreddit .
I feel I 'm about 2 x more productive now , but I 'm still far from the stage where I can spend more than 50 % of my computer time doing productive tasks .

9/11 hijackers ' debut ' in GOP attack ad RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 30 , 2009
Print This Email This
The attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 have often been paraded out for political advertising -- even some seven years after the actual events .
But the latest attack ad from the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee takes the typical 9/11 - attack ad one step further .
It displays the faces of eighteen 9/11 hijackers , along with Osama Bin Laden .
The ad attempts to pin the " terrorist supporter " lapel to Democrat Scott Murphy , who 's running in a special election to replace the successor to Sen.
Hillary Clinton , Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - NY ) .
It highlights a radio interview in which Murphy said he would n't support the death penalty even for the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
The Republicans ' campaign committee continues to wholeheartedly endorse the ad .
 This is one of the few questions Scott Murphy has been willing to answer during this campaign , so he should be willing to explain how he came to such a dangerously out - of - touch position ,  Paul Lindsay , an NRCC spokesman , told The Hill on Friday .
 By opposing the death penalty for the terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks , it is abundantly clear that Murphy is unable or unwilling to empathize with the loss so many New York families faced on that tragic day . 
The Republican running against Murphy , however , sought to distance himself from the ad .
Somewhat strangely , he referred to the NRCC as part of " the Washington groups , " even though it 's the official fundraising arm for House Republicans .
" Jim ca n't control what the Washington groups do with these ads , " said Republican Jim Tedisco 's spokesman Adam Kramer .
" Jim is staying focused on his positive message of fighting for Main Street jobs and against the AIG - style greed on Wall Street and waste in Washington . "
In the ad ( which appears below ) , New York Post Albany reporter Fred Dicker asks Murphy about his opposition to the death penalty .
" So if the terrorists who say destroyed the World Trade Center in the 9/11 attack had been captured , you do n't think they should have faced the death penalty even though they killed some 3,000 people ? "
Dicker asks .
" Yeah , I mean , as I say it 's a tough issue , " Murphy replies .
" We so often deal with cases where the evidence may not be totally conclusive and we can't prove beyond any shadow of a doubt ... it 's so much more costly than putting someone away , it 's a big expense . "
" So you 're against the death penalty for terrorists ? " Dicker continues .
" Yeah , " Murphy says .

The trouble with torture is that sometimes it works ; and when it does , the devil sings .
Scarpia may have ended with Tosca 's knife in his chest , but his torturers got what they needed from Cavaradossi .
When Dick Cheney , the former US vice - president , said this week that his favoured interrogation methods had saved America from another 9/11 , who could gainsay him ?
We may find it incredible that democracies such as Britain and America find themselves opening the 21st century with a debate on the efficacy of such medieval tortures as extreme confinement , sleep deprivation and near - drowning .
Yet it is now clear that both countries have been reduced by the hysterics of the war on terror to making use of information extracted under torture .
Do we just forgive and forget ?
The CIA memos released this week by President Obama were accompanied by pardons .
These were for possible violations by American citizens not only of the international convention against torture , but of the CIA 's own meticulous , if ghoulish , rule book .
­ Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the 9/11 planner , was apparently waterboarded 183 times and barraged with a variety of rough interrogation techniques a hundred times in two weeks before doctors stopped it .
What ethic permitted medical involvement in this treatment ?
Abu Zubaydah , an alleged senior al - Qaida commander , was sent for torture to Thailand before being waterboarded a reported 83 times .
These actions were plainly not confined to the " ticking bomb " crises of torture apologists .
They were systematic , intended to confirm the names of accomplices , past events , dates and places .
Mohammed apparently " confessed " to every outrage of the past decade .
As is known from the second world war , the process of torture so brutalised those taking part that the only restraint was the risk of being held responsible .
Obama has eliminated that risk .
In doing so he is prima facie in breach of the torture treaty , which imposes a " binding " obligation on governments to take into custody those , high and low , guilty of perpetrating it .
Even open war is no justification for disobeying the treaty .
Honouring it should thus devolve to the attorney general , Eric Holder , not the president .
Given the weight of ­material flooding the blogs and airwaves , it is hard to see how Holder cannot appoint a special prosecutor .
British collaboration will be increasingly exposed as this ­poison seeps through the system .
Cheney 's argument is chanted by successive British home secretaries as they click upward the ratchet of state authoritarianism .
If a bomb goes off , the home secretary needs another power .
If a bomb does not go off , it proves that the last new power worked .
We lurch towards darkness at the bomber 's bidding .
Always the means justify the end of " national security " .
The morality of torture is merely polluted by claims and counter - claims of its efficacy .
To some it is excusable in " ticking bomb " cases .
Yet this excuse is more often cited by philosophers pointing to the danger of any move from such a situational ethic to a general theory of torture as justified beyond a given threshold of state danger .
The fact in law is that the physical or mental abuse of prisoners is universally banned as abhorrent , irrespective of efficacy – a sign of the onward march of civilisation .
Torture 's apologists ( who invariably redefine it as not quite torture ) protest that sometimes one backward step must be taken to prevent the bomber taking two backward steps .
This is crazy reasoning , since such overt retrogression soon feeds on itself , as with Britain 's counter - terror legislation .
The trouble lies in our old foe , the war on terror , a creature of an age that seems to feast on the terminology of fear , and which Obama has rightly been seeking to deflate .
The massacres in New York , Bali , London , Madrid and Mumbai were horrible but politically insignificant .
They lacked even the IRA 's policy - changing programme .
They were a howl of rage from a deranged fanaticism , threatening lives and property but not the security of any state .
They are best treated as accidents of globalisation .
Anyone who feels America or Britain is moving nearer to an Islamist caliphate because of a suicide bomber is a wimp who has no belief in the robustness of democracy .
That clearly includes the former US vice - president .
Governments have a duty to protect their citizens , but that is a policing role .
The Islamist threat in no way constitutes a war .
­ Further attacks ( other than the dreams of fantasists and the Metropolitan police ) may well have been prevented by assiduous policing .
It is hard to believe that torture contributed to that prevention .
If it had – and that is Cheney 's contention – then the libertarian must accept there will always be a price to pay for liberty .
( There is a far higher one for letting people ride motorbikes . )
9/11 was itself the price of sloppy policing , given the attack on the same target in 1993 .
The price of banning torture , if there is one , would be paid in broken lives and broken walls , not in the future of the democratic state .
The danger in exaggerating terrorism is that there is an industry waiting to pounce .
Murmur " war " or " state security " or " threat to civilisation " and the horsemen of the apocalypse will descend in cavalry formation .
This week Lord West , the unelected security minister , indicated his total capture by the horsemen when he gave an interview to announce plans " to step up the fight against al - Qaida by unveiling a plan to protect every public building in Britain " .
He says he wants to ­reinforce every ­shopping centre , sports ground , school , hospital and restaurant – even every church – against suicide bombers .
With billion - pound budgets flashing , he is courted by cohorts of security consultants , defence lobbyists , building contractors , electronic warfare pundits , and health and safety fear ­merchants .
He will not stop until he has allowed al - Qaida ( which we are constantly told is " on its last legs " ) to drain the exchequer dry and reduce British citizens to gibbering wrecks of fear .
The British state , British tolerance and the British way of life are far more threatened by Lord West and his like than by any nutcase in a Pakistan madrasa .
This abuse of the language of terror for political and commercial self - aggrandisement is disgraceful .
It is precisely the cast of mind that Obama hoped to end .
It strips the word security of all sense of proportion , and ends in the torture chambers of Guantánamo .

Technology.am ( Apr. 4 , 2009 ) — University of Kansas engineers have developed a new kind of technology that could double the life of exiting bridges .
“ This technology will allow our existing bridges — to be safer for longer , ” said Ron Barrett - Gonzalez , associate professor of aerospace engineering at KU .
The uses of composites can double the life of steel structures and the application is created with an eye toward cost and ease of use .
Composite doublers were earlier used to repair cracks around stress points and rivets in airplanes .
They take stress that would cause the rivet or crack to fail and allow that stress to pass through the composite material and over the rivet or crack without stressing the airplane .
To create these “ detail doubler fuses ” for bridges , layers of composite material are applied to a joint or stress point on a bridge .
Once set , the doubler takes the stress from a car or truck and allows it to pass without the joint receiving any stress , extending the life of the bridge .
Once the doubler begins to wear out , it also will function as a simple warning system for bridge inspectors and road workers .
We are building these as a fatigue ‘ fuse , Barrett - Gonzalez said .
When they are about to fail , they pop off of the joint , and we will include an indicator — whether it ’s bright red paint or some other form — that will serve as an obvious sign that it needs to be replaced .
Believe it or not , Finland still has blasphemy laws on the books , but there have been repeated attempts to rescind Section 10 of chapter 17 of the Finnish penal code .
All attempts however , at removing the anti-modern statute from the law books have proved unsuccessful , with the latest attempt failing in 1998 .
Helsinki city councilman , Jussi Halla - aho was charged with blasphemy and incitement of an ethnic - group in the Helsinki district court today , and ordered to stand trial for publishing on his blog that Islam 's prophet was a pedophile .
According to the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney , Jorme Kalske :
" Halla - aho had uploaded to the Internet and submitted writings to the general public , in which Islam and its sacred institutions were combined with pedophilia , and in which was also presented the robbery of pedestrians and the ooting of tax revenue was a certain national group or a specific genetic characteristic .
Courtesy of the blogger Vasarahammer , here is Helsinki City Councilman , Jussi Halla - aho 's post that the Finnish state wants him prosecuted for .
It is addressed to Mika Illman , the Finnish state prosecuting attorney , in response of the Finnish state 's prosecution of Seppo Lehto last year .
State prosecutor Mika Illman ’s winning streak continued a few days ago , when a specialist of rude humor Seppo Lehto was sentenced for two years and four months imprisonment and to pay tens of thousands of euros in damages for several accounts of gross defamation , incitement against an ethnic group and for religious worship ( TT : blasphemy ) .
The issue has been discussed around the internet so much that I probably do n’t have to repeat the self - evident facts :
a) Filth blogs created by Lehto fulfill all possible criteria for “ gross defamation ” but
b ) Nobody has ever been sentenced for two years and four months for these kind of crimes .
I do n’t blame Mika Illman , he is obviously a man worthy of his last name , who does what he thinks he is supposed to do , but those district courts that have lamely given Mika everything he dares to ask have a reason to be ashamed of themselves .
c ) Illman ’s selection of plaintiffs and recipients of damages consisted only of his fellow prosecutors and members of parliament , and not , for example , Teemu Lahtinen , to whom Lehto ’s filth blogs possibly caused real damage during the last parliamentary election .
The thinking in which public figures deserve more protection than regular citizens has so far been alien to the democratic state and rule of law .
Let ’s stop talking about defamations .
Lehto was also convicted of disturbing religious worship .
According to the district court Lehto violated muslims ’ religious worship by defaming the prophet Muhammad .
Professor Jaakko Hämeen - Anttila has confirmed the interpretation according to which Muhammad is a revered figure in Islamic faith .
According to state prosecutor Mika Illman and Tampere district court insulting the prophet Muhammad is illegal , because Muhammad is revered by muslims .
( On the other hand professor Hämeen - Anttila could certainly confirm that in Christianity Jesus and God are holy figures .
Of course , this does n’t prevent anybody to defame Jesus or God freely in the way he or she chooses . )
Next I intend to throw Mika a bait :
Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and islam revers pedophilia as a religion .
Islam is a religion of pedophilia .
Pedophilia is Allah ’s will .
Are these statements illegal ?
They certainly insult muslim ’s religious feelings .
Let ’s approach the issue logically :
As a 50 year - old man Muhammad was engaged to six or seven year old Aisha .
Their marriage was “ consummated ” when Aisha was nine years old .
It is possible to think that they were living in another age and Muhammad ’s deeds must not be judged according to today ’s standards , but as we have learned during the last few years , schoolbooks from the 50’s were racist when they spoke about ” negroes ” ( even if ” negro ” was not a racist term at the time by anybody ’s standards ) , it ’s equally justified to call a child rapist who lived 1400 years ago a child rapist .´
What has to be done so that the bolded statements were not true ?
You must insist that
a ) ... Quran is not literally true ( i.e Muhammad did not have sexual relations with a nine year old girl ) .
This will not do , since according to Islamic doctrine and muslims ’ opinion Quran is a literal word of Allah .
Consummation and Aisha ’s age cannot be denied without insulting muslims .
b ) ... Muhammad ’s actions were not always acceptable .
This will not do either , since according to muslims ( and Tampere district court ) criticizing Muhammad is the same as criticizing Allah and therefore blasphemy .
The penalty is death .
Muslim ’s believe that Muhammad ’s actions were the will of Allah .
Because Muhammad had sexual relations with a child , that was Allah ’s will as well .
As we see , all the argumentative ways to disprove the bolded statements have been theologically exhausted .
The fact that Muhammad was a pedophile and Allah supported pedophilia can only be denied either by denying the literal truthfulness of Quran or Muhammad ’s status as a messenger of Allah whose actions are according to the will of Allah .
Therefore I repeat my claim :
Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and islam revers pedophilia as a religion .
Islam is a religion of pedophilia .
Pedophilia is Allah ’s will .
The next bait reads :
Robbing bypassers and living at taxpayers ’ expense as a parasite is a national , possibly genetic characteristic of Somalis .
Is this claim inappropriate ?
My fellow blogger Kekke filed a complaint to the Media Council for the editorial that appeared in newspaper Kaleva , in which killing people while intoxicated was described as a national , possibly genetic characteristic of Finns .
Media Council dismissed the complaint .
According to Council secretary Nina Porra :
” The writer probably refers to studies , in which heavy drinking has been observed to be a specific feature in Finnish drinking culture .
It has also been observed that there is a correlation between intoxication and violence .
The genetic backround of the problem is not handled as a fact , but the writer gives his own opinion . ”
Naturally , the decisions made by Media Council are not legally binding so inquisitor Illman does n’t have to take notice .
But on the other hand , “ incitement against ethnic group ” is a felony and because Illman ( whom the matter belongs to ) has not reacted to the Kaleva article , it can be concluded that negative ethnic and genetic stereotypes can be published as long as they are not handled as facts .
We ca n’t think that there are different rules for different people in Finland , can we ?
Naturally , not all Somalis commit robberies or live at taxpayers ’ expense , but not all Finns kill while intoxicated either .
Somalis who constitute 0.2 per cent of Finland ’s total population commit 12 per cent of robberies reported to the Police .
One in ten Somalis living in Finland has a job .
Committing robberies and living at taxpayers ’ expense are a lot more common among Somalis related to their share of the population than killing while intoxicated among the ethnic Finns .
Therefore , I present my assumption ( that I do not regard as fact ) :
Robbing bypassers and living at taxpayers ’ expense as a parasite is a national , possibly genetic characteristic of Somalis .
With this , I wish Mika a nice day .
Patrick Swayze 's pancreatic cancer is clearly exacting a heavy toll on the ailing star .
A rail thin Swayze , now virtually bald having lost his hair as a result of treatment , looked a shadow of his former self during an outing in Los Angeles .
With his clothes hanging from his reduced frame , the actor was barely recognisable as he walked to his car .
The 56 - year - old edged along the roadside , gripping hold of a nearby post for support as his brother Don waited in a car park to take him to an appointment .
Frail : Actor Patrick Swayze was seen in Los Angeles looking startlingly frail , having lost weight and his hair as cancer takes its toll on the Ghost star
US magazine The National Enquirer said the Dirty Dancing star 's weight had dropped to just 7st 5lbs ( 47.6 kilos ) .
However , friend and actress Whoopi Goldberg said : ' You know what , he ’s doing what everybody else is doing , he ’s taking it one day at a time .
' He does not have an expiration date on his backside - none of us do .
We just know at some point it ’s going to happen and that ’s how he ’s looking at it , ' she added .
A year on from being diagnosed with late - stage pancreatic cancer , Swayze recently admitted that he may have only two years to live .
Support : Frail Swayze , who is reported to weight just 7st 5lb , held onto a post for support as he made his way to his car
In his first TV interview since being diagnosed , the Dirty Dancing star told U.S. TV host Barbara Walters that he was ' scared and angry ' and had been ' going through hell ' .
Swayze said : ' Five years is pretty wishful thinking .
' Two years seems likely if you 're going to believe statistics .
I want to last until they find a cure , which means I 'd better get a fire under it . '
Swayze 's public appearance came as the fate of his television show The Beast remains uncertain .
The Ghost star went public with his illness a year ago .
Soon after , he signed on to shoot television show The Beast on location in Chicago .
Swayze threw himself into the physically demanding role of Barker , an undercover agent teamed up with rookie Ellis Dove ( played by Travis Fimmel ) .
Despite the 12 - hour - day shooting schedule , he worked without painkillers , taking chemotherapy at weekends .
Golden years :
Swayze hit the big time in 1987 when he starred as a dance instructor in ' Dirty Dancing '
But it has attracted low ratings and is unlikely to return for a second season .
A show source said Swayze 's rapidly declining health would be a deciding factor .
The series arrived on a wave of publicity mainly driven by the grim prognosis and exaggerated accounts that he was near death .
' As has been the case from day one , it is all about Patrick - in a lot of ways , said a show source .
' It is about his condition , and when and whether he would be up for another gruelling production schedule . '
The actor has been married to wife and former dancer Lisa Niemi , 53 , for 33 years .
Gates Foundation awards Funds for pro-GM political lobbying and removal of regulatory obstacles
OPEN LETTER from GM Free Cymru
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
PO Box 23350
Seattle , WA 98102
( 206 ) 709-3100

10th January 2009
Dear Friends ,
Gates Foundation awards Funds for pro-GM political lobbying and removal of regulatory obstacles
We have been alerted by an article in " Truth about Trade and Technology " ( a pro-GM trade newsletter ) that you have awarded a substantial grant ( $ 5.4 million ) for what will effectively be pro-GM political lobbying , designed to break down regulatory obstacles to GM planting programmes in Africa and elsewhere in the world ( 1 ) .
This is not the impression one gets from the very bland press release from the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center , but TTT is in no doubt at all , having talked to the grant recipients , as to the purpose of the award .
http://www.truthabouttrade.org/content/view/13106/54/
Quote : " The funding will help the center secure the approval of African governments to allow field testing of genetically modified banana , rice , sorghum and cassava plants that have been fortified with vitamins , minerals and proteins ............. "
The only mention in the Donald Danforth Center press release ( 2 ) is to the formulation of " a regulatory strategy " and otherwise the statement is full of obfuscation , dissembling and carefully manipulated spin .
For example , there is not a single mention of GMOs or genetic engineering , and the term " appropriate technologies " is used instead .
That is thoroughly dishonest .
The use of the name " BioSafety Resource Network " ( BRN ) is yet another example of a name designed to encourage confidence and complacency and to mask activities which involve disruptions of plant genomes with unpredictable consequences and potentially damaging health effects .
There appears to be virtually no science involved in this project , with the funding devoted almost exclusively towards lobbying , diplomacy and attempts to loosen up regulatory frameworks .
This activity is essentially political , and designed to drive forward GM technology in countries which are currently rightly sceptical about it .
This is NOT the type of activity which should be funded by a charitable foundation , especially since the recipient organization has very close links with Monsanto , widely seen as one of the most corrupt and evil organizations in the corporate world .
Is the Gates Foundation totally unaware of the dangers associated with GM " biofortification " techniques and of the failure of Golden Rice ?
Is it unaware of the science which shows clear evidence of health and environmental harm associated with GM foods and crops ?
Is it unaware of the socio- economic impacts of GM crop plantings on a substantial scale , with industrial monocultures replacing balanced local farming economies , and with corporate feudalism leading to mounting farm debts , bankruptcies and suicides among farmers ?
These " wonder " GM crops fortified with minerals , proteins and vitamins absorb huge amounts of research effort and millions of dollars of funding , while others look on with amazement at the obsession with a bright and shiny technical fix for an invented grubby little problem .
The GM industry , and its " charitable arms " , have thee simple objectives -- namely to " lower the standards for the risk assessment of genetically modified ( GM ) seeds worldwide , to put moral pressure on the critics of GM seed , and break consumer rejection . "
The ultimate aim is commercial and political , involving nothing less than the corporate control of the global food system -- and it is a sad thing indeed that the Gates Foundation should be closely involved in promoting this despicable agenda .
I will appreciate your comments on the foregoing analysis ,
Yours sincerely ,
Dr Brian John GM Free Cymru

But today Allison , the green sea turtle with only one flipper , was back on the right track thanks to a prosthetic fin .
Scientists kitted out the 5 - year - old turtle in a black wetsuit complete with a dorsal fin on the back to help her glide along gracefully with other turtles .
Little Allison , who was brought in to a rehabilitating centre for turtles in 2005 , was found painstakingly swimming in tight circles in the sea after losing her fin in a suspected shark attack .
Staff initially feared the turtle would n't survive as she would struggle to find food and swim to the surface for air , but she recovered well from her injuries and soon wormed her way into the hearts of the rescuers .
Workers at Sea Turtle Inc - a
Texan non-profit group that rehabilitates sea turtles - searched desperately for a way to help the circling turtle , whose life expectancy is a staggering 150 years .

Why A Decline In Home Prices Should Not Cause Defaults
It seems that we have taken as an axiom the idea that if the price of a home drops below the face value of the mortgage , the borrower will default on the mortgage .
That sounds like a good rule , since it ’s got prices dropping and people defaulting at the same time , so there ’s a certain intuitive appeal to it .
But in reality , it makes no sense .
Either the borrower can afford the mortgage based on her income alone or not .
However , it does make sense if you also assume that the borrower intended to access the equity in her home before the maturity of the mortgage .
That is , the home owner bought the home with the intention of either i ) selling the home for a profit before maturity or ii ) refinancing the mortgage at a higher principle amount .
If neither of these are true , then why would a homeowner default simply because the home they lived in dropped in value ?
She would n’t .
She might be irritated that she paid too much for a home .
Additionally , she might experience a diminution in her perception of her own wealth , which may change her consumption habits .
But the fact remains that at the time of purchase , she thought her home was worth X .
And she agreed to a clearly defined schedule of monthly payments over the life of the mortgage assuming a price of X .
The fact that the value of her home suddenly drops below X has no impact on her ability to pay , unless she planned to access equity in the home to satisfy her payment obligations .
Annoyed as she might be , she could continue to make her mortgage payments as promised .
Thus , those mortgages which default due to a drop in home prices are the result of a failed attempt to access equity in the home , otherwise known as failed speculation .
In short , if a home drops in value , it does not affect the cash flows of the occupants so long as no one plans to access equity in the home .
And so , the ability of a household to pay a mortgage is unaffected in that situation .
This is in contrast to being fired , having a primary earner die , or divorce .
These events have a direct impact on the ability of a household to pay its mortgage .
I am unaware of any proposal to date which offers assistance to households in need under such circumstances .
The Dismal Science Of Mortgage Modification
Simply put , available evidence suggests that mortgage modifications do not work .
[ IMAGES REMOVED BY UST ; SEE REPORT LINK BELOW ]
The charts above are from a study conducted by the Office Of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The full text is available here .
As the charts above demonstrate , within 8 months , just under 60 % of modified mortgages redefault .
That is , the borrowers default under the modified agreement .
If we look only at Subprime mortgages , just over 65 % of modified mortgages redefault within 8 months .
This may come as a surprise to some .
But in my mind , it reaffirms the theory that many borrowers bought homes relying on their ability to i ) sell the home for a profit or ii ) refinance their mortgage .
That is , it reaffirms the theory that many borrowers were unable to afford the homes they bought using their income alone , and were actually speculating that the value of their home would increase .
Morally Hazardous And Theoretically Dubious
Why should mortgages be adjusted at all ?
Well , one obvious reason to modify is that the terms of the mortgages are somehow unfair .
That ’s a fine reason .
But when did they become unfair ?
Were they unfair from the outset ?
That seems unlikely given that both the borrower and the lender voluntarily agree to the terms of a mortgage .
Although people like to fuss about option arm mortgages and the like , the reality is , it ’s not that hard for a borrower to understand that her payments will increase at some point in the future .
Either she can afford the increased payments or not .
This will be clear from the outset of the mortgage .
So , it does n’t seem like there ’s much of a case for unfairness at the outset of the agreement .
Well then , did the mortgage become unfair ?
Maybe .
If so , since the terms did n’t change , it must be because the home dropped in value and therefore the borrower is now paying above the market price for the home .
That does sound unfortunate .
But who should bear the loss ?
Should the bank ?
The tax payer ?
How about the borrower ?
Well , the borrower explicitly agreed to bear the loss when she agreed to repay a fixed amount of money .
That is , the borrower promised “ to pay back X plus interest within 30 years . ”
This is in contrast to “ I promise to pay back X plus interest within 30 years , unless the price of my home drops below X , in which case we ’ll work something out . ”
Both are fine agreements .
But the former is what borrowers actually agree to .
Not enforcing voluntary agreements leads to uncertainty .
Uncertainty leads to inefficiency .
This is because those who have agreements outstanding or would like to enter into other agreements cannot rely on the terms of those agreements .
And so the value of such agreements decreases and the whole purpose of contracting is defeated .
In a less abstract sense , uncertainty creates an environment in which it is impossible to plan and conduct business .
As a result , this type of regulatory behavior undermines the availability of credit .
But even if we do not accept that voluntary agreements should be enforced for reasons of efficiency , mortgages represent some of the most clear and unambiguous promises to repay an obligation imaginable .
The fact that a borrower was betting that home prices would rise should not excuse them from their obligations .
There are some situations where human decency and compassion could justify a readjustment of terms and socializing the resultant losses .
For example , the death of a primary earner or an act of war or terrorism .
But making a bad guess about future home prices is not an act that warrants anyone ’s sympathy , let alone the socialization of the losses that follow .
The Elephant In The Room
This notion that Subprime borrowers were victimized as a result of some fraudulent wizardry perpetuated by Wall Street is utter nonsense .
Whether securitized assets performed as promised to investors is Wall Street ’s problem .
Whether people pay their mortgages falls squarely on the shoulder of the borrower .
Despite this , we are spending billions of public dollars , at a time when money is scarce and desperately needed , on a program that i ) is demonstrably ineffective at achieving its stated goals ( helping homeowners avoid foreclosure ) and ii ) rewards poor decision making and imprudent borrowing .
Given the gravity of the moment , a greater failure is difficult to imagine .
But then again , we live in uncertain times , so my imagination might prove inadequate .
The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is the much anticipated , long awaited “ next generation ” telescope .
Planned for launch in 2013 October 2018 , JWST has been touted as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope .
With it , astronomers hope to look back in time to when the universe was just 200 million years old , and see the first stars and galaxies .
The lead scientist guiding this project is Dr. John Mather , co-recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work with the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) , which measured the black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background .
We were understandably honored when Dr. Mather contacted Universe Today , saying he ’d like to talk with us about the status of JWST .
“ I figured it might be time to talk about what we ’re doing , ” he said , “ because exciting things are starting to happen . ”
Universe Today : Dr. Mather , for over a decade we ’ve been hearing about the Next Generation Space Telescope , which later was officially named the James Webb Space Telescope .
Can you tell us how the concept for this telescope began ?
John Mather :
In 1989 , even before the Hubble was launched , a conference was held about what the next space telescope should be .
They discussed great telescopes of the future and from the proceedings , published a book .
But they really did n’t consider that infrared was the great wave of the future .
Then , in 1993 , there was a committee called HST and Beyond .
They published a lovely little report in 1996 that said there were two important things to do .
One was to build an infrared telescope , unlike what the previous book had said , and the other was to build a telescope to search for Earth - like planets .
At that point , astronomers were just recognizing that searching for extrasolar planets was possible .
So in October 1995 , NASA Headquarters called me up , gave me a list of scientists and engineers to contact and said to start planning .
So we did , and we immediately came to a remarkable convergence of thought and opinion .
We quickly agreed on a concept which met the wishes of the scientific community and came within the ambitions of NASA .
You ’ll find that the telescope we wanted to fly back then is very much like the one we ’re going to fly in 2013 .
UT : Can you give us an update on the status of the JWST right now ?
Mather :
The flight instrument hardware will be coming in from all over the world in the summer of 2010 .
The fine guidance sensor comes from Canada , one and a half instrument packages come from Europe and the rest comes from the US .
So , in 18 months the instrument package starts going together , and then it meets up with the telescope around a year later .
The four science instruments are a near - infrared camera , a near - infrared multi- object spectrograph , a mid-infrared instrument , and a tunable filter imager .
We just went through the Critical Design review for the instrument module .
Last week we had hundreds of people come to look at everything and tell us if we ’re doing it right .
I think we passed , although I have n’t seen the official paperwork yet .
But even I was impressed .
UT : The question many people ask me is , since Hubble has been so successful , why is n’t JWST going to be an optical telescope ?
Mather :
Why did the committee change from optical to infrared ?
It was twofold .
One was that Hubble was getting so good , they could see it would be hard to beat it , no matter how big you built a telescope .
Another thing happening was that people were seeing you could build big optical telescopes on the ground .
The Keck Telescope was working really well , and people were starting to talk about adaptive optics , which meant even bigger telescopes on the ground were worthwhile .
So those two things pointed us towards an infrared telescope .
Also all the scientists of the JWST said we needed infrared .
From the little capability we did have at the time , infrared was fascinating , finding that the most distant universe is exciting and is red-shifted from the visible .
It starts out in ultraviolet and gets to infrared because of the great distances of these objects and the huge red shift they have .
So if you want to do ultraviolet astronomy at the almost - edge of the universe you need an infrared telescope .
UT : Now that the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope is up and running so well , has that changed anyone ’s mind , or does that make scientists want to go to the next level with infrared ?
Mather : Yes , Spitzer has proved this is actually a fascinating territory .
Spitzer is actually a little bitty telescope by modern standards ; it ’s only 3 feet wide , 85 cm .
But it has been producing some astonishing surprises .
They can see things out to very , very high red shifts , and none of those things were expected .
So , that tells us infrared is where the wonderful discoveries will be .
We now know we can do the technology , so let ’s get a better telescope .
The science is way , way exciting , and there ’s so much out there waiting to be discovered .
UT : In your opinion , what will set the JWST apart from previous space telescopes ?
Mather : Every telescope says , “ I ’m better than the one before me , ” and we say the same .
Of course , this telescope will see farther back in time with its infrared capability and its huge aperture ; it will see through dust clouds to see where stars are being born ; it will see things that are room temperature , like you and me , planets , or young stars being born .
All those things can be seen directly with the infrared capability we have on this new telescope .
Most of the work will be done in infrared , with some capability in the visible range .
But we ’ve built a general purpose telescope .
After launch , scientists can write proposals as they do for Hubble , for what they would like to observe , so they can observe whatever the hot topic is at that time .
UT : With your experience with COBE and the subsequent honors you received , how have you applied that to the JWST ?
Mather :
It was n’t so much the honors that affected my life , it was the fact of having been through the process from the very beginning to the very end for a very radically designed observatory , which COBE was , that gave me the nerve to think big things .
So when NASA Headquarters said they wanted a successor for Hubble , I thought that would be interesting , and I had enough nerve to say yes , I ’d like to try that .
COBE was very ambitious for the time , but small enough that I knew the engineers personally and I could talk to them any day about anything .
So I thought I could graduate to a bigger project .
UT : And now you ’re working with people from all around the world ?
Mather :
Yes , this is a huge deal .
Our science team is about 19 people , from Europe , the US and Canada .
The engineering team is over 2,000 people who are spread out all over the world .
Clearly , I do n’t know all of them .
I work with the scientists most closely and talk with them about what we want to accomplish , and make sure we are accomplishing that .
So I have a different role now .
I do n’t have hands - on responsibility for any hardware , but I work with the people who do .
We have access to some of the very best people in the world on every topic .
UT : Can you talk about of the problems this telescope has had to overcome , the cost overruns and the delays it has had ?
Mather : Number one , the cost overrun is not as big as is being portrayed by some folks that would like the money for their own project ideas .
Originally Dan Goldin was the head of NASA when we started , and he said , “ We want you to think of a way to do this observatory for a half a billion dollars in 1996 dollars . ”
We said we ’d try .
But we quickly realized building this was going to be hard .
By the time we got ready to present it to the decadal survey in 2000 , the cost was more like one billion dollars .
Then , three years ago , we saw that the job was getting harder and we had to replan and rebudget .
Now , if you count the entire NASA cost from beginning in 1995 to the end , somewhere after 2019 with inflation and civil servants ( which we were n’t counting before ) now it is roughly $ 4.5 billion in actual real dollars , not 1996 dollars .
So there is cost growth , but we have had excellent success and we ’re on track to launch this wonderful machine , which will be used by thousands of astronomers .
And we have n’t had to change our plan or our total budget in three years , thanks to steady leadership from NASA HQ and brilliant technical work by the teams .
UT : That ’s good to know .
I think people have a general concept that the JWST has had a huge cost overrun .
Mather :
Well , it ’s not something small , and we wish we could have done better on that .
But it ’s about a factor of two growth , and not the factor of five that has been advertised by some people who should know better .
This telescope will work for a long time .
The requirement is five years , but we ’re hoping to run it for ten .
So , our project spans from 1995 to maybe 2024 when operations would end .
Let me give you some idea of what we needed to do to get ready and what we ’ve been up to all this time .
We developed a list of ten major technologies that we needed .
The hardest thing was to develop the mirrors .
That required twelve different contracts just for developing the competitors to where their designs were good enough , so that took quite a few years .
The detectors clearly had to be improved over what we have on the Spitzer and Hubble telescopes .
So now we have bigger and better detectors , and they are fabulous .
One measure astronomers have is how many stray electrons do you get from the detectors .
If you close off all the light you should get zero .
We now have detectors that give off a few stray electrons per pixel per hour , which is almost perfect .
It would be good to be even better , but this is fabulous .
I ’m impressed .
We needed to improve on the refrigerators in space .
We started off saying we need to get a radiatively cooled telescope so that it would be cool enough by itself , and that ’s mostly true .
But it turns out we still need an active refrigerator to keep the longest wavelength detectors cold , so we had to develop that .
So , those are just some of the things we had to design , and all the technology development was finally finished in 2007 and passed the review board ’s approval , who said , ” Yes , those things are finally ready now to be built . ”
So , just getting to 2007 was a long time , and I do n’t think people have really appreciated what it takes to get new technologies ready .
On the other hand , we ’ve been blessed by not having to “ back up . ”
We put enough planning and effort into these technologies that they work now .
That was one of the things we learned from the Hubble project , which was , do n’t finish your design until you know what you ’re supposed to build .
UT : How about your testing process .
Is it pretty rigorous ?
Mather :
That is another lesson we had to learn from Hubble .
If you do n’t test it , it ’s not going to work .
We ’ve learned to have a very determined and rigorous process .
They did enough testing on the Hubble that they could have known about the mirror focus problems .
The mirror manufacturer had two tests that did n’t agree and they decided to ignore one of them instead of tracking down the reason , and that turned out to be foolish and expensive .
We have a generalization that if anything really matters , do it twice .
We will actually test the telescope cold in the big vacuum tank down at Johnson Space Center .
So it will be a full - scale end - to - end “ light - in - at - the - beginning , light - out - at - the end ” sort of test , something they could not do for Hubble .
But they knew they could go fix Hubble in space , and we know we ca n’t fix JWST , since the telescope will be at the L - 2 point , about 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth , which is about four times further away from the Earth than the Moon .
This is a complicated project , but our approach for doing a complicated project is dramatically different from when I was a young feller .
When I got here to Goddard , we used pencils and slide rules , and computers were pretty new and most people did n’t have them .
Now we have computers everywhere that keep track of our documents .
We can do systems engineering , and even can do very accurate , complete simulations to know if something will fit together and work before we even built it .
So the world has changed , and it ’s a wonderful thing to see .
So this is why we are now able to build this observatory for about the same real cost as it took to get the Hubble launched and working .
But JWST is so much bigger and more powerful .
UT : Can you tell us about the design for the mirror for the JWST ?
Mather :
The hardest thing to build was the mirror , because we needed something that is way bigger than Hubble .
But you ca n’t possibly lift something that big or fit it into a rocket , so you need something that is lighter weight but nonetheless larger , so it has to have the ability to fold up .
The mirror is made of light - weight beryllium , and has 18 hexagonal segments .
The telescope folds up like a butterfly in its chrysalis and will have to completely undo it self .
It ’s a rather elaborate process that will take many hours .
The telescope is huge , at 6.5 meters ( 21 feet ) , so it ’s pretty impressive .
The sun shield is completely new , and it too will have to deploy .
So , what was wrapped up into a small cylinder , relatively speaking becomes a giant shield about as big as a tennis court .
It ’s huge .
All this happens in multiple stages and will take days .
We hired a company , Northrop Grumman that had experience unfolding things in space , and they tell us this is definitely not the most complicated thing they ’ve unfolded in space , which is reassuring .
Video of the JWST deploying in space :
UT : Has there been any discussion of first light and what the JWST will look at first ?
Mather : Yes , a little .
That will be the fun part after we get the thing put together .
UT : Do you have any favorite suggestions ?
Mather : I think we should start with easy targets that will be pretty , that will enable the public to say , “ Oh , I see its working ! ”
Some of the first observations can be done when we ’re setting up the telescope , even before it ’s fully adjusted .
Because it is deployed after launch and the mirror is n’t close to the right shape at first , we ’ll be working up to this gradually .
There ’s a test model at Ball Aerospace in Boulder Colorado , where we get to practice putting the 18 mirror segments into position .
Each segment has 7 motors on it to control the position and curvature , so we have to rehearse this one .
This is something they could n’t do with Hubble .
They wished they could , and it did have motors but they could n’t push hard enough .
That ’s an interesting story .
We learned from Hubble how to correct the optics based on the images we were getting , so we ’re doing it on purpose for this telescope .
UT : There has been some controversy about how the JWST will be launched .
Mather :
We ’ll take the telescope to French Guiana and load it in the rocket down there .
The ESA is buying the launch vehicle for us ; it ’s the Ariane 5 rocket , a commercial product from Europe and they ’ve had a good run lately , so it ’s very reliable .
Naturally that caused a lot of controversy .
Even if Europe was giving us the launch vehicle , so to speak , there were people here who did not want to accept it .
It took headquarters two years to accept it .
That cost us money .
The only reason it was accepted was that we got a new administrator who would accept it .
That was Mike Griffin , so I want to say , “ thank you very much Mike Griffin ! ”
UT : Your team still has a lot to do before 2013 , which will probably be here before you know it !
Mather : Yes , I know .
It ’s been over 13 years now since NASA contacted me about this , but now the end is coming up fast .
We have plenty of technical challenges ahead of us in putting everything together .
And we have n’t gotten far enough to along yet find out how many things we broke or how many mistakes we made , but I think we ’re pretty good at figuring them out before we make them .
It ’s going to be very exciting to put the equipment together for the first time .
We ’ve got the pieces , we ’ve got the picture on the box to show where they go , and pretty soon we get to prove that they work together , or not .
By the time we receive all the parts here at Goddard , they will all have been tested individually , so they ’re supposed to play together just fine .
But nature does n’t like arrogance , so we have to test the whole thing from beginning to end , just as we ’re going to use it in flight .
After we put it together here , we take it down to Johnson Spaceflight Center , and put it in the giant vacuum tank there .
That will be an extraordinary process .
UT : Thank you so much for talking with us .
Mather :
This has been fun .
I love telling my story and I ’m glad you want to tell it with us .
I figured it might be time to talk about what we ’re doing because exciting things are starting to happen .
Magnificent things are happening .
We ’ve got the Kepler Observatory up now , and hopefully they ’ll find a handful of Earth - like planets to track down and we ’ll take a closer look at them .

A few years ago I tried to explain why I felt more comfortable with the label ‘ classical liberal ’ than ‘ libertarian ’ .
The Australian political identity survey can help see if the distinctions I was trying to make hold up .
One of my claims was that libertarians tend towards a rights - based view of politics .
Consistent with this , 59 % of the 184 libertarians in the survey supported either a constitutional bill of rights or a statutory charter of rights .
By contrast , 52 % of the 256 classical liberals preferred leaving the protection of individual freedoms to the democratic system , which among other things allows broader considerations to be taken into account .
( Charts containing classical liberal and libertarian views compared , and further analysis can be found here . )
However , a large minority of classical liberals want freedoms to be protected by the courts , and a large minority of libertarians preferred the democratic system .
Across most issues , there was a pattern of classical liberals and libertarians being on the same side of a broad debate but with libertarians taking the more radical stance .
For example , while 40 % of classical liberals chose the most radical option of cutting tax as a proportion of GDP to 20 % or less , 57 % of libertarians chose that option .
While 46 % of classical liberals thought that minimum wage laws should be repealed , 59 % of libertarians took that view .
While 50 % of classical liberals would legalise marijuana entirely , 65 % of libertarians would do so .
As I said in 2006 , ‘ if libertarianism and classical liberalism are not identical twins they are at least first cousins , which is why classical liberals can end up appearing like “ moderate ” libertarians . ’
As these numbers indicate , while general knowledge of the pro-freedom , pro-market ideologies of classical liberalism and libertarianism lets us predict what side of an issue most respondents will be on , for many issues significant numbers of respondents do not take their ideological logic to its most extreme conclusion .
Many take a more ‘ moderate ’ view , and on some issues surprisingly large minorities take an opposing view .
For example , 38 % of classical liberals and 27 % of libertarians support a state or national curriculum .
A government monopoly to indoctrinate young people sounds like an improbable conclusion from classical liberal or libertarian first principles .
Yet even narrowing the sample to strong supporters only , still 25 % of classical liberals and 17 % of libertarians supported monopoly curriculum .
Very large minorities of both groups also support compulsory voting .
While classical liberals and libertarians appear divided on a number of issues , these divisions can be as much within the groups as between .
For example , there are no majority views on climate change .
While the pure ‘ denialist ’ view is 10 % or less in both groups , those who believe it is happening are divided between natural and human causes ( with slightly more supporting the latter general consensus view ) .
Similarly , none of the three options for responding ( nothing , carbon trading , carbon tax ) received majority support from either group .
ACCC review of company mergers causes debate in classical liberal and libertarian circles , and there were supporters of both the for and against the ACCC view in both groups .
Though larger numbers in both groups favoured ACCC intervention where a merger would substantially lessen competition , it was a 39 - percentage point margin for classical liberals but only a 2 - percentage point margin for libertarians .
Though generally libertarians are radical classical liberals , on quite a few issues the responses of the two groups were near identical .
They hold the same unfavourable views on benefits for families capable of self - reliance , the same favourable views on privatisation of government assets , nearly the same levels of support for the idea that government should fund but not deliver school education and health services , the same attitudes to abortion ( legal in the first 24 weeks was the most popular option ) , both in almost equal proportions think that penalty rates should be decided by negotiation rather than by government , and their views on the effects of phasing out tariffs are the same .
Tthe survey provides no evidence of the religious influence sometimes claimed by critics on the left .
62 % of classical liberals and 72 % of libertarians say that they are either agnostics or atheists .
Their pro-abortion views and overwhelming support for either improved legal recognition of gay relationships or marriage being a matter of private contract are consistent with this strong secular stance .
In my methodology post , I noted the low proportion of female respondents .
I checked to see whether male and female responses differed .
On most questions , males and females took the same side of the debate , but on a number of questions , female classical liberal respondents preferred different options to male respondents .
These were unfair dismissal laws ( females preferring application to larger companies rather than abolition ) , marijuana use ( females preferring legalisation for personal use only ) , minimum wage laws ( females preferring them , while recognising effects on employment ) and compulsory voting ( females in favour , males against ) .
It ’s hard to know whether these women were representative of classical liberal women more generally , but overall there is little reason to believe that more women would have substantially altered the results .
In general , the survey is consistent with the impressions I had of the differences between the two groups , though it did not ask questions on deeper philosophical points and could not measure intellectual style .
Classical liberals and libertarians are on the same side of the political debates covered in this survey , with libertarians tending to be more radical .
However , there are substantial differences of opinion within both groups , including sometimes large minorities holding views apparently inconsistent with their broader ideological commitments .
Sony Corp's PlayStation3 outsold Nintendo Co Ltd's Wii in March for the first time in 16 months in Japan thanks to the hot new PS3 titles from Sega Sammy and Capcom , a game magazine publisher said .
TOKYO - Sony Corp's PlayStation3 outsold Nintendo Co Ltd's Wii in March for the first time in 16 months in Japan thanks to the hot new PS3 titles from Sega Sammy and Capcom , a game magazine publisher said .
Video game sales are closely watched for hints on how soon Sony can turn around its struggling game operations and how much growth momentum Nintendo has left .
Domestic sales of the PS3 came to 146,948 units in the five weeks through March 29 , compared with 99,335 units of the Wii and 43,172 units of Microsoft Corp 's ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 , Enterbrain said on Monday .
The latest versions of popular action adventure series from Sega Sammy Holdings Inc and Capcom Co Ltd" Ryu Ga Gotoku 3 " and " Resident Evil 5 , " respectively came in first and second in game software sales in the period , helping drive PS3 demand .
Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Etsuko Tamura said that despite its strong showing in March , the PS3 is unlikely to threaten the Wii's global dominance as more software makers are focusing development resources on the Wii , a console with the largest user base among the current generation of hardware .
The president of the Sydney chapter of the Hells Angels , Derek Wainohu , and the Comanchero city chapter chief , Mahmoud " Mick " Hawi , had organised the sit - down to discuss the problem of Zervas 's parlour .
During the meeting Anthony Zervas arrived with a sawn - off shotgun .
" That is a big no - no to do that at a sit - down , " said the underworld figure .
A scuffle ensued during which one of the Comanchero was hit in the head with the gun .
" That 's when it turned into open warfare , " the crime figure said .
The next day the tattoo parlour was sprayed with bullets .
Several weeks later a masked man on a motorbike fired three shots at the building .
The parlour has been closed since October after being firebombed .
On that occasion a silver car disgorged three men shortly before 11.30 pm .
After smashing the front window , the car sped off and the parlour went up in flames .
At the time the Herald reported that since the store had its official opening in September , although it had been trading in the previous months , up to six Comanchero members had taken to circling the block on their bikes during the day on at least four separate Saturdays .
" There 's five or six of them and they circle like vultures .
There 's a group of the Hells Angels standing out the front of the shop with their arms folded , looking tough .
They wear their colour , their branded jackets , then the police come and drive around .
It 's like Keystone Cops , " a nearby store manager said at the time .
A police source yesterday confirmed the sit-down and the consequences of Zervas setting up the tattoo parlour in Comanchero territory .
He said the move by Zervas to set up a tattoo parlour in Brighton would have been inflammatory .
" Brighton - le - Sands is right in the heartlands of [ the Comanchero City Chapter 's territory ] , it 's where they go every Friday , Saturday night . "
It was an overreaction to a flippant remark made to Peter Zervas while walking along a street in Brighton - le - Sands that had landed him in jail in the first place .
In the early hours of New Year 's Day 2005 a reveller had called out " Happy New Year " to him .
" F--- you .
You think you 're a legend and a clown , " snapped Zervas , who returned five minutes later with a black revolver from which he fired up to six shots , wounding one man .
A travel bag with the revolver , a sawn - off shotgun and clothing was found at Anthony Zervas 's neighbour 's home during a police search later that night .
It was never going to end well when the Hells Angel leader Derek Wainohu happened to be sharing the same flight , QF430 , from Melbourne to Sydney , with five Comanchero on Sunday two weeks ago .
When he called for reinforcements to meet him at the airport , the Zervas brothers were among those who answered his call to arms .
Within 10 minutes of the plane 's arrival , Anthony Zervas lay dying on the floor at Terminal 3 .
Wearing his Hells Angels T - shirt , his older brother Peter comforted him as bystanders attempted to resuscitate him .
Meanwhile , the registration number of the taxi seen speeding from the airport with four Comanchero inside was circulated on the police radio network .
Within half an hour police had pulled over the taxi and arrested the four occupants .
Coincidentally , it was stopped in Brighton - le - Sands in the same street as Peter Zervas 's ill - fated tattoo parlour .
Loading Last Sunday , only a week after his brother 's death , Peter Zervas survived a hail of bullets outside his mother 's home .
But the bikie is following another piece of gangland etiquette - he is refusing to speak to police about either his brother 's killer or the identity of his would - be assassin .

The news of Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps smoking pot should re-energize the marijuana legalization debate because America should be a free marketplace of ideas where ALL perspectives joust .
Yet to even consider legalization is often unacceptable in polite company .
But , because all public policy should be rationally debated , let 's at least look at some legalization arguments .
I wish no one used any recreational drug ( and I avoid them all ) .
But if we must outlaw everything potentially dangerous , then we need a federal 30 mph speed limit and a ban on fatty foods greasing the obesity epidemic killing over 300,000 Americans annually ( CBS News ) .
Somehow we survived legal marijuana until 1937 .
It actually helped finance our revolution , clothe the Continental Army , and provide the paper for our Declaration of Independence and Constitution .
Washington and Jefferson grew it , and the latter even risked smuggling it out of Europe .
In fact , before 1870 , hemp oil ranked second only to whale oil in creating light around the world .
During World War II , the feds pushed hemp production to make rope for the war effort .
Dope got banned because federal cops wanted to keep their jobs ( alcohol prohibition was repealed in 1933 ) , cotton farmers wanted to end hemp competition , and whites linked pot to Mexican immigrants and black jazz musicians .
Louis Armstrong never performed without it , and a later user , Beatle Sir Paul McCartney , still calls joints " herbal jazz cigarettes . "
But Caucasians feared white girls would " go crazy " on dope and become intimate with minority males .
So , to avert " Reefer Madness , " the weed got outlawed instead of the cancer sticks , liver poison , and " Mother 's Little Helper " pills preferred by the ruling class .
Today over 12 percent of federal and state inmates are doing time for pot , costing taxpayers over $ 1 billion annually ( In These Times ) .
A record 872,000 Americans were arrested for it in 2007 alone -- 89 percent just for possession ( the FBI ) .
In fact , an attorney on " The O'Reilly Factor " revealed a few years back that there were more lifers in California prisons for pot than for murder , rape , and kidnapping combined .
So pot - smokers get locked up with and brutalized by our most violent felons .
How 's that for " rehabilitation " ?
Then their criminal records deny them student loans , good jobs , and even voting rights .
Does our abuse of drug-users resemble how we used to mistreat the mentally ill ?
The medical evidence shows drug addicts are unwisely self - medicating a dopamine deficiency in the brain .
They need treatment , not an 8 x 10 cell .
How do you think future generations will judge us ?
William F. Buckley , Jr. noted that 400,000 police can't go after violent crimes and theft due to the endless " War on Drugs . "
There 's also epidemic vice squad corruption with drugs since their price is so inflated precisely because they 're illegal .
Psst :
The folks most against legalization -- are drug dealers !
Why not tax our biggest cash crop and let cops chase violent felons ?
Does n't prohibition fuel the forbidden fruit syndrome ?
The 1920s ' alcohol ban criminalized a huge percentage of decent Americans , created organized crime in the US , and corrupted thousands of police and officials ( even President Warren Harding and Chief Justice William Taft secretly drank ) .
Though none is healthy , is pot remotely as bad as alcohol or cigarettes ?
CBS
News reported that half of US hospital beds are filled by folks with alcohol - related problems , and we have 110,000 alcohol - lubricated deaths every year .
Also , the Justice Department admits that alcohol was the only drug found in 36 percent of all convicted criminals and is a factor in over 40 percent of murders .
Cigarettes are as addictive as heroin ( former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop ) , do far more bodily harm than any opiate ( addiction medicine specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky ) , and kill 430,000 Americans a year ( CDC ) .
My hygienist says they can even cause teeth to fall out in your thirties .
Though pot is psychologically addictive for some , no one ever overdosed , got cancer , or died from marijuana .
Nor do people get violent on it ( as Bill Maher says , " Forgetting to kill your wife on pot , okay " ) .
Also , studies show most pot -smokers do not graduate to harder illegal drugs .
Legalization does n't mean more pot smoking .
In Holland , where marijuana is tolerated , just 12 percent of Dutch aged 15 - 24 said they used pot in 2005 .
But , in nearby France , where it 's illegal , 24 percent of French youths admitted smoking it that year .
And , in the U.S. , almost 28 percent of Americans 18 - 25 said they used marijuana in 2004 - 5 .
Yet , with effective health classes and ad campaigns , U.S. tobacco and alcohol consumption have gone way down in recent years .
Better education can lower pot use as well .
Though 12 states have passed referenda liberalizing marijuana laws , the feds keep vetoing our constitutional democratic states ' rights .
Ultimately , either we 're for less government or we 're not .
Is it really state business what consenting adults do in their own home ?
Must we have a national nanny state with Big Brother jailing citizens for a weed ?
And would n't our libertarian Founding Fathers be appalled at this gross encroachment on our privacy rights ?
Let 's at least debate returning to our roots and finally standing up for freedom for a change .
Exactly why not ?
Asthma affects 5 m people in the UK A low intake of vitamins A and C could raise the risk of asthma , a team which reviewed 40 studies carried out over the past 30 years has said .
A Nottingham University - led team found people with a low intake of vitamin C had a 12 % increased risk of asthma , the Thorax journal reported .
For vitamin
A the raised risk was less clear cut , the team said , but there was still a significant association .
Asthma UK and the Medical Research Council said more research was needed .
There has been a lot of confusion over the link between vitamins and the condition , which affects five million people in the UK .
The jury is still out as to how exactly vitamin intake and asthma are related
Leanne Male
Asthma UK
Previous studies have come up with a variety of conclusions .
In this study , the researchers analysed the relevant reports on both children and adults published since 1980 .
They found no link for vitamin E , but said the associations for A and C were significant .
They concluded low levels of vitamin C - found in fruit and vegetables - increased the risk of asthma by 12 % .
They were unable to put an exact figure on vitamin A - found in cheese , eggs and oily fish - but noted that those with severe asthma consumed on average half of the recommended intake of the vitamin .
Lead researcher Dr Jo Leonardi - Bee said : " Our findings indicate that low levels of vitamin C intake and to a lesser extent vitamin A are consistently associated with asthma risk to a degree that , if causal , would be sufficient to be clinically relevant . "
He said it was now important to carry out larger - scale studies to clarify the link and to see if there was a direct cause between vitamin intake and asthma .
Other factors Experts agreed more research was needed , but warned other factors would also play a significant role .
Glenys Jones , a nutritionist with the Medical Research Council , said : " The data provided is interesting , but inconclusive .
" There are many factors such as smoking , physical activity and socio- economic status that have not been taken into account .
" Therefore more research is required to investigate a causal relationship . "
Leanne Male , assistant director of research at Asthma UK , added : " The jury is still out as to how exactly vitamin intake and asthma are related . "

The orangutan is one of the most endangered great apes
A hitherto unknown population of orangutans numbering perhaps 1-2,000 has been found on the island of Borneo , conservation researchers say .
Members of the reclusive endangered species were found by scientists acting on tip - offs from local people .
Much of the orangutan 's tropical forest habitat in Indonesia and Malaysia has been cut down for timber extraction and to create palm oil plantations .
About 50,000 orangutans are thought to remain in the wild .
" The reclusive red - haired primates were found in a rugged , largely inaccessible mountainous region , " Erik Meijaard , of Nature Conservancy Indonesia , said .
The journey to the region took 10 hours by car , another five by boat and then a couple more hours hiking .
The team found more than 200 nests crammed into just a few kilometres and spotted three wild orangutans in the canopy above them - a mother and her baby , and a large male who broke off branches to throw at them .
It is even possible , the researchers say , that this could be a kind of orangutan refugee camp - with several groups moving into the same area following widespread forest fires .
The team of scientists is now working with local groups to try to protect the area .
Buildout is a tool for automating software assembly .
It ’s important that given a project configuration , two checkouts of the configuration in the same environment ( operating system , Python version ) should produce the same result , regardless of their history .
For example , if someone has been working on a project for a long time , and has committed their changes to a version control system , they should be able tell a colleague to check out their project and run buildout and the resulting build should have the same result as the build in the original working area .
American Depositary Receipt ( ADR )
American depositary receipt ( ADR ) was introduced in 1927 as a more convenient way for investors to buy and sell shares of foreign corporations .
Put simply , ADRs represent a specific number ( or fractions ) of a share in a company that does n’t already have a stock listed on the US stock exchanges and trade like a stock in the open market .
A Little Background about ADRs
Back in the days , it was very complicated to buy shares in different countries , which involved dealing with tax and currency issues .
Subsequently , ADR was introduced to let U.S. banks buy shares from a foreign company and re-issue them on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) , American Stock Exchange ( AMEX ) or the Nasdaq .
During the introduction , the bank will also determine how many shares will correspond to each home country share .
The reason why it is n’t a 1 to 1 relationship is due to the fact that banks want to price shares of ADR high enough to perceive substantial value and low enough for individual investors to take advantage .
For example , exchange rates can make certain stock look like a penny stock , which will have a negative psychological effect on investors in the U.S .
A Reminder of Risks with ADRs
Other than the actual company that the ADR represent , investors should be aware of additional risks when buying into a foreign corporation .
For example , there might be political risks in the home country that the foreign country is in .
For example , if two countries start a war , you can bet that the prices of any ADR that is linked to those two countries will fall .
While this is true for stocks in the U.S. as well , the additional risk in foreign countries is that you are n’t as sensitive with news abroad .
Also , currency plays a huge role in ADRs as shares are priced in U.S. dollars .
For example , if the U.S. currency becomes stronger against the foreign countries ’ currency , the earnings of the foreign company have to make up the difference before share prices will appreciate meaningfully .
Of course , exchange rates can work in your favor as well .
In an environment where the U.S. dollar is weak ( and continues to become weaker ) , ADRs usually perform very well .
What does ADRs Mean for Us
ADRs provides investors a great way to diversify into foreign markets because it ’s highly liquid , easy to manage and it trades just like any other stock .
While there are brokerage firms like Etrade that will allow you to buy stocks in foreign countries , ADRs are available for everyone provided that the company you want to invest in has an ADR set up .
As an average investor who picks individual stocks , there is no reason why you should n’t look into ADRs .
If you have n’t taken advantage yet , you are missing out since the additional diversification and ease of management is well worth it .

What on earth is happening out there in theatreland ?
It 's like the G20 riots .
Reported instances of actors losing it with disruptive audience members mid-performance and yelling at them to stop phoning / taking photographs / giggling / whispering / coughing / breathing ( delete as necessary ) , seem to be as regular a feature as opening nights themselves .
Sometimes the victims even have the temerity to answer back .
If things get much worse , audiences will have to be safely kettled in the circle bar till the performance is over .
Actor Patrick Stewart apparently lost his rag with an autograph hunter outside the stage door of the King 's theatre in Edinburgh , after a performance of Waiting for Godot .
" Are you the arsehole who was sitting in the front tonight ? " was his introductory comment , before bellowing " You know , what I really want to know is how you can sleep at night ?
I really hope you 're pleased with yourself . "
Apparently , the importunate individual had been spied earlier by Stewart trying to take a sneaky photograph of him and his co-star , Ian McKellen , during the curtain call – in clear contravention of explicit warnings that photography was not permitted .
While most punters will have gone to see Vladimir and Estragon , others are clearly there to gawp at Picard and Gandalf .
To many it may seem that thesps are in danger of forgetting whom it is who pays their wages .
Oscar Wilde famously said the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about at all : and if leading actors do n't want to be pestered for a little piece of their magic , they should n't be in live theatre .
Should they ?
The flashing of cameras and waving of mobile phones at eye - level can just about be absorbed in Grease or We Will Rock
You , but in straight plays , in intimate venues , these activities can be a nightmare - particularly as the shutters and flashes always seem to activate during the most dramatic pause or just before the punchline .
Many a beleaguered stage actor would agree , that it 's virtually impossible these days to get through a show without somebody in the audience treating the experience as if it were just another heritage landmark to be captured and recorded for the folks back home .
Of course when you 're a big star , the problem – and the temptations – are magnified 100 % .
I 've frequently witnessed well - known actors besieged by requests at the stage door to sign up to 10 or 15 identical prints of themselves in some iconic TV performance – often by people who have n't even seen the show .
I suspect this recent outburst of Stewart 's is an example of the straw that broke the camel 's back ;
Godot is n't easy to get right , even if everything 's going for you .
And I 've no idea how much a signed photograph or programme of a leading Trekkie would fetch nowadays , but I would n't mind betting it would be enough to feed a family of four for days .
There 's a story I heard a few years back – possibly apocryphal , but I suspect not – from the time Stewart was playing Macbeth in the West End .
A young teenager had allegedly been waiting outside the stage door ever since curtain down on the Saturday matinee , with a picture of the actor in full warp factor five mode in the hope of getting a signature .
With night ( and the second show ) fast approaching , he was still there .
Eventually Stewart ( who I suspect has a soft heart ) , weakened and broke his own rule about gratuitous autograph - giving by popping upstairs to gratify the child 's dearest wish .
By midnight , it was up for auction on eBay .
Senate majority leader says the United States is ' stuck ' with Roberts , Alito Reid : Roberts ' did n't tell us the truth '
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Friday that John Roberts misled the Senate during his confirmation hearings by pretending to be a moderate — and that the United States is now “ stuck ” with him as chief justice .
“ Roberts did n’t tell us the truth .
At least Alito told us who he was , ” Reid said , referring to Samuel Alito , the second Supreme Court justice nominated by President George W. Bush .
“ But we ’re stuck with those two young men , and we ’ll try to change by having some moderates in the federal courts system as time goes on — I think that will happen . ”

Reid ’s comments , which came during a wide - ranging discussion hosted by the Christian Science Monitor , reflect Democratic concerns that Roberts presented himself as a neutral arbiter of the law but has wielded a relentlessly conservative agenda .
Republicans reject the attacks , saying Roberts has been a fair judge and has been consistent in his opinions .
Although Reid said that Democrats will try to put moderates on the bench , he said he will not try to deny Republicans the right to filibuster nominees .
In 2005 , then - Majority Leader Bill Frist threatened to eliminate the filibuster , sparking a furious reaction by Reid and other Democrats who said the so - called nuclear option would quash the rights of the minority .
“ As I said at the time , the nuclear option was the most important issue I ’ve ever worked on in my entire career , because if that had gone forward it would have destroyed the Senate as we know it , ” Reid said .
“ If the Republicans want to filibuster a judge , that is directly contrary to what their political philosophy was , but I guess it ’s all subject to change , ” he added .
Reid called GOP efforts to block President Bill Clinton ’s judges “ a dark point in the history of our country .
I would hope we do n’t have to go through that again . ”

The Always Innovating Touch Book does something I 've never seen from a netbook : it has a fully detachable keyboard dock and transforms from a standard looking 8.9 - inch netbook , to a stand - alone tablet .
Advertisement
Spearheaded by Gregoire Gentil , the man behind the Zonbu Desktop and Laptop , the Touch Book is his latest project , and a promising one at that .
Gentil says the Touch Book 's hardware and software are fully open source and ready for modifications .
While the device will come preloaded with a custom Touch Book OS , Gentil says this machine is capable of running mobile operating systems such as Android or Windows CE .

The hardware I saw was n't quite complete — the software was demoed on a prototype , and the final hardware above were just empty shells to give an idea of the design — so I cant comment too much on how well the end product performs , but I saw enough to consider this thing more than vaporware .
The Touch Book is the first netbook powered by a 600 MHz TI OMAP3 processor ( built around ARM technology ) , 256 MB RAM , 3 - axis accelerometer , an 8 - gigabyte microSD card for storage and two batteries providing up to 15 hours of usage between charges .
The 8.9 - inch screen can display resolutions up to 1024x768 and uses a resistive touch panel .
There 's also the usual offerings of 802.11b/g/n wi-fi and Bluetooth .
As a standalone tablet , the Touch Book is roughly 9.5 " x7 " x1 " and weighs about a pound .
When docked to the keyboard , it is about 1.4 - inches thick and weighs 2 pounds .
All of the Touch Book 's guts , except for one of the batteries , are housed in the tablet portion of the device , so that it 's fully functional while detatched from the keyboard .

The chipset fits on a motherboard about the size of an index card , and is heavily optimized to get the best performance out of the hardware .
Part of this involves stacking the RAM directly on top of the processor in a package on package configuration .
The lid of the touchbook also pops off , so you have easy access to the hardware and it's two internal USB ports you can use for dongles you dont want hanging off the side of the tablet .

As far as software goes , the OS is based around the Open Embedded Linux platform , but fully customized for the Touch Book hardware .
As such , the Touch Book has the power to handle full screen video , and render OpenGL 3D graphics .
Gentil says the Touch Book can run some of the same games found on the iPhone and plans to offer them in the future .
The Touch Book UI design depends on what configuration the hardware is in .
When docked to the keyboard , the Touch Book uses a standard , cursor - based UI that looks like other Linux desktops .
However , when in tablet mode , it uses a custom - designed , touch - based UI .
The touch UI is based around spherical icons that rotate in a circular fashion as you swipe to the next one .
Content is divided into three categories : web , apps and settings .
Advertisement
On the apps side , Touch Book will ship with both Firefox and Fennec ( Mobile Firefox ) , games that will make use of the accelerometer , plus various sorts of web and productivity apps , such as word processor and spreadsheet - type programs .
Advertisement
Always Innovating plans to start shipping the Touch Book in late May or early June , priced at $ 300 for the tablet alone , or $ 400 for the tablet and keyboard dock combination .
Pre-ordering will begin next week , and you can order the Touch Book in either red or dark grey colors .
Gentil says he would also like to release future iterations that include support for GPS and 3G mobile broadband .

NEW TOUCHBOOK COMBINES NETBOOK AND TOUCHSCREEN TABLET ; PROVIDES THREE TIMES THE BATTERY LIFE AT UNDER TWO POUNDS PALM DESERT , Calif .
March 2 , 2009 : Always Innovating today unveiled the Touch Book , a versatile new device that works as both a netbook and a tablet thanks to a detachable keyboard and a 3D touchscreen user interface .
The Touch Book , previewed at DEMO 09 , weighs less than two pounds as a netbook and has a battery life of 10 to 15 hours – three times longer than most netbooks .
" The Touch Book is perfect for these tough economic times because you can use it in so many ways , " said Gregoire Gentil , founder of Always Innovating and creator of the Touch Book .
" You can use it as a netbook computer , a hand - held game device , or a video player .
You can even reverse the keyboard to prop it up on a table in an inverted ‘ V ' .
Finally , because it is magnetic , you can remove the keyboard and put the tablet on the fridge to serve as a kitchen computer or digital frame . "
The Touch Book combines the best of open source software and open hardware with a sleek industrial design by designer Fred Bould .
The innovative design includes internal USB plugs .
" I hate having dongles hanging from my laptop – I often end up disconnecting them accidentally – so we opted to put the USB inside , " said Gentil .
The Touch Book is the first netbook featuring an ARM processor from Texas Instruments , resulting in outstanding battery life , and a fan less , heat - and - noise - free system .
According to Chris Shipley , executive producer of the DEMO Conferences , the Touch Book 's innovative architecture and industrial design earned it a spot on the DEMO conference stage .
" The longer battery life is a boon to netbook users .
But the Touch Book 's versatility – its ability to function as a netbook as well as a standalone touchscreen tablet – makes it a breakthrough product , " said Shipley The Touch Book is expected to ship in late spring and will start at $ 299 .

Feds were involved in ACORN raid in Nevada , officials say Brad Jacobson
Published : Wednesday March 18 , 2009
Print This Email
This US Attorney allegedly involved appointed after US Attorney firings Federal agencies were involved in the decision to raid the office of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) in Nevada last October , just weeks before Election Day , the offices of Nevadas Secretary of State and Attorney General say .
The allegations raise questions of whether politics played a part in the raid and calls into question assertions by the US Attorneys office that they were uninvolved .
Federal guidelines instruct agencies investigating election fraud to avoid action that might impact the elective process .
Bob Walsh , a spokesman for Nevadas Secretary of State , and Edie Cartwright , a spokeswoman for Nevadas Attorney General , said that not only were the Nevada US Attorneys Office and the FBI involved in investigating Nevada ACORN on allegations of voter registration fraud but that all four agencies jointly made the decision to conduct the raid .
Both the investigation and the raid were conducted as part of the joint federal - state Election Integrity Task Force announced last July , the spokespersons said .
In initial conversations with Raw Story , Walsh wouldnt specify the federal agencies involved in the decision to raid the ACORN office .
But after being presented with previous statements he'd made in which he said the US Attorney and the FBI were involved , he said ,  My comments dont come with an expiration date . 
Asked to confirm if that meant he did indeed stand by every statement he made in an earlier report , Walsh added ,  Yeah . 
Cartwright corroborated Walshs two main assertions : that Nevada 's US Attorney and the FBI were involved in the investigation of Nevada ACORN as part of the joint federal - state Election Integrity Task Force , and the decision to raid the ACORN office was made between these four agencies .
Asked to confirm that her office agreed with Walsh , Cartwright answered without hesitation ,  Yes , that s right . 
Their statements appear to contradict those previously made by Nevada US Attorney Greg Brower 's spokeswoman Natalie Collins .
In October , Collins said the US Attorneys office and the FBI have not been , and are not , at the present time , involved . 
Collins later said she was misquoted .
( Brower is pictured above right . )
Told of the alleged involvement of the Nevada US Attorneys Office and the FBI in the ACORN raid , Justin Levitt , an election law expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law , expressed concern .
 The manual governing how federal prosecutors are supposed to act with respect to election crimes says you should do everything in your power to conduct your investigation so that the investigation does not become an issue in the election ,  Levitt told Raw Story in a recent interview .
 The raid is certainly not that . 
 Exactly how much input the federal government had , or exactly how much direction the federal government had in making the raid happen ,  Levitt continued , is going to determine exactly how outraged people should be at the federal governments participation . 
He added ,  And its not like they hadnt had warnings that this was going to be a sensitive issue . 
In 2007 , for example , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) excoriated former interim Missouri US Attorney Bradley Schlozman for announcing the indictments of four former ACORN workers on charges of voter registration fraud just five days before the 2006 election .
Gerry Hebert , an election law expert who spent over twenty years as a Justice Department attorney prosecuting voting rights cases , pointed to specific guidelines in the Departments Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses manual that raise questions about the federal agencies  role ( cited from page 12 ) :  In most cases , election - related documents should not be taken from the custody of local election administrators until the election to which they pertain has been certified , and the time for contesting the election results has expired ,  the manual says .
 This avoids interfering with the governmental processes affected by the election .
 Another limitation affects voter interviews ,  the manual continues .
 Election fraud cases often depend on the testimony of individual voters whose votes were co-opted in one way or another .
But in most cases voters should not be interviewed , or other voter - related investigation done , until after the election is over .
Such overt investigative steps may chill legitimate voting activities .
They are also likely to be perceived by voters and candidates as an intrusion into the election .
Indeed , the fact of a federal criminal investigation may itself become an issue in the election . 
Hebert said the Justice Departments Office of Public Integrity is supposed to be consulted prior to any voter interviews in a pre-election period .
Thats in the US Attorneys  Manual .
The Nevada US Attorneys spokeswoman , Natalie Collins , would not comment on the alleged involvement of her office or that of the FBI , saying it was Justice Department policy not to confirm or deny the existence of investigations . 
The Nevada field office for the FBI did not return calls for comment .
Speaking on behalf of the Department of Justice , Laura Sweeney of the Office of Public Affairs declined to comment on whether the Nevada US Attorneys office and FBI were involved in the ACORN investigation and raid .
She also declined to answer questions on whether Nevada US Attorney Gregory Brower consulted with and attained approval from the Election Crimes Branch of Public Integrity before proceeding .
Conflicting statements Last October , Nevada US
Attorney spokeswoman Collins denied the involvement of the Nevada US Attorneys Office and the FBI in the ACORN raid and claimed that the investigation into ACORN in Nevada was not conducted as part of the Election Integrity Task Force .
 The task force was formed to facilitate coordination between agencies , but not every investigation is a task force investigation ,  Collins told The Huffington Post .
 The subject investigation is being pursued by the state ( SOS office ) , and the US Department of Justice ( FBI and USAO ) have not been , and are not , at the present time , involved with it . 
In the same article , Nevada Secretary of State spokesman Walsh disclosed the involvement of the US Attorneys office and the FBI in the ACORN raid .
According to Walsh , after he told the Huffington Post that federal agencies were involved , Collins contacted him and expressed displeasure and made it abundantly clear that he was not to speak for the Nevada US Attorneys office in the future .
Raw Story confronted Collins about her earlier statements to the Huffington Post .
In response , Collins said that the publication had misquoted both her and Mr. Walsh and had subsequently issued a correction .
Yet no correction was issued by the Huffington Post and Raw Story confirmed with both the reporter on the story , M.S. Bellows , and the managing editor of Off The Bus ( Huffington Posts special 2008 campaign section ) , John Tomasic , that neither Walsh nor Collins was misquoted and no correction or retraction was issued or warranted .
Bellows stood behind all statements obtained for his article , as did Bellows editor .
In addition , Walsh contends that all comments he had made to the Huffington Post were accurately reflected .
Raw Storys attempts to contact Nevada US Attorney Gregory Brower for clarification of Collins  discrepancies were denied and redirected to Collins , who subsequently did not return calls .
Connection to US Attorneys scandal Nevada US Attorney Gregory Brower , a Bush appointee , replaced Daniel Bogden , one of the US Attorneys purged in the prior administrations Department of Justice scandal that is still under investigation by Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy .
The US Attorneys scandal involved the firing of eight attorneys who had failed to prove their loyalty in pursuing Bush administration objectives .
Various reasons for their dismissal appear to have included probing Republicans for corruption , refusing to initiate investigations into Democrats and declining to prosecute unfounded claims of voter fraud . 
The internal Justice Department investigation completed last September by the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility clearly found that former New Mexico US Attorney David Iglesias , asked to resign on the same day as Bogden , was purged for partisan political reasons after he had set up an Election Integrity Task Force in 2006 similar to the one in Nevada last year but had failed to prosecute any cases of election fraud .
The report notes that the task force targeted ACORN in New Mexico .
But Iglesias found no grounds for prosecution .
As Iglesias wrote in his 2008 book , In Justice , Inside the Scandal that Rocked the Bush Administration ( p. 89 ) :  After an exhaustive examination of the facts , I felt I had dispelled the phantoms of voter fraud in New Mexico .
But some people had wanted a different result , whether or not it was warranted by the facts . 
Absent from the Inspector General report is that Bogden , an independent who claims no Party affiliation , had reportedly opened a corruption probe during his US Attorney tenure into Nevada Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons .
Gibbons was alleged to have accepted payments and gifts while serving in Congress from his friend Warren Trepp , owner of Reno - based eTreppid Technologies LLC . , in return for helping to secure defense contracts for Trepps company .
Charges were never brought against Gibbons during Browers tenure as US Attorney .
According to Gibbons  lawyer , Abbe Lowell , the probe ended on November 2 , two days before the Democratic victory in the 2008 Presidential election , which quickly led to sweeping changes in the Department of Justice .
The day after the Nevada ACORN raid , Governor Gibbons issued the following press release .
 Our voting system is very simply the greatest in the world and is the basis of what makes this country great ,  Gibbons said .
 The allegation that an organization that s main purpose is to register new voters was doing so fraudulently is very troubling .
I believe that requiring a photo ID to vote is a very reasonable protection for our voting system and should be enacted as law by the 2009 Legislature . 
Gibbons ' use of the ACORN raid to possibly further a political agenda is similar to other cases of alleged political prosecutions , such as the case of Mississippi lawyer Paul Minor and the use of his indictments and conviction to paint Democrats as corrupt .
Joe Rich , the former Chief of the Voting Section at the Justice Department , who spent nearly forty years at the DOJ , said the overt actions taken against Nevada ACORN strongly suggest that DOJ policy may have been violated .
 Certainly , doing a raid on an organization that is trying to register voters is terribly intimidating ,  Rich said .
 I mean that s much more intimidating than interviewing voters or people from ACORN .
Rich said he was familiar with the Oct. 16 , 2008 Associated Press report of an anonymous Justice Department leak which revealed a national investigation into ACORN on allegations of systematic voter registration fraud  noting that the leak itself was against Department policy .
Its timing , he added , could amount to another breach of guidelines in the Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses manual .
But he had heard little about the events in Nevada .
 I find it unusual that the federal government , given its policies , would jointly do an investigation like this , this close to an election ,  Rich said .
 It certainly indicates that what was going on back then was much more of an intrusion into the election than the initial reports showed . 

One strange thing you might notice when reading about asteroids and other bodies in the Solar System is that most of the time the only dimension given to illustrate their size is diameter .
This is perfectly understandable for most objects in the Solar System as well as extrasolar planets , but even when mentioning bodies that are similar to or smaller than the Earth ( and thus possible future destinations for human exploration ) the only dimension given is diameter , and almost never do you see the surface area given alongside this .
What 's strange about that is that diameter is simply the distance from one side , through the centre and to the other end :
The reason why surface area is also important is that it 's the only measurement that gives us some idea of what it would actually be like to stand on the surface of another planet , moon or asteroid , as so it 's the easiest for us to visualize .
It 's the measurement we use for the size of countries , cities , our houses and the land they are built on .
Diameter is simply the distance between the surface of an object and the surface directly on the other side ; that is , the distance from where you are standing , down into the centre and then back out again , so diameter alone does n't really tell you much about just how much there is to explore on the surface of a body in space .
So in order to help visualize the real size of an object when standing on its surface , let 's take a look at a few sample bodies from Venus all the way down to an average - sized near - Earth asteroid and see just how much there is to explore for someone standing on the surface .
With these in mind it should then become much easier to guess at the real size of an asteroid the next time you read about one in the news .
Venus
Mars
Mercury
Venus is an easy calculation .
The total surface area is 90 % that of the Earth , but there are no oceans on Venus whereas 70 % of Earth 's surface is covered by water ( total land area on Earth is 148,940,000 km² ) .
This means that the total surface area on Venus is equivalent to three times that of the land on Earth .
Pity the temperature is about 450 degrees C on the surface .
The area 50 km above the surface could be colonized , however .
Mars is just as easy as Venus .
The surface area is 144,798,500 km² , and that 's all the land area on Earth minus Greenland and Mexico .
Eventually one day we might be able to terraform
Mars though and then the land area will be significantly less than that on Earth , but for the time being it's about this much : Mercury has an area of 74,800,000 km² , or one third the land area of Earth .
That 's the equivalent of Asia and Africa put together , still a huge area to explore :
Next we 'll go with the Moon .
Here it is next to the Earth for comparison :
That 's looking rather small now but it still has a surface area of 37,940,000 km² .
That 's Africa plus Australia : Next is Ceres Ceres is located in between Mars and Jupiter and is in my opinion a great destination for colonization once we 've developed to the point where we 're able to think about choosing a destination .
It has a diameter of 950 km , giving it a surface area of 2.8 million km² .
Though now we 've gotten to the point where surface gravity is only 3 % that of Earth , it is still a considerably large area to explore , equivalent to Kazakhstan , the 9th - largest country in the world .
It 's also about the same size as Western Europe , or Alaska plus Texas plus California .
The Dawn probe will arrive at Ceres in 2015 .
The next largest body in the Asteroid Belt is Vesta
This is the next massive body in between Mars and Jupiter after Ceres , with a mean diameter of 530 km .
Dawn will be visiting Vesta in 2011 on its way to Ceres .
Now we 're down to bodies that are n't massive enough to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , so no more spherical shapes , but these are just rough comparisons so calculations will still be made on the assumption that we 're working with a sphere .
With an average diameter of 530 km , that gives us an area of approximately 880,000 km² .
Now we 're dealing with an area somewhat smaller than Venezuela , or Texas plus the states of Washington .
After these two are quite a few asteroids of some hundreds of kilometres in diameter , but none of these are likely to be explored in the near future so let 's drop in size a bit and turn to asteroids that we 've encountered before , starting from the largest .
This one is called 253 Mathilde and it has an average diameter of 52.8 km .
This gives a surface area of 8750 km² .
That 's the size of New Jersey , or Puerto Rico .
Next down on the list is 243 Ida This is an asteroid visited by the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter .
It also has a tiny moon called Dactyl that you can see on the right that is only a fraction of the size .
Ida has an average diameter of 31.4 km , giving a surface area of 3100 km² , or three quarters of Rhode Island .
Take out everything in the ocean and east of Providence and you have the surface area of 342 Ida .
As far as countries are concerned it has the surface area of Luxembourg plus Singapore .
The next one down the list is a particularly interesting one : 433 Eros
This asteroid has been observed in an unprecedented level of detail by the NEAR Shoemaker probe for about a year .
The average diameter of 433 Eros is 16.84 km , giving a surface area of 890 km² .
That 's Berlin , which is 38 km from north to south and and 45 km from east to west :
Next down the list is 951 Gaspra Gaspra was the first asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft , also by Galileo .
Assuming an average 12.5 km diameter the surface area works out to about 490 km² , which is about the same as the tiny country Andorra ( smaller than Berlin ) , sandwiched in between Spain and France and where Catalan is the official tongue .
At this size we 're now down to an asteroid that you could walk all the way around in a single day if you could actually properly walk on the surface .
After that : 2867 Šteins
This asteroid was encountered just last year by the Rosetta space probe , at a fairly distant 800 km away so the images of the asteroid are n't as sharp as the others .
It looks a bit like a diamond .
With a diameter of approximately 4.6 km , that gives an approximate surface area of 66 km² .
That 's around the same surface area as the country of San Marino , a tiny blip of a country ( but also the oldest sovereign state in the world , founded in 301 ) entirely located within Italy .
It 's still much much larger than the Vatican though , and large enough that it you could n't explore the entire area in a day , and walking a distance equivalent to walking all the way around would still take a couple of hours .
Now we 're getting near sizes of asteroids proposed by NASA as destinations for human explorers .
The next asteroid is 25143 Itokawa which is a potato - looking thing of some 350 m in diameter or so , kind of like a pile of rubble .
A lot of asteroids this size come fairly close to Earth , usually at distances just a few times more than that from the Earth to the Moon ( see spaceweather .com for near - Earth asteroids this month ) .
This asteroid has a surface area of 0.38 km² , about the same as the Vatican , the smallest country in the world .
And finally , an asteroid with a diameter of 100m .
This is a good size to pick because NASA has tentative plans to send humans to a near - Earth asteroid of just about this size , as a kind of test of missions away from LEO but much easier than missions to other more well - known areas of the Solar System .
100 metres sounds tiny but it still works out to 31,415 m² , so about six football fields .
Not bad in terms of total area to explore for a mere 100 metres in diameter , and it shows that even astronauts exploring a body as small as this will still have a lot of work to do once they get there .
The 1000 % Speedup , or , the stdlib sucks
I hate the stdlib .
There !
I said it .
Why do I hate it ?
Cookie , cgi , urllib , n'uff said .
Today I can add another module to the “ I hate you ” list .
I noticed that Werkzeug 's SharedDataMiddleware was just delivering 50 requests a second .
I tried around a bit but nothing changed .
Until I removed the call to mimetypes.guess_type .
Suddenly I got 500 requests the second instead of the previous 50 .
How badly implemented can that function be I was asking myself .
So I had a look :
def guess_type ( url , strict = True ) : init ( ) return guess_type ( url , strict )
WTF ?
And then it hit me . init( ) was loading the mimetype database and monkey patching the module so that guess_type ( ) was replaced by a new function .
Actually a method of the mimetype database .
And I was importing guess_type as follows :
from mimetypes import guess_type
So on every call the database was reloaded .
GNAAAaa .
So check out If you 're doing the same mistake .
If yes , change it to the following import :
import mimetypes
And now I file a ticket in the Python bug tracker ticket filed .

Miles and Miles of low road
by Jeremy Hooper
We 've made note of Pastor Miles McPherson 's inflammatory rhetoric on a couple of occasions .
On his now - defunct blog ( which was abruptly pulled and scrubbed around the time Miles became nationally known for his Prop 8 actions ) , the evangeli- xalted Rock Church leader wrote all kinds of nasty things about us , including this little nugget about which otherworldly leader is responsible for marriage equality :
" Satan wants to destroy God 's image .
The evil one is having a field day right now , and I believe things are going to get worse before they get better "
And then there 's audio like this , from last fall 's " The Call " event , in which he likened marriage equality advocates to cockroaches :
All pretty disturbing stuff , the likes of which have placed Miles , in our eyes , in a category of opposition that is willing to say just about anything in order to convince the populace that LGBT people are evil , pesky beings
But now our pal Alvin McEwen has discovered even more bullshittery from Miss California 's pastor .
Head over to Alvin 's site ( link at bottom of post ) for insight into this , something Miles wrote back in 2004 :
Alvin 's take :
Why does Miss California ’s church believe that homosexuality and pedophilia are linked ? [ HB & HM ]
Your thoughts
" Our God will intentionally make you suicidal .
Would n't you just loooove to worship him ? "
Posted by : ZJ | Apr 28 , 2009 9:09:35 AM
O_O WHUT .
Ok ... No. Just ... Just no .
NAMbLA =/= gay .
There are psychological reasons for WHY this tends to happen in STRAIGHT pedophiles .
One of those reasons is that the rejection of a parent of the same sex of the child warped the child 's mind so much , that the now - adult will try to ' love ' other children , to try and fill their own psychological needs .
Just because the pedophile preys on children of the same sex , does NOT make them gay .
This also works in the opposite way , as a gay pedophile might prey upon children of the opposite sex if they were damaged psychologically that way .
These people are sick , and need therapy among other things to overcome themselves .
This has been your Psych . 101 for the day .

Star Trek will disappoint no one .
As the lights dimmed and the familiar Star Trek Federation logo slid on screen , the emotion of all those hours of watching Next Generation reruns as a kid came sloshing back into my brain , dripping out of my eyes as tears of pure happiness .
I expect that it was essentially the same emotion Star Wars fans felt during the opening credits of Episode 1 , but without the massive letdown afterwards .
( Ha ha , suckers . )

But yes , to answer your question , there 's Kirk , there 's Spock , and there 's everyone you expect ( even Pike ! ) .
Not all of the same mannerisms are there , but if you wanted to see the old actors you 'd go watch the first six movies again .
This implies that Kirk does n't do a two - hour Shatner impression , which is , of course , good news .
Instead , he plays Kirk as a intelligent , brash , but friendly youngster that has confidence oozing out of every torpedo tube .
And the new Spock is more Sylar than Spock , to be honest ; though the rest of the casting is essentially spot on .
Advertisement
So long as you go into the movie expecting a " Star Trek " movie , in that there 's space and aliens and action and shooting and torpedoes and pew pew pew , you 'll come out happy .
The movie is targeted enough toward the mainstream in that someone with zero
Trek experience would enjoy it .
Director J.J. Abrams also gives enough shout outs to old time staples that trekkers will be giddy at the slight nods and fanservice that say , in essence , " thank you for supporting us all these years , now here 's something you asked for . "
Think of it like Casino Royale was to the James Bond franchise : fewer gadgets , more action and an incredibly pugilistic lead .
And lens flares .
Lots , and lots , and lots of lens flares .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Kirk 's Enterprise has never looked better .
These guys took the original ship , combined it with some designs of the Enterprise - B , then mashed it up with Picard 's Enterprise - E and then added a dash of ' 60s non-Trek Sci Fi .
The set design , however , is almost all touchscreen ( like TNG ) , but with a tremendously updated UI .
I 'd hate to call it Apple-y , but there 's lots of glass and slick white finishes .
Retro this is not — you 'll barely be able to equate the bridge to the original 's , other than the fact that the players are all sitting in the right places .
Why Bones canoodles in the bridge so much instead of where he 's supposed to be is still beyond me .

And the plot ?
The plot makes as much sense as any other Star Trek movie .
There 's even a very good explanation of why this movie is the way it is , which is the most I can say about that .
Advertisement
This is what Star Trek needs right now .
After writing on Next Generation , Ron Moore went on ( about a decade later ) to reimagine Battlestar Galactica , a relatively realistic show ( topic - wise ) that just happened to be set in space .
Sci
Fi fans have moved on from the utopian , and what many accused as sterile , confines of TNG to a grittier , less kempt future .
That 's not to say Star Trek is now gritty — it 's just more ... modern .
And more sexy .
Like when you upgrade from a six piece KFC meal to a 12 piece bucket : you 're going to get more breast and thigh .
Advertisement
It also does n't have any crap about the Prime Directive or any undertones about race that TOS and TNG dealt with , but it is a very good " restart " of the franchise .
With this film as the base , I cannot wait to see where the franchise goes from here .
Bonus : there 's a four - issue Star Trek : Countdown comic series that prequels the movie .
Though , you might want to wait until after you watch to read , since it gives away a few plot points .
To tell you more would be to spoil too much .
It 's too much even to tell you what KIND of fans would like the comic .
You can download the first one here for your iPhone .
KHARTOUM ( Reuters ) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee , John Kerry , will lead a delegation to Sudan ’s Darfur region , U.S. officials said on Monday , in a possible sign of a growing willingness to engage with Khartoum .
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry ( D - MA ) speaks at a news conference to discuss the role of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank in the global economic crisis on Capitol Hill in Washington March 18 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts
“ This is significant , ” a U.S. diplomatic source told Reuters .
“ It is the first Congressional delegation to Sudan we have had since 2007 .
Like the U.S. envoy ’s current visit , it is a new tack . ”
The new U.S. special envoy to Sudan , Scott Gration , who is currently touring the country , made an unusually positive statement on his arrival in Khartoum last week , telling reporters he was looking for friendship and cooperation from the Sudanese government .
Gration said he had arrived “ with my hands open , ” echoing a phrase used by President Barack Obama during his inauguration that was widely seen as an offer of greater engagement with the Islamic world .
U.S. officials said the appointment of Gration marked an attempt to find new ways to deal with the Sudanese government .
Gration , a retired Air Force general who grew up in Africa , is a close ally of Obama ’s and reports directly to the president , they added .
The U.S. diplomatic source said Kerry , a Democrat , would lead a Congressional delegation to Darfur , and would meet senior Sudanese officials in Khartoum in the middle of next week .
The state - run Sudanese Media Center said the U.S. Congressional delegation would visit Sudan for three days next week .
Sudan traditionally had a stormy relationship with the United States .
President Bill Clinton imposed wide - ranging sanctions on the country , accusing it of supporting terrorism .
Relations have been strained further by the conflict in Darfur , which both Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush have called genocide .
Gration sounded one note of criticism over the weekend , saying he was concerned Darfur was on the brink of a deeper humanitarian crisis following a decision by the Sudanese government to expel foreign aid groups
Sudan ’s president Omar Hassan al - Bashir expelled 13 foreign aid groups and shut down three local organizations last month , accusing them of helping the International Criminal Court build up a war crimes case against him .
The Hague - based court has issued an arrest warrant for Bashir , accusing him of masterminding war crimes in Darfur .
International experts say at least 200,000 people have been killed and more than 2.7 million driven from their homes in almost six years of ethnic and politically driven fighting in Darfur .
Khartoum says 10,000 people have died .

A.A. 20 Questions Test : Are you alcoholic ?
Comment on A.A. 20 Questions : " I remember clearly the first time i saw the A.A. 20 Questions .
It was many years before I landed in A.A .
Late one night , for some reason , probably because I was intoxicated , I was alone in a coin - operated laundry .

Perhaps I was just waiting for the spinning to stop !
( Yes .
I sure could have used some drying out ! ) .
I might have wrecked my car .

I got up out of my seat to look at one of the dryers and when I returned to my seat I noticed that there was a yellow card with the A.A. 20 Questions .
Someone hypocrite must have snuck in and placed the card in my seat ! :-)
After reading the A.A. 20 Questions .
I though it be some nitwit or an outfit that wants to do away with alcohol and drinking ! .
" Heck !
This would mean that everyone in the world is alcoholic ! "
It must have been a conspiracy , right ?
Besides -- only a lunatic would be out at 3 am , putting little cards like this on seats at a coin - operated laundry ! &qut ;

Comment : " I do n't think they do that anymore .
Maybe too many died trying to detox in meetings ? "
Comment : " I only answered " Yes " to 17 of the questions .

Comment : " I did n't know you could die while withdrawing alcohol .
I have a doctor friend that works E.R. and he told me it happens often .
He said you could have seizures , stroke , heart attack die and all kinds of stuff when quitting .
It 's good to get help and see a doctor . "

Alcohol Addiction Treatment and Recovery Information
12 Step Alcohol Addiction Treatment Recovery
It 's Earth Day in Washington and , all about , politicians are scurrying to offer their tributes to the environment .
Call it Earth Pander .
On Capitol Hill , the Congressional High Tech caucus is hosting a briefing -- led by California Democrat Anna Eshoo and Texas Republican Mike McCaul -- on smart grid technology .
The upshot : a new , intelligent grid could drastically increase the efficiency of the nation 's electricity infrastructure .
Plus , several committees are hosting climate change hearings on both sides of the Capitol .
And lots of Cabinet officials -- from Transportation , Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency -- are testifying .
At the White House , the Big Three automakers brought their new energy - efficient cars to the North Lawn in what the Obama administration billed as a " green " vehicle market research day .
Actually , the event was delayed for two hours because of rainy weather , prompting the Associated Press to quip that the cars might be fuel efficient but they 're not apparently waterproof .
Usually when executives from GM , Ford and Chrysler visit Washington , they are treated to lots of outrage from suddenly populist members of Congress who claim to be protecting the public purse .
To be sure , Chrysler and GM are meeting inside the West Wing with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers on the terms of their TARP loans .
But at least on the lawn , they were welcomed as heroes -- or at least innovators .
For his part , President Obama is in Iowa today , addressing workers about his energy plan at a " green " plant in Newton , Trinity Structural Towers , a former Maytag plant that now houses a manufacturing facility producing towers for wind - energy production .
But perhaps the most unusual Earth Day comment came from the Marijuana Policy Project , which told TheHill.com that a disparate array of politicians -- from Texas Republican and Libertarian darling Ron Paul to California Democratic Latino rock star Loretta Sanchez -- are now talking about legalizing marijuana , in part because of growing concern about the recent drug - inspired violence at the U.S. - Mexico border .
“ We are seeing a massive explosion of interest in this issue , very rapidly , across many different fronts , ” said Aaron Houston , the director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project .
“ It ’s definitely been difficult to keep up .
...
We ’ve been bolstering our staff . "
In his first nationwide e-town hall meeting , Obama got more questions about legalizing marijuana than about anything else , a product of a healthy lobbying campaign by the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
The president brushed off the question .
" There was one question that voted on that ranked fairly high and that was whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy and job creation , " he said .
" And I do n't know what this says about the online audience , but ... this was a popular question .
We want to make sure it 's answered .
The answer is no , I do n't think that 's a good strategy to grow our economy .
All right . "
But legalization advocates insist his non-answer answer drew a flurry of public interest .
" It ’s a bittersweet thing when the president dabbles in your subject matter , ” said NORML 's executive director , Allen F. St. Pierre .
Noting that he'd been at NORML since George H.W. Bush 's administration , he added , “ I ’ve been here long enough that , had President Bush been in that same situation , in a hand - picked audience , they would have hissed in 1991 .
So this is all moving largely in a very positive direction . ”

The world 's major economic powers are considering whether to involve internet service providers ( ISPs ) in fighting copyright infringement and how to stop pirated material crossing borders , according to documents released by the US Government .
Thirty - seven countries are negotiating a new worldwide trade deal that aims to reduce counterfeiting and copyright infringement , but details have until now been kept secret .
Called the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , the putative deal has been kept under wraps , but as part of US President Barack Obama 's commitment to transparency in government , details of the negotiations have been published .
The secrecy around the talks had attracted criticism from digital rights lobbyists .
The just - published summary indicates that the countries are considering how to involve ISPs in the process of combating internet piracy .
The document said that the countries were discussing " the possible role and responsibilities of internet service providers in deterring copyright and related rights piracy over the internet " .
Just last week the French Assembly passed a law that forces ISPs to disconnect those suspected of illegally sharing copyright infringing material on the third warning for up to a year .
ACTA is also considering what measures to implement to stop material from crossing borders .
Fears had emerged that the countries involved were considering ordering border searches of computers and MP3 players to identify and possibly take action over pirated material on personal players .
The outline of ACTA activity discounts that , making it clear that it is concerned only with industrial - scale importing and exporting of counterfeit material .
" Cross - border trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is a growing global problem that often involves organized criminal networks , " said the note .
It said that ACTA might include " a de minimis exception that could permit travellers to bring in goods for personal use " .
The document said that the countries were also looking into whether they should agree that only imported goods could be blocked or whether that could also apply to exports ; what the limits of civil and criminal enforcement would be ; and how the national authorities would co-operate and share information .
The Treaty aims to harmonise what scale of activity needs to be reached before infringement becomes criminal , and what rights authorities will have to destroy material .
The document also said that the Treaty would cover " criminal procedures and penalties in cases of camcording motion pictures or other audiovisual works " .
The process was begun by the US and Japan in 2006 but negotiations now include Australia , Canada , the European Commission and the EU's 27 member states , Mexico , Morocco , New Zealand , South Korea , Singapore and Switzerland .
There have been four rounds of negotiation on the Agreement , most recently in France in December .
Another was planned for March in Morocco , but was postponed as the US government asked for more time for its international trade authority to changeover in the aftermath of the change of government .

It is often said that good things take time , and if that is true then AMD ’s Fusion should prove to be exceptional considering the fact that it has been in the works since their $ 5.4 billion acquisition of ATI four years ago .
The official AMD copy for Fusion reads as :
“ AMD Fusion is a new approach to processor design and software development , delivering powerful CPU and GPU capabilities for HD , 3D and data - intensive workloads in a single - die processor called an APU .
APUs combine high - performance serial and parallel processing cores with other special - purpose hardware accelerators , enabling breakthroughs in visual computing , security , performance - per - watt and device form factor . ”
In short , Fusion is basically a standard processor ( think CPU ) and graphics processor ( think GPU ) in a single chip .
Recently AMD CEO Dirk Meyers advised analysts that the roadmap for Fusion would be making some detours .
Originally AMD had planned to lead with their mainstream offering named Llano which was targeted for both desktop and notebook PC’s .
It appears that now the green team from Texas will be leading with Ontario , a low - power package aimed primarily at netbooks and other minimalist computers , a change that is not sitting well with some analysts .
" It is disappointing , " said Craig Berger , an analyst with FBR Capital Markets in an interview with the Statesman .
Disappointing indeed , generally when most hardware companies are looking to launch a new product , especially an entirely new platform , they look the lead with their biggest guns hoping to grab prospective buyers with the wow - factor .
Additionally a shift from launching with a mainstream part to a low - power offering can indicate a production or design concern on AMD ’s side , further eroding analyst ’s faith in the company .
AMD is no stranger to being the underdog .
Intel has always eclipsed AMD in terms of capital , manufacturing capabilities and installation base .
AMD ’s key victories have been in terms of design innovations ( Athlon processors come to mind ) and their willingness to listen to and understand their customers needs .
Fusion is AMD ’s next big hope for a design win and a resulting shift in market share .
Berger mentions “ Intel is putting out phenomenal products right now .
They are firing on all cylinders .
If you want to keep pace , you need to be in the ballpark on ( manufacturing ) process technology , which AMD is not ” .
As with baseball , your team can only lose so many seasons before the fans quit going to the ballpark .
If done right Fusion could prove to be a real make or break launch for AMD as Berger points out “ [ t ] hey have a real shot at becoming good again , but it is going to require execution . ”
All is not doom and gloom for AMD however , recent wins on the desktop graphics side have begun to turn the tables on their rival NVIDIA as well as win some favor among analysts .
Graphics technology market analyst Jon Peddie is hopeful “ It is a genuine inflection point in the PC market and game changing for AMD and the industry ” .
Only time will tell if Fusion will truly prove to mark a come - from - behind - win for AMD or merely another strike out .
Cynthia Moreno clearly did n't expect anyone but a few friends to take note when she indulged in that time - honored pastime of college students : ranting about how much she hated her small hometown .
Unfortunately , the local high school 's principal , Roger Campbell , also spotted the " Ode to Coalinga " Moreno posted on her MySpace page — and forwarded it to the Coalinga Record , where it appeared as a letter to the editor under Moreno 's name .
The backlash was so severe — including death threats and even a gunshot at the family house — that Moreno 's parents and sister had to leave town .
Nevertheless , a California State appellate court ruled late last week that the publication of the letter did n't violate Moreno 's privacy rights .
The then - Berkeley student 's jeremiad — which began " the older I get , the more I realize how much I despise Coalinga , " and reportedly went on to disparage the California town 's residents over the span of about 700 words — only appeared on her MySpace page for six days before it was removed .
By then , however , Campbell — principal at the same high school attended by Moreno 's sister Araceli — had spotted it and forwarded it to his friend Pamela Pond , editor at the Coalinga Record .
So extreme was the reaction of the residents that Moreno 's father David shuttered his 20 - year - old trucking business , Left Over Freight Transportation , and moved the family out of town .
The family sued both the paper ( quickly dropped from the suit under state " anti-SLAPP " laws that discourage lawsuits against the press ) and Campbell , claiming both invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress .
On the privacy claim , Fifth District Court of Appeal Justice Bert Levy concluded that it was Moreno who had decided to make her rant public :
Here , Cynthia publicized her opinions about Coalinga by posting the Ode on myspace.com , a hugely popular internet site .
Cynthia ’s affirmative act made her article available to any person with a computer and thus opened it to the public eye .
Under these circumstances , no reasonable person would have had an expectation of privacy regarding the published material .
While the published letter did add Moreno 's full name — only her first name appeared on the MySpace page — she was so clearly identified by both circumstance and photographs that the court regarded it as too thin a basis to support an invasion of privacy tort .
The court did , however decide that a jury should be allowed to hear the infliction of emotional distress claim .
Especially given Cambell 's role as the principal of Moreno 's sister , the opinion reasoned , people might conceivably differ on whether his actions were sufficiently " extreme and outrageous " to constitute a tort .
Writing about the case earlier this week , UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh blasted that element of the decision , arguing that all Moreno 's claims should have been tossed :
The speech here may have been merely anti-Coalinga , but under the First Amendment precisely the same logic should apply when someone publicizes another 's postings that are ( say ) racist , anti-American , sexist , pro-drug -use , anti-gay , pro-crime , or or anti-religious in order to fault them for their views .
If you find that someone from your community is expressing views that you believe repulsive , and you try to condemn the person by posting the statements to your blog — or circulating them on an e-mail list or publishing them in a newspaper — you could , given the logic of the case , face a ruinous lawsuit .
This case may seem like a no - brainer , but social networking sites could present some harder cases in the near future .
Many such sites , after all , feature relatively fine - grained privacy controls , permitting users to determine precisely who will have access to different kinds of content that are " published " online .
Moreover , the terms of service for those sites often expressly forbid the republication of user content elsewhere .
So when is a particular post or photograph shared widely enough that it has crossed the line from private to public ?
No doubt we 'll have fresh lawsuits to test that question soon enough .
WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama ?s recent pledge to seek a ban on space weaponsdrew a mixed reaction from experts in the field , with some saying the presidentmight be better off pursuing something more modest and less complex , such as aset of international rules governing space operations .
Armscontrol advocates nonetheless applauded the statement as a welcome departurefrom the space policy stance of former President George W. Bush , who rejectedthe notion of banning or limitingspace weapons via treaty arrangements .
? The Bushadministration rejected space diplomacy , ? said Michael Krepon , co-founder ofthe Henry L. Stimson Center , a think tank here .
?
We refused to negotiate on anysubject that could limit U.S. military options .
We have a shift from anadministration that was very dismissive of multilateral negotiations [ as awhole ] , to an administration that is open to that possibility if it improvesU.S. national security .?
Soon after Obamawas sworn in Jan. 20 , the official White House Web site was updated with aset of policy guidelines including one on restoring U.S. leadership in space .
Under the heading ?
Ensure Freedom of Space , ?
the statement said the White Housewould seek a ban on weapons that ?
interfere with military and commercialsatellites ? ; assess possible threats to U.S. space assets and the best militaryand diplomatic means for countering them ; and seek to assure U.S. access tospace - based capabilities , in part by ? accelerating programs to harden U.S.satellites against attack .?
Obama ? scampaign in 2008 outlined similar goals , saying an Obama administration wouldoppose putting weapons in space , seek rules of behavior for spacefaring nationsand reduce the vulnerabilityof U.S. space capabilities .
The Bushadministration generally opposed international accords that might tie thenation ?s hands in space .
The National Space Policy issued by the Bush WhiteHouse in 2006 states in part that the ?
United States will oppose thedevelopment of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit orlimit U.S. access to or use of space .?
Meanwhile , the Pentagon during the past few years carried out or planned a number ofexperiments that critics charged were thinly veiled tests of space - basedweapons .
Early last year , with then - President Bush ?s approval , the Pentagon downeda wayward U.S. spy satellite using a sea - based missile interceptor .
Expertsgenerally agreed that Obama ?s statement signals a new direction in spacediplomacy , but some said it does not carry much meaning in the absence of keydetails , beginning with a good definition of the term space weapon .
Coming upwith such a definition is complicated by the fact that any number ofconventional military and even commercial capabilities can be used to disruptor damage satellites .
? Obama isdelivering on his promise of more cooperation , ? said retired U.S. Air Force Lt.Gen. James Armor , former head of the Pentagon ?s National Security Space Office .?
I like the idea of working together more with our allies , but verification of [ a ban on space weapons ] is very difficult .
If you can ? t verify something , itmakes it difficult to build a treaty .?
Armor saidObama ?s statement could have implications for counterspace operations , which ismilitary parlance for the ability to either disrupt or protect spacecapabilities .
?
My sense is this may make it a little harder to do counterspaceprograms , but we weren?t doing much of any offensive counterspace , ?
he said .?
Most of the Air Force ?s efforts are in space situational awareness anddefensive counterspace .?
TheresaHitchens , director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research anda longtime opponent of weapons in space , applauded the White House statementbut said that given the difficulty of coming up with an acceptable definitionof space weaponry , a better approach would be to seek a ban on certainbehaviors .
? I wouldsay this is good starting language , ?
Hitchens said in an interview . ??
Theproblem is most space technologies have multiple uses , so the approach thatshould be taken needs to look at actions rather than capabilities .
For example , a number of nations use lasers to track satellites , but lasers could also be used toattack satellites in space .
So we should focus on outcomes rather thantrying to ban certain classes of technology .?
JohnSheldon , a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute here , said arms controlagreements are fundamentally flawed and likely to break down at the exactmoment they are needed .
He said the United States would do more to protectspace security by taking the lead in pressing for informal rules of operationlike those used by commercial satellite operators around the world .
? We need toagree on a set of normative practices that will turn into a customary law likewe now have on the high seas , ?
Sheldon said .
?
Most countries obey the law ofthe sea based only on centuries of customary practice .?
Singer is right to point out the psychological differences in how we respond to the toddler in the pond as opposed to the distant starving child , but wrong if he concludes that we ought to be as generous to one as the other .
There are lots of reasons for not giving money to try to save the life of someone you have never met , in a country you have never visited , and in a culture you do not understand .
Here are some :
1 . You do n't know how much of the money will reach the child .
2 . You do n't know how much of the money will go to maintain the aid agency .
3 . You do n't know how much of the money will be taken by corruption in the child 's country .
4 . The money you and others give may even fuel corruption .
5 . The money you give may undermine self - reliance and appropriate development in the child 's country .
Giving aid may do more harm than good .
6 . You cannot save all the children who are dying and you cannot decide whom to choose or how .
7 . If the child has negligible prospects for a healthy and happy life , saving their life may only increase their suffering later .
8 . In a country where food and water resources are stretched to the limit , saving one child 's life may actually cause others ' deaths .
9 . We all bear some responsibility for world poverty and suffering and millions of us could give money if we thought it right ; but only you can save the child in the pond .
Every one of these arguments is contentious , and all could be countered , but they suggest we should think carefully about the consequences of giving aid to try to save lives .
Personally they lead me not to do so .
I give regular support to a number of charities but not including aid agencies .
I used to support " Population Concern " until they changed their name to " Interact Worldwide " and shifted their focus away from contraception and woman 's control of fertility .
I am not suggesting that my own moral response is right : I am suggesting that the two cases given are fundamentally different and we are right to respond differently to them .
The government insists the system in England is becoming " fairer " NHS prescription charges in England are to go up from £ 7.10 to £ 7.20 from April , ministers have announced .
The cost of a dental check - up on the NHS in England will also increase by 30 p to £ 16.50 .
The announcement came on the day doctors ' leaders called on the government to abolish prescription charges for all patients in England .
The British Medical Association ( BMA ) said the current system was not working and was " iniquitous " for many patients .
Graph : Prescription charges , UK and Northern Ireland since 2000 Prescriptions are free for everyone in Wales , will be free in Northern Ireland by 2010 and in Scotland by 2011 .
PRESCRIPTION CHARGES England : £ 7.20 [ from April ] Scotland : Phased out by 2011 Wales :
No charge since 2007 Northern Ireland : £ 3 from January 2009 , phased out by April 2010 The BMA has accused the government of supporting an " outdated " system in England which can harm health , saying that charging can put people off paying for the medication they need .
But the government has stressed that 89 % of prescription charges in England are dispensed for free .
Pensioners and children are exempt from the charges , as are pregnant women , people on income - related benefits and patients with certain conditions .
Public health minister Dawn Primarolo said : " For people who say , ' Make prescriptions free ' - which I think is a point that we do need to discuss - they also have to say , ' OK , what do n't we spend the £ 400 m on in the health service ? ' "
The minister said : " The remainder [ of paid - for prescription charges ] provides valuable income to the NHS , which goes towards the safety and speed of healthcare .
" But we are making the system fairer .
Cancer patients will be eligible for free prescriptions from 1 April and we 're looking at how we can do the same for people with long - term conditions . "
CASE STUDY Kelly Ridpath , 28 , from Lincoln has suffered from asthma since the age of three .
She pays charges for asthma inhalers , anti-histamine drugs , migraine tablets and a once - a - year adrenaline injection for her nut allergy .
Kelly estimates she pays between £ 20 and £ 25 a month on prescription charges .
" I have n't opted for the £ 95 annual prescription " season ticket " because each year I have told myself I wo n't need so many drugs , " she said .
Kelly said she can afford to pay the charges , but is aware there are many - including in her own family - who struggle to find the money .
" I think it is unfair that people in other parts of the UK - such as Wales - do n't pay any charges , " she said .
" The government says the charges help to finance the NHS - but I thought I already paid my taxes to do this anyway . "
But the BMA is worried about creating a " new set of arbitrary winners and losers . "
Chairman Dr Hamish Meldrum said : " Free prescriptions for people with long - term conditions is a laudable aim , but it does not go far enough .
" Making the list of exemptions longer will not make it fairer .
Ultimately , we could end up with a situation where only a tiny proportion of prescriptions attract a charge , which would be nonsensical .
" Abolishing prescription charges altogether is the fairest and the simplest option . "
The BMA said the current system was unfair , with people with asthma and heart disease , for example , not being exempt despite needing long - term treatment .
People whose incomes were low , but are just above the levels required to trigger exemptions , were also penalised , it said .
BMA spokesman Dr Richard Vautrey , who is also a GP , told the BBC that charges were so high , some of his patients were not able to get all the treatments that they needed .
He said : " It 's not unusual for patients to ask me which prescription is really important , which one can they get now and which one they have to wait maybe two weeks before they get their pay cheque . "
He said if all patients could get the treatments they needed via free prescriptions it may reduce hospital admissions and costs for the health service in the long run .
He added : " What I hope is that what is good for patients in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland is good for patients in England . "
The BMA says that scrapping all charges could improve care and benefit society , by reducing hospital admissions , helping patients to return to work more quickly following illness .

More from Today programme Asthma patient Sarah Harrison , from Telford in Shropshire , told the BBC she thought the current system was unfair .
But she said she understood that making an exemption for certain patients could cause problems for the NHS .
" I do appreciate ... that if asthmatics become exempt , other people are going to say ' Well , why are n't we and why are n't we ? '
And so it goes on further down the line . "
Katherine Murphy , director of the Patients Association , said English patients were " left navigating an increasingly contradictory system " .
She added : " We have long supported the abolition of prescription charges and welcome the BMA 's stance .
Patients are sick of healthcare lotteries . "
Ciaran Devane , chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support , said : " We were delighted the government listened to us and abolished prescription charges for cancer patients .
" It was absolutely the right thing to do and finally righted a wrong which stood for 40 years . "

According to a new study published in the recent Acta PÃƒ¦diatrica journal , American women might be wise to skip the baby making during spring and summer months .
The study , which analyzed the 30.1 million births in the United States between 1996 and 2002 , found that there was an increased number of babies with birth defects born to those women who conceived in April , May , June , and July .
But what ’s behind all this ?
Turns out this is the time of the year when there is also an increase in the levels of pesticides in the surface water across the United States .
These pesticides include atrazine ( which is banned in Europe but still used in the United States ) and nitrates , chemicals already suspected to be harmful to the developing embryo .
But this is the first time that a study has been able to link the increased seasonal concentration of pesticides in surface water to a similar increase in birth defects in newborns conceived in the same months .
This is an important finding , for as Dr Winchester , lead author , says -¦ if our suspicions are right and pesticides are contributing to birth defect risk , we can reverse or modify the factors that are causing these lifelong and often very serious medical problems . ”

Vermont Governor Jim Douglas is threatening to veto the marriage equality bill that has sailed through the senate by a 26 - 4 vote , and now goes on to the house for final approval .
He maintains that civil unions are equal and that Vermont needs to focus on the economy .
Yet , when asked if he would trade his marriage for a civil union , he swiftly replies that he would not .
What he also fails to realize is that gay marriage is a boost for the economy , and that going against the majority of the people and the legislature is unconstitutional .
Please urge everyone regardless of their home state , to call AND email the governor and tell him to retract his message and support marriage equality .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States believes Iran has stockpiled enough nuclear fuel to make a bomb , U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen said on Sunday .
“ We think they do , quite frankly , ” Mullen said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” program when asked whether Iran has enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon .
“ And Iran having nuclear weapons , I ’ve believed for a long time , is a very very bad outcome -- for the region and for the world , ” Mullen said .
A watchdog report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency two weeks ago said Iran had built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel , raising alarm among Western governments that Tehran might have understated by one third how much uranium it has enriched .
The United States suspects Iran of trying to use its nuclear program to build an atomic bomb , but Tehran insists it is purely for the peaceful generation of electricity .
Enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons .
U.S. President Barack Obama ’s administration , which favors diplomatic engagement with Tehran to defuse the dispute over its nuclear intentions , called Iran ’s nuclear program an “ urgent problem ” the international community must address .
The IAEA report showed a significant increase in Iran ’s reported stockpile of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) since November to 1,010 kg -- enough , some physicists say , for possible conversion into high - enriched uranium for one bomb .
The IAEA later said Iran was cooperating well with U.N. nuclear inspectors to help ensure it does not again understate the amount of uranium it has enriched , suggesting the uranium accounting shortfall might not have been deliberate evasion .
Chimpanzees have long been suspected of planning ahead A male chimpanzee in a Swedish zoo planned hundreds of stone - throwing attacks on zoo visitors , according to researchers .
Keepers at Furuvik Zoo found that the chimp collected and stored stones that he would later use as missiles .
Further , the chimp learned to recognise how and when parts of his concrete enclosure could be pulled apart to fashion further projectiles .
The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology .
There has been scant evidence in previous research that animals can plan for future events .
Crucial to the current study is the fact that Santino , a chimpanzee at the zoo in the city north of Stockholm , collected the stones in a calm state , prior to the zoo opening in the morning .
The launching of the stones occurred hours later - during dominance displays to zoo visitors - with Santino in an " agitated " state .
This suggests that Santino was anticipating a future mental state - an ability that has been difficult to definitively prove in animals , according to Mathias Osvath , a cognitive scientist from Lund University in Sweden and author of the new research .
" We 've done experimental studies , and the chimps in my mind show very clearly that they do plan for future needs , but it has been argued that perhaps this was an experimental artefact , " Dr Osvath told BBC News .

More from Today programme Chimp attacks :
Your emails " Now we have this spontaneous behaviour , which is always in some sense better evidence . "
Cracking show Dr Osvath embarked on the study after zoo staff discovered caches of stones in the section of the enclosure facing the public viewing area .
Since the initial discovery in 1997 , hundreds of the caches have been removed to protect visitors , to whom the caching and the aggressive displays seem strictly related ; in the off season , Santino neither hoards the projectiles nor hurls them .
Most interestingly , Santino seems to have learned how to spot weak parts of the concrete " boulders " in the centre of the enclosure .
When water seeps into cracks in the concrete and freezes , portions become detached that make a hollow sound when tapped .
Santino was observed gently knocking on the " boulders " , hitting harder to detach bits that were loosened and adding those to his stashes of ammunition .
The chimp stashed hundreds of stones in anticipation of throwing them
There are a number of examples of complex behaviour in apes that suggest forms of consciousness .
Planning behaviour like that of the current work is connected to so - called autonoetic consciousness , where information due to memory can be distinguished from that from the senses .
" I 'm personally convinced that at least chimps do plan for future needs , that they do have this autonoetic consciousness , " Dr Osvath said .
" I hope that other zoos or those in the wild will look more closely at what is happening , " he added .
" I bet there must be a lot of these kinds of behaviours out there , and I would n't be surprised if we find them in dolphins or other species . "

When last we left America 's drone war over Pakistan , the local government seemed resigned to idea of the United Sstates launching its unmanned air force from Pakistani soil , on targets within Pakistan , without Islamabad 's permission .
All the ministers asked was that America respect their " red line " – and keep U.S. ground forces out of their country .
But the red line may have suddenly shifted , from human troops to robots in the sky .
In a meeting yesterday with U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Michael Mullen , top Pakistani officials allegedly demanded that America stop the unmanned attacks and " shift the drone technology and authority to the Pakistan Army , " according to Pakistan 's *
Dawn * newspaper .
" We did talk about drones and let me be very frank , there is a gap , " Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi tells Reuters .
Pakistani leaders have huffed about the drones in public before – only to cooperate in secret with the robotic aircraft strikes .
But these requests are a bit different .
Rather than demand the drones stop flying , the leaders are asking for control of the aircraft .
" We would much prefer that the U.S. share its intelligence and give us the weapons , drones and missiles that will allow us to take care of this problem on our own , " Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari tells the Independent .
" These drone attacks are counter - productive . "
Meanwhile , the attacks continue .
An unmanned aircraft fired a pair of missiles today into a vehicle in the town of Gangi Khel .
Four suspected militants were killed .
"
It 's the third such strike this month and the fourteenth inside Pakistan in 2009 , according to the Long War Journal .
Gangi Khel is thought to be under the control of Pakistani Taliban leader Maulvi Nazir .
In an interview earlier this week with al - Qaeda 's propaganda wing , Nazir practically begged the Americans to come after him – declaring his intents to wage terror worldwide , and calling President Barack Obama a " black ass . "
A week earlier , Nazir 's ally Baitullah Mehsud threatened to " launch an attack in Washington . "
Which , of course , makes the idea of America giving up her killer drones all the more remote .

By now at least 30 million people worldwide ( roughly the same number who view the Oscars , or the Super Bowl ) have watched an extraordinary clip from a popular UK show called “ Britain ’s Got Talent . ”
A dowdy , 47 - year - old virgin named Susan Boyle takes the stage , wearing her low heels and her Sunday best .
The crowd laughs at her , and Boyle – how devastating – laughs along .
She says she wants to be a professional singer ; people laugh harder and louder .
They point .
It ’s grammar school and the Roman coliseum combined .
Simon Cowell – panelist and show creator – rolls his eyes .
And then Susan Boyle sings .
In the past five days , Susan Boyle has been invited to appear on Oprah , interviewed on all three network morning shows and covered by news outlets all over the world – many of which have descended on her hamlet , where she lives alone with her cat , Pebbles .
She is the favorite to win the competition and it ’s likely she ’ll sing for the Queen .
Cowell will probably sign her to his record label .
But there is something disturbing about the collective rejection - embrace - elevation of Susan Boyle .
There is the element of self - congratulation in the viral spread of this link around the Web , the idea that we , the secondary viewers , the judges of those who are judging , are far more evolved .
There is the clip itself , suspiciously ready - made for online consumption : A 7 - minute movie , slick and pithy in its perfect execution of the underdog narrative .
( That something like “ Rocky ” took two hours to tell now seems antediluvian . )
There is the classic David vs. Goliath subplot , the primal satisfaction of seeing the bully ( Cowell ) slain by such a seemingly inferior force .
And there is the profound desire for this entire thing to be authentic , which in and of itself suggests that it probably is n’t .
Not since P.T. Barnum has there been a show business master of the trompe l’oeil like Simon Cowell .
This is n’t to suggest that Boyle herself is a hoax ( though she does seem a bit too comfortable on that stage , parrying with Cowell , to be a complete naif ) .
But the notion that Cowell was unaware of Boyle ’s existence , let alone discordant looks and talent level , before she ever took the stage , is flatly ridiculous .
And the song Boyle chose – if she , in fact , chose it – so seamlessly provides the meta - narrative that it ’s easy to miss how calculated it is .
From “ Les Misérables ” ( “ the miserable , ” the way we are meant to perceive Boyle ) , she sings “ I Dreamed a Dream . ”
Boyle opens on the second stanza : “ I dreamed a dream in time gone by / When hope was high / And life worth living . ”
In “ Les Misérables , ” it ’s sung by a lonely , unemployed character on the fringes – just like Boyle , who sang with the undignified descriptor “ unemployed , 47 ” slung across the bottom of the screen .

In a week that saw a good chunk of the nation losing its mind for days over the presidential puppy ( just how bad are things ? ) , it seems cynical , churlish even , to speculate about the machinations behind this phenomenon .
But it remains true that this clip , and Boyle ’s rendition , would not be so compelling without the contradictions : the beautiful voice possessed by this defiantly unglamorous woman , who can somehow fully inhabit and interpret a love song without ever having been in love .
Most disturbing of all , perhaps , is that not since Saturday has Susan Boyle been Susan Boyle .
It ’s a permutation of the Heisenberg principle :
That 30 million people have heard her , seen her , embraced her has already changed who she is .
The shy churchgoer who said that her recently deceased mother encouraged her to “ take the risk , ” who admitted in her audition that she has never been kissed , who has forever lived as something of an accidental outcast – she now seems too much of this world .
“ I ’ve been for a meeting with Sony BMG , but I ca n’t say much about it , ” she said this week .
“ It ’s early days . ” Susan Boyle is now one of us .
And that is really a shame .
From The Ed Show April 21 , 2009 .
Pat Leahy responds to Dick Cheney 's remarks and says if he feels so strongly about what he said , let him appear before his committee under oath and answer some questions .
John Amato :
Sen .
Pat Leahy also wants a special prosecutor and a bipartisan commission to investigate the torture issue we 've been presented with .
He then took a very strong position against Jay Bybee and said that he should do the honorable thing and resign from the bench .
Leahy :
If the Bush / Cheney administration told the truth about him , and he told the truth about what he did , he never would have been confirmed by the Senate .
He never would have become a judge .
I think the only decent and honorable thing for him to do now that these facts have come out is to resign .
Resign for the good of the Judiciary .
What he 's done is a total blot on the and it reflects on him and the rest of the Judiciary and he should do the decent and honorable thing and step down .
The liberal blogosphere has been calling for him to be impeached , but if he was a true patriot he would step down and not bring a scandal to the bench .
However , if a man can write a memo like that , then I highly doubt that is a realistic option .
I think Judge Bybee should read Digby 's intense post called Torturers In Common , so he can take a hard look at what he has done .
When I moved down to Vancouver to go to Horticulture school I had only ever seen one type of Clematis which grew in the Prince George area .
It is the rare Western Blue Clematis ( Clematis occidentalis ) which is not at all vigorous or showy having small blue bells which are lost in the dense forest edges .
Down in the warm Vancouver area there of course are many types with large flowers that can bloom from early spring into late summer .
I was surprised that on my list of plants to learn was an evergreen species which naturally is Clematis Armandii commonly known as the Evergreen Clematis or more appropriately ( I think ) Armand ’s Clematis .
Clematis armandii is very common in this area , I have found it in countless yards and municipal sites used in a variety of ways .
Many broadleaved evergreens here took a real beating with this winters unusual cold which included a prolonged damaging dry northern wind .
The Armand Clematis ( zone 8 - 10 ) that I have come across have not been touched .
Armand ’s Clematis originates in almost the same area as Rhododendron strillgilosum , the plant I featured last week .
It ’s range is from south Yunnan , traveling west Guizhou and north into Hubie and Sichuan China .
It is seen growing in the scrub , along riverbanks and up through trees where it blooms in April and May .
Although it is named in honor of the French missionary Per’e David - Jean Pierre Armand David ( 1826-1900 ) the plant was introduced into cultivation by Ernest ‘ Chinese ’ Wilson around 1900 .
It was an immediate hit and earned a FCC ( First Class Certificate ) in 1914 from the Royal Horticulture Society .
Clematis armandii is a plant which is especially attractive in the spring ,
It ’s fresh new growth is tinged with wine tones and the leaves are glossy and crisp in the sun .
The flower buds are an delicate cream which burst forth into an incredible show .
Often on a sunny spring day these plants are absolutely covered in flowers and the bees are happily buzzing about harvesting the honey .
All Clematis have gained an undeserved reputation for being difficult plants to grow and this is not true at all .
They do need to be properly sited and have enough water during their growing season .
They need both sun and shade ; at least 6 hours of full sun per day to grow their best and a cool shaded location to sink their roots in .
A large hole 2 ft ( 60 cm ) deep by 3 ft ( 1 m ) across to be filled with lots of compost and organic material will get your plant of to an extremely fine start .
If happy Clematis armandii will grow to be large vines up to 20 ft ( 5 m ) in spread and height .
Staking to a strong trellis or other form of support is a must as these are extremely vigorous and eventually heavy plants do to their think leaves and dense growth .
It is advisable to give Clematis armandii an annual mulching of well rotted manure or compost each spring .
If they get to big or need to be restrained they can be pruned after blooming .
They do not like having wet roots in the winter it it might rot off , this caused by a fungi which attacks Clematis .
Signs of this are seen in wilting of the new growth .
Unfortunately there is no known cure for this .
Carefully discard the plant in the garbage and do not replant with another clematis in the same site if this happens .

Cowardice in the Time of Torture I used to take a certain pride by association with prominent Bronxites who have “ made it . ”
Cancel that for Attorney General Eric Holder and former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
Email
Printer friendly
You might think that as African - Americans , they would be especially outraged by torture , given what blacks have suffered at the hands of white torturers in this country and abroad .
Why is it that they seem to value more their admittance into a privileged white - dominated ruling class than doing the right thing ?
How else to explain their stunning reluctance to hold torturers accountable and thus remove the stain of torture from our nation ’s soul and reputation ?
One might say that Attorney General Holder is proving himself to be part of that “ nation of cowards ” that he called the United States in a different context , i.e. our unwillingness to address the issue of race .
What about when the victims of torture are Muslims ?
Where ’s Holder ’s courage then ?
Surely , I was not the only one stunned by former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s public admission that he helped authorize waterboarding of detainees .
But , on reflection , there seems to have been a method to his madness ; and , so far at least , the method seems to be working .
Have Holder and Colin Powell forgotten from their days growing up in the Bronx the typical reaction of bullies when caught in the act ?
“ Okay , so waddaya gonna do ‘ bout it ! ”
It was an attempt at intimidation , and it was generally effective with those who felt not quite up to the challenge .
Looks very much as if Cheney sized up Holder correctly .
During his confirmation hearings , Holder manfully agreed with Sen. Patrick Leahy that waterboarding , which subjects a person to the panicked gag reflex of drowning , is torture .
But Holder has been out to lunch since then , no doubt leaving Cheney and his torture - friendly friends smirking at having been correct in taking the measure of the new Attorney General .
Call it chutzpah , intimidation , bullying — whatever ; it does seem to be working .
Cheney endorsing waterboarding ;
Holder labeling it torture ; and — Hello ?
Anyone home ?
Deafening silence .
Never mind that Holder , like President Barack Obama , took a solemn oath to faithfully execute the laws of the land .
Why are they still afraid of Dick Cheney , whom even the neo-con editors of the Washington Post in 2005 branded “ Vice President for Torture ? ”
Ain’t Misbehavin ’
Holder seems to be taking his cue from the pitiable Colin Powell , now traversing the country giving lucrative speeches on leadership .
Powell knew he was welcome into the club , or in this case the White House , only as long as he toed the line and was willing to offer up what was left of his reputation to the Bush / Cheney war effort .
True , in one brief spurt of behind - the - scenes assertiveness , Powell insisted that arch - prevaricator ( and former CIA director ) George Tenet sit behind him during Powell ’s unforgettable / unforgivable speech at the UN on Feb.
5 , 2003 .
Could he have been so unaware as to think this might somehow shame the shameless Tenet into coming clean with the intelligence ?
No way ; and he knew it .
Powell had already confided to then - British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that the case against Iraq was what in the Bronx we call a “ crock . ” I know Powell .
In the early 1980s , when he wore but one star as military assistant to the Secretary of Defense – and I was a CIA intelligence briefer – I used to do him the courtesy of pre-briefing him , to the extent I could , on what I was about to discuss during my early - morning one - on - ones with his boss , Casper Weinberger .
I found Powell to be anything but naïve .
He and I had a good bit in common — growing up at about the same time a mile from each other in the Bronx , “ Distinguished Military Graduates ” commissioned via Army R.O.T.C. — he from City College in 1958 , I from Fordham in 1961 .
Initially , I was blissfully unaware of the many times he had compromised himself — in doing Weinberger ’s bidding on Iran - Contra , for example .
And so in 1989 , I took a certain pride by association when Powell made it to the very top as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
That pride dissipated quickly as I watched Powell bend to those who were bent on launching a war of aggression on Iraq .
Republican elder statesman James Baker , who was secretary of state under George H.W. Bush , has referred to Powell as the one person who could have stopped that war .
Baker is right .
Caving on Torture More to the point , Colin Powell betrayed the U.S. Army and the nation on the issue of torture .
When he got a whiff of the tortured reasoning for torture – being urged on the President by the likes of Alberto Gonzales and David Addington to somehow make torture “ legal ” – Powell took the coward ’s way out .
He had his lawyer get in touch with the Mafia - type lawyers in the White House to ask them please , could they please ask the President to reconsider his decision to exempt al - Qaeda and the Taliban from the protections of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War .
Powell ’s gentle demurral appears in a MEMORANUM FOR THE PRESIDENT , dated Jan. 25 , 2002 , drafted by Addington but signed by Gonzales .
They included Powell ’s argument in a paragraph at the bottom of a list of “ negative ” consequences of ignoring Geneva : “ A determination that Geneva does not apply to al Qaeda and the Taliban could undermine U.S. military culture which emphasizes maintaining the highest standards of conduct in combat , and could introduce an element of uncertainty in the status of adversaries . ”
Powell got that right .
Too bad he did not have the courage of his convictions .
Too bad he lacked the guts to confront the President directly .
Too bad , for he is perhaps the one person who could have stopped the torture and the debasement of the Army to which he owed so much .
Rather than put into play the wide respect he still enjoyed , in order to stop a war he knew to be illegal , Powell decided to trade in that respect for the equivalent of 30 pieces of silver .
As the Executive Summary of the Senate Armed Services Committee report on torture , released on Dec. 12 , 2008 , indicates , President Bush threw in his lot with the early opinions of Addington and Gonzales .
( What most folks do n’t realize is that this was long before everyone ’s favorite bête noire John Yoo and associates served up their ex post facto “ justifications . ” )
Incorporating Addington ’s language , the President signed an executive order on Feb. 7 that , in the words of the Senate committee , “ opened the door ” to torture .
Powell not only acquiesced in this but also allowed himself to be sucked into a series of discussions in the White House Situation Room regarding which torture techniques might be most appropriate to apply to which “ high - value ” detainee .
Those are the sessions that then - Attorney General John Ashcroft referred to in commenting , “ history will not be kind ” to us .
What brings this painful flashback to mind is Rachel Maddow ’s interview with Colin Powell on April 2 .
Not surprisingly , he danced around her questions about the White House seminars on torture .
Most telling of all , however , Powell could not bring himself to admit , even now , that waterboarding is torture .
Doubling Down On April 3 , former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , the fabulous fabricator of the fabled Saddam - al - Qaeda connection , upped the ante in the “ so - wattaya - gonna - do - ‘ bout - it ” challenge , and held up to ridicule the timidity of Holder and the President .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Feith pretended to be shocked at the temerity of a Spanish court that seems to be on the verge of bringing criminal charges against Feith , Gonzales , Addington , John Yoo , and two other lawyers who served up the desired opinions on how the White House could make an end - run around domestic and international law and approve the systematic torture of detainees .
Disregarding the provisions of international law that clearly do apply , Feith makes liberal use of reductio ad absurdum to “ prove ” that Spain has no jurisdiction to put Americans on trial for torture .
More important , Feith is so cocksure of himself that he throws down the gauntlet at the feet of the new administration : “ If President Barack Obama and the prosecutors see a crime to be prosecuted , they can act . ”
What , I wonder , gives Feith such confidence that he will not one day rue having said that ?
Has it been his watching of a long line of timid officials – both Republicans and Democrats – who lack the courage of their convictions ?
Clearly , the Cheneys and Feiths of this world are betting on Obama being cut of the same cloth .
The President will prove them right if it turns out that his oft - repeated “ No one is above the law ” proves to be just rhetoric .
And it will remain just rhetoric , if Obama delays much longer in ordering the reluctant Holder to appoint a nonpartisan , independent special prosecutor to bring the torturers to justice and end this shameful chapter in American history once and for all .

An accused killer who stabbed the judge during his murder trial in Stockton used a 6 - inch metal shank that he hid from his jailers even though they were warned he had a weapon , investigators said Thursday .
Murder suspect David Paradiso , who was on the witness stand Wednesday , was able to slip behind Superior Court Judge Cinda Fox and stab her as bailiffs were distracted by a courtroom outburst from his mother and brother , said San Joaquin County Sheriff ’s Det.
Dave Konecny .
Paradiso , 29 , was killed by the lead investigator in his murder case , Lodi Police Det.
Eric Bradley , who quickly approached the judge ’s bench and shot the defendant in the head and shoulder at point - blank range .
“ He saved the judge ’s life , ” said defense attorney Chuck Pacheco , who also rushed to the judge ’s aid .
“ It was necessary .
Otherwise , the judge would have been killed .
He was hellbent on killing her . ”

Pacheco said his client was attempting to cut Fox ’s neck in the same manner that he had killed his first victim , Eileen Pelt , 20 .
The judge was treated for her injuries and released .
Pacheco had argued in court that Paradiso suffered serious mental disorders from prolonged methamphetamine use .
The defense did not contest that Paradiso killed Pelt , his girlfriend , in 2006 .
Paradiso faced the death penalty for cutting
Pelt ’s throat in the back seat while his mother , Debra , was driving .
Paradiso was also accused of kidnapping his mother and forcing her to drive to neighboring Amador County , where he dumped Pelt ’s body .
The Sheriff ’s Department said that an unnamed female family member called the San Joaquin County Jail on Feb. 17 and reported that Paradiso had a weapon made from a broken hair clipper blade .
Two searches a week apart failed to find a weapon .

“ It is currently under investigation where and how the suspect received the weapon which was found in the suspect ’s hand , ” Konecny said in a statement issued to the media .
Pacheco said he suspects that Paradiso was able to smuggle the weapon into court by hiding it in a security leg brace he wore under his pants .
The brace is designed to lock if the defendant tries to run but has metal parts that may have masked the weapon when he went through a metal detector .
“ I was always concerned that he was capable of an attack like that if he did n’t get his way , ” said Pacheco , noting that at one point Paradiso tried to fire him .
“ I figured I would be the object of it . ”
Shortly after taking the stand Wednesday afternoon , Paradiso said Pelt deserved to die because she had not performed a sex act well , which prompted the outburst from his relatives .
As a bailiff tried to handle the disturbance , Paradiso stood up , produced the shank and lunged at the judge , who was only four feet away .

“ The judge was nothing but sweet to him , ” Pacheco said .
“ There was absolutely no reason for him to go after the judge . ”

I have been sitting on this post for a while now , because that was my first impression after seeing Oslo & M and all the hype around it from the PDC .
To be frank , I had a hard time believing my own gut feeling .
I kept having the feeling that I am missing something , which is why I avoided talking about this so far .
But , as time passed , and as we started to see more and more about Oslo and M , it validated my initial thinking .
Now , just to be clear , I do n’t intend to even touch on the whole of Oslo in this post .
I do n’t have a problem stating that I still do n’t see the whole point there , but that is beside the point ( no pun intended ) .
What I would like to talk about is the M language , its usage , and the DSL that Microsoft shows as samples .
I see M as a whole lot of effort trying to optimize something that is really not that interesting , complex or really very hard .
I look at the M language , the way that you worked with , the tooling and the API and I would fully agree that it is a nice parser generator .
What it is not , I have to say , is a DSL toolkit .
It is just one , small , part of building a DSL .
And , to be perfectly honest , M is the drag & drop of DSL .
It looks good , on first glance , but then you dig just a little deeper and you see what actually going on , and you realize that you are probably not where you wanted to be .
I see it as trying very hard to optimize opening the car ’s door .
While I assume that this is interesting to someone in the world , optimizing the opening of a car door is crucial , I do n’t really see it as an important feature .
More to the point , it has negligible effect on the time taken for the primary task for which we use a car , the actual driving !
Why am I saying that ?
Well , M is used for defining the syntax of the language , which is what most people look at .
It does a good job there , but it also stops there .
And there is a lot of stuff other then the syntax that you really care about .
Here is a snippet from MisBehave , which was an attempt to build a BDD framework on top of M :
Pretty impressive syntax , right ?
The problem is that there is n’t really a good way to take this and translate that into something that is executable .
Not without doing a lot of work .
And that is why I am saying that M is n’t really an important piece of the stack .
The actual syntax definition is n’t really that important .
It is all the other things that you do with the DSL that matters .
Let us take a look at MUrl :
I am looking at this , and after looking at the source code , I still ca n’t figure out the point .
Yes , this is a demo DSL .
But it is a good example that shows how you can completely miss the point with regards to a DSL .
What problem does this DSL solve ?
What benefits do I get from integrating that into my system ?
How does this helps me solve a real problem ?
The answer is that it does n’t .
The only remotely useful case that I can think of is if I really want to be able to issue REST calls from the command line , and even then , there are better ways of doing that on the command line .
MUrl is an exercise in abstraction for the sake of abstraction .
More than that , it gives the impression that it is something that is is not .
If you want to show me a DSL , show me one that has logic , not one that is a glorified serialization format .
That is the sweet spot for a DSL , to extract policy decisions from your systems , so you can work with them at a higher level and have easier time making change .
M is not a language for creating DSL .
It is a language to define a serialization format , that is all .
( CNN ) --
A new poll shows that two - thirds of Americans surveyed think the U.S. should lift its travel ban on Cuba , and three - quarters think the U.S. should end its five - decade estrangement with the country .
Fidel Castro led Cuba 's communist revolution in 1959 and recently handed over power to his brother Raul .
According to the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted April 3 to 5 , 64 percent of the 1,023 Americans surveyed by telephone thought the U.S. government should allow citizens to travel to Cuba .
And 71 percent of those polled said that the U.S. should reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba , while 27 percent opposed such a move .
Both questions had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The Obama administration has signaled that new rules on family travel and remittances to Cuba may be announced before President Obama goes to the Summit of the Americas on April 17 .
A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47 - year - old travel ban to Cuba .
" I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue , " said Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - North Dakota , one of the bill 's sponsors .
Sen . Richard Lugar , R - Indiana , another sponsor of the bill , issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions .
Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .

" Republicans as well as Democrats favor reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba , " CNN polling director Keating Holland said .
" On the issue of lifting travel restrictions , Republicans are evenly divided , while independents and Democrats support the change . "
A delegation from the Congressional Black Caucus traveled to Cuba earlier this week to find out if Cuba was interested in resuming relations with the U.S. , said Rep. Barbara Lee , D - California , a member of the delegation .
" We have to remember that every country in Latin America , 15 countries , have normal relations with Cuba , " Lee said .
" We 're the country which is isolated . "
Watch Lee discuss her visit to Cuba »
Lee said that Cuba has no preconditions on resuming relations .
The trip prompted a pair of Republican congressmen to rip the Black Caucus members for ignoring Cuba 's " myriad gross human rights abuses , " saying the trip to the island nation ignored the plight of political prisoners under the Castro regime .
Reps .
Chris Smith of New Jersey and Frank Wolf of Virginia also urged the Obama administration to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all " prisoners of conscience , " shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech , and holds " free and fair " elections .
Cuban - American members of Congress , regardless of party affiliation , have voiced outrage over the easing of relations .
Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez , who was born in Cuba , does n't want to see changes to the embargo .
" Having tourists on Cuban beaches is not going to achieve democratic change in Cuba , " Martinez has said .
New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez , a Democrat and Cuban - American , said in a recent speech that the Cuban government is " pure and simple a brutal dictatorship .
...
The average Cuban lives on an income of less than a dollar a day . "
Obama has said he is in favor of changing the relationship with Cuba .
The $ 410 billion budget Obama signed in March makes it easier for Cuban - Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island .
It could also allow the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba .
Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by former President Bush after he came to office in 2001 .
U.S. citizens are allowed to visit Cuba , but must apply for special licenses to do so .
Though it is illegal , some citizens travel to a third country like Mexico or Canada and then into Cuba .
Fidel Castro led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Cuba 's Batista dictatorship .
The United States broke diplomatic ties with the nation in 1961 .
The next year , the U.S. government instituted a trade embargo .
Both policies remain in effect .

There ’s a workshop taking place tomorrow night not far from where I live .
The subject : How to respond to “ Homosexual Activism ” in our public schools .
That is tempting .
It ’s free and walk - ins are welcome , so I have an urge to drop by .
I ’ve never been to one of those kinds of meetings , so I ’m curious what ’s said and what the people there actually think .
I ’ve heard soundbytes in the media and I ’ve read secondhand about what conservative Christians have to say on the subject , but I ’ll admit I do n’t know very many people who are this rabidly anti-gay - rights .
So this sounds like something I want to check out .
The bigger question is how I should act when I ’m there .
Should I :
stay silent and just be observant ?
( This would allow me to assess the situation and take in everything that ’s going on . )
be somewhat vocal and try to politely rebut things that are said ?
befriend everybody , win their trust , and slowly work my magic in an attempt to eventually take over the group .
( Hilarity will ensue . )
pretend like I do n’t know anything about the subject , ask people what this “ homosexual activism ” is all about , and record their responses ?
start debates with people over the absurdities of their arguments ?
The last option does n’t appeal to me very much .
The second option is more enticing , though not nearly as interesting .
Maybe I left out a good option .
What would you do ?
Is there anything you ’re really curious to find out about that I might be able to help with when I go there ?
In a OneNewsNow article titled ( I shit you not ) “ Intelligent Design for Dummies , ” Marcia Segelstein explains everything you need to know about ID - proponents in one paragraph :
Science was never my forte , and heated debates over Darwinism , evolution , creationism and Intelligent Design never piqued my interest .
As far as I was concerned , all that mattered was my belief that God created the universe and everything in it .
How

BOSTON  Maybe it really was just the American League East ’s bad dream .
Maybe last season ’s surreal ascent of the Tampa Bay Rays from laughingstock to division champions  culminating in the Rays beating the Red Sox for a berth in the World Series  was , indeed , too bizarre to have actually occurred .
On Tuesday , the cosmos did seem realigned at Fenway Park , where the Red Sox dismissed the Rays , 5 - 3 , to land the first solid jab in the division .
The Boston ace Josh Beckett struck out 10 through seven breezy innings in his first opening - day start for the Red Sox .
His bullpen gave up two runs in the eighth to narrow the score , but Beckett was as dominant as the Red Sox expect him , and themselves , to be all season .
“ We ’ve got a long way to go , but watching the way he ’s throwing is big , ” Manager Terry Francona said of Beckett , whose command of his fastball and curveball were in virtually midseason form .
“ We want to lean on him . ”
Tampa
Bay struck out 14 total times  Carlos Peña in each of four at - bats  and managed only three hits .
The Red Sox ’ lineup proved as balanced as the Rays ’ was feeble , with Dustin Pedroia ( first inning ) and Jason Varitek ( fifth ) hitting solo home runs , and Jason Bay and Mike Lowell each adding run-scoring hits in a three - run third .
All the runs came off James Shields , who appeared simply overmatched despite his talent .

Thug life , bitches .
For years , the men said nothing at all .
One day they went into an office to cast a vote by secret ballot that changed their lives , and the next day they moved on into a future clouded with doubt .
A few days later , a defiant Adolf Hitler pushed German troops into the Rhineland , and there were more pressing concerns than a basketball team and a sacrifice that seemed minuscule in comparison to the storm raging in Europe .
Seventy - three years later , each of the men who cast a ballot is gone , and the New York City they grew up in has been paved over and rebuilt and then paved over again .
Even the basic truths that form the core of this story seem impossibly removed from the modern day : Imagine a tiny college in Brooklyn forming the best basketball team in America , its roster composed of the sons and grandsons of Jewish and Italian immigrants , its coach a man who eventually would write a series of wildly popular children 's sports books .

Here they are , members of the LIU team that turned down a tryout for the Olympics .
The coach 's name was Clair Bee , and his was a remarkable American life -- he was said to have invented the 1 - 3 - 1 defense and the 24 - second shot clock .
He coached some of the greatest teams in college basketball history and later got caught up ( unwittingly , most believe ) in the gambling scandals of the early 1950s that changed the face of college basketball .
His stories about Chip Hilton , an All - American boy and an All - American athlete , were among the most beloved books of a certain generation of schoolchildren -- including a young man from Orrville , Ohio , named Bob Knight , who found in Bee a friend and a coaching mentor .
And yet this part of Bee 's remarkable biography , the secret ballot of 1936 , has remained largely hidden from view .
Not long ago , Mike Farley --
Bee 's grandson and the family 's unofficial historian -- called up Knight and asked him :
What did he know about Bee 's Long Island University basketball team 's boycott of the 1936 Olympic trials ?
What did he know about the vote the players had taken , about the decision they had made -- that if one team member chose not to participate , they all would refuse to participate , and that if they had chosen to participate they almost certainly would have won the first Olympic gold medal in men's basketball in Hitler 's Berlin ?
There was a long pause .
And then Knight , bewildered , said , " Michael , I did n't know anything about your grandfather and the Olympic trials . "
There is an undercurrent of silence in this story , and the odd thing is , no one who remains alive can explain why these men felt the need to stay quiet for so long .
In retrospect , what they did was unquestionably courageous .
We can see that now .
But maybe you had to be there to understand how complex this vote actually was , to understand the implications and the repercussions and its effect on their lives .
One sports columnist declared LIU 's decision would cause " ill feelings " and was " the wrong answer from a sports angle . "
This was five years before Pearl Harbor .
The questions being asked were entirely different -- there was an overarching sense , as there often is , that sports and politics should remain separate .
Maybe , to some , it felt like a missed opportunity :
Here were eight men who had gone 25 - 0 during the 1935 - 36 season , who had won 33 games in a row by an average margin of 23 points , who had been referred to by at least one opposing coach as " the greatest team in the country " despite the fact that they shared a cramped gym with the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy .
All they had to do was show up at the Olympic trials , and they almost certainly would have prevailed .
( Given the formula of the day for choosing the Olympic team , Farley says , the likelihood was that every member of that LIU team would have had a place on the squad . )
And so maybe there was a lingering bitterness about what happened in Berlin when a group of players clearly inferior to LIU won Olympic gold in Hitler 's Germany .
Or maybe it was simply too difficult to talk about the war at all .
For Melissa Merson 's father , Leo , this had always been the case .
Basketball , he could speak of all day long -- he later built his children a lighted court in their backyard , and both of his sons would go on to play college ball .
He would share stories about his time at LIU , and he would speak of Coach Bee and the years he spent as a player and coach in the American Basketball League .
And then one day in 1995 , with her father confined to a wheelchair , Melissa Merson took him to the Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C. , and there was an exhibit about the 1936 Olympics , about the heroism of Jesse Owens , and Leo Merson began telling this story he'd never told before .
" I was supposed to go to the Olympics , " he said .
There were so many stars on that team -- Julie Bender , the leading scorer , and Ben Kramer , the captain , each played several seasons in the ABL .
Marius Russo went on to pitch for the Yankees in the World Series , and Ken Norton would later spend 22 years as the basketball coach at Manhattan College .
Harry Grant became an expert bowler .
Arthur Hillhouse , at 6 - foot - 6 , was a dominant presence at the pivot , and Bill Schwartz , a senior , had already helped elevate the LIU program into the upper echelon .
They were not all Jewish , of course , but several were , including Merson .
He lived in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn .
His father owned a grocery store and had rushed out one afternoon to return some change to a patron when he was killed by a careening taxicab .
After that , Leo lived with his mother , and in 1936 , in a Jewish neighborhood , the pressure to do something about Hitler was all - consuming .
His grandfather would come home from synagogue and plead with him not to go to Germany .
His mother , working at the grocery store , would come home and tell him that the customers were speculating about what LIU would do , about whether it would set an example .

The story of these players ' secret vote is finally out .
And so , in early March , with their season almost complete , the players held the vote in Bee 's office .
They had already agreed : A single no meant a unanimous no .
And so it is impossible to know the final tally , or to know how much Bee influenced their decision , though the coach was known to wield a strong hand , and to advocate for the less fortunate .
( He had , in fact , been orphaned as a teenager . )
All that can be said for certain is that the men came out of that room in unanimity .
They were not the only team to drop out of the trials ; at least three other schools declined as well , blaming exhaustion and academic concerns .
But none of the others cited the political climate as the basis for its decision .
None of the others even alluded to Hitler and his persecution of the Jews .
Only Long Island University did , in a sweeping statement by the university 's president , Tristram Walker Metcalfe : " Our conviction that the United States should not participate in the Olympic Games since they are being held in Germany has not been altered by the fact that our basketball team is now recognized generally as a possible Olympic representative .
Such participation would be indirect , if not direct , contribution of the raising of funds to finance such participation . "
And that was the end of it .
Until Leo Merson told his daughter about it 60 years later .
Until she informed the United States Olympic Committee , and until word slowly began to spread among the sons and the daughters of the men in that room .
In 2001 , a few months after Leo 's death , Melissa Merson ran with the Olympic torch in his honor .
They 've since been honored by LIU , and on April 26 they 'll be inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Commack , N.Y .
Still , the vote and its repercussions have remained shrouded in secrecy .
When a reporter from a Jewish newspaper called Russo 's daughter in the fall to inform her of her grandfather and the boycott , she had no idea .
" How could you have any kind of a selfish feeling after such an unselfish act ? " said Farley , Bee 's grandson .
" How in the world did no one know about it ? "
What compelled so many men to remain silent for so long , we will never know .
All that remains now are old newspaper clippings , and grainy photographs , and our own attempts to grasp at what it means for a group of athletes to vote their conscience .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Reviving a ban on assault weapons and more strictly enforcing existing gun laws could help tamp down drug violence that has run rampant on the U.S. - Mexican border , President Obama said Thursday .
" We can respect and honor the Second Amendment while dealing with assault weapons , " Obama says in Mexico .
Speaking alongside Mexican President Felipe Calderón , Obama said he has " not backed off at all " on a campaign pledge to try to restore the ban .
It was instituted under President Clinton and allowed to lapse by President George W. Bush .
" I continue to believe that we can respect and honor the Second Amendment right in our Constitution -- the rights of sportsmen and hunters and homeowners that want to keep their families safe -- to lawfully bear arms , while dealing with assault weapons that , as we know here in Mexico , are used to fuel violence , " Obama said .
Obama and Calderón spoke after completing a wide - ranging meeting that included talk of the deadly border situation .
Calderón said that the link between Mexican drug violence and the U.S. ban on 19 types of military - style semi-automatic rifles -- which lapsed in 2004 -- is clear .
" From the moment the the prohibition on the sale of assault weapons was lifted a few years ago , we have seen an increase in the power of organized crime in Mexico , " Calderón said .
He said that more than 16,000 assault weapons have been seized in the crackdown on drug traffickers , with almost 9 in 10 coming from the United States .
Some observers have said Obama may be slow to reintroduce the ban in Congress , where it would be sure to spark a fight at a time when his administration needs all the political clout it can muster to push its aggressive economic recovery efforts .
Calderón acknowledged the debate 's thorny nature .
" We know that it is a politically delicate topic because Americans truly appreciate their Constitutional rights , " he said .
" As long as we are able to express clearly what our problems in Mexico are , then we might be able to also seek a solution that respects the constitutional rights of Americans , that at the same time will avoid organized crime becoming better armed in our country . "
Obama said he has asked Attorney General Eric Holder to study how current gun laws are enforced and whether loopholes in some can be tightened .
He said laws already on the books should restrict the flow of weapons into Mexico .
Obama and Calderón said their discussions ranged from working together to combat global climate change , to efforts at comprehensive immigration reform .
Obama noted his two votes as a U.S. senator for reforms was backed by then - President Bush but shot down by Bush 's fellow Republicans over what they called an " amnesty " provision for illegal immigrants .
" For those immigrants who have put down roots -- they have come here illegally -- I think they need to pay a penalty for having broken the law .
They need to come out of the shadows .
Then we need to put them through a process where , if they want to stay in the United States , they have an opportunity to earn it , " Obama said .
Calderón said the key to reducing illegal immigration is to grow jobs in Mexico , which he pledged to do .
But much of their talk centered on the drug violence .
Watch report on President Obama 's trip »
Since taking office in 2006 , Calderón has worked to root out government corruption and crack down on the drug cartels that hold sway in many of Mexico 's border regions .
That , combined with ramped - up power struggles and turf warfare , has contributed to a rash of violence that has led to more than 1,000 deaths this year .
Obama commended Calderón on the steps his government has taken .
" But I will not pretend that this is a Mexican responsibility alone , " he said .
" A demand for these drugs in the United States is what is helping keep these cartels in business .
This war is being waged with guns not purchased here but in the United States . "
Obama said he 'll urge fast - tracking of the three - year , $ 1.4 billion Merida Initiative , a joint security plan between the United States , Mexico and other Latin American countries in which U.S. equipment , technology and expertise are used toward combating the drug trade .
Speaking to CNN en Español , Obama lauded Calderón as having done " an outstanding and heroic job in dealing with what is a big problem right now along the borders with the drug cartels . "
Asked whether the United States is partly to blame for the violence along the border , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said , " there certainly is a relationship .
You ca n't deny it . "
In Mexico City on Thursday , she said , " What we 're working to do is to work to stop the flow of guns and cash into Mexico that are helping fuel these cartels , but also we 're working at the border to make sure that the spillover violence does n't occur in our own cities and communities . "
Watch what Napolitano says about the U.S. - Mexico drug link »
Napolitano said the United States also must ensure that it is enforcing immigration laws on employers who " consistently go into that illegal labor market in order to exploit it . "
E-verify , an electronic employment eligibility verification system , must be an integral part of immigration enforcement , she said .
Obama is to travel later in the week to the summit for meetings with Latin American leaders .
While on the trip to Latin America , Obama said he seeks to engage in talks with the region 's leaders as equals .
" Times have changed , " Obama said Wednesday .
He refused to criticize the leaders of Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezuela , who have taken measures to change their constitutions to extend their holds on power .

" I think it 's important for the United States not to tell other countries how to structure their democratic practices and what should be contained in their constitutions , " he said .
" It 's up to the people of those countries to make a decision about how they want to structure their affairs . "
He said he believes that the United States has a leadership role to play in the region , but he qualified that role this way : " We also recognize that other countries have important contributions and insights . "
He added , " We want to listen and learn as well as talk , and that approach , I think , of mutual respect and finding common interests , is one that ultimately will serve everybody . "
CNN 's Ed Hornick and Kristi Keck contributed to this report .

WASHINGTON , April 14 ( Reuters ) - More U.S. chief executives got pay raises than had their pay cut in 2008 , a year when billions in taxpayer dollars went to prop up struggling companies and millions of workers lost jobs , according to an AFL - CIO survey released on Tuesday .
Wall Street pay has been heavily scrutinized in the past year , especially for executives at major financial firms getting funds under the government ’s Troubled Asset Recovery Program , aimed to keeping troubled banks afloat and keeping the banking system sound .
The executive pay study of major companies by the AFL - CIO , the country ’s largest labor federation , calculated compensation that included stock options granted to CEOs but not yet vested .
Some governance experts favor this method , which is intended to take into account the intent of corporate boards .
Using that methodology , Citigroup Inc C.N CEO Vikram Pandit made $ 38 million in 2008 , compared with the roughly $ 11 million reported in the company 's compensation section in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
Citigroup collected $ 45 billion in government bailout funds in 2008 .
“ When it comes to CEO pay , many companies continue to hew to the fiction of pay for performance , ” said Daniel Pedrotty , director of the AFL - CIO ’s Office of Investment .
The survey used data from 946 companies in the Russell 3000 index with 2008 information available .
Of those , 480 executives got pay raises , while 463 had pay cuts .
The median CEO salary rose 7 percent in 2008 .
CEO perks at the companies surveyed also went up , nearly 13 percent to an average value of $ 336,246 , according to the survey .
Of CEOs whose compensation increased , the average was $ 5.4 million , including salary , bonuses and stock options .
The average compensation of those who got pay cuts was about $ 3.9 million .
The AFL - CIO , which represents about 11 million workers in the United States , used publicly reported data with help from the Corporate Library , an independent research group , to compile the survey .
It hopes the survey will rally its members to contact Congress members to push for greater oversight of financial institutions , an issue Congress is debating .
The database breaks out compensation to financial institutions getting TARP funds and also by industry .

A few years back , satellite imagery was the exclusive domain of government entities .
But private business has gradually moved in , and over time , the equipment they 're sending into space is providing sharper imagery and greater detail .
That has left some governments wondering whether the pictures might be revealing a bit too much about sensitive locations .
Now , at least one California legislator has taken those worries to an extreme :
He wants all government buildings , including schools , to get the low - res treatment from Google Earth and similar services ; failure to comply would mean hefty fines and jail time .
For the most part , satellite imagery services have reached agreements with various governments about whether they can photograph sensitive locations and , if so , at what resolution .
Similar informal agreements exist with companies such as Microsoft and Google , which provide maps and virtual earth services .
For example , as shown here , the images available of the neighborhood near Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC start to get blurry as the service maps areas closer to the White House .
But these sorts of agreements are informal and , apparently , subject to revision without notice .
That 's the apparent message of a story that appeared in The Sun , which found that a military base that houses some of the country 's nuclear - armed submarines had lost the protective fuzziness that had masked its appearance in earlier versions of Google 's imagery service .
The same applied to its MI - 6 intelligence ministry headquarters and the barracks for the UK 's special forces .
When asked about the change , The Sun was told by a Google spokesman that " we do listen to requests from governments but we do n’t comment on the details of any of those discussions . "
That story may help explain the attention that 's now being given to California legislation , Assembly Bill 255 , which was introduced nearly a month ago .
That bill would move well beyond sensitive military installations and require any company that offers either a satellite imagery service or a street view to blur out a huge collection of buildings .
The bill would add schools , hospitals , government buildings , and places of worship to the list of locations that have to receive blurring .
Perhaps more significantly , the bill wo n't rely on ad hoc agreements between the government and service providers ; instead , the bill would give the government some serious legal weaponry if it chose to go after the companies .
Anyone found violating the requirements would be hit with fines of a quarter of a million dollars a day for each day the image remains pristine .
The company 's executive officers would also face a minimum of a year in jail .
As with many recent instances of misguided legislation , this one appears to have been prompted by fears of terrorism .
The basic logic appears to be that anything terrorists might conceivably use to make their lives easier has to be stopped , even if that same service makes the lives of ordinary citizens easier .
Presumably , atmospheric oxygen will be targeted with legislation at some point in the future .
Even by that logic , this bill fails by being overly narrow .
By simply targeting street view and satellite services , the legislation 's author has left a huge variety of pictures of the Capitol and the Berkeley Campus sitting online , undisturbed .
It 's especially ironic that one of the aerial views is hosted by University of California , Berkeley itself , home of John Yoo , who is notably not a fan of terrorists .
Presumably , this legislation will never make it past the introductory stage .
Still , there 's a strong argument to be made that it deserves any publicity it gets , in that the publicity may discourage others from introducing legislation without thinking .
Just the other day , a friend forwarded me a mass - mailed promotion for Free Inquiry magazine ( a publication in which , incidentally , I had an article published a couple of years ago ) .
The brochure was emblazoned with the following warning : “ If you wish to avoid spending eternity roasting in HELL , do not open and read this brochure . ”
Having no fear of hell , I opened it and fished for what my friend said would be inside : a note from Richard Dawkins encouraging the recipient of the mailing to subscribe to Free Inquiry :
Dear Friend ,
If you live in America , the chances are good that your next door neighbours believe the following : the Inventor of the laws of physics and Programmer of the DNA code decided to enter the uterus of a Jewish virgin , got himself born , then deliberately had himself tortured and executed because he could n’t think of a better way to forgive the theft of an apple , committed at the instigation of a talking snake .
Since I live in Oklahoma ( the purported Buckle of the Bible Belt ) , one might expect that Dawkins was envisioning a neighborhood like mine when he assessed the chances that my next - door neighbors believed this odd little story .
As it happens , one of my next - door neighbors is a Marxist atheist , but the neighbors on the other side do attend the hip , youth - oriented Christian church in town .
As such , what they believe may bear some family resemblance to Dawkins ’ sketch .
My guess , however , is that the resemblance is about as close as what the typical political cartoon rendition of President Obama bears to the real man .
That is , it ’s a caricature that exaggerates certain visible features but fails to capture the man ’s soul .
Such caricatures are common in popular religious discourse , and Dawkins is good at them .
In the same note , he caricatures Islam by noting that in other parts of the world , your neighbors are likely to believe “ you should be beheaded if you draw a cartoon of a desert warlord who copulated with a child and flew into the sky on a winged horse . ”
These are caricatures not because there are n’t people who believe things roughly along these lines , but because they tell us as much about the true substance of the faith as the shape and size of Obama ’s ears tell us about the character of the man .
While most of my Christian friends treat the Garden of Eden story as a myth whose religious significance lies not in its literal accuracy but in its allegorical meanings , there certainly are Christians who insist on the literal truth of this story .
But even those who do would typically agree that it ’s the meaning behind the story that matters most .
The great world religions are n’t about literal belief in stories you might read in a book of fairy tales .
Instead , they ’re primarily about promulgating a holistic worldview and way of life infused with the sense that there ’s something beyond the empirical skin of the world , something deeply important with which we can forge a relationship .
They teach us that when we do so , our lives will be richer and our characters better .
At their root , the stories and teachings and injunctions of a religion aim to bring about a transformation in believers , one in which the believers ’ lives are informed by a relational connection to an Ultimate Reality that transcends them .
That , put simply , is what religion is about .
It ’s not about believing that talking snakes or flying horses are real — even if , sometimes , the adherents to a religion insist they are .
Even among those who believe that religious stories are historical facts and not just myths , there is also an affirmation that the story is more about theology than about history .
The story is remembered because it means something .
If religious teachings are an attempt to transform believers by connecting them with a more fundamental reality , then we have to admit that many religions are failures , at least by any pragmatic measure of success I ’d be prepared to endorse .
But does it follow that every religion is a failure ?
Or , focusing on my own religious faith , does it follow that every way of being a Christian is doomed to failure ?
The important question here is n’t whether some soulless , cartoonish version of religious faith can transform one ’s life .
The important question is whether there ’s a way of being religious , a way of living one ’s life as if there were a transcendent good beyond the empirical world , that actually bears rich fruits .
If your Christian faith is nothing more than belief that “ the Inventor of the laws of physics … got himself born , then deliberately had himself tortured and executed because he could n’t think of a better way to forgive the theft of an apple , ” it ’s hard for me even to imagine what it would look like to live as if this were true , let alone discern any good fruits that might result .
And so , if this hollow and disjointed story were the best that Christianity had to offer , I suppose we could conclude that Christianity is pretty pointless .
But this hollow and disjointed story is n’t the best that Christianity can do .
It ’s a caricature .
And to see just how caricatured Dawkins ’ version of the Christian story is , it may help to sketch out an alternative one .
There is n’t just one , of course , and some may have more transformative potential than others .
What I want to share here , as briefly as I can while doing it justice , a version that has been transformative in my life .
The story begins with the idea that the fundamental reality is personal , an eternal and infinite Person who created the world we know as an act of love .
According to this story , love is n’t love if it does n’t embrace that which is not the self .
And God , whose nature is love , was therefore inspired by His very nature not only to create , but to create and embrace something truly Other than Himself — a universe bound by finitude and mechanistic laws of cause and effect .
But love finds its fullest expression in mutuality , in relationship .
An inanimate universe governed by mechanistic laws and randomness cannot respond to divine love .
For that , there needs to be a personal Other .
And to be another person , something fundamental is required : a person must have a will of his or her own .
And so God did n’t just create a world that ran by rules suited to its material nature .
He also created a world which , operating in terms of those rules , gave rise to persons who had a will of their own .
And the gift of Otherness that He gave to us , the potential to chart our own course rather than blindly follow His , was a gift that necessitated distance .
We could not exist in the full glory of God ’s presence from the start and still be able to develop into independent selves .
God had to create a space between Himself and us , in which we were free to chart our own path , to mature in our own way , to tell our own stories .
Hopefully , these stories would be love stories that would eventually bring God ’s creatures back to Him : fully formed selves who were Other than Him , but united with Him and each other in love .
But our freedom carried with it the capacity to do otherwise .
It carried with it the capacity to reject God .
It carried with it the capacity to reject one another , to hate each other , to despise Otherness rather than embrace it .
And , of course , because we were limited , we chose far too often to do these very things .
But the story does not end there .
This infinite God , when faced with the brokenness and alienation of His creation — with the reality of sin — did n’t abandon us .
Instead ,
He became one of us , and suffered finitude , and experienced the worst kind of cruelty that human freedom can inflict .
And somehow , in the process , He redeemed the world .
The somehow is important .
Dawkins ’ caricature offers no sense of how this act of divine self - sacrifice might be redemptive .
There are many competing accounts , of course , so let me offer just one .
It ’s an account that I first came to really appreciate after stumbling across a little known and out - of - print book from the 1950 ’s , psychotherapist Don Browning ’s Atonement and Psychotherapy .
The account is n’t one that Browning invented — it ’s far older than that .
What Browning did was use the metaphor of psychotherapy to elucidate this old and profound understanding of how the incarnation , crucifixion , and resurrection of Jesus could have a truly redemptive power in the world .
Browning begins by noting that all of us desire to be judged as valuable by some standard of achievement — something that earlier theologians called “ works righteousness . ”
We get the idea , very early on , that our worth as individuals is tied to doing the right things .
And we not only internalize this idea , but we grow to like it .
We want to be responsible for our own worth .
If we ’re valuable , we want it to be because we ’ve earned it .
This idea is inimical to the concept of unconditional love .
Unconditional love is n’t earned .
It ’s bestowed as a gift .
But for those who ’ve grown to measure their worth in terms of their accomplishments , unconditional love may be an unwanted gift .
It ’s this fact , for Browning , that ultimately perpetuates our alienation from God .
Where God offers unconditional love , and invites participation in a community defined by such love , we want the world to be ruled by a law of “ tit - for - tat , ” a law according to which love is earned by achievement , and being loved is a sign that one deserves it .
And so we find God ’s unconditional love to be an affront , and we respond with hostility .
In the face of such hostility , how is God to establish a loving relationship with us ?
Browning ’s answer is drawn from his own experience as a psychotherapist .
The job of a psychotherapist is to listen empathetically , and to offer unconditional concern and care no matter what the patient might share .
The point is to create a space in which it ’s safe to share anything at all without fear of rejection .
But many patients become hostile precisely because of this unconditional empathetic responsiveness .
They want their therapist to approve of them for their accomplishments , but the therapist treats them as valuable no matter what .
And so the patients become hostile .
They lash out : “ I hate you because of your empathy and understanding ! ”
And how does the good therapist respond ?
By empathizing with and understanding the hostility itself .
Hostility to love is defeated by loving even more .
Browning uses this psychotherapeutic practice as a metaphor for our relationship with God .
God ’s love for us is an unqualified acceptance and empathy .
We reject it because we are in bondage to the idea that acceptance must be earned .
God responds by accepting us even in the face of our rejection of Him , by empathizing even with our hostility .
But God has to go further than any therapist .
The therapist is merely human , and so can be hurt by hostility .
The therapist ’s continued love in the face of rejection and hostility means something for that very reason .
Were the therapist a transcendent being who could not be touched by the blows the patient might strike , the acceptance of those blows would mean nothing .
And so God must make Himself vulnerable to the blows we strike .
He must become one of us , at our mercy .
And it ’s not enough that His love be unconditional in theory .
To really defeat our rejection of Him , He must love us through the worst that we can and do throw at Him .
His love must really persist , even as we spit on Him in fact , even as we torture Him in fact , even as we nail Him to a cross .
Therapists do not break through their patients ’ hostility by having a capacity for acceptance and empathy that would persist even if tested .
They break through their patients ’ hostility by actually accepting and empathizing with their patients even in the face of real hostility .
But the empathy of therapists has limits .
They ’re human , after all .
If their patients begin to stalk them , even the best therapists call the police .
Ordinary hostility may be overcome by a therapist ’s work , but not sin itself .
Sin admits of extremes that only God ’s love can endure .
And it is by truly accepting these extremes , and loving us in the face of them , that God defeats the power of sin .
Sin is nothing but the rejection of God and His unconditional love .
And the only way for God to overcome such rejection is through the relentlessness of vulnerable love , persisting even in the face of the most hostile conceivable rejection .
Vicariously if not in fact , we all crucify God for the crime of loving us unconditionally .
And when we do , we come face to face with the fact that we have failed to kill what we intended to destroy .
We confront the empty tomb .
And when we truly come to understand that it ’s empty , when we realize that even the cross is not enough to shatter God ’s unconditional love , we are transformed .
We cease striving to overcome our finitude on our own , and put ourselves at last into the hands of infinite love .
Here , then , is a version of the Christian story .
Unlike Dawkins ’ version , it ’s not a caricature — even if , perhaps , there is much about it that theologians and philosophers ( and psychotherapists ) might debate .
But my task here is n’t to develop a fully coherent theological account of the Christian narrative .
Rather , it ’s to tell a version of the story that is n’t soulless and absurd .
With this version of the story , I can imagine what it might look like to live as if it were true .
I know many people who do so , whether or not they ’ve formulated the story in quite Browning ’s terms .
And my judgment , at least , is that those who live a life informed by this story are transformed by it .
They experience a connection to something deep and fundamental , a wellspring of integrity , compassion , and joy , even in the face of the cruelty and suffering that the world can inflict .
And so here is my challenge to Dawkins and other atheists who want to critique religion .
Let ’s set aside caricatures .
If Dawkins wants to challenge religion , he should take on the soul - stirring versions of the Christian story rather than the mind - numbing ones , and show that these versions lack the transformative power that they promise .
Or he should explain why the transformative potential of a religious narrative is not a good reason to choose to live as if it were true , even if such pragmatic assessment may be the only tool we have for evaluating beliefs about what transcends the empirical world .
Caricatures can be useful in calling attention to things we might not otherwise notice .
But caricatures cease to be useful when they ’re confused with the real thing ; when the critic invites his audience to deride the real thing based on the absurdity of the caricature .
This is what Dawkins does in his little “ note ” to potential Free Inquiry subscribers .
And it is n’t helpful .
There is such a thing as helpful satire , as comic lampooning that highlights the truth .
And then there are caricatures offered up as if they were the truth .
When intelligent people indulge in the latter , they ’ve let the lampooning spirit carry them too far .
Let 's Reconsider

Stunting a Framework
by Michael Feathers
July 31 , 2003
Summary
Ever download a framework and feel overwhelmed ?
Maybe there is a way around that .

I ended up creating a little framework the other day .
I was working on a set of classes to solve a problem and then bang !
All of a sudden I saw how I could extend them to solve a whole set of problems .
" Wow , " I thought , " if I package these classes nicely and put them someplace conspicious I 'll be famous .
People will download the framework and extend it .
They 'll sing my praises far and wide ... and .. and .. I 'll get real email again ! "
I sat at my computer with a beatific grin .
Then , the hammer fell .
" Yes , " I thought , " I will be known as a great framework developer ... a framework developer ... let 's think about great frameworks ... erm .. there are n't many are there ?
In fact , even the good ones are a pain in the ass , are n't they ?
There was that time when we downloaded framework X and it took quite a bit of time to learn how to use it , and that other time when we thought it would be useful if only it did that , but we spent the next week trying to force it and . . "
I 'm sure many of you have been in the same situations .
Framework development is hard , framework extension is hard , and framework use is hard , yet we keep trying .
Why do we do it ?
Mainly because we want to create leveragable work and leverage the work of others .
If we use someone 's else framework , we may save some time .
Moreover , we 've benefited from someone 's " crystalized thought , " thought in the form of working code .
The code shows a proven way of doing things and if it's well - designed it can accomodate our thoughts and we can roll them back to the community .
Sounds good , eh ?
How does it go wrong ?
Many frameworks start out simple .
Someone has an idea , they code up a few classes and then tell their friends about it .
People download the code and say " hmmm ... if only this method was factored this way , I 'd be able to subclass and do X . "
Emails fly to the framework developer and invariably , the code becomes more complicated .
What started out as three or four classes becomes a dozen or two .
New users have to scramble over a couple dozen classes to see what makes them tick .
When you unfocus your eyes a bit , you can still see those simple classes , but only if you remember them from the first version .
The task for the framework developer is no easier .
He has to make sure the changes he makes do n't impact the users .
By necessity , he 'll be conservative ; there will be directions that the code can go easily and directions it can never go because it will break too many clients .
What we 're left with is a lot of frameworks which extend into a particular set of problems very well , but then drop off like a continental shelf when we wade away from that set .
The sad part about these framework problems is that we cause them by trying to make frameworks more useful .
" Can we get the framework to do this ?
Yes , but we have to separate these concerns , break this class in two .. there it 's done .
Uh - oh , it 's a little harder to understand now , but it is useful , let 's roll the change in . "
Compare that to ...
" Can we get the framework to do this ?
No , we 'd have to put in a template method here and generalize this ... and now the method names are all wrong , but if we change them we break all clients so no , we 're never going to let the framework do that . "
It 's hard to win .
Framework developers try to write classes that do n't have to change when new features are added , and often that works , but each time that it does n't , the framework gets a little more baroque and a little harder to understand .
Over time frameworks show their age , but maybe there is a way around that .
A few years ago , I ported JUnit to C++.
It was a port with high allegiance to the original design , it treated C++ as if it were Java and it used the full arsenal of C++ features : templates , exceptions , the " standard " library , etc .
I released it and the email started coming .
" We like your CppUnit code but we have a problem , we can not use exceptions in our environment . "
Another : " CppUnit is great , but we are running in an embedded system and we can not use new and delete . "
And another : " On our team , we can't use the standard library , we use string and collection classes from vendor X . "
From that experience , I learned a couple of things .
I learned that the largest cross platform compatible subset of C++ is C.
I also learned that it was better in many cases to tell someone how to solve a problem in their local copy of the framework than it was to try to roll the solution into everyone 's code .
Sure , as soon as they modified their local copy , it became " their " framework , but the problem was solved .
And , in fact maybe it was better that it was " their " framework .
It occurred to me that if I made a promise that I would never again update the framework , users could really own the framework .
It 's growth would be stunted , but since less is more , it would remain highly flexible and above all , easy to understand .
Instead of sharing full sets of framework source , people can get together and share tips on refactoring and extending their copies of the original simple seed .
I 've tried this out with a brutally stunted framework called CppUnitLite and it seems to be working fine .
Does all of this sound drastic ?
Maybe it is , but I think that the idea is applicable more often than it would seem .
Take a second to think about all of the frameworks you 've used .
How many would have been better off if they were stunted at , say , the second release ?
If you still had the second release and you knew there was n't going to be a third would you be happy growing that framework ?
Would you feel better downloading that version and trying to understand it than you would the current release ?
And , would you feel better knowing that the framework you get is a gift , something you can own , refactor and use without having your code stepped upon by later versions ?
There are some frameworks that I always want the latest and greatest version of , and there are some that I just want the core of ; I take the latter and grow them as I need to .
Right now , I do n't know how I decide to take each tack , but I do know that there are n't many of these officially stunted frameworks around .
If I had to write down some criteria for them , I 'd say that they should be small enough to explain in an hour and after that hour you should feel comfortable changing them .
When a framework is that small and understandable it is easier to adopt .
For teams that need leverage the most , a very short learning curve can make all of the difference in the world .
It 's something to think about ..
The next time you are tempted to write and distribute a framework , run a little experiment .
Imagine the smallest useful set of classes you can create .
Not a framework , just a small seed , a seedwork .
Design it so that it is easy to refactor .
Code it and then stop .
Can you explain it to someone in an hour ?
Good .
Now , can you let it go ?
Can you really let it go ?
Talk Back !

News Corporation founder Rupert Murdoch .
US newspaper owners , their advertising revenue evaporating , their circulation declining and their readership going online to get news for free , are fighting mad
US newspaper owners , their advertising revenue evaporating , their circulation declining and their readership going online to get news for free , are fighting mad .
The enemy ?
Websites that use their stories without paying for them .
" We are mad as hell , and we are not going to take it any more , " said the chairman of the Associated Press , a cooperative of over 1,400 US newspapers , borrowing a line from the anchorman character in the 1976 movie " Network . "
" We can no longer stand by and watch others walk off with our work under misguided legal theories , " Dean Singleton said at a meeting this week of the Newspaper Association of America ( NAA ) in San Diego , California .
Singleton 's battle cry came just a few days after News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch launched a broadside against Internet giant Google , whose Google News website is one of the most popular news aggregators on the Internet .
" Should we be allowing Google to steal all our copyrights ? " asked Murdoch , the owner of newspapers in Australia , Britain and the United States , where his holdings include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post .
" Thanks , but no thanks , " the News Corp. chairman said .
Robert Thomson , the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal , used even harsher language than his boss in describing the situation .
" There is no doubt that certain websites are best described as parasites or tech tapeworms in the intestines of the Internet , " Thomson said in an interview with the newspaper The Australian .
" It 's certainly true that readers have been socialized -- wrongly I believe -- that much content should be free , " he said .
" And there is no doubt that 's in the interest of aggregators like Google who have profited from that mistaken perception . "
The salvos by Singleton , Murdoch and Thomson appear to have been uncoordinated but they reflect rising anger among an industry facing a deepening crisis .
Two newspapers , the Rocky Mountain News of Denver , Colorado , and the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , have shut down in recent weeks and several big newspaper groups have declared bankruptcy , including the Tribune Co. , publisher of the Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times and other dailies .
Hearst Corp. , owner of the San Francisco Chronicle , has threatened to shut down the paper unless unions agree to major staff cuts and The New York Times Co. has threatened to close the Boston Globe unless unions there do the same .
According to the NAA , last year was the worst ever for the US newspaper industry with print advertising revenue falling 17.7 percent and even online advertising revenue dropping -- by 1.8 percent .
The decline in print advertising revenue has been exacerbated by the global recession but the more fundamental problem according to media analysts is that the business model that has sustained the industry for decades is broken .
The counter - attack by US newspaper owners has met with a mixed reaction from analysts , with some saying it's about time they went on the legal offensive to defend copyright and others saying they 're wasting their time .
" What the AP is doing now , like many newspapers , is too little too late in recognizing the threat of the Internet , " said Tom McPhail , professor of media studies at the University of Missouri , St. Louis .
" The court system is too slow for their needs and purposes , " McPhail told AFP .
" They need a short term victory and that is n't going to happen . "
Peter Kafka , writing on his blog MediaMemo , derided the efforts .
" AP shakes fist at Google .
Tells Internet to get off its damn lawn , " read the headline on a post Kafka wrote about the AP threat to go after websites that use its content or that of its member newspaper without permission .
A Google lawyer , Alexander Macgillivray , on Tuesday defended the practice of linking to newspaper articles from Google News , saying it was driving traffic to newspaper websites and providing them with advertising revenue .
Google chief executive Eric Schmidt walked into the lion 's den himself on Tuesday , appearing before the assembled newspaper executives in San Diego just a day after the AP chairman issued his rallying cry .
Schmidt said the reality is the " vast majority " of readers are going to opt for news for free and that newspapers should see Google as a partner and not as a rival as they try to increase their online advertising revenue .
" We have to embrace what users want together and by doing that I think we can win big , " he said .

Q: My son is graduating from college and wants to take a two - year break before entering medical school .
He 'd like to do public service , especially scientific research , and needs to make only enough money to cover his expenses .
He was turned down by Teach for America .
What suggestions can you offer ?
...
Internet users have long known that spam emails - offering everything from cheap medicines and sex aids to get - rich - quick schemes - are an unwanted annoyance , but new research suggests that they are also hugely damaging to the environment .
More than 80 % of the world 's email traffic is now spam and the transmission and receipt of unwanted email gobbles up 33bn kilowatt - hours of electricity a year , according to anti-virus software specialist McAfee .
That is the equivalent of the electricity used by 2.1 m US homes .
The report follows research published yesterday by rival online security firm Symantec showing that cyber criminals are now trading stolen credit card details for as little as 4 p , while a person 's full identity can change hands between gangs for 50p .
Symantec 's Internet Security Threat Report recorded a 192 % increase in spam detected across the internet , from 119.6bn messages in 2007 to 349.6bn in 2008 , with 90 % of those messages generated by " bot networks " .
Bot networks are collections of computers that have been hijacked - often without their owners realising - by malicious software found on websites or within spam .
They can then be controlled by gangs to relay spam messages .
Many internet security analysts fear that the Conficker internet worm , which has infected millions of PCs worldwide , could ultimately be intended to create a massive bot network .
McAfee estimates 62tn spam messages were sent globally last year .
The greenhouse gases involved in providing enough electricity to generate , send and then delete this unwanted traffic was the same as the emissions from 3.1 m cars , according to McAfee 's Carbon Footprint of Spam report , published today .
" As the world faces the growing problem of climate change , this study highlights that spam has an immense financial , personal and environmental impact , " said Jeff Green , a senior vice - president at McAfee .
Amazon 's Kindle e-book reader was introduced to the world back in November 2007 .
Most people would be forgiven , however , for thinking that the device 's legal problems only started with the 2.0 version of the device , which has gotten Amazon in hot water with the Authors Guild , and prompted the company to lash out at those who attempted to put unsanctioned content onto its hardware .
But , as it turns out , Amazon 's biggest legal worries may have begun in the very month that the device was first introduced .
That 's when a patent that anticipates most of the Kindle 's major features was granted to someone else .
That someone else , Discovery Communications , has now filed suit against Amazon for patent infringement .
Discovering e-books
Discovery Communications is probably most notable for its premium TV channels , including the eponymous Discovery Channel .
But , according to the announcement of the suit , " Discovery Communications and [ its founder ]
John S. Hendricks were significant players in the development of digital content and delivery services in the 1990s . "
That interest in content delivery seems to have prompted the company to consider getting into the e-book business as early as 1999 , when the patent was first filed .
A look through the patent , which is called " Electronic book security and copyright protection system , " reveals that Hendricks and his colleagues were well ahead of the game on a variety of levels .
The majority of the patent 's claims involve encrypting and delivering e-book contents , focusing on the storage of keys and secure communications — much of it seems to anticipate the DRM schemes that would be popularized shortly thereafter with digital music distribution .
But Discovery was n't making bets on any specific encryption or distribution model .
The patent contains over 170 clauses , most of them citing variations in which the encryption takes place at different points in the distribution .
And , although the patent suggests one distribution model that fits well with Discovery 's primary business ( sending the books down an unused portion of a TV signal ) , its authors also made sure to cover their bases by including clauses that patented book distribution over the Internet and — bad news for Amazon here — on " a wireless telephone network . "
The patent 's abstract describes how " a portable book - shaped viewer is used for secure viewing of the text " and how " a billing system performs the transaction , management , authorization , collection , and payments . "
That last bit appears to be describing Amazon 's role as gatekeeper for the transactions involved in putting content on the Kindle .
The similarities continue .
The portable device " receives a created , transmitted list of titles of available electronic books " and allows the user to select " a title from the transmitted list of titles of available electronic books . "
From there , the system handles encryption , transmission , and decryption with secure keys for each transaction .
Illustrations of the intended e-book reader included with the patent application seem to look like a keyboardless - Kindle ( or a Sony Reader ) .
Do similarities equal infringement ?
The patent covers most of the significant aspects of the Kindle and its e-book content management system .
Any problems are likely to arise from the long and fairly specific list of approaches to encrypting and validating the e-books , as it's possible that Amazon 's DRM scheme is different enough not to be covered .
Discovery is n't looking to keep the Kindle from being sold , but it is intent on making the device a significantly more expensive proposition for Amazon .
The suit seeks damages " adequate to compensate Discovery for Amazon 's infringement " and asks to have them trebled due to willful and exceptional actions on Amazon 's part .
In addition , in lieu of blocking sale of the Kindle , the company wants the court to impose a royalty agreement .
We talked with Raymond Zenkich , a partner at IP consulting firm Red Chalk Group , about some of the intellectual property issues involved .
He found that Discovery has a diverse portfolio of 32 patents , generally focused on digital content delivery .
Nine of these cover e-books .
Those nine date from anywhere between 1994 and 2008 .
" This shows that they take this area seriously , " Zenkich said , " they are seeking to protect their innovations . "
( He also viewed Discovery 's long history of patents in this area as an indication that the timing — the patent being granted at the same time as the Kindle was released — was coincidental . )
With nine patents on e-books to choose from , Zenkich suggested that Discovery " may have learned that the Kindle was infringing on some aspect of the security and copyright protection system disclosed in the patent . "
After a relatively smooth experience with the first model , Amazon seems to have stumbled into the legal undergrowth with Kindle 2 .
Since the introduction of the revised hardware , Amazon has annoyed both its users and content suppliers even as an intellectual property sword has been hanging over its metaphorical head .
MOSCOW  A crowd of more than 10,000 young Moldovans materialized seemingly out of nowhere on Tuesday to protest against Moldova ’s Communist leadership , ransacking government buildings and clashing with the police .
The sea of young people reflected the deep generation gap that has developed in Moldova , and the protesters used their generation ’s tools , gathering the crowd by enlisting text - messaging , Facebook and Twitter , the social messaging network .
The protesters created their own searchable tag on Twitter , rallying Moldovans to join and propelling events in this small former Soviet state onto a Twitter list of newly popular topics , so people around the world could keep track .
By Tuesday night , the seat of government had been badly battered and scores of people had been injured .
But riot police had regained control of the president ’s offices and Parliament Wednesday .
Electric cars have been getting a lot of buzz lately , but a more immediately viable transportation fuel of the future could be liquid derived from coal .
Scientists have devised a new way to transform coal into gas for your car using far less energy than the current process .
The advance makes scaling up the environmentally unfriendly fuel more economical than greener alternatives .
If oil prices rise again , adoption of the new coal - to - liquid technology , reported this week in Science , could undercut adoption of electric vehicles or next - generation biofuels .
And that 's bad news for the fight against climate change .
The new process could cut the energy cost of producing the fuel by 20 percent just by rejiggering the intermediate chemical steps , said co-author Ben Glasser of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa .
But coal - derived fuel could produce as much as twice as much CO2 as traditional petroleum fuels and at best will emit at least as much of the greenhouse gas .
" The bottom line is that there 's one fatal flaw in their proposed process from a climate protection standpoint , " Pushker Karecha of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" It would allow liquid fuel CO2 emissions to continue increasing indefinitely . "
The race for alternative fuels kicked into high gear last year , with the price of oil reaching $ 150 a barrel before plummeting down below
$ 40 this year .
Still , though experts disagree on the specifics of timing , it 's clear that conventional oil sources will eventually run out .
The list of contenders to replace oil is long and diverse .
Alternative fuels could include next - gen ethanol , algal biofuel , hydrogen and natural gas , or cars could go largely electric .
But the problem with all the new fuels is that they have to scale up
— and that 's harder than it sounds .
Plus , many fear that biofuels could
cause massive , negative land - use changes .
The process of cooking coal into liquid fuel , on the other hand , has already proven itself on a massive scale .
Take coal , add some water , cook it , and you 've got a liquid fuel for your car .
The hydrogen in the water bonds to the carbon and voila : hydrocarbons , such as octane .
It 's the very fact that coal - to - liquids could work that make them such a scary idea for people devoted to fighting climate change .
The Nazis used the so - called Fisher - Tropsch process to provide up to half of their transportation fuel needs during World War II .
Later , South Africa began a major coal - to - liquids program during the Apartheid era and now maintain the world 's largest CTL industry in the world .
The country 's factories produce 160,000 barrels of fuel a day , a little more than all the residents and businesses in Utah use each day .
The traditional process uses carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide , and hydrogen as the ingredients in the molecular soup that gets turned into hydrocarbons .
The Science process uses just CO2 and hydrogen .
Glasser 's new production method allows them to set a lower limit on the amount of energy that would be needed to transform solid coal into fuel .
The very best possible CTL process would require 350 megawatts of input to make 80,000 gallons of fuel ; the current process uses more than 1,000
megawatts .
Even with the small efficiency gains , a large , domestic , carbon - intensive source of transportation fuel would throw a wrench into many plans to reduce emissions from vehicles .
" What they 're proposing is simply not allowable if we want to avoid the perils of unconstrained anthropogenic climate change , " Karecha said .
But Ben Glasser defended the work as a good intermediate step that would help keep energy flowing even as oil reservoirs dwindle .
And he said that the lessons his team learns could be applied to waste streams or renewable sources .
" The long - term solution has to be solar , wind , renewable , but in the meantime I know as a chemical engineer that the easiest thing is to improve on what you 're already doing , " Glasser said .
" The hope is that what we learn with coal - to - liquids , we can take one step further and start using municipal waste or cooking oil , for example , as the carbon source . "
In this case , though , green - tech advocates say that improving a fossil - fuel technology could slow the adoption of other , more sustainable transportation options .
" We are simply running out of time to avoid catastrophic warming , and we no longer have the luxury of grossly misallocating capital and fuels to expensive boondoggles like coal - to - liquid , " Joe Romm , a senior fellow at the Center for American
Progress , told the House Science and Technology
Subcommittee on Energy and Environment last year .
The conflict over which energy source replaces oil as it becomes more scarce is likely to be a massively divisive political topic .
The winning technology could play a huge role in determining whether the American economy can decarbonize before the effects of catastrophic climate change occur .
" Peak Oil and peak gas and peak coal could really go either way for the climate , " Kharecha said at last year 's American Geophysical Union conference .
" It all depends on choices for subsequent energy sources . "

Mr. Obama condemned what he called a “ dark and painful chapter in our history ” and said that the interrogation techniques would never be used again .
But he also repeated his opposition to a lengthy inquiry into the program , saying that “ nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
Mr. Obama said that C.I.A. officers who were acting on the Justice Department ’s legal advice would not be prosecuted , but he left open the possibility that anyone who acted without legal authorization could still face criminal penalties .
He did not address whether lawyers who authorized the use of the interrogation techniques should face some kind of penalty .
The four legal opinions , released in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the A.C.L.U. , were written in 2002 and 2005 by the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , the highest authority in interpreting the law in the executive branch .
The first of the memos , from August 2002 , was signed by Jay S. Bybee , who oversaw the Office of Legal Counsel , and gave the C.I.A. its first detailed legal approval for waterboarding and other harsh treatment .
Three others , signed by Steven G. Bradbury , sought to reassure the agency in May 2005 that its methods were still legal , even when multiple methods were used in combination , and despite the prohibition in international law against “ cruel , inhuman or degrading ” treatment .
All legal opinions on interrogation were revoked by Mr. Obama on his second day in office , when he also outlawed harsh interrogations and ordered the C.I.A. ’s secret prisons closed .
In the memos , the Justice Department authors emphasized precautions the C.I.A. proposed to take , including monitoring by medical personnel , and the urgency of getting information to stop terrorist attacks .
They recounted the C.I.A. ’s assertions of the effectiveness of the techniques but noted that interrogators could not always tell a prisoner who was withholding information from one who had no more information to offer .
The memos include what in effect are lengthy excerpts from the agency ’s interrogation manual , laying out with precision how each method was to be used .
Waterboarding , for example , involved strapping a prisoner to a gurney inclined at an angle of “ 10 to 15 degrees ” and pouring water over a cloth covering his nose and mouth “ from a height of approximately 6 to 18 inches ” for no more than 40 seconds at a time .
A spokesman for Nawaz Sharif says the Pakistani opposition leader left his residence this morning in defiance of an order placing him under house arrest .
A convoy of vehicles left Sharif 's villa in the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday , apparently headed for an anti-government rally where police were battling stone - throwing demonstrators .

Sharif spokesman Asif Kirmani confirmed that the former prime minister was in the convoy .
Sharif is locked in a bitter power struggle with Pakistan 's president that threatens to paralyze politics in the nuclear - armed country and dilute its focus on tackling economic woes as well as Taliban militants operating along the Afghan border .
Hundreds of police surrounded the former prime minister 's residence in the eastern city of Lahore before dawn and detained him along with scores of his supporters .
Officers showed party officials an order placing Sharif and his politician brother Shahbaz under house arrest for three days , party spokesman Pervaiz Rasheed said .
Shahbaz and a host of other protest leaders went underground to dodge similar orders .
Rao Iftikhar , a senior government official , said the list of those facing detention also included the head of Pakistan 's main Islamist party and a leader of its activist lawyers .
Lawyers and opposition party supporters had planned to gather today near Lahore 's main court complex before heading toward Islamabad to stage a mass sit -in front of Parliament , in defiance of a government ban .
To thwart them , authorities parked trucks across major roads on the edge of the city , and riot police took up positions outside the railway station and government buildings .
About 1,000 flag - waving demonstrators jumped police barricades to reach the courts .
At one point , protesters pelted some of the hundreds of riot police ringing the area with rocks .

An Associated Press reporter saw one officer led away with a head wound before his colleagues fired two rounds of tear gas , scattering the crowd .
Television images also showed police commandos wearing flak jackets and armed with assault rifles apparently searching for Shahbaz in Rawalpindi , a city just south of the capital .
Shahbaz , speaking to Geo television by phone , appealed to ordinary Pakistanis to come out onto the streets .
" ( President Asif Ali ) Zardari has put the nation into this deep crisis by breaking his promises , " he said .
" These fascist tactics cannot stop the masses who want justice . "
Zardari and Sharif are under pressure from Washington to reach a settlement .
The US fears the dispute is bogging down the government just a year after democratic elections ended the long domination of former military ruler and US ally Pervez Musharraf — and preventing Islamabad from being an effective ally in the fight against militants in Afghanistan .
Suspected militants attacked a transport terminal in northwestern Pakistan used to supply NATO troops in Afghanistan before dawn and torched dozens of containers and military vehicles , including Humvees , police said .
The latest political turmoil began last month when the Supreme Court disqualified the Sharif brothers from elected office , over convictions dating back to an earlier chapter in Pakistan 's turbulent political history .
Zardari compounded the crisis by dismissing the Sharifs ' administration in Punjab , Pakistan 's biggest and richest province .
The brothers then threw their support behind plans by lawyers to stage an indefinite sit-in in the capital — a move officials say would bring the government to a standstill and present a target to terrorists .
Yesterday , after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke to both Zardari and Nawaz Sharif by telephone , the government announced it would file an appeal against the Supreme Court ruling in the coming days .
Sharif 's party welcomed the move but said it would n't compromise on demands for a shake - up of the judiciary .
Zardari refuses to reinstate a group of judges fired by Musharraf .
Many observers suspect Zardari fears the judges could challenge a pact signed by Musharraf that quashed long - standing corruption charges against him and his wife , slain former leader Benazir Bhutto .
Skeptics suspect Sharif of hoping to force early elections , from which he and Islamist parties would likely profit .
The UK government cannot afford to pump more money into Britain 's struggling economy , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned today , piling further pressure on Gordon Brown ahead of the G20 summit in London .
Echoing comments made by the Bank of England governor , Mervyn King , the OECD said Britain 's worsening budget deficit meant the government had little room to cushion the impact of the recession if it turned out to be deeper than expected .
The government is already expected to have to borrow at least £ 118bn in 2009 to balance the books - equal to 9 % of gross domestic product , an all - time record .
" The room for additional fiscal manoeuvre to respond to worse - than - expected activity developments is therefore limited and new measures would need to be accompanied by detailed and credible fiscal consolidation plans in order to ensure that confidence is not eroded , " the OECD said .
The Paris - based thinktank urged the Bank of England to hold interest rates near zero until the end of next year to support the economy .
Until last week , the prime minister , Gordon Brown , appeared determined to announce a new stimulus package in the 22 April budget , but he was forced to backtrack after King warned against a giveaway .
Opposition politicians seized on King 's warning to intensify the pressure on Brown , who is chairing the G20 summit to coordinate international steps to tackle the global economic crisis .
For now , Britain is implementing a discretionary fiscal stimulus worth 1.4 % of GDP , on top of increased spending on social benefit payments .
The Bank is also creating £ 75 bn to buy government bonds through a quantitative easing programme to boost growth and stave off deflation , which the OECD said could turn out to be more successful than expected .
" Monetary and fiscal policy could provide a stronger stimulus to growth , although the magnitude of their impacts , especially that of quantitative easing , are currently difficult to gauge , " the body said .
The OECD is predicting the UK economy will shrink by 3.7 % this year , the sharpest rate of decline since the second world war , and by 0.2 % next year , although a recovery should start later that year .
Unemployment is likely to peak at 10 % , up sharply from the current 6.5 % rate .
" While the OECD projections make depressing reading , we suspect they may even be a little on the optimistic side , " said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight , who thinks the economy could suffer a 4 % contraction this year and a further one of 0.4 % next year .
The OECD 's forecast for British growth is slightly less grim than that for other big economies .
It predicts the United States will contract by 4 % , the eurozone by 4.1 % and Japan by 6.6 % .
It said that governments may be able to justify more spending in certain circumstances .
" If economic circumstances deteriorate significantly more than projected , further fiscal measures would be warranted , " it said in the report .
The OECD fears the world 's 30 richest countries face a combined jump in unemployment of 25 million people in the current economic crisis , by far the biggest and swiftest rise in the post - war period .
Ratings agency
Fitch also issued a grim forecast today .
It downgraded its previous forecasts for economic growth in 2009 and is now predicting the " widest and deepest global recession " since the second world war .
The 35th annual Long Beach Grand Prix took place during a hot and sunny weekend with record crowds .
All told , six racing series held competitions during April 18th and 19th on the 1.97 mile course that looped through the streets of Long Beach .

Former Area 51 scientists break their decades - long silence David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday April 13 , 2009
Print This Email This UFO theorists and alien conspiracists brace yourselves !
Former employees of the mysterious and infamous Area 51 are now breaking their decades - long silence and coming forward to talk about their work at the ultra - secret military facility .
For decades there have been reports of UFO sightings near Area 51 but the CIA only recently declassified a program that may explain some of those sightings .
Thornton Barnes , a former Area 51 project specialist , told Fox 's Bill Hemmer that a secret plane , code - named OXCART , was almost certainly mistaken for a UFO .
At the time the OXCART was first brought online , Barnes says no one else in the world had any aero - technology like it .
The A - 12 OXCART flew 2,850 missions out of Area 51 .
The plane could fly at three times the speed of sound at an altitude of 90,000 feet .
" People would see the reflection of the plane at that altitude and at that speed and I m quite sure that this was responsible for many of the false sightings , " Barnes said .
Former Area 51 physicist Edward Lovick agreed .
" Commercial aircraft pilots would see something , but they were never really able to see the shape of it , " Lovick said .
" All they could see was some glint off the bottom of the airplane flying by . "
Lovick and Barnes said their work for Area 51 was focused on defeating and besting Soviet aero-technology .
" My work always was involved in attempting to reduce the ability of [ the Soviet Union ] to detect our aircraft by means of radar , " Lovick said .
The A - 12 OXCART program was shut down in the late sixties .
Other projects at Area 51 remain a secret .
Los Angeles Times has more recently disclosed details about Area 51 here .

Politico : Palin ' most untrustworthy ' figure in American politics John Byrne
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This A new Politico poll released Tuesday finds that President Barack Obama enjoys broad support -- some 66 percent trust Obama a " great deal " or " some " -- and is named the most popular figure in politics today .
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , meanwhile , found themselves on the opposite side of the popularity fence .
Palin , who enjoyed broad support among the conservative base of the Republican Party during her run for the vice presidency last year , got the highest " untrustworthy " rating of all the major political figures surveyed at 33 percent .
Voters were asked if they trusted the politician to identify the right solutions to the problems we face as a nation . 
Ranking second - worst in the " untrustworthy " column was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , who polled at 32 percent .
Pelosi came in last when asked if respondents trusted her " a great deal " -- at just 26 percent .
The survey was conducted by Public Strategies / Politico and involved 1,000 registered voters .
" The Democratic Party was trusted to find the right solutions by a majority of voters , 52 percent to 40 percent , " the poll said .
" Forty percent of those surveyed said they trusted the Republican Party , compared with 54 percent who did not trust the GOP . "
On the economy , " Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , Obamas point man on the economy , is found credible by 56 percent of the public , trailing Buffett , Bernanke , former President Bill Clinton and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Romney , the Republicans  top performer in the category , tied with Geithner . "
Obama was found to the most credible voice on the economy , topping even billioniare investor Warren Buffet .

Marilyn Chambers , a former Ivory Snow detergent model who became a porn star , died Sunday at her Canyon Country home .
She was 56 .
Chambers , whose real name is Marilyn Ann Taylor , was found unresponsive at 8:51 p.m. at her residence it the 16000 block of Vasquez Canyon , said Los Angeles County coroner 's spokesman Ed Winter .
The cause of death is under investigation but foul play was not suspected and an autopsy is pending .
Chambers became a pop culture phenomenon when she gave up work as a model advertising Ivory Snow laundry detergent to star in the X - rated " Behind the Green Door " in 1972 .
The movie also sparked a buying frenzy on boxes of Ivory Snow soap , then graced by Chambers ' angelically complexioned face .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The last survivor of the Titanic , 97 - year - old Millvina Dean , is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills .
Millvina Dean , 97 , is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers .
The auction , which is expected to raise up to $ 50,000 for her , is set to take place Saturday near her home in England .
It is the second auction in less than a year for Dean , who was a 9 - week - old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 .
Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship , said Alan Aldridge of the auction house .
" Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia , the rescue ship , in a mail sack , " Aldridge said .
After her rescue , Dean , her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack , among other possessions .
" There is speculation that this would have been the bag .
It 's a leather and canvas bag .
You would easily get a child or infant in it , " Aldridge said , though he added that research by the Smithsonian , the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag .
Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag , " we expect it to fetch £ 3,000 ( $ 4,480 ) .
If it was the bag she was rescued in , it would be £ 30,000 to £ 40,000 , ( $ 44,800 to $ 60,000 ) , but we can't prove it .
It depends on what people are prepared to believe . "
Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible .
" She 's in a residential nursing home .
She 's 97 years of age .
She 's paying £ 3,000 a month in nursing home fees , " he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for .
" As she said , £ 3,000 a month is £ 36,000 a year , which is a lot of money , " he said .
" When she runs out of money , the state will pay fees for her , but while she can pay her fees , she decides where she gets her care .
When the state pays , they decide . "
Dean 's previous sale , in October , raised just over £ 30,000 , Aldridge said .
" It 's made a lot of people aware of her plight ; a lot of people have sent her funds , " he said .
Dean never married and had no children .
" There are cousins , but there is no one directly to support her , " Aldridge said .
" The property she lived in [ before she moved to the nursing home ] was not hers .
She 's just an ordinary little old lady .
" If she 's lucky , she 'll get another four or five years ; she 's quite a fit lady , " he said .
Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection , Aldridge said .
The auction will include 17 items from her collection , most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her but not from the ship itself .
The auction , in Devizes , southwest England , will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton - West , estimated to fetch £ 40,000 to £ 60,000 ( $ 60,000 to $ 90,000 ) .
The letters include descriptions of her family 's trip to board the Titanic and the immediate aftermath of the sinking .
Dainton - West , who was 10 months old when the ship went down , died in October 2007 , the auctioneer said .

In a review of the thesis should be paid particular attention to whether the procedural requirements have been complied .
The proofreading of the thesis is the last step before printing , when this error can not be seen , it is usually for a change too late .
There ’s thesis certain procedural requirements to be followed , misspellings are used by most professors , especially in the natural sciences , but also for economists , educators and lawyers rather tolerated – which does not mean that spelling with no value is placed .
The thesis – the last step to the title
At the end of studying a thesis must be written many times .
For them , there are certain procedural requirements , if errors exist , are easily modifiable in proofreading the thesis .
The situation is different with the content , here serious mistakes were made , it is usually used for corrections too late .
Basically , ever worked careful when creating the final work , the lower the cost in the subsequent review .
Most of the students are finished with their dissertation until shortly before the deadline , in the hustle and bustle errors are often overlooked .
Since a student hardly works without a computer , the spell check is the slightest problem , otherwise it looks with the formatting form .
Many PC performs an unwanted life of its own , so footnotes disappear , the font size suddenly at the beginning of the work other than at the end , table formats become independent and much more .
Even if the content should be relevant , most professors still place great emphasis on the outward appearance , so it is sensible to neglect these details in any case in proofreading the thesis .
That ’s the claim , but the question is whether or not the G - Tech / Pro actually fits the bill .
In an effort to determine this , we reached out to G - Tech to demo a unit .
Jovo Majstorovic , inventor / founder of the G - Tech , was nice enough not only to accept our request but also to sit down with me for a long chat to discuss current and possible future products .
There are a variety of performance meters on the market , running the gambit in price and features from the $ 12.99 Dynolicious app for the iPhone to the professional $ 10,000 +
Correvit Datron dynamic vehicle testing system .
The more expensive systems can measure slip , pitch and roll angle and are able to connect to a car ’s internal systems like ABS sensors .
There are even application specific units such as the $ 750 DriftBox from VBOX with both built - in GPS and the ability to measure drift angle .
But at the end of the day , if you are a typical auto enthusiast and weekend warrior , you want a device that ’s accurate , inexpensive and gives you the essential metrics that you require .
In other words , you want the G - Tech / Pro .
For $ 199 , with a 30 day money back guarantee and a 1 yr limited warranty , you get a device with which 95 % of gear - heads can comfortably apply check marks across the features and functionality they require .
First and foremost , the G - Tech / Pro SS measures horsepower and torque and gives both numerical and graphical feedback .
This is great for figuring out before - and - after increases ( or decreases if you like to slap on those can exhausts ) .
The 60 feet time is a rather new performance mark which determines how effectively the car is hooking up .
Let ’s say you make some engine modifications , adjust the front and rear suspension to tweak the weight transfer or experiment with slicker tires .
The G - Tech will evaluate those efforts .
Of course , the stalwarts of performance metrics are available as well — 1/8th and 1/4 mile measurements and 0 - 60 mph and 0 - 100 mph times .
One of the coolest features of the G - Tech is that it can pick up RPMs from the cigarette lighter and flash bright red LEDs at the most effective shift points .
Whether you are dragging or racing on a track , the G’s that you are pulling are always visible with a directional indicator .
With all this data available , it ’s easy to loose track of where you were and where you are now .
Luckily , the G - Tech / Pro provides an internal record of the last 30 runs which can be easily accessed by maneuvering through rows of boxes on the screen .
Getting set up could n’t be easier .
All that is required is unpacking the unit , inserting the power cord , placing the other end in the cigarette lighter , slipping it into the holding bracket and sticking the suction cup to the window .
As reported by others , we did have some problems with the unit staying in place .
But as with any high tech device , it is always the low tech piece that causes the most problems .
The nice thing is that this was quickly resolved by being a little proactive , cleaning off the windshield with rubbing alcohol and placing a tiny bit of water around the rim .
Pressing down on top of the red button above the cigarette adapter activates the unit .
Once it powers up , only a Menu and OK button need to be operated alongside the Navigation toggle .
Calibration is performed by entering the time and date , choosing the car ’s redline , selecting the appropriate weight and setting the pitch ( if needed ) .
And that ’s it !
Unfortunately , if you switch between cars , this has to be performed each time you swap .
However , the more expensive G - Tech / Pro RR does save calibration for 2 vehicles .
So what ’s the bottom line ?
We were able to test out the G - Tech / Pro SS on a couple of different vehicles and found the performance meter feedback to be a welcome addition to the driving experience .
From a casual driving perspective , even when not in the mindset of pushing the car , it was cool to get G ratings as well as have the red LEDs flash at the appropriate shift points .
When it was time to get down to business and really test out our vehicle ’s performance chops , the G - Tech did a great job of giving us all the information we required .
There was no need to test the accuracy of these units , as they have been reviewed over the years by many folks who have evaluated the G - Tech against both traditional dynos and other devices costing 50 times as much .
They have always performed well with an +/- .02 mph variance for 0 to 60 mph , +/- .01 sec time variance for the quarter mile and +/- 1 % for horsepower .
Lately there have been some reviewers who have pitted the Dynolicious app against the G - Tech , painting the latter in a negative light .
Garage 419 did a scathing review that questioned the accuracy and efficacy of their G - Tech unit .
When there is a strong reaction on either side of an issue , the truth can usually be found somewhere in the middle .
The G - Tech unit has much more advanced electronics associated with its accelerometers that allow it to function consistently across a variety of temperature ranges for which the Dynolicious app cannot possibly duplicate .
In order to be effective , calibration has to be performed at the same temperature as the measurements are taken .
The G - Tech handles this robotically as opposed to the Dynolicious app which requires the user to perform this action each and every time with the hope that they will get it close .
In addition , the G - Tech performs pitch correction which is required for accurate measurement .
Dynolicious leaves this out of the equation .
All this is not to suggest that the Dynolicious app is not solid , because it ’s very close to being a real contender .
With an informed user vigilent enough to take the time to perform a proper calibration before each run , it can be pretty accurate .
And with upgrades as simple as downloading the latest version it can only get better and better .
What I will say is that the success of the Dynolicious app does serve to highlight the age of the G - Tech / Pro SS which was first released in 2004 .
Technology has progressed a long way since then and Jovo assured me that there is something in the works that will tip the scales decidedly back in its favor ( although the G - Tech is still more than holding its own ) .
My advice is as follows .
If you currently have an iPhone and have sunk your piggy bank into that , grab the Dynolicious app ( see our review ) and hold off on the G - Tech / Pro until the upcoming unit is available .
If you do n’t have an iPhone ( and even if you do but need real world accuracy ) , the G - Tech / Pro SS is the best unit on the market for the money .
We ’ll wait with baited breath until G - Tech ’s new gizmo is released .
Check back then as we will definitely put it through its paces including some serious side - by - side comparisons to other units on the market such as the VBOX Mini .

VINA DEL MAR , Chile ( Reuters ) - Sovereignty over the Falklands Islands will not be up for discussion when Prime Minister Gordon Brown holds talks with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez , Brown said on Friday .
Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown listens as Chile 's President Michelle Bachelet delivers a speech during the closing ceremony of the Progressive Governance Conference in Vina del Mar , about 75 miles ( 121 km ) northwest of Santiago , March 27 , 2009 .
The leaders are in Chile for the upcoming Progressive Leaders ' Summit .
REUTERS / Eliseo Fernandez
Brown and Fernandez are scheduled to meet on Saturday morning on the sidelines of a meeting of centre - left leaders in the Chilean coastal resort of Vina del March
Britain seized back the islands , known as the Malvinas in Spanish , in a 1982 war after they were occupied by Argentine forces .
Some 649 Argentines and 255 British troops died .
Tackling the global financial crisis is expected to dominate the meeting which comes less than a week before the G20 summit of leading industrial and developing countries that both leaders will attend in London on April 2 .
Brown made clear before the meeting that “ on sovereignty of the Falklands , there is nothing to discuss from our side . ”
“ The essential principle has always been that the islanders should determine the issue of sovereignty for themselves , ” he said in a statement .
“ Our first priority will always be the needs and the wishes of the islanders .
They are a proud and strong community and they have my total support and respect , ” he said .
He said there were “ ongoing discussions about flights to and from the mainland but as on every other issue it is the needs and wishes of the islanders that are our first priority . ”
Argentina wants direct flights to the islands so that relatives can visit the graves of the war dead .
The Falkland islanders , who number around 2,900 , want more flights to South America for business purposes , a British official said .
He said no breakthrough on these issues was expected at Saturday ’s meeting .
Argentina ’s Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana told reporters in Vina del Mar there would be an “ open agenda ” at the meeting between Fernandez and Brown .
Taiana said that the issue of sovereignty over the Falklands was a “ permanent ” Argentine foreign policy issue .
Argentina ’s ill - fated Falklands campaign is widely seen as a mistake by the discredited military dictatorship ruling at the time .
However , Argentina ’s government has said it will continue to seek sovereignty over the islands .

Craigslist is stunned by a civil lawsuit filed against the site 's " erotics services " section , according to CEO Jim Buckmaster .
Craigslist is stunned by a civil lawsuit filed against the site 's " erotics services " section , according to CEO Jim Buckmaster .
" Frankly , Sheriff Dart 's actions mystify me , " Buckmaster said in a statement .
Sheriff Thomas J. Dart of Cook County , Illinois filed suit against the online classifieds Web site Thursday , accusing its owners of knowingly promoting and facilitating prostitution .
" Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation , " Dart said in a statement .
" Missing children , runaways , abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they 're being pimped on Craigslist . "
Buckmaster said the company spoke with Sheriff Dart in mid- and late - 2007 about its " erotic services " section .
" Since then , we have not only initiated multiple new measures to further reduce misuse of our Web site by anyone intending criminal activity , we also reached an agreement with 40 state attorneys - general , including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan , about an enforcement plan designed to protect the public from those who would misuse our site , " Buckmaster said .
In November , Craigslist filed suit against 14 companies and individuals who were accused of using the classifieds
Web site to facilitate human trafficking , child exploitation , and prostitution .
The site also announced that it would require people posting ads via " erotic services " to provide credit card verification and pay a fee .
Dart said that fee was " dirty money " and " a publicity stunt that generated goodwill and possibly tax breaks for Craigslist , but which has had little practical effect . "
Pimps get around the requirements by using stolen cards and posting in other sections , he said .
Dart said he wrote to Craigslist numerous times asking that it shut down the " erotic services " section , and alerting them to the numerous arrests the department has made by trolling Craigslist for inappropriate content , but nothing was done .
Arrests have ranged from suburban soccer moms to heroin addicts , a former reality TV star and several juveniles , some as young as 14 years old , Dart said .
" As our counsel explained to Sheriff Dart 's department in 2007 , Craigslist cannot be held liable as a matter of clear federal law for content submitted to the site by our users , " Buckmaster said .
" We assist police forces all over the country , including members of Sheriff Dart 's department , " he continued .
" The vast majority seem to understand that Craigslist is part of the solution when it comes to combating terrible crimes like human trafficking and child exploitation . "
Dart is not convinced .
" Craigslist unabashedly facilitates prostitution , then ultimately makes a profit from it , " he said .
In 1982 , schoolteacher Ed Peden drove out to investigate a decommissioned nuclear missile bunker that was up for sale near his hometown of Topeka , Kansas .
He found 34 acres of grass in need of mowing and , deep below ground , an 18,000 - square - foot warren of concrete tunnels , most of it flooded with rainwater .
Peden stripped to his shorts and dropped a rope ladder into the flooded base .
Most of the rooms were three - quarters flooded , and the water had stagnated for nearly two decades .
Holding his nose to dive under doorways between the flooded rooms , Peden took his first tour of what would soon become his family home .
At the height of the Cold War in the early ' 60s , the United States built dozens of missile bases across the Midwest to launch salvos of Atlas and Titan ICBMs .
Typically , the sites were enormous underground bunkers , built to withstand a direct nuclear hit .
Some resembled underground cities in their scale .
The government spent millions of dollars building each of the sites but evolving weapons technology made them quickly obsolete .
Most were shuttered after only a few years of war readiness .
The Topeka base , opened in 1961 , housed a gigantic Atlas E missile armed with a 4 megaton thermonuclear warhead – a weapon 200 times more powerful than the bomb that obliterated Nagasaki .
By1965 it was declared outdated because it took too long to open the missile bay doors .
Nearly 20 years later Peden bought the base – which had remained abandoned all that time – for $ 48,000 .
Today , retired from teaching , Peden is one of the Midwest 's leading missile base brokers .
So far , he 's sold 48 of these forsaken sites , often selling the same site more than once when new owners become overwhelmed with the commitment needed to overhaul and live in an enormous government facility .
Join us as we tour Peden 's missile - base home and take a look back at the time that spawned these supersized structures .

The I - 70 interstate skirts downtown Topeka .
It stretches past miles of Kansas farmland , occasionally interrupted by a rest stop or filling station .
Heading west out of town you travel the same open road Ed Peden often drives to pick up groceries and visit civilization since moving into his nuclear missile base some 15 years ago .
He has owned the place since 1983 , but it took him 10 years to convince his wife to live there .
As the miles pass it becomes obvious why the government decided to build a cluster of missile sites where it did .
If you think Topeka is in the middle of nowhere , then Missile Base Road is nowhere .
Off the exit , south 7 miles , left at the T , follow the curve to the right but not onto the gravel road , another couple of turns and you find yourself on Peden 's mile - long driveway .

The one structure Peden added to the property is a sunroom containing a hot tub .
He built this small structure over the entrance to his living space and in the shadow of a castle turret .
Friends built two faux castle turrets over the bunker 's escape hatches .
Peden is a former Topeka high school teacher - turned - real estate mogul , who specializes in selling off these abandoned missile bases .
He is also media savvy , as evidenced by the dozens of newspaper and magazine clippings taped to a hallway wall .
He glorifies living underground , but carefully measures his words .

The landscape of Peden 's Atlas missile bay is similar to this historical aerial photograph of a similar site , except most of the outbuildings were removed years ago , and his parking lot is completely empty .

Peden 's missile base is an early design .
The Atlas E missile it housed was stored horizontally in a missile bay .
( The entrance to the bay can seen in the background ) .
To ready the missile for firing , the bay 's roof was retracted and the missile lifted into a vertical position .
It was then fueled and prepped for launch .
This design did n't last long , as it became apparent that too much time was lost preparing the missile for action .

After being paraded through the streets of nearby towns and cities , the missiles were delivered to their respective bays and silos .

Peden , who often gives tours of his missile base , likes to start them in the garage .
Walking down the ramp to his garage door you can understand why :
It 's huge .
The massive motorized bay door , which measures 18 - by - 20 feet and weighs more than 47 tons , gives you some idea of what lies behind it .
Beautifully engineered and made from the finest steel , the door still works like a charm , even after spending years submerged under eight feet of water .
Even before all the water was pumped out , even before the electricity was working , Peden cleared out the missile bay with a wheelbarrow , a shovel and a miner 's cap .
He removed the sludge one trip at a time .
It was a mess , but he was determined .
Today the missile bay houses Peden 's Winnebago , a tractor and various other vehicles , including an old MG Midget with a For Sale sign in the window .
His Winnebago is parked right on top of a massive exhaust pit – now covered by a huge steel plate – that would have expelled the missile 's flaming rocket plume as it shot out of the bay .
There 's also a workroom next door where Peden has built airplanes .
( Yeah , full - sized airplanes .
Not models ) .
It 's a tinkerer 's paradise .

The first of two tunnels out of the missile bay leads to a platform .
A second , 120 - foot tunnel leads to the Peden 's living space .
" Not many houses have tunnels , " said Peden .
" We have one .
We like it . "
Peden says that he and his wife inhabit only 6,500 square feet out of the base 's 18,000 sq ft .
Their two daughters grew up here , learning to ride their bikes on the extensive driveway , but have since grown up and moved out .

Peden remodeled part of the base into a residential area , adding , among other things , two kitchens for his wife , who loves to cook .
He also built an office for himself and a bedroom for each daughter , both left untouched since they flew the nest .
At his wife 's request , Peden keeps the master bedroom off limits for tours .
The highlight of this portion of the house is the spiritual room , formerly the missile control room .
Three men manned the controls 24/7 between 1961 and 1965 .
Now , very deliberately , it 's filled with spiritual artifacts from all over the world .
Peden had the room checked out by some of his more spiritual - minded friends .
" The room had some heavy energy , " he says .
He thinks it 's ironic that someone with his liberal political views lives in a structure built for such an ominous purpose .
" We think we are the antithesis to the American military , " he says .

The final stop on the tour takes you through the upstairs dining room , where the diesels that powered the site used to live .
The room 's glass doors lead to a balcony overlooking the largest and most impressive room in the " house . "
Now it is lit with chandeliers , hung with delicate fabrics and covered in richly colored carpets , a gathering place for the Pedens and their friends .
Up the spiral staircase to a sunroom , the tour ends .
After an hour below the surface in Peden 's castle one can appreciate seeing the light of day and relaxing in his above - ground hot tub .

The notion that evil is the expression of bestial instincts is deeply ingrained , and for the average philosopher as for the average person there is nothing more bestial than the wolf .
More generally , a belief in the innate superiority of humans over other animals is part of the Western tradition .
Christians tell us that only humans have souls , and though they speak in a different language secular thinkers mostly believe much the same .
There are innumerable secular rationalists who , while congratulating themselves on their skepticism , never doubt that the universe is improved by the presence in it of humans like themselves .
The Philosopher and the Wolf is a powerfully subversive critique of the unexamined assumptions that shape the way most philosophers - along with most people - think about animals and themselves .
When Rowlands bought a wolf cub for $ 500 , and lived with it for eleven years , he ended up writing : ' Much of what I learned , about how to live and how to conduct myself , I learned during those eleven years .
Much of what I know about life and its meaning I learned from him .
What it is to be human : I learned this from a wolf . '
A part of Rowlands 's life with Brenin was sheer delight : ' The wolf is art of the highest form and you can not be in its presence without this lifting your spirits . '
Beyond its beauty , though , the wolf taught the philosopher something about the meaning of happiness .
Humans tend to think of their lives as progressing towards some kind of eventual fulfillment ; when this is not forthcoming they seek satisfaction or distraction in anything that is new or different .
This human search for happiness is ' regressive and futile ' , for each valuable moment slips away in the pursuit of others and they are all swallowed up by death .
In contrast , living without the sense of time as a line pointing to an end - point , wolves find happiness in the repetition of fulfilling moments , each complete and self - contained .
As a result , as Rowlands shows in a moving account of his last year with Brenin , they can flourish in the face of painful illness and encroaching death .
The bond that Rowlands formed with Brenin was based on the fact that the wolf had emotions in common with the philosopher , such as courage , affection and delight in play .
At the same time , Rowlands seems clearly to have been drawn to the wolf because of its profound differences from humans .
In evolutionary terms humans belong in the ape family , and if apes are intellectually superior to other animals it is because of their highly developed social intelligence .
Some of the most valuable features of human life - science and the arts , for example - are only possible because of this intelligence .
But it is also this type of intelligence that enables apes - some kinds of ape , at any rate - to engage in forms of behavior that , when more fully developed , embody types of malignancy that are pre-eminently human .
As Rowlands puts it :
" When we talk about the superior intelligence of apes , we should bear in mind the terms of this comparison : apes are more intelligent than wolves because , ultimately , they are better schemers and deceivers than wolves . '
The ability to scheme and deceive requires a capacity to enter the minds of others , which other animals seem not to possess in anything like the same degree .
But the human capacity for empathy brings something new into the world - a kind of malice aforethought , a delight in the pain of others that aims to reduce them to the condition of powerless victims .
If the philosopher loved the wolf , it was because while it could kill without emotion it lacked this distinctively human trait . "
Among other things The Philosopher and the Wolf is a series of unsentimental reflections on human evil .
Rowlands does not think of evil in simple terms , as mere Schadenfreude - it is far more complicated than that .
But neither does he share the rationalist delusion that evil is a kind of error , which can be removed from human life by better knowledge and improved understanding .
On the contrary , unfashionably but to my mind rightly , Rowlands accepts that evil is part of human nature , which can be moderated but never eradicated .
Mark Rowlands tells us he has long pondered the claim , often advanced as an objection to his life with Brenin , that wolves have no place in civilized society , and has finally concluded that it 's true .
The reason is not that Brenin was too dangerous to be allowed in civilised company .
Rather , it is that 'he was nowhere near dangerous , and nowhere near unpleasant , enough .
Civilization , I think , is possible only for deeply unpleasant animals . '
I would put the point rather differently .
Civilization is a way of coping with what that supremely great twentieth - century poet Wallace Stevens called ' the unalterable necessity of being this unalterable animal ' .
The dark side of the human animal is not wolf - like ; it is ape - like , and at its worst peculiarly human .
In other words , civilization is a defense erected by humanity not against bestiality , but against itself . "

Richard Demming wrote a short story called “ The Shape of Things That Came ” back in 1950 .
The story , set in 1900 , is about a writer who has traveled forward in time to 1950 and back again .
He tries to publish a story about the future technologies he has witnessed , but it ’s rejected — the editor says it ’s unbelievable because with so many advances in only fifty years , it ’s impossible that everyone could take them for granted .
I read this story for the first time just last year , and I had to wonder what a modern version of it would look like with all the advances in technology we ’ve seen since the fifties .
Just as in Demming ’s story , today we take even the most recently introduced gadgets as commonplace components of our lives .
Now TechRadar has published nine predictions for the future of computing over the next fifty years .
If I ’m still alive in 2059 , it would be interesting to compare how closely reality follows these prognostications .
I ’m guessing that they ’re pretty far off the mark , given the history of such predictions and the accelerating pace of technology .
Even looking forward five years into the future is getting pretty dicey , never mind fifty .
For instance , take the predictions about photonics .
This is a technology that already exists .
Is it realistic to think that no better alternative will be developed in fifty years ?
And will it really take that long for computing to reach zettascale ?
Will advances in display , storage , speech , and touch be only refinements on what we already have ?
Think of all the innovations in computing over the last fifty years and then tell me we ca n’t do any better than that .
But the one that really got my goatee is the ninth and last point : “ Being a geek wo n’t matter ” , because everyone will possess geek powers .
A commenter named “ matrixdweller ” captured my reaction precisely :
Making the assumption that everyone will be geeks would be like saying , back in the early 20th century , that everyone would be an auto mechanic since automobiles would proliferate to a great extent .
The more concise conclusion would be that everyone would know how to drive .
Sure the technical know how of the average person will far exceed that of the average person today .
Similarly on how each generation ’s technical know how is more advanced than the preceding generation ’s ( my parent ’s still ca n’t set their digital clocks ) .
There will always be those that have a more advanced comprehension of a subject than the general population .
Of course there will be geeks — they just wo n’t be working on problems that will have already been solved for fifty years .
Instead they ’ll be exploring new technologies that have n’t even been dreamt of yet .
Long live geeks !
In spite of the fact that virtualization has officially been hot for well over two years , it 's still fairly new to many businesses .
Indeed , if the number and regularity of threads in the Ars forums discussing first - time virtualization deployments is any indication , there are plenty of businesses in categories ranging from SMB all the way up to the enterprise that are still just getting started with virtualization .
And again , if the Ars forums are any indication , many first - time virtualization deployers are learning many of the same lessons .
So would n't it be great , we thought , if we could distill the collective wisdom of regulars in The Server Room , our forum dedicated to servers and datacenters , into an article that could help others avoid common pitfalls and blunders in virtualization deployments ?
To this end , we started a thread entitled , " Biggest mistake you ( or someone else ) has made in a virtualization deployment ? "
We had quite a few responses , many of which centered around a common set of basic themes .
This article boils down that discussion into a set of six steps that everyone considering a virtualization deployment should follow if they want to avoid the most common pitfalls .
Step 1 : Make sure virtualization is right for you
Not everybody needs to run out and virtualize just because it 's the thing to do .
So before sinking money and effort into going down the virtualized server path , be 100 percent sure you know all of the reasons why it 's a good fit for your business .
User Zeebee writes :
You virtualize to consolidate hardware , to potentially lower costs , and for resiliency and for disaster recovery ...
Some people , unfortunately , try to follow trends for the sake of keeping current , rather than actually looking at what they need .
If you 're jumping on the virtualization bandwagon just to jump on it , then odds are higher that you do n't have a real plan , or even the right overall approach , and you 're therefore more likely to fall into some of the pitfalls below and actually end up with your datacenter in worse shape than if you had just left it alone .
Step 2 : Start with the understanding that virtualization is n't a " project , " but a new way of doing things from here on
More than one user stressed that a virtualization deployment is not an " IT project , " with a fixed time horizon , budget , final deliverables , and so on .
Rather , a virtualization rollout marks the beginning of a fundamental shift in how your datacenter operates .
murph182 went into some detail on this point , and his detailed case for this enterprise - wide mindset shift is worth reading in full :
Much like you have to make a lifestyle change instead of simply " going on a diet " if you want to lose weight and keep it off , you ca n't just " implement virtualization . "
It 's a completely new way of doing things , and it 's the way you 're going to be doing things for some time to come .
Yeah , there are stages to things but the overall effort does n't end , it just becomes the norm .
When it 's treated as a project instead of simply being the reality of your datacenter , [ then ] you do n't get full integration with all facets of your IT operation .
Other groups in your IT structure ( storage , network management , etc ) treat you as someone to provide resources to rather than as something to integrate their processes with .
Management treats it like any other project , to give or remove resources as they see fit .
And IT in general will treat it as something to pay attention to NOW , and then forget about as they move on to other projects .
If , instead , you implement virtualization as a way of life then you get greater buy - in from the various components of your IT organization .
The decision to implement better processes in all IT areas to support virtualization becomes easier , and the purchase of the appropriate tools to monitor and manage the environment becomes more likely .
One of the concrete effects of this mindset shift is that you 'll start to think about individual server instances differently , because every software component of a server build has to be evaluated in light of the fact that it will be replicated many times across your infrastructure .
User rogerd writes :
Think , for example , about a daemon that wakes up once an hour to check on something ( it does n't matter what ... ) .
Once an hour 's not much , right ?
Except you have 100 guests , so that 's once every 36 seconds , on average .
Still sound like a lightweight process ?
Still need to be in your standard build ?
Likewise a daemon that eats 100 MB of RAM , or blindly installing packages because you " might need to use gcc some time . "
Yeah , maybe you might .
Is it worth the storage you just ate ?
Ultimately , much of the advice in this article really boils down to a mindset shift , and many of the pitfalls outlined below stem from IT departments and other stakeholders who are simply thinking about virtualized resources in the wrong way .
Step 3 : Find the right people , make sure they have thorough , product - specific training .
( But do n't train anybody and everybody . )
A number of users stressed the damage that uninformed and / or untrained people , both inside and outside your IT department , can have on a virtualization deployment .
So it pays to ensure that the people directly involved in the project are n't just enthusiastic bandwagon jumpers who want in on a hot datacenter trend , but that they 're really well - trained on the specifics of the products that you 're using .
Otherwise , promises get made that can't be delivered on .
And on the flip side , one user takes things a step further and advocates that you do n't train non-admin stakeholders at all , on the theory that a little virtualization knowledge will just make key decision - makers dangerous .
murph182 warns :
In my experience there simply is NO happy medium when it comes to training people on virtualization topics .
Admins need to really know what they 're doing or they [ screw ] things up or , worse , give out information that is completely and utterly wrong ... [ And for ] anyone who is not a designated admin on your virtualization platform , do n't bother training them at all .
In fact , if you can get away with it do n't tell them that a server is a VM ...
I 've gotten screwed more times than I can count by people making decisions based on their flawed understanding of how things work , and then having to completely redesign a project to reflect reality .
I really believe that these management - level decision makers think that they understand it enough to not involve me in the decision making process , and it 's just caused nothing but trouble .
The ones who do n't know [ anything ] get me involved far earlier and those projects tend to go a lot more smoothly .
So make sure that the people involved in the project have as much training as they need or just keep them out of things entirely .
Step 4 : Put policies in place to prevent VM sprawl
One of the most commonly cited virtualization pitfalls in the forum discussion was the problem of VM sprawl , wherein the number of virtual machines balloons unnecessarily , taxing both compute and human resources .
User neilhwatson writes , " With this population explosion comes the over head of administration .
Most organizations do not use sophisticated configuration management services resulting in a time deficit and neglected hosts . "

Most people recognize the value of a fire drill .
Adults and children alike recognize the usual fire drill steps include evacuating the building and reaching a pre-designated spot .
What most people do not recognize is that a fire drill is really an emergency evacuation plan and emergency evacuation plans are growing to include drills such as an influenza pandemic event .
The Houston Federal Executive Board sponsored such a drill , April 14 - 15 .
The Interagency Continuity Influenza Pandemic Tabletop Exercise was as an opportunity for federal , state , and local emergency coordinators to discuss how their agencies would manage during a pandemic event .
“ My goal since 9 - 11 is to facilitate the preparedness of federal agencies in the Houston area by providing emergency training opportunities , ” said Houston Federal Executive Board Director Michael Mason .
“ Every class we offer , we open it to state and local agencies where the emergency managers can create partnerships during the training rather than during an emergency . ”
The training , provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency , was interactive requiring attendees to break into small groups to discuss the scenario and the current procedures their agency used to manage an emergency .
Group members discussed what certain procedures should be implemented at varying stages and why other procedures could wait .
“ A primary focus of this exercise identified the operational impact an agency faces when 30 to 40 percent of their personnel are unable to come to work , ” said Chief Jeremy Luczkowski , U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
“ Developing plans to deal with Pandemic - specific issues is challenging for an agency that deals directly with the public on a daily basis . ”

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama 's flight into exile .
With this anniversary , there have been renewed calls for Tibetan autonomy throughout the world , and a correspondingly harsh response by China 's military within Tibet .
In the UK Times , this profile of a Tibetan exile based in Canada named Thubten Samdup , who heads an online outreach program that seeks to counter anti-Tibetan sentiment in Chinese language message boards and chat rooms .
Snip :
In a simple office overlooking the Himalayan foothills of India a young Tibetan man sits at a computer , trying to succeed where the Dalai Lama has failed for 50 years – by talking to the Chinese .
Every day , Sonam and ten other Tibetans – all fluent in Mandarin – surf social networking sites in search of Chinese people to talk to about their homeland .
It can be painstaking work .
" Hi , want to chat ? " Sonam , 32 , asks one man from Beijing .
" You male or female ? " comes the reply .
" Male . "
" Not interested . "
Like this one , many of the millions of Chinese in chat rooms are searching for love .
Most do not want to talk politics .
Some become abusive when they realise they are talking to Tibetan exiles .
Sonam contacts about fifty or so people every day and says that half are willing to chat and five or six want to talk in depth .
He now has 200 " old friends " to whom he sends information on the Dalai Lama to circumvent China 's " Great Firewall " , which blocks websites about the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader .
" We do n't say this is right or wrong , or that the Chinese Government should be overthrown , " Sonam told The Times .
" We just give people an alternative source of information . "
The aim of the project is bold : to change attitudes towards Tibet among ordinary Chinese in the hope that they will gradually shape Beijing 's policies .
Sonam and his colleagues can talk to only a tiny fraction of China 's 300 million netizens – who are notoriously nationalistic .
Arguably it offers better prospects , and more immediate results , than the failed negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama , who fled to India 50 years ago yesterday .

Nope , nothing sketchy about this .

The PediSedate was designed for dentists , allowing them to distract kids with video games while they were drugged in prep for oral surgery .
But hey , why limit it to dentists ?
You could use this to sedate children for any number of reasons !
And with a name like PediSedate , you get all sorts of great ideas right off the bat .
I 'm so surprised this never caught on .

Considering the anarchist cinema of the 21st century
Since anarchism is a notoriously difficult term to define , it should not be surprising that the concept of " anarchist cinema " is equally elusive .
Just as internecine conflicts between anarcho - syndicalists , anarcho - individualists , and anarcho - communists complicate efforts to reduce anarchism to a monolithic ideology , there is no consensus as to whether anarchist filmmaking is more a literal - minded matter of content ( e.g. documentaries on anti-authoritarian activism or biopics on heroic figures from the past like " anarchist martyrs " Sacco and Vanzetti or Buenaventura Durruti ) or an idiosyncratic style ( e.g. the bold lyricism of avant - gardists like Jean Vigo ) .
Even Stuart Christie , the well - known British anarchist writer , activist , and avid movie enthusiast , confessed to The Guardian that some films made and produced by anarchists are often " very boring indeed . "
Curiously enough , nearly a decade into the 21st century , caricatures of anarchist violence in popular culture mirror misconceptions that prevailed a hundred years ago .
In 1908 , when President Theodore Roosevelt railed against the anarchist peril , the yellow press excoriated the anti-authoritarian left as nothing more than foreign vermin .
This paranoid era provides a partial backdrop for Aleksandar Hemon ’s recent novel The Lazarus Project ; the journalist - hero , who investigates the still - notorious case of the 1908 murder of a Jewish immigrant , and apparent anarchist , by the Chicago chief of police , looks back at those benighted times and proclaims that the 20th century " war against anarchism was much like the current war on terror — funny how old habits never die . "
Hemon ’s protagonist cites an early - 20th - century editorial cartoon " depicting an outraged Statue of Liberty kicking a cage full of degenerate , dark - faced anarchists bloodthirstily clutching knives and bombs . "
In the wake of 9/11 and the ongoing " war on terror , " an implicit conflation of the longstanding revulsion toward anarchists , and more recent antipathies toward real and imagined terrorist threats , has come to the fore .
Many reviews of Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight referred to Heath Ledger 's Joker as an " anarchist , " even though this character , who blithely threatens large swaths of the population with annihilation , is merely branded an " agent of chaos " within the film .
From a more complex , albeit muddled , point of view , another comic book film , James McTeigue 's V for Vendetta ( 2005 ) , blends the anarchist perspective of Alan Moore ( who wrote the " graphic novel " that inspired the film ; illustrations were provided by David Lloyd ) and a jaundiced post - 9/11 critical orientation .
A commentary on the Thatcherite 1980s , Moore ’s dystopian fantasy fleshes out the legacy of Thatcher ’s repressive regime .
Ubiquitous closed - circuit TV cameras ( which in fact became pervasive in Blair and Brown ’s Britain ) are here emblematic of a neo - fascist mania for total surveillance that evokes both Orwell and the excesses of MI5 .
McTeigue ’s well - intentioned adaptation angered Moore because he believed that the filmmakers ' decision to impose post - 9/11 concerns onto his narrative transformed Vendetta 's anarchist impetus into a more palatably mainstream liberal movie .
In Moore 's vision , V. , the altruistic rebel in a Guy Fawkes mask , explicitly evokes the anarchist tradition of " propaganda by the deed " — a precept associated with solitary acts of terrorism in the popular imagination but actually linked by serious 19th - century proponents like Errico Malatesta to concerted efforts to foment social revolution .
While Moore even lends V. some dialogue paraphrased from an early , pre-anarchist Bakunin tract in which the creative impulse is inextricable from the destructive urge , McTeigue 's film is less anchored in the anti-authoritarian tradition but instead takes Moore ’s premise as a departure point to flog a laundry list of standard left - liberal demands .
Although Moore and the a for anarchy website , which led the anarchist charge in the U.S. against the Hollywood adaptation , presumably share the contempt of McTeigue and screenwriters Andy and Larry Wachowski for the Patriot Act and homophobia , they were less entranced with the film 's propensity to use an incendiary allegory from another era for ends that were deemed either murky or merely reformist .
For these critics , the film ’s culminating event , the bombing of the Houses of Parliament , resides in an ahistorical void .
From a much different vantage point , Lewis Call , writing in the academic journal Anarchist Studies , hails McTeigue 's film for its exemplary advocacy of " postmodern anarchism " and terms the destruction of Parliament ( " a curiously minor event in the Moore / Lloyd comic " ) a salutary critique of the " excesses of state power . "
To a certain extent , the disparity between Moore ’s hostility to the film version and Call ’s " postmodern " enthusiasm comes down to whether one insists , with purist intransigence , that Hollywood inevitably co-opts radical aspirations or that " if we use consumer capitalism to critique capitalism we are only making use of the practical use of the existing instruments in order to transcend the existing order of things — a very anarchist proposition . "
Even though anti-globalization protests at the 1999 convocation of the World Trade Organization in Seattle brought the new anarchist activism to the attention of Americans during the early post - Cold War era , popular culture proved reticent and has only recently registered a response , albeit a feeble one , to these events .
While excellent documentaries such as This Is What Democracy Looks Like ( Jill Friedberg and Rick Rowley , 2000 ) provided comprehensive analyses of the WTO events , Stuart Townsend ’s conspicuously earnest Battle in Seattle ( 2007 ) attempted to explain the intricacies of anti-corporate protest to a wider audience .
Unfortunately , although Townsend cites The Battle of Algiers and Medium Cool as influences , his film , as critics pointed out , frequently resembles a slightly more enlightened version of Paul Haggis 's Crash .
As in Haggisland , a grab bag of strangers collides and endures privation while learning prefabricated life lessons .
Although the travails of a harried liberal mayor ( based loosely on former Seattle mayor Paul Schell ) , a world - weary NGO representative , and a cop who regrets pummeling a protester need not concern us , the depiction of the activists , particularly a feisty anarchist named Lou ( played with requisite amounts of anger and spunk by Michelle Rodriguez ) , provides ample evidence of the paradoxes that emerge when anti-authoritarian politics becomes fodder for mainstream entertainment .
Despite being a passionate advocate of direct action , Lou—perhaps in the interest of spurious " balance " — is preoccupied with condemning the supposedly violent tendencies of her fellow anarchists .
Lou is clearly referencing the activities of the " Black Bloc " and apparently believes that this group ’s most famous " transgression " — the smashing of Starbucks windows — renders it hopelessly violent and irresponsible .
But as the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber observes , " Journalists have a fairly idiosyncratic definition of ' violence ' . . . so , if even one protester damages a Starbucks window , one can speak of ' violent protests , ' but if police then proceed to attack everyone present with tazers , sticks , and plastic bullets , this can not be described as violent . "
And as a group of anarchists wrote in an anonymous broadside against Townsend 's film , an entire swath of anti-hierarchical protest , which includes grassroots groups like " Food Not Bombs , " is overlooked in Battle in Seattle .
Townsend is , alas , more interested in gooey humanist uplift than the nuts and bolts of direct action .
A BBC documentary that never mentions anarchism — Adam Curtis 's The Trap : What Happened to Our Dreams of Freedom ( 2007 ) — struck a much more resonant note with many anarchists than Townsend ’s tepid docudrama .
Since words such as freedom and individuality are cherished by the extreme right as well as the left , Curtis 's playful polemic , interlaced with interviews and archival footage , endeavors to prove that , during the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1980s , the regimes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher hijacked the concepts of freedom and individualism in order to implement authoritarian goals .
Embedded in Curtis 's ingenious linkages among seemingly disparate thinkers — game theorist and economist John Nash ; R.D. Laing , the '60s guru of anti-psychiatry ; and Sir Isaiah Berlin , the patrician proponent of " negative liberty " — is an assumption that an alarmingly limited brand of freedom that views human nature as intrinsically selfish gained ascendancy under conservative governments during the 1980s and reached its zenith during the ostensibly " liberal " 1990s regimes of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair .
For anarchists , the obvious implication is that " the trap " of neoliberalism recapitulates the " possessive individualism " of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke that triumphed over the proto- anarchist " communal individuality " espoused by 17th - century radical utopians such as Gerrard Winstanley .
If The Trap might be deemed almost unwittingly anarchist , recent documentaries adhering to an explicitly anti-authoritarian stance reflect a DIY aesthetic than is frequently indivisibly tied to activist goals .
In " Videotaping a New World , " an article that will appear this spring in Arena : On Anarchist Cinema , an anthology I edited , Andrew Hedden considers the efforts of grassroots anarchist video collectives to provide an " alternative form of journalism . "
Just as some of the earliest examples of anarchist video — e.g.
Clayton Patterson 's 1988 Tompkins Square Park Riot , which chronicled police malfeasance during a peaceful protest in New York 's East Village — fused ethnography and activism , groups such as the Argentinean Grupo Alavio and A - films , a Middle Eastern collective , both document and participate in local struggles .
Cop Watch L.A. , on the other hand , goes well beyond the role of media watchdog and demonstrates how the line separating filmmaking and direct action can be permanently effaced .
Armed with video and cell phone cameras , Cop Watch L.A. brigades monitor police harassment of poor and minority communities in Los Angeles .
While outside the realm of art usually assessed by film critics and historians , what Richard Modiano labels a burgeoning " cinematic record of police transgression " also performs an archival function for our era that parallels the aspirations of participant - observers like the journalist Henry Mayhew and the photographer - muckraker Jacob Riis in the 19th and 20th centuries .
Even as unimpeachably earnest anarchist nonfiction thrives , a new film , Benoît Delépine and Gustave Kervern 's Louise - Michel ( which screened at Sundance and Rotterdam last month ) , reinvents anti-authoritarian rage with deadpan gallows humor .
The two protagonists ' first names invoke the memory of Louise Michel , the anarchist heroine of the Paris Commune of 1871 , in ways that will understandably disconcert many earnest anarchists .
When the mildly retarded Louise ( Yolande Moreau ) discovers that she and her colleagues are suddenly out of work after a duplicitous boss abandons their factory , she urges her comrades to hire a hit man to kill the hated culprit .
The contract killer turns out to be Michel ( Bouli Lanners ) , a hopeless bungler who leads Louise on a wacky wild goose chase through France and Belgium until their prey is finally discovered relaxing in Jersey , a notorious tax haven in the Channel Islands .
A film that dispatches clownish and inept anti-heroes to wreak havoc on boorish capitalists involves tricky narrative and political strategies .
But as buffoonish as Louise and Michel might be , Delépine and Kervern are undeniably fond of this hapless duo ; in a recent interview with Cineuropa , Kervern insists that these marginal characters touch him and his co-director " more than the company bosses and middle - classes , or the literary and artistic circles , who are usually the focus of French films . "
In addition , as the journalist Fabien Lemercier maintains , Louise and Michel 's vertiginous quest is almost impossible to disentangle from the peculiar depersonalization wrought by corporate globalization .
While a villainous boss in the 19th century would not have strayed from his local estate , contemporary plutocrats , with no visible national allegiances , are free to wander the globe .
In the film 's most comically transgressive sequence , the ungainly pair simulate the destruction of the World Trade Center with the aid of a scale model , an act that functions as both an absurdist exorcism of this international trauma and an irreverent act that thumbs its nose at mainstream — and anarchist — respectability .
An accusation that ’s often leveled against atheists is that we lack charitable impulses , that faith - based organizations do the hard work of caring for the needy and atheism only promotes selfishness .
This is a hateful slur , and to counter it , I ’ve discussed outstanding acts of charity by individual atheists in the past .
Evidence like this shows that , as a group , we do not lack compassion .
On the contrary , we know that this life is the only one we ’ll ever have , which gives us the strongest possible motive to improve the welfare of our fellow human beings in the here and now .
Another rejoinder to this accusation is that , if there ’s any discrepancy between atheist and religious charitable works , it ’s because many theists donate to explicitly religious organizations , making their contributions highly visible and easy to tally up , whereas atheists generally just give to secular charities and feel less need to advertise their acts of philanthropy as specifically arising from their atheism .
But while this is true , it feels unsatisfying .
It would be better if there were a way to count just those contributions made by atheists , so we could present definite evidence of how we measure up .
Well , I ’m happy to report that such a way has come to my attention .
This evidence comes by way of Kiva , a philanthropic organization that helps impoverished communities in developing nations .
Kiva does good through “ microfinance ” , a strategy which consists of making small loans , typically $ 1000 or less , to local entrepreneurs who use the money to launch or expand a business .
These business plans can be as simple as buying livestock , so that rural farmers can add meat , milk , eggs or skins to their marketable commodities ; or they can go toward the purchase of tools or machines so local people can start a machine shop or a clothing store .
( Another microfinance organization you may have heard of is Bangladesh ’s Grameen Bank , whose founder , Mohammed Yunus , won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work . )
When intelligently targeted , microfinance can help impoverished communities break the cycle of poverty and become self - sufficient .
On Kiva , anyone can sign up to be a lender and give to entrepreneurs listed on the site .
If they ’re asking for more than one person can give , multiple lenders can join together to fully fund a proposal .
If the business plan is successful , your seed money is repaid .
Kiva has already loaned out over $ 24 million and claims a default rate of just 2.2 % .
What does this have to do with atheism ?
Only this :
Kiva ’s volunteers can join together into lending teams , keeping track of the total amounts that everyone on a team has given out .
And when you view all the teams , the largest – with the most members , the largest number of loans , and the largest total amount of money loaned – is a team named “ Atheists , Agnostics , Skeptics , Freethinkers , Secular Humanists and the Non-Religious “ , with over 3,000 members and over $ 300,000 loaned so far .
This is a potent counterexample to any claim that atheists lack concern for the common good .
( This was originally posted by 2 [ Y ] and came to my attention via Lynet , who submitted it to the next Humanist Symposium .
I hate to steal the host ’s thunder , but this was too good to not report on sooner ! )
This is a great achievement , but we can do better .
I ’ve joined Kiva and become a member of the atheists ’ lending team .
With my first donation , I ’ve supplied the last piece to fully fund a loan request from a grocery store owner in Tajikistan .
Kiva makes the process easy : donations can be as small as $ 25 , and there ’s a reasonable expectation that your money will be repaid .
If you ’re a nonbeliever who cares about the welfare of the world , join me there and let ’s do some good !
This post offers a kind of reverse engineering of what numbers could be behind the long and detailed IEA decline analysis in their last report ( 2008 IEA WEO ) .
A tentative decline structure for the post - peak Super - Giant and Giants oilfields is offered as well as a possible scenario for future production .
The conclusions are :
The IEA based its analysis of decline rates on a database of 780 world largest oil fields among which 580 are past their peak production .
Fields where categorized according to their size ( Super- giants > 5 Gb , Giants > 1.5 Gb and Large ) and decline intensity .
Three phases are considered for the decline :
Phase 1 : field is in a production plateau above 85 % of peak annual production .
Phase 2 : field is past plateau and above 50 % of peak production .
Phase 3 : production is below 50 % of peak production .
Decline rate averages are computed for each size and decline category which give the following table :
Decline Phase 1 Decline Phase 2 Decline Phase 3 Total Super - Giants 0.8 %
3.0 %
4.9 %
3.4 %
Giants 3.0 %
3.7 %
7.6 %
6.5 %
Large 5.5 %
7.2 %
11.8 %
10.4 % World 1.4 % 3.6 % 6.7 % 5.1 %
Table I. Decline rate structure according toe the IEA for the Top 580 oil fields in decline .
In addition , the following information is given for the 580 fields dataset :
The production - weighted average annual observed for 2007 is decline rate is 5.1 % ( table above ) .
They have a total initial reserves of 1,241 Giga - barrels , 101 are in a production plateau , 117 in decline phase 2 , 362 in decline phase 3 .
The total production was 40.5 mbpd in 2007 or 58 % of 2007 production .
( 5.1 * 40.5 + x * 10.4 ) / ( 40.5 + x ) = 6.7 %
x
x= ( 6.7 * 40.5 - 5.1 * 40.5 ) / ( 10.4 - 6.7 ) = 17.5 mbpd
( 6.7 * 58 + ( 81 - 58 ) * y ) / 81.0 = 4.35 %
y= ( 4.35 * 81 - 6.7 * 58 ) / ( 81 - 58 ) = - 1.58 %
A Detailed View of the Decline Structure
The point 3 above leads to 40.5 / 0.58 = 69.8 mbpd for 2007 production ( in comparison the EIA gives 73.0 mbpd for crude oil + condensate so I guess they are not considering 3.2 mbpd of condensates and unconventional oil ) .
Even if this oil field subset covers 58 % of the oil production , some large fields are missing from this 580 fields sample and are contributing to the resource base decline .
They extrapolated the global decline rate bt assuming that the missing fields are large and smaller fields so they must decline at least as fast as the population of large fields above ( i.e. 10.4 % ) which results in a total decline rate of 6.7 % .
They are using a production - weighted average so the calculation is the followingwhereis the unknown production from small fields not in the 580 fields database with the following valuewhich means that 40.5 + 17.5= 58 mbpd of 69.8 mbpd are coming from post - peak fields ( i.e. 83.0 % ) .
Note that if 69.8 mbpd is the total production considered for 2007 , then 69.8 - 58 = 11.8 mbpd must come from fields that are not in decline .
On their final forecast , they implicitly assumed a decline rate around 4.35 % ( see post here ) which means that taking 81.0 mbpd for C+C+NGL in 2007 ( EIA ) : or : which means that 23 mbpd of crude oil +
NGL that is not post peak must grow at least by 1.58 % in order to get a global 4.35 % decline for total production .
That seems reasonable .
On table I , average decline rates are given for each category .
Unfortunately , the amounts used for the various production - weighted averages are not given .
I propose an estimation of the 3x3 production matrix P behind the decline rates using the following constraints :
P must give the same average decline rates per decline phase or by size category .
In all , it gives 8 equations .
The total production is equal to 40.5 mbpd .
From the list of top 20 oil fields ( 20 of the 45 known super - giants ) , we know that at least 1 field is in decline phase 1 ( Ghawar ) , 9 are in decline phase 2 ( for a total production of 7.747 mbpd in 2007 ) and 5 in decline phase 3 ( or 3.505 mbpd ) .

With a cumulative production of around 600 Gb in 2007 , it is likely that we have reached a kind of production plateau

Tb , production from pre-2007 fields ( light green ) is assuming that those fields are entering production plateau in 2007 .
A Sum of Exponentials is not an Exponential
Uisng a standard linear programming algorithm , it converges toward this solution ( the residual error on the decline rates was around 0.2 % ) : Figures 1 and 2 below are summarizing the database structure that the IEA may have considered .
Production from the super - giant and giant fields is the cornerstone of modern oil production .
In the top 20 , 16 of them are in decline .
Using IEA decline rates ( Table I ) , we get the following production profile for the top 16 in decline :
We can substitute more realistic decline scenarios for Ghawar and Cantarell ( see posts here and here ) : The official Ultimate Recoverable Resource for the super - giants and giants is around 1.306
Tb , looking at a logistic projection we get an URR around 1.181
Tb with the official number being in the upper range .
What I mean by that is the equivalent decline rate for a sum of exponentials is not the average of the individual decline rates .
The resulting curve from a sum of exponentials is not necessarely an exponential with a constant decline rate .

Post - peak components of the resource base decline with field - by - field modeling for the top 16 fields .
Figure 11 .
Decline rates for the declining portion of the resource base estimated from Figures 9 and 10 .
However , the figure above offers a static view of the decline rate .
Field in phase 1 will go in Phase 2 as soon as they pass the 85 % threshold and then in Phase 3 as they go below 50 % of peak production .
The resulting total decline rate has a complex behavior as shown on Figure 6 , it accelerates for a few years before declining toward 4 % .
Interestingly , the asymptotic value for the blue curve is 4.35 % which is exactly the value used by the IEA for their forecast
The apparent decline rate peak in 2010 can be understood by looking at the relative contribution of each component to the total .
We can see the small field component decline will have more weight at first .

Potential Decline for the resource base using pre-2007 ( inclusive ) megaprojects from the Wikipedia database .
The thick red line is the implicit decline ( 4.35 % / year ) used by the IEA .
Because the Wikipedia megaproject database collect mainly projects that have been sanctioned ( i.e. financially approved ) and press release are available , we can reasonably assume that the difference with the IEA new supply additions is the unsanctioned project portion .
In addition , the green area is a coarse estimation of total new supply additions ( including Yet - To - be - Found ) that could come from the SG / G category , we can assume that the difference with the Wikipedia and IEA forecasts is due to contributions from Large fields and YTF .

Figure 14 .
Production scenario based on the Wikipedia megaproject database for sanctioned project , the difference with the IEA new supply is supposed to come from unsanctioned projects ( in orange ) .
There is a portion of YTF in the large / small fields category that is not included and could add a few mbpd by 2030 ( see here for a discussion ) .
Reserve growth is also not included but it`s a long term and diffuse supply addition .
Some growth in production from small fields is not included ( no data available ) .
It is hard to predict growth in the not - in - decline portion of SG / G fields , my assumption ( point 2 above ) is probably too pessimistic .
Past this point , we will get even more speculative so bear with me .
Figure 11 shows so project contributions from the Wikipedia database Strangely , if we use the pre-2007 portion of the Wikipedia database , it fills exactly the gap between the 2007 production level and the total amount in decline ( 69.8 mbpd ) .
However , the resulting decline profile is far more bleak than the one used by the IEA for their final oil production forecast Based on this decline profile and the logistic modeling for the SG / G category shown on Figure we can make an attempt to fill in the gap .
I make the following 2 bold assumptions : Below is a possible scenario formed by stacking together the following components :
Some important caveats :
Enlarge By David Coates , The Detroit News , via AP
In Detroit , three downtown businesses have created a local currency , or scrip , to keep dollars earned locally in the community .
A small but growing number of cash - strapped communities are printing their own money .
Borrowing from a Depression - era idea , they are aiming to help consumers make ends meet and support struggling local businesses .
The systems generally work like this : Businesses and individuals form a network to print currency .
Shoppers buy it at a discount — say , 95 cents for $ 1 value — and spend the full value at stores that accept the currency .
VIDEO : Scrip :
It 's all the rage Workers with dwindling wages are paying for groceries , yoga classes and fuel with Detroit Cheers , Ithaca Hours in New York , Plenty in North Carolina or BerkShares in Massachusetts .
Ed Collom , a University of Southern Maine sociologist who has studied local currencies , says they encourage people to buy locally .
Merchants , hurting because customers have cut back on spending , benefit as consumers spend the local cash .
" We wanted to make new options available , " says Jackie Smith of South Bend , Ind. , who is working to launch a local currency .
" It reinforces the message that having more control of the economy in local hands can help you cushion yourself from the blows of the marketplace . "
About a dozen communities have local currencies , says Susan Witt , founder of BerkShares in the Berkshires region of western Massachusetts .
She expects more to do it .
Under the BerkShares system , a buyer goes to one of 12 banks and pays $ 95 for $ 100 worth of BerkShares , which can be spent in 370 local businesses .
Since its start in 2006 , the system , the largest of its kind in the country , has circulated $ 2.3 million worth of BerkShares .
In Detroit , three business owners are printing $ 4,500 worth of Detroit Cheers , which they are handing out to customers to spend in one of 12 shops .
During the Depression , local governments , businesses and individuals issued currency , known as scrip , to keep commerce flowing when bank closings led to a cash shortage .
By law , local money may not resemble federal bills or be promoted as legal tender of the United States , says Claudia Dickens of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing .
" We print the real thing , " she says .
The IRS gets its share .
When someone pays for goods or services with local money , the income to the business is taxable , says Tom Ochsenschlager of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants .
" It 's not a way to avoid income taxes , or we 'd all be paying in Detroit dollars , " he says .
Pittsboro , N.C. , is reviving the Plenty , a defunct local currency created in 2002 .
It is being printed in denominations of $ 1 , $ 5 , $ 20 and $ 50 .
A local bank will exchange $ 9 for $ 10 worth of Plenty .
" We 're a wiped - out small town in America , " says Lyle Estill , president of Piedmont Biofuels , which accepts the Plenty .
" This will strengthen the local economy .
...
The nice thing about the Plenty is that it can't leave here . "

Gentleman of the night Mick Mercer is just about to have a comprehensive tome on the goth genre published - Music To Die For .
So who better to introduce this ( entirely subjective ) top thirty ?
Zombina photo : Nikki Jones
In choosing a Top 30 I have gone back to day one , and forward right up to tonight , as these days you even get indie bands claiming to be goth !
This music is now seen as having real dignity and credibility , because it exists for its own enjoyment and is the only genuinely underground movement in the world .
No wonder everyone wants in !
So , in this chart you get a whole cross-section .
If you want more of this , as I write daily online , or to find out what else I have on offer , visit me here : Mick 's Myspace .
1. DANSE SOCIETY ' No Shame In Death ' ( 1981 12- inch - Pax PAX 2 )
Perhaps the biggest under-achievers in the bigger league ( being lumbered with Arista ) , Danse Society were a magnificently dark commercial band , caught at their most desolate , distant best on this rare record .
Atmospheric , stylish and driven , it ’s everything Goth should be .
2. ATARAXIA ' Bonthrop ' ( 1998 Orlando CDEP - Prikosnovenie PRIK 021 )
My favourite modern band , Ataraxia feature the remarkable vocalist Francesca Nicoli , who can sing in various languages and veer between different styles , as can the band ; often sleekly modern with macabre touches , or authentic Renaissance replicants performing in medieval locations .
This song is a hypnotic piece which is breathtakingly simple yet ominous and sombre in tone .
They have a myspace group here .
3. SEX GANG CHILDREN ' Mauritia Mayer ' ( 1983 7 - inch - Clay CLAY27 )
The most artistic of the early Goth bands , and utterly unpredictable , the ‘ difficult ’
Sex Gang sound foxed many , but here they positively romp , with sexy piano in tow – and Andi Sex Gang still makes fantastic records today .
4. BAUHAUS ' Dark Entries ' ( 1980 7 - inch - 4AD AD3 / BEG37 )
I ’m sure everyone expects ‘ Bela Lugosi ’ , which is a standard , but this one ’s more vibrant and almost splintering under its own desire to be energetic .
Words spew out and remind you of how stunning they were live .
5. UK DECAY ' Testament ' ( 1982 12- inch ‘ Rising From The Dread ’ - CORPUS CHRISTI , CHRIST ITS 1 )
Never before was so much owed by so many bands to so few .
UK Decay galvanised the developing Goth scene and are rightly regarded as the primal force at the beginning .
This comes from their weightiest 12 - inch and surges with power .
This year they ’ve finally got their first CD out , and maybe their only album will be re-released ?
6. DANCING DID ' The Haunted Tea Rooms ' ( 1980 7 - inch - Fruit & Veg F&V 002 )
Included for a laugh really , as there is much about goth that is amusing .
“ King Charles slept here , or so they say , ” Tim Harrison warbles happily .
“ Tudor tea spoons , take it away . . . ” and there is a spoon solo !
They had serious dark overtones and lyrics that were half Dickens , half Peake , from a strictly English perspective .
Quality all the way through , with a well deserved compilation out soon on Cherry Red .
I collect live tapes , so if you have any of them please get in touch and there is a myspace group here .
7. THEATRE OF HATE ' Nero ' ( 1982 12- inch - Burning Rome BRR1931 )
Where post - punk headed towards that first goth phase there you would find Theatre Of Hate , bare - boned and roaring nastily , in an inspirational fashion .
This is their most piercing song , constructed in a way no other band at the time was capable of .
8. XMAL DEUTSCHLAND ' Schwarz Welt ' ( 1981 7 - inch - Zick Zack ZZ31 )
We are not alone - that ’s what we got from this .
In America Christian Death were top dogs , and on the continent Xmal did the girl power thing with a single so noisy it puts virtually every record before or since to absolute shame .
Later they went more for vocal drone , with keyboard wash and stony , stormy rhythms , but this record is just vicious .
I hear they ’re reforming , which is exciting news .
9. ALIEN SEX FIEND ' R.I.P. ' b/w ' New Christian Music ' ( 1984 12- inch - Anagram 12ANA18 )
Kitsch but provocative , with superb lyrics , Alien Sex Fiend flushed themselves out of the Batcave and into your life with a slew of great records in the 80s .
I loved this best for the b-side , but any of their storming , ranting pop Goth pre-Techno meltdowns are fun .
Well ahead of their time .
10 . KABUKI 'I Am A Horse ' ( 1982 7 - inch - Kabaret Noir Kab 1 )
They became Ausgang after this and kept releasing fantastic records , but I like the sheer joy you can hear in these grooves , with their precociously jumpy rhythmical onslaught and charismatic vocals .
11 . BELFEGORE ' All That I Wanted ' ( 1984 12- inch - Elektra ED 5030 )
A monster of a record and maybe a decade or so ahead of its time compared to the Electro - Industrial hoo - ha of today .
A pile - driving sound with superb vocals , and a shame the band split up so soon after getting a major deal .
They should have been huge .
12 . FIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM ' Preacher Man ' b/w ' Laura ' ( 1987 7 - inch - Situation 2 SIT46 )
A unique band , and the most creative of the major label goth bands in the 80s , the Neffs do n’t get the credit they deserve .
A world within a world , with a dense , rich sound and vocals black as ink .
This is their most accessible record , with the equally endearing ‘ Laura ’ on the flip .
13 . MISSION ' Wasteland ' ( 1987 7 - inch - Mercury MYTH 2 )
Very traditional rock , but seriously impressive , this finds
The Mish at their most supremely confident and fluid with a beast of a chorus .
14 . SPECIMEN ' Beauty Of Poisin ' ( 1983 7 - inch - London Batcave LON40 )
Although mainly known for the Batcave and seen as lightweight fluff musically , Specimen had great songs , and this slinky little number punches above its weight .
It ’s a disgrace they never get the credit they deserve .
A new album will be with us shortly !
15 . ZERO LE CRECHE ' Last Year ’s Wife ' ( 1984 12- inch - Flicknife FLS 029 )
Should have been as big as Bauhaus .
They too had their own look and their own sound , with unusually short songs and slender tones blended well .
Warmly romantic themes ; chilled , spectral sounds .
The singer left , mystifyingly early .
16 . BFG ' Higher Than Heaven ' ( 1987 12- inch - BMG ATT003 )
All their records are good , but this indie / goth single has the best melody and ought to be part of a staple goth diet .
It ’s gorgeously catchy .
Now reformed and recording a new album .
17 . CREAMING JESUS 'A Forest ' ( 1990 12 - inch ‘ Bark ’ EP - Jungle JUNG53T )
Many may wonder where The Cure , Banshees , Joy Division and Damned are in this Goth chart ?
Well , put simply , bands are defined by their audience [ No they are n't , Ed ] and none of these bands ever had a majority goth crowd [ That 's debatable .
Did the Mission for instance ?
Ed ] .
None of these bands were goth bands [ Utter tripe .
The first three were .
Ed ]
They may have had similarities , they may have inspired many goths , but that is n’t the same thing .
Creaming Jesus , a wonderfully loutish goth band with pre-grunge sensibilities , do a magnificent cover of the Cure enigma , giving it a rougher power but maintaining the same lost feeling .
( Andy now fronts the wonderful Giant Paw . )
18 . NAUGHTY ZOMBIES ' Posesion Zombie ' ( 2006 7 - inch - Blondes Must Die BMD 002 )
A frantic , gargling punk take on dark matter .
Brilliantly noisy and wholly impudent adventures , because no - one is noisier nowadays than these wild boys and girl .
Goth meets
Punk meets Horror meets modern noise storms .
Spain ’s gain is our loss .
19 . HISTORY OF GUNS ' Your Obedient Servant ' ( 2004 CDEP ‘ Whitby Promo ’ – Liquid Len LENCD09FOC )
Imagine this decade spawning a cross between Alien Sex Fiend and Public Image Limited , then leaving it locked in a pub for months on end and emerging as unruly punk .
They ’re brilliant .
20 . ACTION DIRECTE '60 Million Guns ' ( 2006 CD OKTCD11 )
Spluttering dark rage .
Industrial Punk in many respects , but also like a buzzsaw alien in the clubbier side of Goth .
Straight to the heart of the matter , with a rare political axe to grind .
21 . ALL ABOUT EVE ' December ' ( 1989 7 - inch - Mercury EVEN 11 )
Dopey bastards that they were , they drifted from post - punk roots into a hippy folk cul - de-sac for a while , then veered back to bleaker indie surrounds .
Through it all are many wonderful melodies and this song nudged the capering ’ Our Summer ’ out in my affections for this chart .
A curiously dry , but sumptuous song .
22 . IKON ' Rome ' ( 2005 CD - Equinoxe EQ019 )
I could have gone with ‘ Psychic Vampire ’ but this is doomier .
From their epic Destroying The World album .
Like an austere modern version of the Mission , but Australian .
[ Christ almighty !
Ed ]
23 . ZOMBINA & THE SKELETONES ' Counting On Your Suicide ' ( 2005 CDEP Mondo Zombina ! Ectoplastic ECT02 )
More post - punk / goth crossover here , but with a real understanding of pop , and silkier rhythmical nuances , which they certainly pour into this song .
It ’s from the Stacis Stasis EP , which went from salsa to New Orleans booze - drenched hellbeat .
Check them out here .
24 . FAITHFUL DAWN ‘I Am Nothing ’ ( 1998 CD - Darkbeat DBCD003 )
Had the UK been more Goth - aware in the 90s this band could have been big , with their melodic Goth bounding over dance soundtracks .
Poppy and bruised , they had a fine sound , but audiences were small back then and major labels clueless .
25 . SOLEMN NOVENA ' As Darkness Falls ' ( 2007 CD - Own Label )
A fine example of a modern band reflecting a desire in Goth to reclaim territory lost to anaemic clubbier fare .
Lots of attitude but humour too , with two excellent singers , so picture a cross between the Eves and March Violets and you ’re sort of there .
26 . RAZORBLADE KISSES ' Ballerina ' ( 2004 CD - Own Label )
Yes , they look like Strawberry Switchblade , but there ’s a subtly poetic , decadent sound here , with wilting violin and shuffling vocal waves .
Cunning stuff .
27 . QUIDAM ' Horrores ' ( 2004 CDEP - Pagan Love Songs Promo )
Tinkling nightmares with mean , slinky guitar and capricious vocals , that ’s what .
Deathrock came back a couple of years ago when the younger goths found that 80s sounds inspired them more than the 90s and now .
Suddenly energy was back and sounds became more varied and turbulent as bands formed without worrying they ’d sound amateurish .
This Spanish band push you to the edge .
28 . THE CULT ' Spiritwalker ' ( 1984 7 - inch - Situation 2 SIT 33 )
Before they got hairy and complacent [ What the fuck ?!
Ed ] , The Cult released some striking records and this was one of their best .
How can you not love it ?
29 . RITUAL ' Mind Disease ' ( 1982 7 - inch - Red Flame RF712 ) Raw and bellicose , Ritual had tribal energy with a wounded saxophone , blasting everything in sight .
I hope their ‘ Songs For Dead Kings ’ demo may yet have an album release ?
That stuff is treasure trove .
30 . GLORIA MUNDI ' Glory Of The World / Nothing To Say ' ( 1978 7 - inch - RCA PB5118 ) I often prefer their ‘ Fight Back ’ single , but Gloria Mundi , in retrospect , were the first goth band ( with the same following who turned up at all early proto - goth gigs ) .
Theatrical , dark , harder - hitting than most punk bands , shrill before Sex Gang , doomy before all of them .
It sounds weedy at times , almost twee , but it ‘s steeped in melodrama and clandestine charm .
More from Mick Mercer all this week .
Pre -order his top new book Music To Die For here .
The failed bankers on Wall Street have been whining that if they have to cut bonuses and salaries dramatically , they 'll be unable to recruit great talent , and they need great talent to fix the situation .
And for years , boards have been claiming that they need to pay CEOs $ 50,000,000 salaries in order to recruit the very best for their companies .
Jamie Dimon at Chase said , " It 's possible someone 's going to walk in my office and say , Jamie , I have a family .
I ca n't afford to live that way . "
This , of course , is nonsense .
After a million dollars or so in salary , the absolute amount that a person is paid has no real impact on their life .
They can't eat more meals in a day or wear more shoes .
What matters to the manager is the relative amount .
How much more would I make over there ?
Why does that company pay its CEO more than my company pays me ?
( Aside : should the guys who drive an armored car that carries millions of dollars in bonds get paid more than the guys that drive an armored car that only carries thousands of dollars in cash ?
Does the amount of money handled change the difficult of the work ? )
Twenty years ago , financial industry salaries were a tiny fraction of what they are today .
Did lesser people do the work ?
Did they try less hard ?
Think smaller thoughts ?
Of course not .
The reasons salaries are high is that the number is a signaling mechanism , a very expensive marketing campaign .
Law firms went through this cycle twenty years ago .
The top firms competed with each other to recruit a too - small pool of talent from the top law schools .
Unable to muster up even a mite of marketing insight , they chose to compete on only one axis : salary .
So , 24 year olds were given jobs at $ 120,000 a year , when their peers from college were making 20 % of that .
The firms could have found great people at half the price , except that with only one axis , they had to be at the top if their peers were .
If you were a law student , the choice was easy .
Either you got a job at a firm that proved its worth by paying a lot or you did n't .
You did n't have to know anything about the firm , apparently , other than the fact that they were top tier , and the way you knew that was because they paid a lot .
Hence the current situation with CEOs and bankers .
There 's no real effort made to market the jobs , just to race to the top ( or the bottom , depending on your point of view ) with the easiest marketing signal of all .
Price .
Yes , it 's exactly the same as a retailer trying to improve business by being the cheapest .
In addition to this being a huge (! ) waste of money , it 's also provably false as an accurate portrayal of what 's necessary to recruit .
For every great job at Goldman Sachs , there are still 1,000 totally qualified applicants waiting for that job .
So , when demand is high and supply is low , the power goes to the supplier .
Lower the salary until you get just a few qualified applicants , right ?
This moment in our economic cycle is a great opportunity for shareholders and taxpayers to let the organizations we own and support know that wasting money on this sort of marketing is silly .
Just as an industry - wide gas standard would have actually helped Detroit twenty years ago , an industry - wide tax and trade salary cap will actually help these organizations .
They 'll be forced to recruit with useful marketing techniques ( I 'd rather work at an innovative , fast - moving , respectful company , given the choice … so the companies would have to make a better ' product , ' not just pay a lot as a result of financial engineering ) .
[ I think performance pay is great , risk should be rewarded and stock options are just fine .
I also think it 's fine for risk - takers and skilled pros to make a ton of money .
I 'm mostly talking about guaranteed bonuses which are n't bonuses at all , just a bribe to sign on and stay on . ]
Sometimes markets get stuck because there is a disconnect between what something costs and what you get .
It costs the individuals on the board of a public company nothing to pay more , they get bragging rights and a CEO who is focused on money .
And that works until the next board leapfrogs them .
The boards themselves should be lobbying to end this practice , but they wo n't because … guess what … the folks on the boards are the CEOs of other companies .
It 's stuck .
If you are a relentless free market believer , more power to you .
If your company is private , pay yourself a trillion dollars a year , fine with me .
In fact , we need more private companies that innovate and pay their staff a ton .
But if you 're owned by shareholders or bailed out by taxpayers , wasting trillions of dollars because you do n't have the guts to market your jobs properly is silly .
Whereas Hamas locates elements of its terrorist infrastructure in civilian population centers , thus using innocent civilians as human shields ;
Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement on December 27 , 2008 , that `[w ] e strongly condemn the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hold Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the renewal of violence there ' ;
Whereas , on December 27 , 2008 , Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert said , `For approximately seven years , hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens in the south have been suffering from missiles being fired at them .
. . .
In such a situation we had no alternative but to respond .
We do not rejoice in battle but neither will we be deterred from it .
. . .
The operation in the Gaza Strip is designed , first and foremost , to bring about an improvement in the security reality for the residents of the south of the country . ' ;
Whereas , on January 2 , 2009 , Secretary of State Rice stated that `Hamas has held the people of Gaza hostage ever since their illegal coup against the forces of President Mahmoud Abbas , the legitimate President of the Palestinian people .
Hamas has used Gaza as a launching pad for rockets against Israeli cities and has contributed deeply to a very bad daily life for the Palestinian people in Gaza , and to a humanitarian situation that we have all been trying to address ' ;
Whereas the humanitarian situation in Gaza , including shortages of food , water , electricity , and adequate medical care , is becoming more acute ;
Whereas Israel has facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza with over 500 trucks and numerous ambulances entering the Gaza Strip since December 26 , 2008 ;
Whereas , on January 2 , 2009 , Secretary of State Rice stated that it was `Hamas that rejected the Egyptian and Arab calls for an extension of the tahadiya that Egypt had negotiated ' and that the United States was `working toward a cease - fire that would not allow a reestablishment of the status quo ante where Hamas can continue to launch rockets out of Gaza .
It is obvious that that cease - fire should take place as soon as possible , but we need a cease - fire that is durable and sustainable ' ; and
Whereas the ultimate goal of the United States is a sustainable resolution of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict that will allow for a viable and independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel , which will not be possible as long as Israeli civilians are under threat from within Gaza : Now , therefore , be it
Resolved , That the Senate --
(1 ) expresses vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare , security , and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders , and recognizes its right to act in self - defense to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism ;
( 2 ) reiterates that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel , recognize Israel 's right to exist , renounce violence , and agree to accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians ;
( 3 ) encourages the President to work actively to support a durable , enforceable , and sustainable cease - fire in Gaza , as soon as possible , that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and mortars against Israel and allows for the long term improvement of daily living conditions for the ordinary people of Gaza ;
( 4 ) believes strongly that the lives of innocent civilians must be protected and all appropriate measures should be taken to diminish civilian casualties and that all involved should continue to work to address humanitarian needs in Gaza ;
( 5 ) supports and encourages efforts to diminish the appeal and influence of extremists in the Palestinian territories and to strengthen moderate Palestinians who are committed to a secure and lasting peace with Israel ; and
( 6 ) reiterates its strong support for United States Government efforts to promote a just resolution of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict through a serious and sustained peace process that leads to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside a secure State of Israel .

We already mentioned that CDS spreads at Berkshire Hathaway are blowing through the roof on fear that it'll lose its AAA rating , resulting in a host of calamities .
So what exactly is the market telling us ?
Felix Salmon plugs in the numbers :
There 's another way of looking at Berkshire Hathaway , however , and that 's through the lens of its credit default swaps , which are now trading at a whopping 535 bp -- pricing in a probability of default which is much greater than one would ever expect from a triple - A company with barely more debt than cash .
If you take those numbers seriously , then maybe the market is n't valuing Buffett at zero .
Remember that historically Berkshire Hathaway has traded on a price - to - book ratio of about 2 : if you gave Buffett $ 100 , and he spent that $ 100 on shares of American Express or Coca - Cola , then the market would value those shares , as owned by Warren Buffett , at $ 200 .
On the other hand , if you plug in a 60 % recovery value , the market is saying that there 's a 13 % chance that Berkshire Hathaway is going to default at some point in the next five years .
( A handy formula for you : the default probability is the CDS spread divided by 1 - R , where R is the recovery value . )
If Berkshire defaults , the equity will be worth zero .
Of course , as Felix notes , the CDS market could be overdoing things on both Berkshire ( and GE , which is suffering from similar default fears ) .
And we suspect that if it gets so bad that Berkshire goes bankrupt , there probably wo n't be anyone else left standing , either .

Park is the second largest urban park in Canada , and is contained entirely within the city of Calgary on the south side .
It used to span the width of the city , but the city has since sprawled around it .
On bicycle , I can reach the park boundaries in just over an hour .
I ’ve been making the trip regularly since last summer , and can do so by staying mostly on paved pathways away from cars .
This park is a key part of several 100 kilometre bike rides that I ’ve done .
It ’s now time to share some of my favourite photos !

More startling still was the abrupt about - face of the Rev. Rick Warren , the hugely popular megachurch leader whose endorsement last year of Proposition 8 , California ’s same - sex marriage ban , had roiled his appearance at the Obama inaugural .
Warren also dropped in on Larry King to declare that he had “ never ” been and “ never will be ” an “ anti- gay - marriage activist . ”
This was an unmistakable slap at the National Organization for Marriage , which lavished far more money on Proposition 8 than even James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family .
The Obamas ’ dog had longer legs on cable than the news from Iowa and Vermont .
CNN ’s weekly press critique , “ Reliable Sources , ” inquired why .
The gay blogger John Aravosis suggested that many Americans are more worried about their mortgages than their neighbors ’ private lives .
Besides , Aravosis said , there are “ only so many news stories you can do showing guys in tuxes . ”
As the polls attest , the majority of Americans who support civil unions for gay couples has been steadily growing .
Younger voters are fine with marriage .
Generational changeover will seal the deal .
Crunching all the numbers , the poll maven Nate Silver sees same - sex marriage achieving majority support “ at some point in the 2010s . ”
Iowa and Vermont were the tipping point because they struck down the right ’s two major arguments against marriage equality .
The unanimous ruling of the seven - member Iowa Supreme Court proved that the issue is not merely a bicoastal fad .
The decision , written by Mark Cady , a Republican appointee , was particularly articulate in explaining that a state ’s legalization of same - sex marriage has no effect on marriage as practiced by religions .
“ The only difference , ” the judge wrote , is that “ civil marriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete understanding of equal protection of the law . ”

Some opponents grumbled anyway , reviving their perennial complaint , dating back to Brown v. Board of Education , about activist judges .
But the judiciary has long played a leading role in sticking up for the civil rights of minorities so they ’re not held hostage to a majority vote .
Even if the judiciary - overreach argument had merit , it was still moot in Vermont , where the State Legislature , not a court , voted to make same - sex marriage legal and then voted to override the Republican governor ’s veto .
As the case against equal rights for gay families gets harder and harder to argue on any nonreligious or legal grounds , no wonder so many conservatives are dropping the cause .
And if Fox News and Rick Warren wo n’t lead the charge on same - sex marriage , who on the national stage will take their place ?
The only enthusiastic contenders seem to be Republicans contemplating presidential runs in 2012 .
As Rich Tafel , the former president of the gay Log Cabin Republicans , pointed out to me last week , what Iowa giveth to the Democrats , Iowa taketh away from his own party .
As the first stop in the primary process , the Iowa caucuses provided a crucial boost to Barack Obama ’s victorious and inclusive Democratic campaign in 2008 .
But on the G.O.P. side , the caucuses tilt toward the exclusionary hard right .
The estranged couple seek to " maintain the privacy and integrity " of their family
Mel Gibson ’s wife of nearly 30 years , Robyn Moore , has filed for divorce , PEOPLE has confirmed .
The couple released the following statement Monday : “ Throughout our marriage and separation we have always strived to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Moore , 53 , citing irreconcilable differences , is seeking joint physical and legal custody over their minor child , Thomas , 9 , according to court papers .
She is also seeking spousal support and attorney ’s fees , and is asking the court to deny her husband any spousal support .
Just weeks after Time ‘s Joe Klein declared “ legalizing marijuana makes sense , ” the magazine is once again extolling the virtues of liberalizing cannabis prohibition .
Writing in the Sunday edition of Time.com , author ( and frequent media critic ) Maia Szalavitz asks , “ Drugs in Portugal : Did Decriminalization Work ? ”
Citing statistics from researcher ( and frequent Salon.com blogger ) Glenn Greenwald , Szalavitz reports that Portugal abolished all criminal penalties regarding the use and possession of cannabis ( and other drugs ) earlier this decade — opting instead to treat drug use strictly as a health problem .
So what happened ?
“ Judging by every metric , decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding success , ” says Glenn Greenwald . …
“ It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better than virtually every other Western country does . ”
( NORML Note : You can listen to audio comments from Greenwald on the NORML Daily Audio Stash here . )
Compared to the European Union and the U.S. , Portugal ’s drug use numbers are impressive .
Following decriminalization , Portugal had the lowest rate of lifetime marijuana use in people over 15 in the E.U. : 10 % .
The most comparable figure in America is in people over 12 : 39.8 % .
Proportionally , more Americans have used cocaine than Portuguese have used marijuana .
Writing on his own blog , Greenwald comments on the significance of his findings , as well as the fact that they are finally being recognized by the mainstream media .
Few political orthodoxies have more of a destructive impact than our approach to drug policy .
Our harsh criminalization framework results in the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of American citizens , breaks up families , burns tens of billions of dollars every year , erodes civil liberties , turns our police forces into para- military units , and spawns massive levels of violence and criminality — all while exacerbating the very harms it seeks to address .
If a measured , rational debate over America ’s extremist drug policies can take place in Time Magazine , then it can take place anywhere . “
Of course , to those who reflexively demand that we maintain pot prohibition , the very suggestion that eliminating ( or softening ) criminal penalties will not lead to an exponential explosion in use ( much less be associated with a potential decline in drug use ) is an anathema .
Writing in the drug prevention and treatment newsletter Join Together , Jim Gogek offers the same tired allegations : facts be damned !
Legal marijuana would mean more access to marijuana .
The number of marijuana users would spike , including teens .
Problems related to marijuana use would spike . …
Right now , there are 127 million alcohol users and 14 million marijuana users in this country – because one is legal and the other is n’t .
But , most alcohol users do n’t get intoxicated .
…
With marijuana , you get intoxicated every time you use it .
That ’s the whole point . …
It severely hurts your ability to perform at school and work .
It saps initiative and drive .
It increases confusion .
In other words , it makes you stupid .
… Marijuana is the loser drug :
That ’s the big problem with it .
To their credit , the editors at Join Together have allowed me the opportunity to rebut Mr. Gogek ’s claims , which I do here .
Feel free to join the discussion .

The sum of RPS coverage of Spelunky : a single news post mentioning that it existed and was pretty good , maybe .
Secret fact :
If you read that post very slowly and in a totally silent room you can actually hear the sound of Kieron phoning it in .
The closest thing to hyperbole in the post is him calling Spelunky ‘ clever and neat ’ , which is analogous to calling sliced bread , uh , sliced , or saying that war is bad .
I mean , what I ’m saying is that the man ’s an asshole .
You dropped the ball , Kieron !
The ball is currently rolling away from you !
There it goes , rolling through the door to the old people ’s home !
You ’d better chase it !
[ We should mention that Kieron now promises to grotesquely murder Quinns analogs in his forthcoming comics – RPS ]
[ Is there even an artist alive capable of putting that much handsomeness on a page ?
– Quinns ]
Here ’s the flashbulb , 1+1 =highscore truth :
In the dwindling field of PC games that have not yet and will not ever show up on a console , which is to say in the field of PC exclusives , Spelunky is … well it ’s my game of 2008 .
So go play it !
A couple of months ago I said I ’d write something about Spelunky for RPS and got as far as writing , uh , maybe 50 % of … something .
I had pretty big plans for it , plans I ’ve completely forgotten since and so now have like a thousand words of the most unbelievable nonsense in a Google Document .
Check this shit out :
104 deaths .

I barely register .
I ’m whipping a snake to death .
“ Oh , God .
I ca n’t even .
You know what ?
Fuck you guys ” says Obama .
“ Best of luck in 2009 .
I ’m outta here .
I quit . ”
And with that he turns on a dime , ice cool , popping the collar of his jacket before walking slowly away from the podium .
The audience falls into stunned silence .
Out of the perfect stillness that the would - be president leaves behind a single shot rings out , our expensive surround - sound system capturing the noise in perfect detail .
I look up briefly at the TV before returning my eyes to the game .
Did it hit ?
He seems fine .
Yeah , I ’ve got no idea .
So I guess I ’m starting from scratch .
Deep breath time !
Here ’s why , as a PC gamer , you should really know all about Spelunky :
Spelunky is a flawless marriage of two well established genres , okay ?
It ’s a frothing alchemical mix clutched in the calloused hand of a beaming mad scientist - the upsettingly talented Derek Yu .
This man operates TIGSource as well as illustrating , designing , coding and writing music for games that are his and his alone .
Spelunky is his attempt to take a platformer and blend it with the key elements of roguelikes - randomised levels , exploration , and a permanent need for caution due to the constant risk of brutal death that ’ll dump you right back to the start of the game .
I say Spelunky is an attempt - Spelunky ’s not notable because it ’s just some experiment .
Spelunky is notable because it ’s a / brilliant idea / that , for whatever reason , exploded into the head of Derek Yu ( maybe he took a trip to a cave that day or ate a particularly unforgiving sandwich ) and he was just the kind of multi-talented , single - minded savant to not rest until he had that idea physically represented in front of him in the form of a freely distributed videogame .
Honest to God , this guy is the videogame industry ’s own Richard Miller .
As to why Spelunky is actually good … okay .
First and foremost , it ’s a tight platformer .
The premise is as perfect as you like .
In the opening cutscene you see a lone adventurer arrive at a cave following a long trek through the desert .
The fact that he ’s alone and heavily equipped tells you everything you need to know - that he ’s come here to explore the cave .
When control is transferred to you there ’s no need for the game to say another word .
There ’s also an instant attraction formed between the player and the character on screen both because there ’s the underdog pull of this figure being so tiny and alone yet so determined looking and the emotional bond of neither of you knowing what ’s inside the cave .
Your avatar controls perfectly for the challenges the game sets in front of him , the jumping , climbing , fighting or some combination of the three .
The speed available to you and the fact that there ’s like , 10 whole buttons to memorise means a lot of people dismissed Spelunky as fiddly ( probably pronouncing it “ fuddluh ” because at the time their mouth was full of very unhealthy foodstuffs ) .
Spelunky is n’t fiddly .
A decent player will have that sprite doing what he wants to the pixel every single time .
What Spelunky ’s controls are is manic and precise .
The speed that ’s available to you , that run key that causes you to dash across the screen like a man possessed , is simply an option you have at all times .
So with the fact that Spelunky ’s a neat platformer in mind let ’s start looking at why Spelunky is absolutely not just some neat platformer thankyouverymuch , starting with level randomisation .
The randomisation in Spelunky is vitally important for the exact same reasons it ’s important in roguelikes .
These are games about exploration , and a player ca n’t explore a space he ’s seen before .
An equally important part of the randomisation is that when it ’s done well , like it is here , it eliminates most of the negative emotions of being dumped back to the start of the game with each death .
There ’s none of the Megaman style horror of having to play through all that crap again ?!
When you die in Spelunky you do n’t have to retrace any steps , you ’re not punished , you simply lose what you ’d achieved which ( just like in the best Roguelikes and arcade games ) will always manage to get off the screen and right under your skin , and it ’s horrible , and you ’ll scream , and the world will stop turning for a second and your mother will ask you if you ’ve done your homework and you seriously have n’t .
But all of this happens with a minimum of frustration or annoyance .
Because it ’s you and only you who fucked up , there is no resentment .
Once the dust settles the only thing left is a gnawing desire to kick the game ’s ass right back .
This is real knife - edge game design , the kind of risky business for renegade mavericks that we ’re seeing less and less of in the mainstream .
You can draw any player further into your game by giving them something they can actually lose ( an item , an NPC , or in the case of roguelikes absolutely everything ) , but you need to make sure the player feels like it ’s their fault when they do inevitably lose what ’s at stake .
To safely give the player the emotional high that comes from succeeding when something tangible they care about is on the table , the tornado of emotional pain that bursts into life when the player does fail needs to be focused entirely inward - the player needs to be angry with themselves with minimal splashback on the game .
The way Spelunky achieves this is simple .
First of all , it makes you achingly vulnerable .
In most contemporary games you can fail .
In plenty of those you can die .
Spelunky ’s a little bit different .
Spelunky is a game that just fucking murders you .
In the first world alone you have to watch for spikes , snakes , bats , arrows , spiders , boulders , GIANT spiders , ghosts , bombs , skeletons and traps , all of which will silence the game ’s soundtrack and dump you to a high score screen if you so much as dare to fuck up .
Most awesomely for a game about travelling ever - downwards , there ’s also falling damage .
Derek
Yu even pulls the dick move of coupling falling damage with you being knocked unconscious for a few seconds , your wheezing body a beacon to any roving creatures you happened to fall near .
But here ’s the thing .
Not one of these individual elements is that hard to deal with .
Move slowly and traps do n’t get you .
Time your whippage right and you ’ll vapourize most monsters .
Jump to get over the spikes .
Approach corpses slowly and if they leap up as skeletons you ’ll be out of their attack range .
If any of these obstacles ever get you , and they will get you , it ’s because you were dumb and so the rage gets focused inward .
The game ’s lack of a big ol ’ health bar is just as important - if you could take a lot of damage and keep going then when death finally came around you ’d be left with a greasy taste in your mouth that it was the game ’s difficulty , and not any one error on your part , that killed you .
Another interesting pose Spelunky strikes is the wealth of equipment and options it gives you .
As well as your default whip attack you start with a limited number of ropes that can be thrown upwards and climbed , and a few bombs which can be either thrown or dropped in the name of killing , destroying or digging .
You can actually throw just about everything in the game - rocks , corpses , chests .
Then there ’s all the gear you can stumble across - the pickaxe , jetpack , climbing gloves , pitching mitt , shotgun , teleporter , web gun , jumping shoes , machete , glasses , glue and much more .
But the thing about all this crap is all it does is gives you alternative means of interacting with a world that ’s still unbelievably dangerous .
All of this equipment is yet more elements to Spelunky that follow very clear rules and are n’t that dangerous unto themselves , yet are painstakingly designed to give you the opportunity to fuck up .
Take the machete , a bonus item you can stumble across .
The first thing I did when I got it was go sneaking up to a spider the size of a minivan that was sleeping right next to a ledge I quite wanted to drop down .
My plan was to cut that thing to ribbons before it could wake up , which it turns out was a flawed plan because the machete is / balls . /
What followed was the scariest chase sequence I ’ve ever experienced in a game before I was finally left staring open - mouthed at a screen showing this spider jumping up and down on my corpse .
My friend had an even better experience with the teleporter .
Following an experimental trip shifting himself up into some open air he began zapping himself about in blind glee .
The world was his for the taking !
Not even walls could stop him !
Ten seconds later he ’d misjudged a jump and fused himself with the insides of a rock .
And while we ’re on the subject I remember the moment I first realised you can set off traps with thrown objects .
I saw an arrow - shooting face in the distance and , pleased as punch , threw my pistol past it to trigger the arrow .
Yeah !
What I neglected to notice was the snake pit just past the trap , although I did spot it just in time to watch my pistol disappear into it .
Anyway , so far so videogame .
Now think this one through .
You ’re Derek Yu .
You ’ve just built a tight , randomised platformer with tons of freedom and plenty of juicy secrets that ’s ridiculously tense and engaging through player vulnerability and the harsh penalty for death .
The game ’s tough but fair since the only causes of player death are idiocy , ambition , encountering something for the first time and just plain fucking up .
So riddle me this :
What ’s the move you can now pull to make your game addictive , satisfying and rewarding ?
What ’s the move you can pull of to make the whole thing a rounded , desirable package ?
No idea ?
It ’s so simple !
You litter levels with treasure and structure the whole thing around a high score .
That way the player knows exactly how well he ’s done at the end of each damp - armpitted playthrough , but most importantly it makes the entire game , a game that ’s fundamentally about caution , reliant on risk - reward .
Buried gems , protected idols , locked chests and loose gold nuggets all scream out at you as you make your way through levels where the only way to survive is to play it safe .
Spelunky is like walking a tightrope with notes of money suspended by string on either side of you .
A tightrope with cute 2D graphics and a great soundtrack .
Okay , that should probably be enough to make you sit up and play this fucking game properly , which means I guess I ’m done .
Although I will say that there ’s so , so much I have n’t talked about for spoilers ’ sake .
I ’ve just noticed the Spelunky thread on the RPS forums is three posts long , which is a serious disgrace , with the saving grace that IncognitoGBG spends his post calling it one of the greatest achievements in the platform genre .
Still , three damn posts .
Fix this !
Start comparing high scores and dumb deaths .
Somebody cause a scandal by saying they ’ve finished the game when they actually have n’t , or something .
I ’m going to make myself some coffee and then continue playing Resident Evil 5 co-op with my flatmate .
Hey , did you know Resident Evil 5 is fucking terrible ?
It is !
It really , really is .
It ’s like Capcom hand - picked the entire team out of employees they knew would n’t cross a street that ’s empty right up to the horizon until they were told to walk by the little green man .
It is at least as awful as Spelunky is good !
Go play Spelunky !
NASA 's new space station toilet , shown here , is a $ 19 million commode based on a Russian design .
NASA may consider putting Stephen Colbert 's name on aspace toilet , after the comedian came out on top of the U.S. space agency ' sonline naming poll for a new space module .
The eponymous host of " The Colbert Report " swept in as a dark - horsechallenger after urging viewers to enter his name through a write - inoption .
When voting ended March 20 , " Colbert " had amassed more than 230,000 votes to beat out second - place name " Serenity " by more than 40,000 votes .
" Come on , Serenity ? " Colbert said on his March10 show .
" That 's not a space module , that 's a Glade plug - in . "
The Node 3 module contains eight fridge - sized racks formany of the space station 's life support systems , such as the newspace toilet , as well as an observation deck that contains a work stationfor the International Space Station 's 57 - foot robotic arm .
It is currentlyslated for launch later this year to the space station .
Colbert pressed NASA 's human space flight chief , BillGerstenmaier , to name the space module after him during a show on March 10 .
ButGerstenmaier was noncommittal , saying only that the space agency would have to " thinkabout that " as the votes came in .
" That 's NASA 's problem , " Colbert said .
" You guys think too much . "
As it became clear that " Colbert " was likely towin the popular vote , NASA insiders told SPACE.com , agency personnelfloated the idea of naming the station ?s new toilet " Colbert . "
NASA spokesman John Yembrick said the Node 3 namingdecision would not be made until April and that the " highest voted names " were receiving the most consideration .
" As for the toilet rumor , we don?t want to flushaway any goodwill by announcing something before we are ready , " Yembricksaid .
The Node 3 naming contest attracted nearly 1.2 millionvotes , with other write - in suggestions also coming in strong . " Myyearbook " placed third behind " Serenity " with 147,637votes , while " Gaia " finished fourth at 114,427 .
NASA recently opened a new namingcontest for its Mars Science Laboratory rover on Monday , although nowrite - in option exists there .
But the U.S. space agency has expressed strong interestin incorporating public opinion , as evidenced by previous naming contests forthe Spirit and Opportunity rovers and the Harmony space station module .
Thatmeans " Colbert " fans may want to keep watch for the officialannouncement next month .
" We have n't decided on a name yet , but we 'recertainly not going to ignore more than 230,000 ' Colbert ' votes from thepublic , " Yembrick noted .

Last November , Dmitrijs Smirnovs , a young economics professor in this coastal university town , published an essay in a leading Latvian newspaper warning that the country was heading for a financial collapse to rival Iceland's .
Soon after , the secret police showed up at his home .
They held Mr. Smirnovs for two days .
The charge : spreading unrest and destabilizing Latvia 's financial and banking system .
" I said we are bankrupt .
I wrote that people should not have their money in banks , and they should not keep their money in Latvian lats , " Smirnovs recalls , sitting in his cold office , the heat turned off , he says , to save money .
" That was enough to have me detained .
They are still investigating me . "
Lawmakers here did not want to admit at first just how quickly Latvia 's fortunes have changed .
But a shrinking economy , rising unemployment , and a $ 7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund have changed that .
A new center - right government took the helm last week and hopes to steer this tiny Baltic nation of 2.3 million out of an economic emergency the European Union fears could soon destabilize the whole region .
At a summit in Brussels Thursday and Friday , the EU continued to debate whether to bail out cash - strapped Eastern Europe .
Latvia , once a poster child for financial success , is now a cautionary tale of breakneck capitalism that has taken it to the brink of a meltdown .
Latvia 's economy grew at a double - digit pace for years since it joined the EU in 2004 .
But it fell 10.5 percent year - on - year in the last quarter of 2008 .
The gross domestic product is expected to decrease another 12 percent this year .
Unemployment could reach 15 percent .
Housing prices , once a boon , are down 25 percent , according to Global Property Guide .
Lawmakers here are trying to minimize the kind of public panic seen last year in Iceland and , more recently , in Ireland , and have targeted those like Smirnovs whom they see as responsible for spreading it .
When Latvia pop star Valters Fridenbergs joked at a concert one night about bank runs , the secret police paid him a visit too .
" Devaluation [ of the economy ] is a very touchy subject here , " says Pauls Raudseps , an editor at Latvia 's most influential daily , Diena .
" This society is n't used to open discussions about these things . "
But public anger over the government 's handling of the economic crisis has been steadily mounting .
Late last year , the country 's biggest national bank , Parex , was nationalized and the government reached out to the IMF – a gesture that carried with it deeply unpopular cuts in social spending , including salary reductions of 15 percent across many services , and hastened the resignation of Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis last month .
There has been unrest : A 10,000 - strong rally in the capital , Riga , turned violent in January .
Last month , farmers blocked the main road to the capital to protest agriculture policy .
In Riga , the trendy cafes , multistory shopping malls , and sleek sushi restaurants belie what the ordinary Latvians say about the declining state of things .
Two years ago Mikhail Arutjunov moved to the capital from the coast , where he worked in the shipping industry .
He drives buses and taxis , but is thinking of going back .
" Life is n't so good here anymore , " Mr. Arutjunov says .
" Money was good back then , but now salaries are too low . "
Latvia 's problems are mirrored elsewhere in Eastern Europe .
The region is foundering not because of toxic mortgages , but because of huge account debts following years during which governments borrowed too much in an attempt to improve institutions and infrastructure ahead of EU membership .
Then , governments cashed in after joining the EU .
Foreign investment poured in , property values soared , housing markets boomed , and ordinary consumers found themselves with access to credit that was unthinkable during the dark days of communism .
" The government just went wild , " says Mr. Raudseps .
" They just went on a spending spree . "
The Baltic countries borrowed heavily in foreign currencies , mostly in the euro , which has devalued significantly since the start of the financial crisis .
And they kept their three currencies at a fixed exchange rate with the European single currency , eliminating the option of devaluing those currencies to help drive up exports .
" That was the one substantial flaw " in the fiscal policies of Latvia and the other Baltic countries , says Anders Aslund , a senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics .
" During their boom times , they imported inflation , imported too much short - term capital , and it has caused overheating in their economy , " he says .
Some of Latvia 's leading economists , particularly those who came of age in the early days of capitalism , are saying the only solution for Latvia is to let it collapse like Iceland and start over again when the IMF loan runs out this fall .
That may sound like risky advice , but Smirnovs says : " We need to change from wild capitalism to simple capitalism . "
Raudseps says the Latvian people are ready for a new government to lead the country through the crisis , and are resigned to some cutbacks .
" When does it end ?
That is creating a lot of tension .
People do n't really know how they are going to deal with it , " he says .

With his vast legal knowledge , experience and integrity , he will make an exceptional Attorney General
Once again , Sarah Palin 's common sense , taste , and sense of responsibility are , well , striking : " Who 's that ? " you may be asking , " And why should I care ? " Via Mudflats , we get the answer :
Tomorrow House Judiciary Committee will meet and take citizen testimony on the nomination of Wayne Anthony Ross to be our next Attorney General .
Leah Burton is on with CC , sharing her testimony regarding Wayne Anthony Ross .
She is a former citizen lobbyist who worked on behalf of families and children concerning child support , child custody , domestic violence , child abuse and sexual assault .
She discusses a meeting of the group DADS , being run by Wayne Anthony Ross , and what she heard .
Numerous comments were made that were appalling , not the least of which were remarks by Mr. Ross which included the following : “ If a guy ca n’t rape his wife … who ’s he gonna rape ? ” and “ There would n’t be an issue with domestic violence if women would learn to keep their mouths shut . ”
Other members made their own contributions such as , “ We have the right to discipline our wives and children without the interference of government in our lives ! ”
These comments were greeted with laughter and affirmative responses by the group .
Given the fact that they had referred to me in recent months as a “ femi- nazi ” , the comments I was witness to at this meeting , while abhorrent , were unfortunately not surprising .
This announcement by Governor Palin is a slap in the face to all single parents who have no choice but to rely upon the State Department of Law to support court orders for child support , as well as those persons who need the Department to enforce criminal laws against sexual assault and domestic violence .
Mr. Ross is the antithesis of the type of person that should be the Attorney General .
This has been clearly demonstrated by his own words and actions in public .
In closing , I am not alone in my assessment that anyone who condones , and contributes to that type of hateful and harmful discourse clearly does not have the judgment necessary to represent the people of the State of Alaska as their Attorney General .

The arguments for maintaining a major U.S. combat force in Iraq at least through 2011 , escalating U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and assuming a confrontational stance toward Iran appear to assume that the United States remains the dominant military power in the region .
But the pattern of recent history and current developments in the region has not supported that assumption .
Not only has the United States been unable to prevail over stubborn nationalist and sectarian forces determined to resist U.S. influence , but it has not been able to use its military supremacy to wage successful coercive diplomacy against Iran .
Furthermore , even the ability of the United States to maintain troops in Iraq and Afghanistan turns out to be dependent on regimes which are by no means aligned with the United States .
Six years ago , after the United States had removed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq , the U.S. appeared to be militarily dominant in the region .
Apart from its nearly 200,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States had surrounded Iran with a network of airbases scattered across the region from the Persian Gulf sheikdoms through Iraq and Afghanistan to the Central Asian republics of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan , along with aircraft on U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf .
Since 2003 , however , events in the region have dealt a series of blows to the assumption that the U.S. military presence in general and ground forces in particular confer real power in the region .
The first blow was the U.S. failure to subdue the Sunni insurgency in Iraq .
By mid-2005 , U.S. commanders in Iraq were admitting publicly that the U.S. military occupation was generating more resistance than it was eliminating .
The next blow was the Sunni - Shi ’a civil war in Baghdad in 2006 , which U.S. troops were unable to prevent or stop , even after the Bush “ surge ” of additional troops .
The “ cleansing ” of Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad by Shi’a militias with the tacit support of the government ended only after a large swath of Sunni neighborhoods in the capital had been taken over .
That fact contradicts the later boast by Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , that “ coalition forces ” had “ broken the cycle of sectarian violence in Iraq . ”
The decision by Sunni insurgents to cooperate with the U.S. military in 2006 and 2007 was not the result of U.S. military prowess but of their defeat at the hands of Shi’a militias and the realization that the Sunnis could not oppose three enemies ( the U.S. , the Shi’a militias and al Qaeda ) simultaneously .
It also enabled the Shi’a government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , which had close ties to Iran , to consolidate its power and to achieve a crucial degree of independence from the United States .
The George W. Bush administration and the U.S. military command continued to assume that it would be able to keep its Iraqi bases indefinitely .
In mid-2007 , Defense Secretary Robert Gates invoked the Korean model  a decades - long garrisoning of tens of thousands of U.S. troops  as the plan for Iraq .
But in July 2008 , the al - Maliki government began demanding that all U.S. troops leave the country by the end of 2010 .
After initially refusing to believe that the troop withdrawal demand was serious , the Bush administration was forced eventually to agree to withdraw all U.S. troops by the end of 2011 .
The evolution of Iraqi politics belies the popular narrative that Gen. David Petraeus miraculously rescued the U.S. war from a bad strategy and ultimately prevailed over U.S. “ enemies , ” including Iran .
In its conflict with Iran over its nuclear program , the Bush administration tried to intimidate Tehran by seizing Iranians in Iraq and wielding indirectly the threat of attack against its nuclear facilities .
But coercive diplomacy did not work , largely because Iran could credibly threaten to respond to a U.S. or Israeli attack with unconventional attacks against U.S. bases and troops  and possibly even warships  in the Persian Gulf region .
Meanwhile , in Afghanistan , where the United States had appeared to be in control from 2001 to 2005 , the Taliban and other insurgent groups have grown rapidly since then and become the de facto government in large parts of the Pashtun region of the country .
The U.S. military presence has been unable to slow the rise of the insurgents in those rural areas .
The most recent blow to the image of U.S. military dominance in the region has been the revelation that the United States lacks a reliable access route for supply of its troops in Afghanistan .
The U.S. military has long relied on the route through the Khyber Pass in Pakistan to transport about 80 percent of all supplies for Afghanistan .
But in 2008 , allies of the Taliban began disrupting the U.S. logistics route through the Khyber Pass so effectively that it could not longer be counted on to supply U.S. forces .
That meant that United States had to find another access route for supplying its troops in Afghanistan .
David Petraeus , the new CENTCOM commander , traveled to Central Asia to secure promises of a new route into Afghanistan from Russian ports overland to Kazakhstan and then through Uzbekistan to northern Afghanistan .
But this alternative scheme would rely on Russian cooperation , giving a rival for power in Central and Southwest Asia a veto power over U.S. military presence in the region .
The Kyrgyz president announced during a trip to Moscow in early February that he was ending the agreement on U.S. use of the air base at Manas .
That was a signal that Russia would cooperate with the U.S. military only insofar as it was consistent with Russian dominance in Central Asia .
Relying on Uzbekistan for transit of NATO supplies for Afghanistan was another highly tenuous feature of the Petraeus plan .
The Karimov regime , notorious for its abuse of human rights , faces an Islamist insurgency that could well disrupt supply routes through the country .
A much shorter and far more secure route into Afghanistan would be from the Iranian port of Chabahar through the Western Afghan city of Herat to the Ring Highway which serves all major Afghan cities .
NATO ’s top commander in Afghanistan said on Feb. 3 that NATO would “ not oppose ” bilateral deals with Iran for supplying troops through that country .
Significantly , the Pentagon has made contingency plans for the use of the Iranian route , according to one well - informed former U.S. official .
That suggests that the Russian - Central Asian route was regarded as far from certain .
On the other hand , the U.S. military is not likely to regard reliance on its regional rival for power in the Middle East as a solid basis for its military presence in Afghanistan .
Obama administration officials are still talking about Middle East policy as though the U.S. military presence has conferred decisive influence over developments in the region .
However , the events of the past six years have shown that to be a costly myth .
They have underlined a truth that few in Washington find palatable : geography and local sociopolitical dynamics have trumped U.S. military power  and are very likely continue to do so in the future .

Security screeners at two of the nation 's busiest airports failed to find fake bombs hidden on undercover agents posing as passengers in more than 60 % of tests last year , according to a classified report obtained by USA TODAY .
Screeners at Los Angeles International Airport missed about 75 % of simulated explosives and bomb parts that Transportation Security Administration testers hid under their clothes or in carry - on bags at checkpoints , the TSA report shows .
At Chicago O'Hare International Airport , screeners missed about 60 % of hidden bomb materials that were packed in everyday carry - ons — including toiletry kits , briefcases and CD players .
[ USA TODAY ]
The more I think about the above , the more inescapable the conclusion becomes .
Tests conducted using fake explosives demonstrated that the TSA security at the airport , for all its annoyance value , is unable to find most of the bombs being taken on board airplanes .
This leads us to a startling conclusion .
If just half the bombs out there can get past TSA , and no planes have exploded , then there ARE no bombs out there !
Let me put this another way .
Based on the recent tests , real terrorists have a better than 50/50 chance of taking down American passenger aircraft IF THEY TRY .
There have been no explosions , and more tellingly , no arrests at the gates of people with bombs .
Quod Erat Demonstradum , there are no terrorists out there trying to bomb our planes .
If there were , more than half of them would succeed .
Aside from the one event on September 11th that occurred just in time to justify Bush 's invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , there has been no real terrorist threat .
It ’s all a hoax , to make it look like we face a threat that only constant invasions of other countries ( which all happen to sit on top of vast oil reserves ) will save us from .

Through a study carried out at the Universities of La Laguna and Valencia , it has been verified that the brain distinguishes between vowels and consonants differently .
Neuronal mechanisms change when they are processed and , when it comes to lexical access ; both have a different status in our mind , thus contributing differently to this basic process of visual word recognition .
The group of researchers led by Manuel Carreiras wanted to research the neuronal bases of an activity involving daily cognition such as the processing of vowels and consonants .
Manuel Carreiras , who also acts as director of the new Basque Centre on Cognition Brain and Language ( BCBL ) , observed that conclusions from previous studies already suggested that consonants and vowels contribute differently to lexical access , something that this study wants to examine in detail .
During the new research , the researchers submitted 31 students from La Laguna ( 23 women and 8 men , all native speakers of Spanish who had no neurological or psychiatric problems ) to experimental situations that involved showing a word twice for only 50 milliseconds on its first appearance : the first relay of words were identical and followed the pattern " CHOCOLATE - CHOCOLATE " ; during the second , two consonants were removed on the first appearance and followed the pattern " CHO O LATE - CHOCOLATE " , and during the third , the same was done with two non-adjacent vowels , as in " CHO L TE - CHOCOLATE " .
" We chose 120 words of between seven and eleven letters that , on average , appeared 26 times per million in the Lexesp Spanish database " , Carreiras explains to SINC .
The participants were placed in a dark , soundproof cubicle to see the stimuli on a monitor .
There they were asked to press one of two buttons , " yes " or " no " to answer the following question : " Is this a legitimate Spanish word or not ? "
The scientists assessed the error percentages and response times .
Data were also recorded with an electroencephalogram , as well as eye movements and blinking .
The results of this approach show that omitting two letters within each word for 50 milliseconds also slowed down identification of the word , but even more important is the fact that this delay was greater when consonants were hidden rather than vowels .
For Carreiras and his team , there is " an alternative vision regarding the differences observed between consonants and vowels " , which is related to frequency .
" Vowels tend to be more frequent than consonants " .
In most languages there are more consonants , but vowels are more frequent , which opens the door to the debate of whether consonant - vowel status is more important than the frequency of the letter in question .
Computerized Spanish lexicon ( Lexesp )
Lexesp - corco is a database of Spanish words made up of two parts .
In the first , a collection of sloganized words is used as the database , which allows for searches to be made of appearances and co-appearances of words , slogans , and categories of words , within a given context .
In the second , lists of previously indexed words are used for the creation of studies that make it possible to search for word characteristics .
Ian Tomlinson lived and worked in the City of London
The police watchdog has said its chairman was wrong to say there was no CCTV footage of an alleged police assault at the G20 protests .
Ian Tomlinson , 47 , suffered a heart attack and died during the demonstrations on 1 April .
Witness footage apparently showed Mr Tomlinson was pushed over by a police officer shortly before his death .
Independent Police Complaints Commission chairman Nick Hardwick had said CCTV cameras were not in the area .
On Thursday , a day after the commission took over the inquiry , Mr Hardwick told Channel Four News there was no CCTV footage because there were no cameras in the location .
Ongoing work However , the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) has now said that although Mr Hardwick believed he was correct at the time , it now appeared there were cameras in the surrounding area .
From the outset it has been a main line of our inquiry to recover all CCTV from the Corporation of London and from all private premises in the area
IPCC spokesman " From the outset it has been a main line of our inquiry to recover all CCTV from the Corporation of London and from all private premises in the area , " said an IPCC spokesman .
" This work is ongoing and involves many hours of viewing and detailed analysis . "
The police officer filmed in the footage has been suspended after coming forward .
Investigators are currently viewing all CCTV images from the City of London and private premises nearby , the watchdog said .
It also renewed its appeal for more information from the public , including video footage .
The IPCC has also ordered a second post - mortem examination as parts of its inquiry into the incident .

Mr Chavez says Mr Obama is more intelligent than his predecessor Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he expects to send an ambassador back to Washington soon .
Mr Chavez expelled the US envoy to Caracas in September in " solidarity " with Bolivia .
The US reciprocated .
In response , the US state department says it " will now work " toward returning its ambassador to Venezuela .
The announcements came at a Summit of the Americas in Trinidad , where US President Barack Obama received a warm welcome from Latin American leaders .
Last September 's diplomatic dispute arose over an alleged US plot against Bolivian President Evo Morales .
Mr Chavez was a fierce critic of the United States under former President George W Bush , accusing Washington of plotting to assassinate him .
Book gift
But in a sign of warming ties , Mr Obama shook hands with President Chavez at the summit , and accepted a book from the Venezuelan leader .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Although they had already shaken hands when they met on Friday , Mr Chavez greeted him again on Saturday , this time pressing on him a book .
In taking the gift , Mr Obama assumed it was a book by Mr Chavez himself , he said later .
However , it was a Spanish - language copy of The Open Veins of Latin America : Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent , a book by Eduardo Galeano chronicling exploitation in the region .
Asked about his first meeting with George W Bush 's successor , Mr Chavez said : " I think it was a good moment ...
I think President Obama is an intelligent man , compared to the previous US president . "
It was unclear whether the two presidents would have a one - to - one meeting .
Addressing the summit earlier , Mr Obama had cautioned Latin American leaders not to blame all their problems on the United States .
Bolivian ' conspiracy '
On a sour note , Bolivian President Morales asked the US president to publicly repudiate an alleged plot to assassinate him that officials in Bolivia say they crushed this week .
Bolivia 's president ( right ) expelled the US ambassador last year Analysts say Mr Morales does not believe there was US involvement in the alleged plot .
But he told reporters that since Mr Obama took office he has seen no change in US hostility .
" In Bolivia ... one does n't feel any change .
The policy of conspiracy continues , " he said .
Correspondents say the dominant issue so far has been US - Cuba relations .
Cuba is the only major Latin American country excluded from the summit and Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said another summit without the communist country would be unacceptable .
President Morales said Cuba had the support of the entire world as a result of the US trade embargo against it and it was now time to abandon that embargo .
Cuba issue
For his part , Mr Obama said he was ready to accept Cuban President Raul Castro 's recent proposal of direct talks .
The US has not maintained high - level diplomatic relations with Cuba since Fidel Castro led the island 's revolution in 1960 .
But Washington recently eased its embargo , allowing Cuban - Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send money home more easily .
" I think we 're making progress at the summit , " Mr Obama told reporters after the meeting on Saturday in Port of Spain , ahead of summit plenary sessions .
Summit leaders are expected to address the economic downturn and the region 's energy and security needs at the talks , which end on Sunday .
Aides to the US leader say he hopes to squeeze one - on - one meetings into his schedule along with the plenary sessions and group gatherings .

Patent application filings can be dry stuff .
But , when Apple files for a new iPhone patent , the world listens .
Up at bat this week is a new Apple patent application that hints at a future iPhone outfitted with a front - facing camera and a dynamic UI that changes based on motion detection .
While the front - facing camera confirms that video - chat is at least a topic if interest in Cupertino , the more juicy tech lies in Apple ’s method for dynamically changing the iPhone UI based on the iPhone ’s physical status .
The iPhone ’s motion sensors would be able to detect when the user is taking a jog , for example .
The UI would then adapt to display larger phone icons or music controls , making it easier to interact with the iPhone through jarring motions .
The potential for activity - sensing technology is intriguing .
Imagine an iPhone that knows when your in the bathroom and automatically silences incoming phone calls while serving up the day ’s emails and rss feeds !
( And do n’t forget to hit up our smartphone - on - toilet poll ! )
Apple most recently filed for “ stealth ” biometric security technology for the iPhone and Mac computers .
The iPhone maker is apparently set on using embedded motion , light , biometric , etc. sensors in the iPhone for some interesting features in the future .
Let ’s hope Apple takes their patent ideas from drawing board to market !

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - A 57 - year - old Detroit woman avoided serious injury when the underwire on her bra deflected a bullet shot at her from next door , police said .
The woman , who lives on the West side of Detroit , saw a group of men breaking into a neighbor ’s house on Tuesday morning .
When the men spotted her , one of them fired a shot at her , a police spokesman said .
The bullet struck the underwire on the woman ’s bra and that saved her from a more serious injury , police said .
“ It did slow the bullet down , ” said Detroit police spokesman Phillip Cook .
“ She sustained injuries but they ’re not life threatening . ”
The woman , who was not identified , was treated at a nearby hospital .
The suspects in the shooting drove away .
A 16 - year - old autistic boy is back at work at his family 's Pilsen restaurant Thursday after Chicago police beat the boy without provocation late Wednesday , his family said .
Oscar Guzman was taking a break outside his family 's restaurant , watching cars on West 26th Street , at about 10 p.m. , when two police officers approached .
They began asking the boy questions he was unable to answer , and when the boy turned to run back into the restaurant , the cops pulled out their billy clubs and began beating him , the family said .
" They took out their little bats and they hit him .
They opened his skull , " said Oscar 's sister .
Nubia Guzman , who called police to ask for a supervisor at the scene of the beating , said she was able to record some of the incident with a cell phone camera .
" Police officers saw he was running toward us , " Nubia said .
The boy received eight stitches in his head .

( CNN ) -- Doctors Without Borders has embarked on a massive vaccination campaign in three African countries to combat an outbreak of meningitis that has killed hundreds of people , the organization said Wednesday .
A child gets vaccinated against meningitis in Niger in August 2007 .
The vaccinations are being carried out in Niger , Nigeria , and Chad -- part of a large swath of what is known as the " meningitis belt " of sub-Saharan Africa , the organization said .
The " belt " stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia .
Doctors Without Borders , widely known by its French name , Medecins Sans Frontieres , said medical teams have treated and vaccinated 5.4 million people and plan on vaccinating another 1.7 million -- making the vaccination campaign the organization 's largest ever .
The group said more than 1,900 people have died in this outbreak since January .
More than 56,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria , Niger and Chad alone , the organization said .
Last month , the World Health Organization said the disease was at epidemic level in 76 areas of in Niger and Nigeria , and a spokesman in Nigeria , Dr. Olaokun Soyinka , said the outbreak was " bigger than usual . "
In March , the organization said a total of 24,868 suspected cases had been reported in the " meningitis belt , " including 1,513 deaths .
The outbreak began around the start of the year , Soyinka told CNN .
It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust , winds and cold nights , before dipping around May when the rains come , he said .
Meningitis is an infection of the meninges , the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord , according to the World Health Organization .
Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for the current outbreak -- is one of the most important because of its potential to cause epidemics .

Jacqui Smith is reportedly " livid and shocked " The Home Secretary is to pay back parliamentary allowances claimed for pay - per- view television services , reportedly including two adult films .
Jacqui Smith said she " mistakenly " claimed for the TV package while billing for an internet connection .
The Sunday Express claims the £ 67 Virgin Media bill included two 18 - rated features viewed last April .
Ms Smith was not home when the films were viewed , sources told the BBC .
She lives with her husband , Richard Timney .
The Home Secretary is already under investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over her use of the second homes allowance .
' Ear - bashing ' BBC political correspondent , Gary O'Donoghue , said a source told him Ms Smith was " livid and shocked " when she found out about the two adult films .
He said he was told Ms Smith had not been at home when they were viewed and said she had no intention of resigning over the matter .
All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full
Jacqui Smith , Home Secretary
What can MPs claim for ?
Mr O'Donoghue said he was told Ms Smith had given her husband , who is also her parliamentary assistant , a " real ear - bashing " .
The bill was submitted last June as part of Ms Smith 's expenses , the Sunday Express reported .
The two films , which cost £ 5 each , were viewed on 6 and 8 April 2008 .
It was also said to include two viewings of the film Ocean 's 13 - at £ 3.75 each - and an additional £ 3.50 to watch the film Surf 's Up .
The films were viewed at her constituency home in Redditch , Worcestershire .
A Downing Street spokesman said Ms Smith had done the " right thing " by quickly rectifying her " inadvertent mistake " .
A spokesman said she was doing a great job as home secretary and would not let the expenses issue detract from her determination to protect the public .
The Committee on Standards in Public Life has announced a wide - ranging review of MPs ' pay and allowances , starting later this year .
It came after Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to the committee calling for a full review into " outside interests " and second jobs .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the BBC's Andrew Marr show : " Jacqui Smith is doing an outstanding job as Home Secretary ... what I know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" That 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
" The system has to be clear , above all in the interests of the public , so they can have trust and confidence . "
Jacqui Smith said in a statement : " I 'm sorry that in claiming for my internet connection , I mistakenly claimed for a television package alongside it .
" As soon as the matter was brought to my attention , I took immediate steps to contact the relevant parliamentary authorities and rectify the situation .
" All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full . "
Last month Ms Smith was criticised for claiming taxpayer - funded allowances for a second home while living with her sister .
But she insisted she had " fully abided " by the rules because she had designated her sibling 's house as her " main " residence .
That allowed her to claim payments on the Redditch constituency home she shares with her husband and children .
She says it 's all within the rules , which I 'm sure is right ... but the reality is it's not within the spirit of the rules
Mark Field , Conservative MP Conservative MP Mark Field told the BBC : " I 'm obviously glad Jacqui Smith has decided to act quickly and repay , I 'd also like her to act as quickly and repay the second home allowances that she 's also taken .
" She says it 's all within the rules , which I 'm sure is right ... but the reality is it 's not within the spirit of the rules .
" If she does n't recognise that I think she 's really a bit too stupid to be Home Secretary . "
He added there were a number of Tory MPs also abusing the system , which he said undermined parliament 's reputation .
Meanwhile , parliament 's standards commissioner John Lyon is investigating a complaint about Labour minister Tony McNulty 's second home expenses .
The work minister has claimed £ 60,000 since 2002 for the house in his Harrow constituency - 11 miles from the Commons - where his parents live .
He has said he did not break any rules .

Jose at Thick Culture sent us this design for the Catholic Church ’s Archdiocesan Youth Commission logo in 1973 ( via The Daily Dish ) .
The logo nicely shows how images are polysemic .
That is , the same image can be read very differently by different people or , as this image illustrates , at different times .
Because of the shift in the social construction of the Catholic priesthood –from benevolent child chaperones to evil child molesters –the logo , though likely lovely then , would be very ill - advised today .
Two more good examples of polysemy here and here .
This is why I have n’t been updating lately : I have been working on a Sim City clone , written purely in HTML , CSS and JavaScript !
The game is called WidgetCity , and I ’m participating with it in the Betavine Widget Competition 2009 .
The game was designed to run in Opera Widgets mode , but it also works in Firefox – only downside is that you ca n’t save your city .
Get the widget here , or if you do n’t have Opera , you can play the game here .
There is also a help file .
Continue reading to find out more details about the game ’s inner workings and such !
The basic stuff
The game is quite similar to the original Sim City – it actually uses some graphics from it , thanks to the fact that the original Sim City source code has been released under GPL , which was a good thing because I ’m not the world ’s greatest graphics artist !
As per the requirements of the Betavine competition , the game had to run in a mobile phone .
This is why the game is so small :
It had the screen size limitations of a Nokia N95 , which is something like 260×240 pixels .
The game was originally supposed to be based on the canvas tag , which I ’ve used on my past widget projects like TankWar Online .
However , this turned out to be a bit of a problem on the phone , and only one of the problems caused by the phone .
The N95 is actually a quite good device :
It has the hardware to run games with 3D graphics , etc. etc. , but it ’s completely unable to run JavaScript code at a reasonable pace .
Using canvas , the game ran absurdly slow !
In the end , I had to resort to using old - school DHTML style trickery :
The game area is simply a table , with some CSS classes applied to each of the cells in JavaScript .
Under the surface
Under the relatively simple looking graphics of the game ticks a quite serious simulation engine .
The game engine simulates a lot of things , and it had quite serious performance implications which required a lot of JavaScript optimization .
You can read more about the problems and optimizations encountered in development in Optimizing JavaScript for extreme performance and low memory consumption .
The sim engine calculates at least the following :
It keeps a track of what ’s built in each tile in the game .
This data is then used to calculate things like how much residential / commercial / industrial demand there is .
For some specific tile types like residential zones , the game calculates desirability and traffic :
Is this area of the map “ good enough ” to build a large apartment block , and can the people living here drive to some destination ?
The desirability calculations are based on a bunch of other large calculations : Pollution , crime rate , land value , population density .
Each of these has to be calculated again and again during the progress of the game to keep the city developing .
Traffic itself uses a quite “ dumb ” algorithm :
It just attempts to drive in a random direction along the roads until it reaches a destionation , which works okay for the simple calculations involved .
The large calculations like pollution and land value calculations require going over all the tiles in the map to determine what ’s built where , and then based on those some values are calculated .
You can probably see why the performance was n’t so great , as there is a lot of stuff going on in the background !
Issues during development
Most of the problems during the game ’s development were caused by the really poor JavaScript performance on the target device .
For example , the original map size in the game was 300×300 tiles .
This would cause the phone to immediately run out of memory when attempting to play , so I had to reduce the size to 128×128 , which still quite good is nowhere near as large as the original .
Note that the original 300×300 map did run perfectly fine on my desktop and on my HTC Touch Diamond .
It would probably have had major performance implications in the future , though …
Additionally , I originally planned to use canvas .
However , I had to scrap that and use a table as the speed of canvas was just way too poor .
You may be interested in reading how the WidgetCity map is rendered using a table and some CSS .
The JS performance in general seemed quite awful : Just looping over the 128×128 map was slow .
If you did nothing else than just iterate over each of the 16 384 tiles , it would already have a small impact , which you would n’t have with most other languages , or even with a bit newer JavaScript engines .
Another memory related problem surfaced closer to finishing the development :
The N95 would run out of memory when saving the game .
Saving and loading are a quite vital feature of the game , so this was a critical issue .
However , Remco Lanting came up with a nice idea to possibly fix it :
Save the map in smaller parts .
The idea worked flawlessly .
Remco also helped with testing the game and with some ideas , so a big thanks to him .
What ’s missing ?
While the game is quite ready and playable now , there are various things that I would ’ve liked to add to it , but due to lack of time I could n’t .
These include being able to lay rail , being able to get nice maps that display things like crime rate in different parts of the map , some user interface improvements , and of course disasters like nuclear plant meltdowns !
One particularily cool thing I would have liked to have was the ability to overlay data like crime rates on top of the city .
I wrote a post earlier on how you can get Photoshop layer style stuff in JavaScript , which could have been a nice way to do this .
I do n’t know if I will be adding all those , as I have various other things to do now that the game is released , like actually writing blogposts again . :)
However , if you ’d like , you are free to modify the game .
I ’ve decided to release it under GPL , similar to the graphics from the Micropolis project used in it .
If you would like to play with the source code , just download the widget , rename the file to .zip and unzip it like normal .

YouTube Smackdown Thread # 13 - PLEASE HELP !
( Update in # 243 & # 244 )
Posted on by StarCMC
Happy April !
Before I get into all the results , I wanted to give you a heads up .
We have been noticing a trend at YouTube ( you might have too ! ) that suggests Nazis and Nazi sympathizers are teaming up with the hirabists at YouTube to harass the Jews .
That 's a match made in hell if I ever saw one !
In any event , one of the Smackdown Crew has set up a channel at YouTube specifically to deal with the Nazis .
We wo n't be highlighting those videos here at FR , since these guys are n't breaking any laws .
They are , however , breaking YouTube 's Terms of Service rules .
So flagging is definitely an option !
If any of you wish to flag the videos of the white supremacists , you can do so by going to YTNAZIHUNTER 's channel and flagging the videos in the playlist !
Well guys , I am here to tell you , this team is absolutley the most awesome force to hit the internet since AlGore invented it !

I find it interesting that NAZI ’s are socialists , and Jews vote , give money to and are members of the very group that marched them into tje gas chambers and wish to do so once again .
So with that being said I do not wish to save them from their own choice of destruction .
I think they did n’t learn the last time .
Maybe this time they will .

Providing services to terrorists violates executive orders 12947 and 13224 .
That includes any free services and each violation is subject to a fine upto $ 250,000 USD .
The governmental agency reponsible for enforcement is the Office of foreign Asset Control in the US treasury and it is very understaffed .
You can file your suspected violations at : http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/contacts.shtml
However ,
Our efforts here are actually within the Youtube guidelines .
( http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines?hl=en_US) and we do not encourage anyone to violate thse guidelines .
All we are doing is helping Youtube to enforce its own rules and to keep them form possibly getting massive fines since the fines could be filed for EACH video uploaded that is in violation of those above mentioned Executive Orders .

What proves your fear mongering statement ?
The rules of youtube are being upheld .

Why are you in bold ?
Go tell it to somebody on another thread .

It also disrupts terrorist from a free tool to recruit with .

Our “ mission statement ” from nearly two years ago .
“ Are you aware that terrorists are using the internet , specifically YouTube , to showcase their graphically violent videos celebrating American and Coalition soldiers being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Additionally , they are using these videos for propaganda and teaching / recruitment purposes !
Our mission - remove as many of these videos as possible !
Then maybe YouTube will take it upon themselves to join us in trying to preserve what our military fights for every day : Life !
Liberty !
The Pursuit of Happiness ! ”
In that time we have seen the graphically violent videos decline thanks to the continual dedication of this group and others .
Propaganda and recruitment videos have increased .
Aside from it being illegal - let us repeat that word now for the third time - ILLEGAL - to post terrorist material it behooves us not to sit with our heads in the sand while these organizations attempt to influence and infiltrate our country as per this example .

There may have been one or two others , I really can't recall but with the number of posters at FR as well as the owner and Mods it should give you a hint you just may be mistaken .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- General Motors Corp. , struggling to restructure itself amid increasing odds of a bankruptcy filing , said it plans to skip a $ 1 billion debt payment due June 1 , according to a Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday .
GM's GM , +2.92 % finance chief Ray Young told reporters at a Chinese auto industry summit in Detroit the beleaguered automaker is relying on a debt - for - equity exchange or court protection to lower its $ 28 billion in debt .
He said bankruptcy is " probable , " though GM , with the full backing of the U.S. government , will right the ship " in court or out of court , " the Journal reported .
GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid - Merem said the company is working aggressively to reach a deal with bondholders , which she said is an " essential element " of the restructuring efforts .
She explained that there are two possible scenarios in which GM would n't make the payment .
One would be if the bond exchange was not yet completed by June 1 , and the other would be if the company falls into bankruptcy before the deadline .
GM 's warning that it might miss the payment puts more pressure on creditors to agree to the equity swap , according to Egan - Jones .
" We look for a default where the bondholder gets primarily equity as the government tries to get concessions from every corner to keep GM running albeit as a much smaller company , " the credit ratings agency said .
The development is the latest in a series of signals pointing toward a potential bankrupcty .
Last week , GM CEO Fritz Henderson said that while it's not the preferred option , bankruptcy remains the likely outcome of the company 's drawn - out saga considering the demands of the Obama administration .

Earlier Wednesday , Goldman Sachs said that GM and Chrysler will probably file for bankruptcy in the coming weeks , paving the way for rival Ford Motor Co. F , +1.89 % to capitalize on the market - share front .
See full story .
" While there is significant operating upside at GM ... , we see a high likelihood that the current class of common shares will be terminated through bankruptcy , [ or significantly diluted in a best case ] , " Goldman analyst Patrick Archambault told clients in a note .
As far as union discussions , CFO Young said negotiations on restructuring $ 20 billion in health - care obligations have eased as the UAW focuses on a deal with Chrysler LLC , which faces its own deadline at the end of the month to partner with Italy 's Fiat .
GM shares gave up early gains to close down 1 cent at $ 1.69 .
The Dow component had risen as high as $ 1.84 during the session .

The 62 trillion spam emails sent in 2008 created carbon emissions equivalent to that of 2 billion gallons of petrol burnt in a car engine , according to a report ( pdf ) by computer security firm McAfee .
The report looked at the energy expended to create , store , view and filter spam on personal computers and servers across 11 countries , including Australia , China , France , the US and the UK .
It found that the level of spam - related emissions generated in these countries is proportionate to its number of email users and the percentage of email that is spam , making it possible to estimate the total energy used by spam worldwide .
Nearly 80 per cent of the energy used by spam comes from end - users deleting it from their inboxes and hunting for legitimate email .
While spam filtering software takes up a further 16 per cent , it also reduces the overall energy impact of unsolicited email .

The annual energy used to transmit , process and filter spam totals 33 billion kilowatt - hours , the report concludes , which is equivalent to driving around the Earth 1.6 million times or the energy usage of more than 2 million typical homes .
“ Stopping spam at its source , as well investing in filtering technology , will save time and money , and will pay dividends to the planet by reducing carbon emissions as well , ” said Jeff Green , senior vice president of product development at McAfee .
As computer use continues to grow , scrutiny on the energy use of the servers that power everything from the internet to banking services is increasing .
Last year , researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , and chipmaker Intel showed that delaying the flow of network data by just a few milliseconds can cut power consumption of some hardware by 50 per cent .
Openmoko , Hersteller des offenen Linux - Smartphones Freerunner ( GTA02 ) , hat die Smartphone - Entwicklung auf Eis gelegt .
Dies hat ein Firmensprecher jetzt gegenüber heise open bestätigt .
Die Entwicklung des Smartphones GTA03 – interne Bezeichnung des Freerunner - Nachfolgers – sei zugunsten eines anderen Projekts offiziell eingestellt worden .
Zudem habe es einige Kündigungen und Entlassungen gegeben .
Die Gründe , das Smartphone vorerst nicht weiterzuentwickeln , skizzierte Openmoko - CEO Sean Moss - Pultz am vergangenen Donnerstag in seinem Vortrag ( PDF - Datei ) auf der OpenExpo in Bern : Mit dem Budget für 2009 habe das Unternehmen nicht annähernd genügend Ressourcen , um neben dem Support für den aktuell verkauften Freerunner noch die Entwicklung von GTA03 weiterzuführen .
Außerdem liege man , so Openmoko in seiner Stellungnahme gegenüber heise open , bereits hinter dem für GTA03 gesteckten Zeitplan zurück .
Daher habe man sich entschieden , anstelle von GTA03 zunächst ein " Projekt B " umzusetzen .
Es handele sich dabei allerdings nicht um ein Smartphone , Details wollte man noch nicht verraten .
Von Openmoko war lediglich zu erfahren , dass dieses Projekt mit den vorhandenen Ressourcen gestemmt werden könne .
Endgültig vom Tisch ist ein Nachfolger des Freerunners damit allerdings nicht : Openmoko wolle die Chance nutzen , um eine Forderung der Community nach einer direkteren Beteiligung an der Hardware - Entwicklung zu erfüllen .
Bislang hatten die freien Openmoko - Entwickler praktisch keinen Einfluss auf das Hardware - Design .
Die Entwickler sollten die in den nächsten Tagen erscheinende Mailing - Liste zu GTA03 beobachten .
Zu den Kündigungen und Entlassungen von Openmoko - Mitarbeitern wollte das Unternehmen bislang keine Stellung nehmen .
Moss - Pultz hatte in seinem Vortrag lediglich am Rande erwähnt , dass nach Darlegung der wirtschaftlichen Lage einige Mitarbeiter von sich aus gekündigt hätten , das Unternehmen sich aber auch von einigen weiteren habe trennen müssen .
Nach Informationen der Berner Zeitung handelte es sich dabei um fast die Hälfte aller Openmoko - Mitarbeiter .
Moss -Pultz versicherte den Zuhörern nur , dass Openmoko auf lange Sicht trotzdem realistische Chancen habe , zu überleben .

When we had paddled our way back to the stretch of the Vézère below Castel - Merle , we pulled out our canoe at the boat landing in Sergeac and walked a few minutes to a narrow vallon , a small side canyon .
Students were working under a shed roof , excavating a thin layer of a floor 33,000 years old in a rock shelter called Abri Castanet .
Abri means shelter in French , and this vallon , about 100 yards across and 300 yards long , has at the bases of its cliffs a dozen such shelters , containing some of the oldest known carvings and paintings , as well as cruder artifacts going much further back .
Marcel Castanet , the first excavator at this spot , is the source of the name for Abri Castanet .
His descendants still own the land  and Castel - Merle  and his son , René , runs a small museum of prehistory in Sergeac .
René ’s granddaughter , Isabelle Castanet - Daumas , an archaeologist , owns the vallon and offers tours of its rock shelters .
In a Quonset hut beside Abri Castanet , Dr. Randall White , a professor of anthropology at New York University , was excavating refuse from a 33,000 - year - old bead workshop .
He picked through bead - making residue with a pair of tweezers , separating tiny shards of hematite , used for polishing , from equally minuscule scraps of the charred reindeer antler and bone .
The beads themselves were made of mammoth ivory and soapstone , materials prized apparently for their smoothness .
Behind him , students uncovered a section of the ancient floor with brushes .
“ We ’re picking through the garbage of everyday life 33,000 years ago , ” he said , holding up the tiny ulna of a prehistoric bird or rodent .
The nomadic hunters called the Cro-Magnon , who were , like us , Homo sapiens , existed here from about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago , and wintered in the vallon sporadically over that time .
The canyon sheltered them from cold winds , and the natural rock overhangs allowed them to hold heat inside by hanging hides over the openings of their shelters .
It is thought that different groups met in those cold months and shared materials , techniques and genes before separating to go to their summer hunting grounds in the spring .
Their own ancestors had come to Dordogne from Africa , taking thousands of years to get there only to find another human species already in residence  the Neanderthal .
Professor
White believes that the shock of that contact was an impetus for the Cro-Magnon use of body ornamentation .
“ Ornamentation helped them organize into large groups and identify each other across wide distances , ” he said .
Their distinctive styles of beadwork and clothing made them identifiable as Cro-Magnon and differentiated them from the Neanderthals .
In this view , ornamentation was not only the beginning of metaphor  the taking of an image or material out of one context and placing it in another  but also of the concept of social status .
Abri Castanet is one of the richest sources of concrete evidence for ornamentation , though earlier so - called “ find spots ” exist in France and South Africa .
From the vallon we followed a centuries - old trail under the overhanging cliffs and through oak forests along the river for almost a mile , to the next village , St. - Léon -sur - Vézère , and back to Castel - Merle .
Here the wild surroundings made it possible to imagine the landscape as a preagricultural refuge for early humans , if not as the dry grassland that once existed here .
SAN FRANCISCO  YouTube , the most popular online video site , and Universal Music Group , the world ’s largest music company , said on Thursday that they would create an online hub for music videos and related content , called Vevo .
The agreement is the latest of many efforts by YouTube , which is owned by Google , to put more professionally produced content in front of its huge audience , and in turn , earn more money from advertising .
Music videos of Universal ’s artists will be available both on Vevo.com , which will be owned by Universal and powered by YouTube ’s technology , and on a Vevo channel on YouTube .
The companies said they would share revenue from advertising on both sites , but declined to discuss specific terms of the agreement .
Google and Universal said they planned to introduce Vevo this year .
They said they were working to persuade other major labels to join the site .

For about 15 years now I 've wanted to do something with stick figures .
I never knew what .
I just wanted to try animating them .
The games I like tend to be isometric or top - down views ; I generally do n't like first person or side views .
As a result , stick figure animation just never seemed useful enough to put into one of my games .
While reading Scott McCloud 's books about comics a few years ago , I had an idea blending comic books and games , and it just happens to be a good fit for stick figure animation .
I 'm not sure I want to pursue it , but since I had spent so much time on the spaceship physics and editor , I thought it'd be a good break for me to take a break and take a look at stick figure animation .
If it turns out to be fun I might explore the comic book idea a bit more .
The other thing that I 've been wanting to explore is the ninja side of the pirates vs. ninjas theme .
Sure , we have Ask a Ninja , but overall I think the pirates have gotten far too much attention .
There are several pirate - themed games , like Sid Meier 's Pirates , Puzzle Pirates , and Tropico 2 Pirate Cove , but not so many for ninjas .
Talk Like a Pirate Day gets plenty of attention but the equivalent for ninjas just does n't compare .
Only the Somali pirate attacks are hurting the pirate image .
So if I write a stick figure animation game , the protagonist will be a ninja fighting the evil pirates .
How am I going to make my 2D ninja stick figure move ?
There are are lots of approaches to character animation : forward kinematics , inverse kinematics , physical simulation , “ ragdoll ” physics , motion capture , etc .
My goal was to make something simple and reasonable without putting in much artwork ( motion capture or hand - drawn animation ) .
My hope was that a 2D stick figure would take much less effort than the full 3D motion systems .
I wanted to try the simplest approach first , using basic geometry to move the legs .
The hip and knee angles tell me where the ankle will end up .
If I know where I want the ankle to be , I should be able to find the hip and knee angles .
I tried approaching it as a gradient function , using hill - climbing to reach the solution , but it turns out this is overkill if you only have two angles .
The femur and tibia length are known , and I know the distance between the hip and my desired ankle position .
That means we know the three sides of the triangle , and can use the law of cosines to determine the angles .
Simple .
Ankles and wrists work out pretty nicely .
The next step was to make the figure take a step ( pun intended , sorry ! ) .
I looked at some animator pages about the walk cycle I also read lots of papers about walking mechanics , including some about automatically “ learning ” how to walk .
Along the way I discovered something cool : passive walking dynamics ( see animation here ) , which treats walking as an inverted pendulum ( your body over the supporting leg ) and a normal pendulum ( your free leg swinging freely ) .
It seems to be a pretty good approximation of how people walk .
I decided the simplest thing would be to make the target ankle position follow a circle , as if you were on a bicycle , and then have the ground prevent your foot from going down .
This actually looked reasonable , but the “ liftoff ” and “ landing ” of the foot did n't look right .
To make them look better , I added transitions ( see this page ) that used the toe as a pivot point ( for liftoff ) and the heel as a pivot point ( for landing ) .
This definitely looked better , but the liftoff and landing have the ankle moving in circular arcs , and these do n't smoothly transition into the overall circular motion .
I improved it a bit more by making the ankle follow a spline that matched the arcs .
I was pretty happy with the walking animation , but several friends reminded me that in a ninja game , you 're not going to spend much time seeing the ninja walk .
The ninja will run , sneak , jump , kick , punch , throw stars , duck , swing , hide , and do flips , but walking ?
How boring .
So once again I realized that I had been focusing on the wrong problem .
The second thing was that my test app had a giant ninja , but in the game it'd look tiny , so all the little details like the flexing foot , the bounce in his step , or the liftoff and landing ( which would be only a pixel high ) really do n't matter .
[ Edit 2008 - 05 - 13 : changed “ pirate ” to “ ninja ” ; thanks Anonymous for pointing out my error . ]
I 'm not sure where I want to go with this .
The walking research papers were cool , but I did n't find research papers about gravity - defying ninja backflips .
My gut tells me that the ninja does n't obey the laws of physics , and thus I should stick to the geometrical approach instead of using a physics engine .
Box 2D looks pretty neat , and I 'm sure I can use physics for other things in the game .
But I need to first figure out how I 'm going to implement ninja moves .
Do I want to procedurally generate them somehow , or do I want to hand - pick the key frames ?
It 'd be cool to generate them in a way that could take into account everything in the scene .
For example , a jump kick should be able to jump on the box before jumping for the kick .
But I suspect that 's a lot more work than I want to tackle right now , and unless it 's a key part of the game ( if I end up writing a game ) , it 's just not that important .
That brings up the question : what is the goal here ?
Am I doing this to satisfy my long - time dream of animating stick figures , or should I try to write a little game that can show off the comic book idea , or do I really want to write a game ?
I do n't know yet .
So that leaves me at : I still want to do something with animated stick figures , and I still do n't know what .
But if I ever figure it out , I have now learned some things that might come in handy .

President Barack Obama traveled to Mexico this week , rounding off nearly a month traveling in Europe and the Middle East .
On March 24 , he announced his plan to send $ 700 million to aid the Mexican government and tighten security along the U.S. - Mexico border .
While the Obama administration acknowledged the role that the United States plays in providing a market for narcotics , as well as providing the AK - 47 assault rifles and other weapons preferred by the cartel assassins , he promised only more of the same to address the violence : guns , surveillance equipment , cash and more police on the beat .
Thus the U.S. government still refuses to acknowledge the failure of the so - called “ war on drugs ” or to initiate a real change in U.S. drug policy .
It has always preferred to export the perception of violence , corruption and chaos to other countries :
In the 1980s and 1990s it was Colombia , now it is Mexico .
The plan is to give hundreds of millions of dollars to weapons contractors to militarize the border and aid the Mexican military and police forces , which have been found time and time again to support one or the other of the various cartels battling over territory and trafficking routes in Mexico .
The untouchable policy continues to be that of legalization and regulation .
In 2006 , the Mexican Congress tried to regulate small possession of many drugs in order to stop the explosion of drug killings , but then - President Vicente Fox quashed the bill after Bush administration condemnation .
Soon thereafter , Felipe Calderón took the presidency and sent 20,000 federal troops into the streets to fight the cartels .
Has that policy worked ?
Since Calderón took office , over 10,000 people have been slain in the streets .
When former President Bill Clinton militarized the U.S. - Mexico border between San Diego and Tijuana , did he stop the flow of illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants ?
No , instead he pushed them both into the desert , subjecting the immigrants to the territorial control of the drug traffickers .
The recent explosion of kidnappings in Phoenix is the result : human traffickers working for the cartels began to kidnap and hold for ransom their own customers .
Now even the Economist magazine and a coalition of former presidents from Brazil , Colombia and Mexico , grouped together in the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , have called for various legalization proposals .
The issue is not one of violence “ spilling over ” from Mexico to the U.S. , but of the transnational violence that will always accompany a multibillion dollar illegal industry .
And yet the U.S. government continues only to blame others .
At least in Mexico , the national media keep count of the annual number of drug executions .
Do we even know how many people were executed on the streets in the United States last year in drug - related homicides ?
Here the government and the major media have failed to develop a national consciousness of slayings that are a product of the underground drug war , not just the bad luck of “ rough ” neighborhoods .
If the current administration advertises change one can believe in , it should address the economic reality of the drug war —
Forbes just included Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín “ El Chapo ” Guzmán in its list of billionaires and listed his industry as : “ shipping ” — and attack its social roots through regulation , decriminalization , treatment and community development .
Obama campaigned on his promise to end the war in Iraq ; it is time to end that other failed and wrong war , the war on drugs .

ANAND , India ( Reuters ) - Shabnam had dreamed of owning a home for years , but with few prospects for her husband , she followed the lead of many poor women in her town in western India : she signed up to carry a baby for another couple .

At the clinic of Nayna Patel , perhaps India ’s best - known “ surrogate doctor ” who delivered Anand town ’s first surrogate baby , more women are signing up to be surrogates , with even nurses and teachers lining up , as their husbands lose their jobs .
“ The women who come here usually want the money to buy a home , pay off loans , or for their childrens ’ college education , ” said Patel in her small clinic , the walls of which are covered With clippings and pictures of Patel with babies and parents .
A surrogate is generally paid about 250,000 - 400,000 rupees ( $ 4,000 - $ 8,000 ) , a huge sum of money in a country where many live on less than $ 2 a day .
Doctors with a western education , top - notch facilities and lower prices have already made India an attractive destination for procedures ranging from bypass surgery to liposuction .
Lax legislation and an entrepreneurial streak in Gujarat state have helped make Anand a last stop for many childless couples at home and abroad , after its first surrogate baby five years ago .
In this bustling town known for India ’s best - known brand of butter , Patel has delivered more than 100 surrogate babies , 40 percent for Indians living abroad and 20 percent for foreigners .
It all began with a grandmother surrogate for a UK couple five years ago that pitched Anand and Patel into the spotlight .
Following their lead , locals and foreigners began to flock to Patel ’s clinic , drawn by the lower costs , relaxed attitude toward surrogates and lack of legislation .
A draft bill on surrogacy is pending before parliament , and meanwhile , hundreds of clinics have mushroomed across the country , with critics saying touts promoting this “ reproductive tourism ” care little for the health or rights of the surrogates .
Patel , who was featured on a special show on Oprah Winfrey two years ago , raises her voice in defense .

“ My argument is : the surrogate is not killing anyone , not committing an illegal or immoral act .
And if a surrogate ’s child is able to get an education , if one family is able to buy a home -- and help a needy couple in the process , where is the harm ? ”
ETHICAL ISSUES
Not everyone sees it that way .
Patel and the couples , more than half of whom are either non-resident Indians or foreigners , have come under a barrage of criticism for “ exploiting ” surrogates and for glossing over the ethical debate .
Many surrogates themselves do not tell their parents or in - laws for fear of being ostracized , and several of Patel ’s surrogates live in a Surrogate House to ensure they have a proper diet , and are safe from drunken husbands and nosey neighbors .
Shabnam , 26 , has not told her two older daughters or her in - laws that she is a surrogate ; she lives with a few other surrogates at the hospital with her youngest child , while her husband , who is out of work , cares for the two others at home .
“ I do n’t think I can ever tell them ; I do n’t think they ’ll understand , ” she said , insisting on using just one name .
Her husband used to earn less than $ 1 a day washing dishes .
Some experts say surrogates , who are often barely literate , do not understand all that the process entails , and are putting themselves at physical and emotional risk but have few rights .
“ The primary concern is the physical and mental health of the surrogate : there are several risks , including maternal mortality , associated with assisted reproductive technologies , ” said Preeti Nayak at Sama Resource Group for Women and Health .
India ’s maternal mortality ratio is 301 in 100,000 births , the highest in south Asia after Bangladesh , the World Bank says .
For Chris McDaniel and his wife Shannon , who came to Anand last April from San Diego after having tried every option in the United States , where hiring a surrogate can take months and cost up to $ 100,000 , the decision to go to Patel was clear .
“ It was n’t in our life plan to fly half - way around the world to a country we barely knew about to have our child , ” said Chris , who is writing a book on their experience .
MORE CONFIDENT
It is hard to come by numbers of surrogates in the country , but Patel has a list of nearly 200 and is seeing more women walk in everyday because they are feeling the pinch of the slowdown .
In the absence of legislation , Patel sticks to guidelines of apex body Indian Council of Medical Research , which say a surrogate may only be implanted with the egg and sperm of the couple or anonymous donors , and that she must be below 45 years .
Patel also insists couples seeking surrogates must have a medical condition that makes child bearing impossible or risky , and draws the line at gay couples and single parents .
The surrogate , who must have her husband ’s consent , has no rights over the baby , but feels empowered nevertheless , she said .
“ Until then , they have felt powerless , helpless ; now , they feel like they can be of some use to their family , ” she said .
Shabnam ’s ambition is far more modest .
“ I was very scared thinking of our situation , thinking how will we manage ? ” said Shabnam , who is eight months pregnant with the baby of an Indian couple living in the United States .
“ Now I feel a bit more confident .
At least if we can buy a house , then things will get better . ”

Most large applications are designed with multiple , autonomous interacting components .
In very high level terms , they look like this :
The two circles above are two mutually dependent components .
The arrow is an avenue of communication between the two , and two classes can only communicate where they are connected to one another .
In general , you want there to be as little ' surface area ' between two classes as possible , and the avenue of communication should be as narrow as possible .
Neat , simple , orderly , supportable .
Now consider the following :
This is how the eTeller application supported by Steve looked under the hood .
Prices So Low ,
They 're INSANE !!!
Infotech is a company that produces budget enterprise software for various financial institutions .
Sure , in this context , " budget " may be defined as being in the neighborhood of a generously equipped new car .
But in the eyes of a bank , even a small one , spending this kind of money is a bargain when compared to writing and supporting something written in - house .
So , to remain competitive and keep their prices appealing , Infotech , like many companies with similar goals , bottled up their requirements and offshored their development .
The same process was applied to Infotech 's latest initiative , eTeller , which was a suite of applications used by bank tellers at their stations to keep track of day - to - day things like deposits , withdrawals , receipt printing , and the like .
After a year of development , eTeller 1.0 was released and , thanks to a base of existing satisfied customers , the money rolled in .
However , their growing customer base was quickly turning from a blessing into a curse .
The " Fit " hits the " Shan "
Working on the front lines , Steve 's group of support analysts were well aware that the product they supported was , by definition , crapware .
Six months after the initial release , eTeller was up to v1.5 and had gained a following of thoroughly disgruntled customers .
Every day , more and more users were calling in about the frequent application crashes mid-transaction , inaccurate reporting that lead some banks to think their tellers were robbing them blind , and several other nasty things were not just keeping them from going about their daily business , but also making them seriously ticked off !
After apologizing in a soothing tone , analysts in the US would send a list of new bugs to the offshore developers , who would then address the problem and release a patch which , when installed by the client , would open up three new bugs in its place .
With customer satisfaction at an all - time low and bank presidents calling Infotech 's CEO , at home , threatening to sue , something had to be done .
The contract with the offshore developers was terminated and the source code was recalled with the plan being to fix the bugs and make enhancements locally at the only - slightly - higher - than - offshore " greenhorn " rate .
The developers complied , but nothing could have prepared Steve , the CEO , or anyone else for what they were about to inherit .
The Beast Revealed
Source analysis revealed that eTeller was over 100 k lines of tangled , messy , and completely unmodularized C# code ... and not a single line of it held any redeeming value whatsoever .
It was so bad that refactoring it would have probably made it worse ; the whole thing just needed to be rewritten .
A few of the " highlights " included :
Excluding classes generated by Visual Studio , there were all of five classes used in the entire application .
Each was a static class containing exclusively static methods .
The main class , " Globals " , contained 1000s of variables to maintain the state of application .
The only types used in the Globals class were bool , string , decimal , and DataSet .
As a result of the lack of classes , no business - specific classes existed in the application .
Instead , ArrayLists , HashTables , and DataSets were used to move around data .
20,000 lines of code were embedded in a single file called frmMain.cs .
It printed receipts , performed account inquiries , controlled the cash dispenser , you name it !
No primary keys , indexes , or foreign key constraints existed on tables , nearly all fields were of type varchar ( 50 ) , and 100 % of fields were nullable .
Who needs stinkin ' parameters when you could store everything in the Globals class ?
In the rare instance that parameters were passed to a method , they were passed as strings for convenience .
Some forms had invisible labels .
The programmers used the .
Text and .
Tag properties to hold miscellaneous data .
Invisible labels must have been easier to create than inserting yet another variable into Globals .
Of course , because they had to support customers who were reaching for their last straw , a full rewrite of eTeller had to be put on hold .
Banks were demanding to have bugs fixed on the same day they were reported ... or else .
Each new bug the development team into crisis - mode : bugs were being fixed as fast as possible and a new release was being sent to QA almost immediately .
Against the recommendations of QA and developers , new versions of eTeller were being released to customers every two to three days .
Fortunately , this was only a " temporary " operating mode and , once things cooled down , they 'd scale back a bit and focus on the big , rewrite project .
At least , in theory .
Many , many months later , when they finally delivered the arbitrarily - numbered eTeller v1.89b.6a , the system was at a state where it performed its most basic tasks with minimal errors .
There was still a steady stream of bugs coming in , but one thing was certain : a rewrite was never , ever going to happen .
Taming The Beast
Steve 's team was faced with a foe they could never defeat .
Every time they worked to slay a bug , the codebase would grow and become an even larger monstrosity .
Instead of going head - to - head with the beast , they decided to take a less ambitious approach : surgically remove dead features and rewrite functionality whenever a change request came through .
The approach seemed to work , though it did have it drawbacks .
Not only did changes take longer to implement , but the codebase did n't seem less ugly ; it was only a bit smaller .
Sure , the once 20,000 - line frmMain.cs had shrunk by 60 % , but was still an 8,000 - line mess .
Eventually , their careful , calculated approach caught up with them .
When it came time for a major new set of features , there was no way Steve and his team could maintain their pace of bug fixing and deliver the changes in a timely manner without hiring more developers .
Fortunately , managers , in all their wisdom , knew exactly what to do .
And all Steve ’s team would have to do is bottle - up a few technical requirements ...
I sometimes hear colleagues complaining that they can't get anything done , because they have too many tasks in their head .
I 've found that in order to increase the efficiency of my work I need a moderately large selection of pending tasks .
This allows me to match the type of work I can do at a given moment with a task in the most optimal way .
Let me be clarify .
Tasks that pass through my hands differ in requirments on concentration , time , location , and facilities .
By juggling around tasks from a rich selection I can ensure that I often get a the chance to optimally match a task to chance I have to work .
Consider , for example , requirements on concentration .
It would be foolish to spend some quite hours in my office spell - checking a document , or coming up with a complext algorithm at a busy airport gate .
Working on those tasks in the other way round makes a lot more sense .
Here is a list of typical work environments I find myself in and corresponding examples of types of tasks I try to keep at hand .
The point to efficient multitasking is to match each task as closely as possible to the available work environment , planning ahead to have appropriate tasks available for upcoming work environments .

Of course , as is the case with computer multitasking , there 's also the case of having too many tasks chasing my attention .
In such a situation I observe myself spending more time juggling tasks and deciding what to do , than actually performing productive work .
In computing this is called thrashing .
Simultaneous partial - face and double - hand transplant
Paris ’ Public Hospital authority says a team of doctors has performed the world ’s first simultaneous partial - face and double - hand transplant .
In a statement Monday , the authority said the recipient was a 30 - year - old burn victim .
The man , whose name was not released , was injured in a 2004 accident that left him with scars “ preventing any social life . ”
French media reports have said the upper half of the face , including the scalp , forehead and eyelids , was transplanted .
The statement did not provide such details .
A 40 - person team worked for 30 hours on Saturday and Sunday to perform the operation at the Henri Mondor hospital in a Paris suburb .
The statement said it was the world ’s sixth partial - face transplant but the first to include hands as well .

There is nothing more humbling or more perception - changing than holding a human brain in your hands .
I discovered this recently at a brain - cutting lesson given by Jean - Paul Vonsattel , a neuropathologist at Columbia University .
These lessons take place every month in a cold , windowless room deep within the university ’s College of Physicians and Surgeons .
On the day I visited , there were half a dozen brains sitting on a table .
Vonsattel began by passing them around so the medical students could take a closer look .
When a brain came my way , I cradled it and found myself puzzling over its mirror symmetry .
It was as if someone had glued two smaller brains together to make a bigger one .
Vonsattel then showed us just how weak that glue is .
He took back one of the brains and used a knife to divide the hemispheres .
He sliced quickly through the corpus callosum , the flat bundle of nerve fibers that connects the halves .
The hemispheres flopped away from each other , two identical slabs of fleshy neurons .
Sometimes surgeons must make an even more extreme kind of slice in the brain of a patient .
A child may suffer from epilepsy so severe that the only relief doctors can offer is to open up the skull and cut out the entire hemisphere in which the seizures start .
After the surgery , the space soon fills with cerebrospinal fluid .
It may take a child a year of physical therapy to recover from losing a hemisphere — but the fact that patients recover at all is stunning when you consider that they have only half a brain .
It makes you wonder what good two hemispheres are in the first place .
In fact , scientists have spent a lot of time pondering this very question .
Their best answer has a lot to do with the form and evolutionary history of our bodies .
From early in our development as embryos , humans take on a left - right symmetry that eventually gives rise to our two eyes , our two big toes , and every paired structure in between .
All vertebrates are symmetrical in the same way , as are butterflies , scorpions , and a vast number of other invertebrates .
This left - right structure is probably inherited from the common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetric animals * , a creature that apparently emerged over 570 million years ago .
There were some obvious survival benefits from left - right symmetry .
With muscles and limbs on both sides of their bodies , animals could move forward quickly and efficiently .
Once established , symmetry had a powerful effect on how new organs evolved .
Eyes and antennae tended to develop in left - right pairs , for example .
When early fish began to evolve complex brains , those too developed according to left - right rules .
The human brain is very different from the brain of a lamprey , but in both species the neocortex — the outer layers of the brain — is divided into two mirror - image hemispheres .
Of course , our bodies are not perfectly symmetrical ( heart on the left , appendix on the right ) , and neither are our brains .
Some regions are slightly bigger on one side than on the other , and these differences translate into imbalances in how the human brain works .
Most people , for example , tend to favor their right hand over their left .
In the mid-1800s , the French physician Paul Broca discovered a region on the left side of the brain that is essential for language ; damage to Broca ’s area , as it is called , leaves people unable to talk .
The same region on the right side is not so vital .
Another area , on the underside of the brain , is important for recognizing people ’s faces .
The right half of this region , known as the facial fusiform area , does most of the work of recognizing .
In fact , if people view a face only through their left eye ( which is linked to the brain ’s right hemisphere ) , they will do a better job of recognizing it than if they use only their right eye .
These sorts of findings helped to turn the hemispheres into pop phenoms .
People were tagged as “ right brains ” if they could draw and “ left brains ” if they were analytical .
Academics made some big claims about the hemispheres as well .
In the 1990s psychologist Michael Corballis of the University of Auckland in New Zealand argued that the asymmetry of the brain — known as lateralization — was a key step in the evolution of our species , giving us language and additional mental powers that other animals lack .
* Correction , April 15 , 2009 :
The article originally said that biliterality came from the common ancestor of all animals .
I found myself in the enviable position last night of seeing the world premiere of the new Star Trek movie .
No , not in Australia - in Austin , TX , where the Drafthouse reigns supreme and Tim League has presented me with ridiculously more amazing movie experiences than I have any right to expect in one life .
First , a very humble thank you to the team that organized this event , including the very lovely woman from Paramount whose name I have sadly forgotten .
Worthy of note :
The film was introduced by the screenwriters and Mr. Nimoy himself , who are actively encouraging feedback and reviews .
They want people to spread the word about their movie .
Here 's
Why :
The new Star Trek movie is amazing - easily the best Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan , and a veritable feast of sight and sound : A captivating adventure that grabs you from the first and does n't let go .
The effects are staggering , finally what the stories have deserved so richly .
There are enough huge fireballs , shattering explosions and exciting fights to go around .
The movie 's first 5 - 10 minutes are of note I feel :
This sequence is brilliant and had me immediately on the edge of my seat .
The movie follows the story of the initial meeting of the crew of the U.S.S.
Enterprise , twisting and turning from its original path thanks to a plot of revenge by the 24th century Romulan Captain Nero .
The less said about what this entails , and what changes are in store for both the universe and characters - the better .
I 'm told there are some spoiler - rich reviews out there .
Avoid them .
This movie packs a lot of adventure and surprises , and is best seen unspoiled , in my humble opinion .

All the adventure is balanced , however , by dead on work by the actors and a generous focus of the story on the characters themselves .
All of the main crew get a nice picture of who they are , only Chekov ever feels like window dressing , a problem every previous
Trek movie has had ( even my beloved Khan ) in spades .
In particular , I would like to single out McCoy ( Karl Urban ) and Scotty ( Simon Pegg ) for being much improved .
Not only do the actors completely nail their parts , but both characters are much more interestingly written now .
As great as they are though , the weight of these stories has always been on Kirk and Spock .
Both are well executed here , and I can safely say that I already like the new Kirk more than I ever did the old .
He 's still Kirk , but you understand why he 's Kirk , and there 's more humanity to him .
Old Kirk was sometimes a dick because , well , he was .
This Kirk feels a touch more pity , has a touch more pain , and actually goes out of his way to save his crew , which makes him far easier to root for .
Zachary Quinto as Spock , aside from the obvious physical resemblance , also feels right .
This movie is more Kirk - centric , I think , but Quinto does a good job conveying the inner turmoil and barely suppressed green - blooded volcano boiling under the character 's surface .
The only issue I have is that a lot of the character development that took Spock many episodes and movies in the original universe seem to be compressed into a very short time here , and I worry that they may be wrapping all of this up too neatly and cleanly .
In one scene , specifically , Spock seems to undergo a complete attitude reversal in the space of about three minutes -
Seething with rage and violence one minute then suddenly , after a quick epiphany , positive and collected and ready to help in any way he can the next .
It feels cut short , like something got left on the cutting room floor .

And that leads into my issues with the film .
There are several bits that feel rushed , from the narrated flashback ( forward ? ) which seems to clip along far too quickly and forces Nimoy to be abbreviated , to the handling of the Vulcans .
Sarek is the only performance here I 'll single out as being definitely poorer for the reboot .
I 'm not sure anyone could have filled those shoes , but the dignity and depth that Mark Lenard brought to the role is sorely missed .
Otherwise , Chekov 's accent , while deliberately pronounced , actually did become a little annoying in several spots , and Eric Bana 's villain , while played well , is given a bit short shrift , with only a very brief explanation of who he is and what he wants .
This cuts both ways though , as the movie nicely avoids the trap that so many of these films fall into , over - focusing on the main villain to the detriment of the heroes .
Overall -
The runtime flies by with very few lulls in the pacing , reinvigorating characters and a universe that had , lets be honest , grown stale and tired .
More than anything else , the movie just feels so much more fun than any previous entry .
There 's more humor , more thrills , far more energy and a much better movie here than anything I 've seen from Star Trek * since the 80's .
I admit I was skeptical - I was not prepared to care about this universe and these characters again , after the crushing mediocrity that they had become .
I can be skeptical no more , though .
This is a fantastic movie it's own right , one I would definitely recommend to Trekkie and new fan alike .

Timothy J. Alberta reports on politics .
The debate over the U.S. moving toward socialism has been revived -– this time because Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele wo n’t call President Barack Obama a “ socialist . ”
A number of Republican National Committee members are n’t happy with Steele ’s preference for the term “ collectivist ” when referring to the president and his supporters , the Washington Times reported .
It ’s the latest conflict between Steele and some in the GOP who view him as too moderate .
RNC leaders in 16 states have signed a petition seeking a special RNC meeting to resolve the dispute .
Steele has twice refused , and some Republicans are turning up the heat .
RNC member James Bopp Jr. of Indiana has led the charge for using stronger language to characterize the Obama administration .
This week he sent an email to the committee ’s 168 members calling for a special meeting to be held next month to discuss the “ socialist ” label , among other issues pressing the party .
“ ” In just a few months , the goal of the Obama administration has become clear and obvious – to restructure American society along socialist ideals , ” Bopp wrote .
Washington state RNC member Jeff Kent sponsored the resolution pushing the “ socialist ” label .
But he wo n’t be satisfied if only Republicans start using the label .
Kent suggested Democrats should be “ truthful and honest with the American people by renaming themselves the Democrat Socialist Party . ”
National Parks Get $ 750 Million
National Parks in the United States received $ 750 million from the economic stimulus in order to address much needed repairs and construction .
The package will help to pay for over 750 projects across the country .
A few of the repairs include work at Independence Hall in Philadelphia , Ellis Island in New York , Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , and multiple stop across the Appalachian Trail .
A full list of the projects by state can be found at the Department of the Interior website .
Castle Geyser , Yellowstone National Park © Dominiqs
The National Park Service projects will address much needed maintenance across the nation .
Though $ 750 million is a sizable amount with the current economic crisis , the preservation efforts will create 30,000 to 40,000 new jobs .
If the United States wants to be serious about conservation , their parks must be kept in satisfactory condition .
It ’s no coincidence that the announcement of the funds landed on Earth Day .
It ’s meant to send a signal that the Obama Administration is committed to being green .
Expect more projects that are funded by the federal government in the coming years .

Every object has a history , and behind that history is an inventor .
Who was the first to come up with the invention can be a topic for hot debate .
Often several people independent of each other will all think of the same good idea at around the same time and will later argue something like " No it was me , I thought of it first . "
For example , many people have claimed to have invented the Frisbee .
The Legend Behind the “ Frisbee ” Name
The Frisbie Pie Company ( 1871 -1958 ) of Bridgeport , Connecticut made pies that were sold to many New England colleges .
Hungry college students soon discovered that the empty pie tins could be tossed and caught , providing endless hours of game and sport .
Many colleges have claimed to be the home of " he who was first to fling . "
Yale College has even argued that in 1820 a Yale undergraduate named Elihu Frisbie grabbed a passing collection tray from the chapel and flung it out into the campus , thereby becoming the true inventor of the Frisbie and winning glory for Yale .
That tale is unlikely to be true since the words “ Frisbie 's Pies ” were embossed in all the original pie tins and it was from the word “ Frisbie ” that the common name for the toy was coined .
Early Inventors
In 1948 , a Los Angeles building inspector named Walter Frederick Morrison and his partner Warren Franscioni invented a plastic version of the Frisbie that could fly further and with better accuracy than a tin pie plate .
Morrison 's father was also an inventor who invented the automotive sealed - beam headlight .
Another interesting tidbit was that Morrison had just returned to the United States after World War II , where he had been a prisoner in the infamous Stalag 13 .
His partnership with Franscioni , who was also a war veteran , ended before their product had achieved any real success .
The word " Frisbee " is pronounced the same as the word “ Frisbie . ”
Inventor Rich Knerr was in search of a catchy new name to help increase sales after hearing about the original use of the terms “ Frisbie ” and “ Frisbie-ing . ”
He borrowed from the two words to create the registered trademark “ Frisbee . ”
Soon after , sales soared for the toy , due to his company Wham - O's clever marketing of Frisbee playing as a new sport .
In 1964 , the first professional model went on sale .
Ed Headrick was the inventor at Wham - O who patented Wham - O's designs for the modern frisbee ( U.S. patent 3,359,678 ) .
Ed Headrick 's Frisbee , with its band of raised ridges called the Rings of Headrick , had stabilized flight as opposed to the wobbly flight of its predecessor the Pluto Platter .
Headrick , who invented the Wham - O Superball that sold over twenty million units , held the utility patent for the modern - day Frisbee , a product that has sold over two - hundred million units to date .
Mr. Headrick led the advertising program , new products program , served as vice president of research and development , executive vice president , general manager and CEO for Wham - O Incorporated over a ten - year period .
U.S. patent number 3,359,678 was issued to Headrick on December 26 , 1967 .
Today , the 50 - year - old Frisbee is owned by Mattel Toy Manufacturers , one of at least sixty manufacturers of flying discs .
Wham - O sold over one hundred million units before selling the toy to Mattel .

We used to play on the old farm , chasing cats and chickens , eating apples and chucking their cores into the beat fields .
We 'd go into the barn , and jump around in the hay , look at the cow in its stable , swatting the flies with its lashes .
We were afraid to climb the ladder into the attic in the barn , not because it was dark up there , but because the ladder was high .
We went into the farmhouse , old and rundown , and played with the ancient sewing machine , left all derelict and abandoned .
We ran the hall with the specters of the family that lived there , their stove still warm , the house still filled with their toil .
We cried when they tore the house down , to make way for a new one .
The other week I tried Sweets Made Here ’s Ferrero Rocher Cupcake Recipe , and while I loved the results ( as did all of my tasters ) , I did feel that the cupcake part of the product got dry really , really fast ( a problem with cupcakes ) .
Also , eating them was a messy process .
So , the idea came to me to simplify and reorganize .
I have a brownie recipe I adore , after much testing , maybe I could jazz it up ?
Ohh yes , I certainly could .
The idea was simple :
One pan of brownies ( jazzed up with hazelnuts and Frangelico ) ; use the back end of a wooden spoon to poke holes in the warm brownies ; fill the holes with Nutella ; spread chocolate chips ( or callets ) on top and heat to melt ; sprinkle chopped hazelnuts on top .
They are … amazing .
I ’ve served them at parties twice now , and after a couple of hours not a crumb was left .
Plus , I could hear people telling other folks who had n’t had them yet about them .
There was much raving .
And now , I share with you !
Chocolate - Hazelnut Brownies
( Brownie recipe adapted from Hershey ’s Easy Baking , a book someone gave me as a gift last year )
Makes 1 9×13 pan
Ingredients
Brownie :
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 tsp Frangelico or Hazelnut extract
4 eggs
3/4 cup Ghirardelli cocoa ( I found this has the best flavor , compared with a number of other similarly - priced or cheaper cocoas )
1 cup AP flour ( I use White Lily )
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts , skins removed as best you can .
Topping
About 1/2 cup nutella .
About three handfuls of chocolate chips and / or bittersweet callets ( I have used both Callebaut 60/ 40 callets , and Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips for this ; both work just fine )
1 - 2 cups chopped toasted hazelnuts , skins removed .
1. Heat oven to 350 F .
Grease 13x9x2 baking pan .
For a much easier time of life , line the pan with heavy foil and grease that .
Cutting brownies gets much easier this way .
2 . Melt butter .
Stir in sugar and Frangelico / extract .
Add eggs , one at a time , beating well after each addition .
Add cocoa , beat til blended .
Add flour , baking powder , and salt , beat well .
Stir in nuts .
Pour into prepared pan .
3 . Bake 30 - 35 minutes or until edges begin to pull away from sides of pan .
4 . After removing from oven , use the reverse end of a wooden spoon to poke holes into the brownie at regular intervals .
( depends on how much you like nutella .
I think I ended up making holes about every square inch 🙂
Fill with nutella while brownies are still warm ( I used a piping bag and a medium round tip ; you could use a sturdy plastic baggie .
Very sturdy , as in freezer - strength ; the nutella is stiff enough that it ’ll split a standard sandwich bag . )
5 . Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the brownies , and return to oven for a couple of minutes to soften / melt .
Spread evenly over top of brownies using a spatula or some other tool .
Sprinkle the nuts on top while chocolate is melty .
6 . Cool completely in pan .
Cut into bars .
Now , if you use straight - up chips for the top , when it ’s completely cooled , what you ’ll have is solid chocolate , which can fragment when you cut it .
Best to cut it when it ’s only mostly solid ; or make some kind of ganache frosting ( too much work for me ! ) .
If you do n’t care if it ’s melty ( as in , people will be eating them in 30 seconds flat anyways ) , just cut them up while it ’s still gooey .
I have found , though , that the brownies are soft enough that they want some time chilling in the fridge ( or outdoors ) to firm up enough to cut without falling apart .
If you want to individually wrap these suckers for storage in the freezer , or gifts , I ’d advise cutting while semi-solid , then chilling until fully solid , then wrapping .
But who are we kidding , like they ’ll last that long !
Ha .
I mean , who could resist this :
In these parlous times , it is extremely comforting to know that while some AIG executives are busy counting their bonuses and Jim Aloisi 's sister is busy counting sheep , the super sleuths at our crack Department of Revenue have been able to track down a scurrilous deadbeat who goes by the name of Fran Dalton .
Fran Dalton , enemy of the state , is 80 years old , and if she makes 81 , she 'll be lucky .
She is badly stooped and uses something she fashioned out of a tree branch as a cane .
She used to weigh 160 pounds , but is now a wispy 115 .
She has a bad heart and every imaginable ailment known to octogenarians .
Despite all this , or maybe because of all this , she insists on smoking .
" It is my one and only pleasure , " she says .
" I do n't have much time left in this world . "
But before she departs this world , the state agency is determined to make Fran Dalton cough up 91 bucks and change , the amount its bureaucrats say Fran Dalton cheated the state out of by buying cigarettes from a mail - order company .
Fran Dalton , a retired artist , survives on about $ 600 a month , checks from Social Security , and the Veterans Affairs Administration .
She lives in a small , subsidized apartment in Newburyport .
The next - to - last time she bought a carton of Lucky Strikes , it cost something like 60 bucks , and that was in New Hampshire .
" Every cigarette I have , it 's a joy , " she says .
" It calms me .
It soothes me .
But I could n't afford them . "
Someone told her about a cigarette company run by Native Americans in New York that was selling by mail at discount prices .
She got the telephone number and ordered five cartons of the cheapest ones they had : nonfilter Senecas , at $ 14.89 a carton .
" They 're not bad , " Fran Dalton said .
" They taste a lot like Luckys . "
The Seneca tribe that runs the company does n't have to pay or collect taxes on products it sells .
But its salespeople send information about their customers to various states , which is why Fran Dalton got a letter from the Department of Revenue the other day demanding $ 91.58 .
The notice said that if she does n't pay up by April 6 , the state will add interest and penalties .
Well , they can start calculating , because Fran Dalton wo n't be paying .
" I do n't have much money , but it 's really not about the money .
It 's about the principle , " she said .
" I had no idea I was being taxed .
And . . . the tax amount is outrageous . "
There is , in fact , some microscopic print on the bottom of Fran Dalton 's invoice from the SmartSmoker company that says , " The purchaser is responsible for payment of any state , local , or excise tax . "
Fran Dalton said she never saw that disclaimer , and even if she had seen it she would n't have been able to read it .
Her eyes , like everything else , are n't what they used to be .
Massachusetts is adamant about collecting these taxes , and you can see the point .
After all , we need every penny we can get to give legislators the raises they orchestrated for themselves , not to mention the 14 grand we need each week to pay members of Sal DiMasi 's old staff , who are busy these days doing their best impression of Carol Aloisi .
Times are tough , the government tells us , and there 's no such thing as a free lunch .
Yesterday , Fran Dalton was sitting in the Salvation Army building in Newburyport , having , well , a free lunch .
" The churches take turns on different days , " she said .
" Wednesdays , they serve lunch here . "
So , if anybody from the state is looking to pinch the dangerous , seditious , and defiant Fran Dalton , she 'll be easy pickings any Wednesday , around noon , at the corner of Water and Fair streets .
You can't miss her .
She 's the one smoking Senecas .

SAN FRANCISCO , Jan. 31 ( UPI ) --
A baby born in San Francisco has six perfectly formed and functional fingers and toes on his hands and feet , say doctors at Saint Luke 's Hospital .
Kamani Hubbard 's extra digits look so normal they were n't noticed at first , said his mother , Miryoki Gross , of Daly City .

Extra digits run in the father 's side of the family , said dad Kris Hubbard , but none have been so perfectly developed .
Kris Hubbard himself had nubs of sixth fingers removed as a child because they were non-functioning , reported KTVU - TV , San Francisco .
That wo n't be the case with his son , born three weeks ago , because Kamani 's fingers and toes function perfectly , said Dr. Michael Treece .
" It 's merely an interesting and beautiful variation rather than a worrisome thing , " said Treece .
" Imagine what sort of a pianist a 12 - fingered person would be " or flamenco guitarist or typist , he said .
" I just want him to see what greatness will be in store for him , " said Kris Hubbard , noting famous polydactyly people include former Florida Marlins ' pitcher Antonio Alfonseca and the late blues guitarist Hound Dog Taylor .
Okay , it is not every day that you come across a home like this .
Sliding House , by dRMM
Architecture does something that we have never seen or heard any another house do – it slides .
At first glance , the form looks nothing special and gives you the idea of a regular timber barn until you realise that the entire outer skin ( the wooden part ) is capable of sliding back and forth .
Here is a short video in which the owner Ross Russel explains the concept of the house and shows how the sliding takes place .
A leaf from the designer dRMM ’s book :
The brief was a self - build house to retire to in order to grow food , entertain and enjoy the landscape .
The site offered a combination of rolling England and agricultural Holland , restrained by stringent local Planning parameters for rural development .
A genuine appreciation of vernacular farm buildings shared by architect and client led to a manipulation of the local timber framed and clad ‘ shed ’ idiom .
The outcome is three conventional building forms with unconventional detailing , radical performance , and a big surprise .
A linear building of apparent simplicity is sliced into three programmes ; house , garage and annexe .
The garage is pulled off axis to create a courtyard between the three .
The composition is further defined by material and colour ; red rubber membrane and glass , red and black stained larch .
The surprise : the separated forms can be transformed by a 20 ton mobile roof / wall enclosure which traverses the site , creating combinations of enclosure , open - air living and framing of views according to position .
This is an autonomous structure ; steel , timber , insulation and unstained larch spanning recessed railway tracks .
Movement is powered by hidden electric motors on wheels integrated into the wall thickness .
The tracks can be extended in the future should the client wish to build a swimming pool , which may need occasional shelter .
Sliding
House offers radically variable spaces , extent of shelter , sunlight and insulation .
The dynamic change is a physical phenomenon difficult to describe in words or images .
It is about the ability to vary the overall building composition and character according to season , weather , or a remote - controlled desire to delight .
At night , the home produces some interesting light patterns with the slide :
Besides the visual awe that the slide creates , it gives the control for its residents to adjust the heating , lighting and mood of the home to suit any weather .

This is a church signs debate , played out in a Southern town , between a Catholic church and Presbyterian church .
From top to bottom shows you the response and counter - response over time .
You get the impression that the Presbyterians are taking this seriously .
Origins : “ If there are no dogs in Heaven , then when I die I want to go where they went , ” humorist Will Rogers once declared .
Somewhat more cynically , writer James Thurber observed , “ If I have any beliefs about immortality , it is that certain dogs I have known will go to heaven , and very , very few persons . ”
Although
it may be the subject of a good deal of humor , the question of whether non-human animals go to heaven has been the topic of debates ranging from serious theological arguments to dinner table discussions , with answers spanning the spectrum from “ No ” ( because only those with souls are privileged to enter heaven ) to “ Yes ” ( because it would n’t really be heaven if it excluded our beloved pets ) to something in between ( e.g. , animals go to heaven , but they end up in a place separate from “ people heaven ” ) .
Regardless of where they stood on this great debate , many people found it amusing that a Presbyterian church and a Catholic church would be arguing the issue in public on their outdoor signs , especially in the form of barbed jabs directed at each other ’s theological interpretations .
To those whose enjoyment of this religious debate was based on the notion that it actually took place , we ’re sorry to say that it ’s all just a bit of Internet humor .
The fact that all the details in the pictures displayed above are identical save for the wording of the signs is a giveaway that the sequence was produced by someone using the Church Sign Generator web site .

About one in four women who have tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) expect pregnancy and motherhood to be a part of their future , recent research suggests .
A woman ’s age at the time she learns of her HIV status appears to influence this decision .
Women in an Ohio State University study who learned of their HIV infection when they were under age 30 were almost four times more likely to say they wanted to become pregnant than were women who were over 30 when they learned they had HIV .
Researchers say the findings point to a need for clinicians to be aware that women with HIV might be struggling with decisions about motherhood – a relatively new phenomenon accompanying the increase in HIV - positive women of childbearing age and the longer survival rates among patients who receive treatment .
“ We should n’t assume that women are n’t going to become pregnant or do n’t want to become pregnant now that they have HIV .
That ’s an erroneous assumption , ” said study co-author Julianne Serovich , professor and chair of human development and family science at Ohio State .
“ Clinicians should be routinely discussing pregnancy with HIV - positive women of childbearing age . ”
In 2005 , 29.5 percent of all new reported HIV infections and 27 percent of new AIDS cases in the United States were among women , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Twenty years earlier , only 5 percent of new AIDS cases were reported in women .
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS .
The study is published in a recent issue of the journal AIDS and Behavior .
The researchers collected questionnaires about pregnancy decisions from 74 women who were participants in a larger , long - term study led by Serovich that explored women ’s HIV disclosure decisions and mental health .
This particular line of research emerged from interviewers ’ observations that participants were talking about pregnancy and , in some cases , becoming pregnant .
Simultaneously , health care professionals were sharing stories with researchers about the women ’s success in avoiding transmission of the HIV virus to their babies .
“ It became obvious that this is a disease that is manageable for women , ” said lead study author Shonda Craft , who completed the research while she was a doctoral candidate at Ohio State .
“ If a woman is 19 years old and diagnosed with HIV , she can still assume she has her whole life ahead of her .
Deciding whether to have a family is part of the development process for young women , including these young women , ” said Craft , now an assistant professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota .
“ This study is about living with a chronic disease , and not just the physiological piece of that , but also the psychological and sociological factors , as well . ”
Women in the study were asked to quantify how influential several factors were on their decision about whether or not to become pregnant after their HIV diagnosis .
Aside from external influences , age emerged as a major factor in the choice .
Nearly 40 percent of women age 30 and younger chose to become pregnant while 11 percent of the women over 30 opted for pregnancy .
The most influential external factors on women ’s choices against pregnancy , regardless of age , were fear of transmitting HIV to a child or other concerns about preserving their own health .
Conversely , a powerful personal desire to have children was associated with a woman ’s choice to become pregnant .
Within the women ’s social network , medical personnel had the strongest influence on their decisions about pregnancy – either for or against having a baby .
Though there are no guarantees of safely conceiving and delivering a healthy baby for women with HIV , the medical community has found ways to reduce health risks for both mother and child , said Michael Brady , professor and chair of pediatrics at Ohio State and a co-investigator on the study ’s funding grant .
Women who are HIV - positive should receive antiretroviral medications throughout their pregnancy and during labor , and their newborns should receive antiretroviral medication for the first six weeks of life .
Delivery by Caesarean section also can reduce risk of transmission of the virus to the infant , but should be performed if required for the mother ’s health or if the mother ’s level of virus in the blood is high .
With optimal care , the risk of transmission can be as low as 1 percent , Brady said .
There is also a risk associated with conception of the child , Brady noted .
Though transmission of HIV from an infected woman to an uninfected male partner is not universal during unprotected sex , it can happen .
Even if both partners are already infected with HIV , an infected male partner might transmit a new strain of HIV to his infected female partner , which can cause problems for the mother and fetus as well .
“ We do n’t understand all of the factors that affect the risk of transmitting HIV with an individual sex act .
Taking medications and lowering the viral load reduces but does n’t eliminate the risk .
Some people interested in having a child may be willing to accept this risk .
But there is a risk , ” Brady said .
One finding of the study surprised the researchers .
Women who had the most negative self - image associated with their HIV status were also the most likely to want to become pregnant .
“ We would have predicted that the lower the stigma , the more likely women would choose to become pregnant .
We saw the exact opposite – that those with high stigma were making more choices in favor of pregnancy , ” Serovich said .
For some women who feel highly stigmatized by their disease , the rewards of pregnancy might offer therapeutic benefits , the researchers suggest .
“ When you ’re pregnant , you get lots of attention , people come up to you and touch your belly .
You get a shower , people do things for you .
There are certainly a lot of very positive repercussions of pregnancy that may help women feel better , ” Serovich said .
Though much of Serovich ’s earlier research focused on HIV - positive men , she sees a need for a deeper examination of issues facing women who are infected .
“ There has n’t been a lot of work done in this area and as women live longer and stay healthier , we need to know even more , ” she said .
“ What is clear is that women can live with this and have many options . ”

Venus
NASA may send a fleet of spacecraft to Venus after a planned mission to Jupiter and its moons set for launch in 2020 , the US space agency has said .
According to NASA , the USD 4 - billion Venus mission , to be launched between 2020 and 2025 , could reveal more about the planet ’s runaway greenhouse effect , any oceans it may have had , and the volcanic activity , the ‘ New Scientist ’ reported .
Two high - altitude balloons built to hover in sulphuric acid clouds could also be part of the fleet to Venus which has more in common with Earth than any other in terms of distance from the Sun , size and mass , the US space agency has said .
And , the mission ’s two balloons would each carry a gondola full of scientific instruments to sniff the atmosphere at an altitude of 55 kilometres .
In fact , in 2008 , NASA tasked a group of scientists to formulate goals for the mission .
The team ’s study outlines a plan to study the planet and the mission concept includes one orbiter , two balloons and two short - lived landers , all of which would launch into space on two Atlas V rockets .
“ Our understanding of Venus is so low , we really need this armada , ” team leader Mark Bullock of Southwest Research Institute in Colorado was quoted as saying .

How to Kiteboard
: Illegal string offset ' keywords_time ' inon line
Imagine …
the speed of wakeboarding without needing a boat .
the freedom of surfing without having to paddle out or time the waves .
the hangtime of motocross – with a much longer float .
Kiteboarding , Kitesurfing or whatever you ’d like to call it is fun and it ’s taking off .
How to Kiteboard / Kitesurf
Here are the steps to get started Kitesurfing
1. Get a Trainer Power Kite
This step is the most crucial for learning quickly – that ’s why it ’s mentioned first .
Trainer kites are smaller and simpler than full - sized kites .
They will teach you the basics on land before heading out to the water .
You wo n’t have the distraction of the board so you will only be learning the basics of kite flying .
Trainer kites are usually 2 line foil kites ranging in size from 1 to 3 meters .
Go for a good size such as 3 meters .
Trainer kites provide the basic knowledge of kite control and power zones of the wind window .
You will need to to perfect this kite control before moving to a larger power kite .
It will also save you money ( and frustration ) by cutting down on extra kite lessons .
It ’s best to get a trainer kite instructional DVD to practice your skills along with your new Trainer kite .
2. Strengthen your Board Skills
Sports such as wakeboarding , skateboarding and surfing will all improve your kitesurfing board skills .
Any experience you have with these sports will speed up your time learning to kiteboard .
The benefit of having strong board skills is that now you can focus on flying the kite instead learning to ride the board at the same time .
Ways to get good fast ?
Wakeboarding ( either board or cable park ) .
Hop on a long skateboard or mountain board and practice carving down hills .
Snowboard any chance you get as this is great for improving your edge control and ability to ride switch ( back foot forwards ) .
3 . Take a Lesson – critical step !
Lessons will cut your learning curve down considerably .
Find a qualified instructor and they will fast track your learning and make the experience fun .
He or she will be able to give you hands - on instruction for the technique and gear you will need to progress
You can learn a lot from the tutorials we have here ( link ) but they will not replace having an in - person lesson .
Just to say it again , lessons are not just valuable – they are critical for avoiding kitesufing accidents which result in injury to yourself , others and the reputation of our sport .
4. Use the Right Kite Surfing Equipment for your needs
Using the kite instructors gear before buying a full - size kite is a smart move .
You will save wear - and - tear on your gear as the first few times you will most likely crash the kite a few times .
This is not a big deal with the foil trainer kites , but the bigger kites need more care .
They will explain to you the differences between different kite shapes and sizes so you will know the right gear to buy .
But make sure they understand the type of kitesurfing equipment that is right for you .
This means getting the gear best suited for your skill level , size and kite conditions .
Too many beginner kitesufers buy gear that is n’t right for them .
Take some time to read through this site so you so you can get the right gear the first time .
This howtokite.com site was designed by kitesurfers to provide the best information to help get you started and off the ground …. literally .
The purpose of this site is to give you the information you need so you will choose us to buy the kitesurfing equipment you need .
In review :
1 . Get a trainer kite – and practice
2. Strengthen up your Board skills .
3. Take a Lesson
4 . Buy the right gear for your needs
How to Kiteboard – continued
Learning how to kiteboard will present you with an entirely new world of freedom , intensity and sheer pleasure .
Learning how to kiteboard can present challenges , but for those that get beyond the first few lessons and start riding on their own , there are endless smiles and any challenges that may have existed in the startup phase are soon forgotten .
Lessons with a professional instructor present an opportunity to learn how to kitesurf in an environment that is safe and will allow for focus on the skills you ’ll need to improve over time .
I ca n’t emphasize enough how much faster you ’ll progress if you ’re able to learn the skills correctly the first time .
Seven or eight years ago there may have been a lack of instructors simply because the sport was so new .
Now , the gear has improved significantly as far as safety considerations and the instruction is top notch .
Please understand that the learning process and reading about kitesurfing online or in books and magazines is not enough .
Getting instruction in an environment where you are n’t risking injury or worse to yourself or others is vital to maximizing the joy you ’ll get out of this amazing sport .
That said , the dynamics and physics of how to kitesurf involve harnessing the power of the wind to build up enough speed to keep the rider planing across the water .
After the instructor - led basic training with a practice kite , learning how to steer the kite and simulating the riding , learning figure 8 patterns , and feeling the power that a kite will generate , the next step is body - dragging .
This is not as bad as it sounds , but involves the rider in the water with a larger kite and while connected to the kite with the harness , practicing the same sine ( up and down ) pattern in a specific direction while being pulled or “ dragged ” through the water .
This also allows the new rider to feel what type of power the kite will be generating when diving the kite which is what will eventually pull the rider out of the water .
How to Kite
There is a significant amount of pull required to get the rider out of the water and planing .
Having a solid concept of what the kite is doing by feeling where it is and what it is doing requires practice .
Learning how to kiteboard is your ticket to a truly new world .
The community you ’ll be a part of is friendly , open , and loves the same freedom you ’ll soon experience learning how to kiteboard .

NEW YORK --
By the end of Saturday 's massacre at the new Yankee Stadium , it was difficult to tell who was more fatigued : the arms in the Yankees bullpen or the people behind the manual scoreboards in the outfield .
The Indians blasted the Yankees and starting pitcher Chien - Ming Wang in a 22 - 4 rout that was beamed on national television , and featured the worst inning in Yankees ' franchise history .
Wang teamed up with reliever Anthony Claggett ( making his big league debut ) to surrender a franchise record 14 runs on 13 hits in the second inning , which lasted 37 excruciating minutes .
The last time the Indians scored that many runs in a frame was in 1950 against the Philadelphia Athletics .
The last time a big - league team scored 14 runs in an inning was the Boston Red Sox back in 2003 .
Wang 's performance -- which resembled batting practice , only the balls were hit harder -- was particularly frightening .
Wang lasted just 1 1/3 innings , allowing eight hits and eight earned runs , a performance that will again trigger questions about his health .
He 's allowed 23 runs in six innings this season .
He is only the second pitcher -- joining Baltimore 's Hayden Penn in 2006 -- to allow seven or more runs in three straight starts to begin a season .
In the Yankees ' six losses this season , four have come after allowing double - digits runs .

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has been accused of swearing on purpose on national television to increase his appeal to voters .
Last night on Channel 7 Mr Rudd dropped the word " shit " as he spoke to sacked Pacific Brands workers about the Government 's decision to spend billions stimulating the economy .
" People have to understand that , because there 's going to be the usual political shit storm , sorry , political storm , over that , " he said .
His comments were applauded by the audience .
But this morning Melbourne 's Liberal Mayor Robert Doyle and Opposition frontbencher Peter Dutton both accused Mr Rudd of scripting the moment .
Mr Doyle told Sky News Mr Rudd did so to " sound human " .
" He usually gives a pretty robotic performance so I 'm sure that that was a clever little snare in there to make him sound like one of the lads , " he said .
Mr Dutton said Mr Rudd 's slip up showed he was a " phony " .
" We 've said all along , and I think people are starting to see it now , that Kevin Rudd is certainly manufactured , " he said .
" He wants to talk and appeal to workers in the audience and it was a scripted moment . "
But Labor frontbencher Mark Arbib said the moment was definitely a mistake .
" It looked like a slip up to me , " he said .
" The Prime Minister is very emotional about the issue of job losses .
He feels it . "
The Killer Rabbit is one of the most memorable movie animal characters and definitely of the top Monty Python creations .
The funny scene alone makes the Monty Python and the Holy Grail stand out as one of the funniest flicks I have ever seen , and it was great to find some various gadgets and products that bring this rabbit to life .
For those unfamiliar with the furry but vicious animal or for the others who want another laugh , the scene could be found below … still crazy after all these years .
Killer Rabbit Plush Toy
This cute rabbit may seem harmless at first sight , but it is a vicious animal that takes no prisoners .
Yes , it is a plush toy that would be fun to hold and hang on to , but you could also reenact the famous Holy Grail scene to your friends and family and have plenty of your own laughs .
It goes for only $ 16.99 at ThinkGeek.com and would be one animal toy that even some men would love to own .
Killer Rabbit Stapler
You may have a job that leaves you bored and tired , but this stapler could grant you an easy laugh or even a giggle with every look .
Created with wonderful detail and feel , this Killer Rabbit may be an office product , but does come with some staples which if mishandled could bring the cruel predator right back to life .
This version of the Holy Grail animal is $ 19.99 and also end up being a practical gadget .
Killer Rabbit Slippers
Sneak up on your enemies during the night without making a sound with the crazy animal literally at your feet .
While on one hand being a disturbed animal , these slippers would also keep your feet warm during the cold night .
A pair will set you back $ 34.99 at ThinkGeek.com , but for the major fans it is a product that should not be overlooked .
Killer Rabbit T Shirt
You could always simply show your Monty Python love for this furry killer animal by wearing the specially designed T Shirt which also zooms in on the rabbit ’s crazy teeth .
Also , it is also $ 19.99 , so it wo n’t hurt as much as the animal usually does .
You cannot deny the power of this Killer , and as was said in another of Monty Python ’s films : ‘ The Hare is Very High and the Sauce is Very Rich ’ .
By measuring the photon signatures left when light bounces off photosynthesizing cells , astronomers may soon have a new tool for detecting extraterrestrial organisms .
" When you look at objects in the solar system , what 's a high - probability way of determining whether or not that planet has life ? " said Neill Reid , a Space Telescope Science Institute astrobiologist .
" Circular polarization has the potential to be a signature of life . "
Other proposed signs of life include gases produced by biological processes , or infrared light reflected by radiation - tolerant microbes .
However , those methods are limited .
Not all microbes are radiation - tolerant , and nonbiological processes can sometimes produce gases typically associated with life .
The new technique exploits the tendency of some photons to adopt a corkscrewed rather than up - and - down wavelength after hitting a molecule .
Those photons are said to be circularly polarized , and their precise path is dictated by the molecule that sets them spinning .
Put a spectrometer calibrated to detect life - specific circular polarized light on a telescope , and you 'd have " a powerful remote sensing technique for generic life searches , " the researchers wrote Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Critical to their system is the tendency of all living creatures to be made from groups of so - called homochiral molecules .
Chirality refers to the " handedness " of molecules , which often contain the same constituent atoms arranged in mirror - image forms .
The amino acids in all Earthly life are left - handed , while DNA and RNA are made from right - handed molecules .
That configuration produced the circular polarization wavelengths identified in two species of photosynthesizing bacteria by Reed 's team , which was led by STSI colleague Bill Sparks and University of
Hertfordshire astrophysicist James Hough .
Whether those signatures are also present in more complex organisms has yet to be determined .
However , the researchers consider the bacteria , believed to be direct - line descendants of species that evolved three billion years ago , to be a plausible stand - in for early life elsewhere in the universe .
It 's also possible that the homochirality seen on Earth is not universal .
" You can conceive of life where homochirality is not so widespread , " said Sandra Pizzarello , an Arizona State University biochemist who was not involved in the study .
" It happens that on
Earth , amino acids are left - handed , but if you think of the possibilities out there , that 's not strictly necessary .
But Pizzarello still called the work " ingenious . "
Any search for extraterrestrial life relies on Earth - based assumptions , and those the researchers made are at least sound , she said .
" They say that photosynthesis is plausibly commonplace , and that 's true , " Pizzarello said .
Adding weight to the assumption of widespread homochirality is the predominance of left - handedness among amino acids found in meteorites that struck Earth .
The researchers ' life - detecting apparatus is presently restricted to a laboratory bench , but could eventually be installed in large telescopes and space - faring satellites , said Reid .
The researchers next plan to measure circular polarization in other organisms , and to analyze circular polarized light reflected from Mars .

Babcock Ranch , Florida
What better place than the Sunshine State for the world ’s first solar - powered city ?
Called Babcock Ranch , the 17,000 - acres - large community will have its energy needs supplied by a $ 300 million , 75 megawatt solar - powered generator .
The city will also integrate a Smart Grid for powering electric vehicles .
( Pics )
While construction wo n’t begin until later this year , Floridian city planners have some ambitious numbers for the solar community : 19,500 homes , 20,000 permanent jobs , 6 million square feet of retail / industrial space and 8,000 acres reserved for open space and greenways .
The biggest hurdle , though , may come after construction when it comes time to populate Babcock .
It ’ll be interesting to see what kind of incentives city planners offer – electric vehicles are n’t cheap , after all .

The most succinct description of what is wrong with Geithner 's PPIP toxic asset plan comes from the Financial Times :
Critics say that would leave the same amount of toxic assets in the system as before , but with the government now liable for most of the losses through its provision of non-recourse loans .
That 's exactly right .
American banks that have received billions in bailout funds , including Citigroup Inc , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co , are considering buying toxic assets to be sold by rivals under the Treasury 's trillion dollar plan ( and Bank of America - another big bailout recipient - is buying toxic assets as well ) .
The amount of toxic assets is n't going to be meaningfully reduced - the assets will just be shuffled from one bailout buddy to another .
But the government is guaranteeing 85 % of the value of the toxic assets .
So the taxpayers ( who anteed up for the bailout funds which the banks are now using to purchase the assets ) will again pick up the tab when the assets turn out to not be worth as much as the banks are paying for them .
But why would the banks overpay for the other guy 's toxic assets ?
Some financial writers have speculated that these banks are giving each other kickbacks under the table .
But we do n't even have to go there .
If all of the big banks holding the lion 's share of toxic assets ( about 5 banks , as discussed below ) have a gentleman 's agreement to overpay for the other guy 's toxic assets , then they will end up in the same position as if they had all paid fair market value .
You overpay for mine , I 'll overpay for yours . . .
But since they can then say that they naively overvalued the assets , the government will pay them back for their " losses " .
Get it ?

The rock ant is tiny , even for an ant .
Individually each ant is the size of comma on this page .
Their colonies are small too .
Numbering about 100 workers , plus one queen , they normally nest between slivers of crumbling rock , hence their common name .
Their entire society can fit into the glass case of a watch , or between the one - inch covers of a microscope slide , which is where they are usually bred in laboratories .
The brain of a rock ant contains less than 100,000 neurons and is so small as to be invisible .
Yet an rock ant mind can perform an amazing feat of calculation .
To assess the potential of a new nesting site , rock ants will measure the dimensions of the room in total darkness and then calculate – and that is the proper word – the volume and desirability of it .
For many millions of years , rock ants have used a mathematical trick that was only discovered by humans in 1733 .
Rock ants can estimate the volume of a space , even an irregular shaped one , by randomly laying a scent trail across the floor of the space , “ recording ” the length of that line , and then counting the number of times it encounters that scented line during additional diagonal runs across the floor .
The calculated area is inversely proportional to the frequency of intersections times length .
In other words , the ants discovered an approximate value for Π derived by intersecting diagonals .
Headroom is measured by the ants with their bodies and then “ multiplied ” with the area to give an approximate volume of their hole .
But these incredible tiny ant minds do more .
They measure the width and number of entrances , the amount of light , the proximity of neighbors , and the degree of hygiene for the room .
Then they tally these variables and calculate a desirability score for the potential nest by a process that resembles a “ weighted additive ” fuzzy logic formula in computer science .
All in 100,000 neurons .
The minds of animals are legion , and even fairly dumb ones can yield amazement .
Asian elephants will strip away branches to construct a fly - switch to keep pesky flies away from their hind parts .
Beavers , mere rodents , have been known to stockpile construction materials before starting to build their dam , thus displaying the ability to anticipate a future intent .
Beavers can even outwit humans trying to prevent their dams from flooding fields .
Clever Homo sapiens will install ingenious “ beaver baffler ” drainage tubes upstream to siphon off water lower than the dam level , but the rodents can somehow figure this out and engineer ways to plug the intake – a modern need that would not ordinarily come about in nature .
Squirrels , another rodent , continually outwit very smart human suburbanites over control of their backyard birdfeeders .

Biologists have witnessed hawks submerging hard - to - kill prey underwater till they drown .
The honeyguide bird in Kenya lures humans to wild bee nests so that the birds can feast on the remaining bee brood after the humans remove the honey ; sometimes according to researchers the honeyguide will “ deceive ” the hunters of the actual distance to a deep forest nest if it is more than 2 kilometers away .
Asked what he could infer about nature ’s Creator , biologist J. B. S. Haldane reputedly concluded that He must have “ an inordinate fondness for beetles . ”
But far more than beetles , nature displays an inordinate fondness for minds .
Since every species of insect , and every animal , yields a mind , however limited , there are more minds , and more varieties of minds than beetles .
Nature has a fundamental affinity , if not fondness , for intelligence .
Plants , too , posses a decentralized type of intelligence .
As Anthony Trewavas argues in his remarkable paper , “ Aspects of Plant Intelligence , ” plants demonstrate a slow version of problem solving that fit most of our definitions of animal intelligence .
They perceive their environment in great detail , they assess threats and competition , then they take action to either adapt or remedy the problems , and anticipate future states .
Time - lapse motion pictures that speed up the action of vine tendrils probing their neighborhood make it clear that plants are closer to animals in their behavior than our fast lives permit us to see .
Charles Darwin may have been the first to observe this .
He wrote in 1822 , “ It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the root acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . ”
Like sensitive fingers , roots will caress the soil , seeking out moisture and nutrients much as a nose or trunk of a herbivore might dig in the earth .
Plants share with animals an almost mathematical ability to optimize their energy efficiency while gathering the most nutrients for the least effort .
Plant and animal “ foraging ” models are almost identical .
Roots search for fertile areas while avoiding adversarial competitors .
A distant rootlet can also recognize another rootlet as its own among many the underground tangle of roots , even when all the neighboring plants are genetic clones .
Thus , says Trewavas , “ Individual plants are able to distinguish self from non-self . ”
Plants are in constant motion because their world is in motion .
The microclimates around a plant vary by height above ground .
The density of carbon dioxide and sunlight can vary by the minute as wind blows and shade shifts .
Available nutrients vary by the day as other plants thrive nearby .
Growth factors vary by the seasons and temperature , and they vary by the decade as the ecological progression changes .
A plant ’s entire shape , metabolism , and behavior will thus change by the minute as well , as if it is being governed by a nervous system .
It can quickly fill its green leaves with toxins or anti-fungal pesticides to retaliate if animals or parasites munch on it .
As competing plants invade its territory a plant can alter the orientation and the structure of its parts by deflating the stomata on one side of its leaves to bend them in certain directions .
A plant can thus “ see ” its environment and move in response to this sight .
Some plants walk across a landscape , branch bent to root raised to branch again , on the scale of decades .
The ability of a leaf to follow the sun ( heliotropism ) to gain optimal light exposure can be replicated in a machine , but only by using a fairly sophisticated computer chip as a brain .
A plant thinks without a brain .
It uses a vast network of transducing molecular signals instead of electronic nerves to carry and process information .
Remarkably a plant mind also contains a memory .
There are numerous examples of plants remembering signals for days , and even years .
A memory is a way to move information from the past into the present .
Plants can also move information from the present into future , or anticipate , which is a true mark of the most primitive intelligence .
When a nearby competing plant dies , opening up previous shade to light , some plants send out “ exploratory speculative growth ” in order to test the new zone with small investments of chlorophyll before spending big time on expensive branches and leaves .
Light reflected from nearby vegetation is richer in far - red wavelengths than unreflected light .
Plants can use this information to not only see shade , but to anticipate the likelihood of shading by a competitor in the future .
“ When a change in the balance of red to far - red radiation is perceived , ” says Trewavas , “ an integrated adaptive response in phenotype structure [ of the plant ] results .
New branches grow away from the putative competitor , stem growth is increased ; the rate of branching diminishes , and such branches assume a more vertical direction : leaf area increases in anticipation of reduced incident flux ; and the number of layers of leaf cells containing chlorophyll diminishes . ”
Plants exhibit all the characteristics of intelligence , except they do it without a centralized brain , and in slow motion .
Decentralized minds and slow minds are actually quite common in nature , and occur at many levels throughout the six kingdoms of life .
A slime mold colony can solve the shortest distance to food in a maze , much like a rat .
The animal immune system , whose primary purpose is to distinguish between self and non-self , retains a memory of outside antigens it has encountered in the past .
It learns in a darwinian process , and in a sense also anticipates future variations of antigens .
And throughout the animal kingdom collective intelligence is expressed in hundreds of ways , including the famous hive minds of social insects .
The manipulation , storage , and processing of information is a central theme of life .
Learning erupts over and over again in the history of evolution , as if it were a force waiting to be released .
A charismatic version of intelligence – the kind of anthropomorphic smartness we associate with apes – evolved not just in primates , but in at least two other unrelated taxon : in the whales , and birds .
Stories of dolphin intelligence are famous .
Dolphins and whales not only demonstrate intelligence , they occasionally give hints they share a style of intelligence with us hairless apes .
For instance , captive dolphins have been known to train each other .
Yet the most recent common ancestor for apes , whales , dolphins was 250 million years ago .
In between apes and dolphins are many families of animals without this variety of thought .
We can only surmise that this style of intelligence evolved independently .
The same can be said for birds .
Measured by their intelligence , crows , ravens and parrots are the “ primates ” of birds .
The size of their forebrain is as relatively large as non-human apes , and the ratio of their brain weight to body weight is in the same line as apes .
Like primates , crows live long and in complex social groups .
New Caledonian crows , like chimpanzees , craft tiny spears to fish for grubs in crevices .
Sometimes they save the manufactured spears and carry them around .
In experiments with scrub - jays , researchers discovered that that jays would rehide their food later if another bird was watching them when they first hid it , but only if the jays had been robbed before .
Naturalist David Quammen suggests that crow and raven behavior is so clever and peculiar that they should be evaluated “ not by an ornithologist but by a psychiatrist . ”
The famous African grey parrot Alex was taught to name colors , size , and shapes , and to put together simple spoken phrases .
When questioned about novel objects he had not seen before , he could give correct answers about 80 % of the time .
He could also count to six .
The common ancestor for birds , whales and apes was 280 million years ago .
The vast majority of smart animals lie between these three very anthropomorphic taxon .
Thus , charismatic intelligence evolved independently three times : in birds on wing , in mammals that returned to the sea , and in primates .
It may have even evolved a fourth time .
Birds are the only dinosaurs that survived the great dinosaur wipeout 65 million years ago .
But it is very probable that before they disappeared large dinosaurs were way ahead of archaic mammals ( typically no bigger than gophers ) on the race to reach complex intelligence .
Because birds today with their small brains can surprise us , dinosaurs with much larger brains may have been as smart as apes .
Had dinos not vanished under the assault of the heavens , consciousness might have been birthed on earth in a highly evolved reptile , rather than a mammal .
We can easily speculate about an alternative world where Saurians ran the place .
A few years ago palaeontologist Dale Russell sketched out what Dinoman could have looked like .
He would be warm - blooded , 1.33 meters tall , and weigh 32 kilograms .
Smartness is a competitive advantage everywhere .
We see the widespread recurrence and reinvention of intelligence because the living universe is a place where learning makes a difference .
Organisms are so highly evolved to their respective ecological niches that in terms of variation almost every part of a creature is unique to that species .
A good biologist , for instance , can identify an animal from its teeth alone .
For the same reasons animal minds also vary by species to fit that animal ’s livelihood .
There are hundreds of types of learning in the animal kingdom .
Rats excel at the expert spatial intelligence they need to navigate a maze , while their cousins the guinea pigs fail in that department .
Humming birds excel at timing , primates in social intelligence .
If we knew enough about animal minds a good biologist could identify an animal solely from its species of intelligence .
What we call “ intelligence ” is in reality a suite of different specialty learning programs , and each species of intelligence is a different mix of those sub programs .
One species of intelligence will dial up counting , while another dials up long - tem memory , or neglects social intelligence .
Yet , a few animal behaviorists claim that to a rough order of magnitude , all animal intelligence shares a universal core .
“ There are no qualitative differences in cognition between animal species in the processes of learning and memory , ” says Euan Macphail .
“ Pigeon , rat , monkey … does n’t matter .
Once you have allowed for differences in the ways in which they make contact with the environment … what remains of their behavior shows astonishingly similar properties , ” says B.F. Skinner .
“ There are no consistent differences on such tasks between the performance of goldfish , pigeons , and chimpanzees , ” says David McFarland .
“ … There ’s an impressive similarity in basic associative learning among diverse species , ” says Leslie Real .
Edward Thorndike , one of the first animal behaviorists , was convinced the universal mind extended to invertebrates as well .
He saw a common intelligence in honey bees and octopus .
He believed that “ octopus show precisely the type of progressive improvement in reversal problems [ learn one pattern then reverse it ] that the rat and monkey show . ”
In fact there is one report of octopuses learning a task while watching another octopus be trained ( and rewarded ) .
A fair number of scientists have tested lowly planarians with a full battery of IQ tests .
Planarians are flat worms , tiny slugs .
They turn out to be smarter than anyone would have guessed .
The problem in gauging the distribution of intelligence is that we ca n’t use the same test for every animal .
You ca n’t measure a worm ’s intelligence the same way you measure a walrus’s .
Their niches , and input / output systems , are so different no uniform test is practical .
When you devise a test that is suitable for a particular creature – say a maze for a rat , or levers for a pigeon — what you are really measuring is that animal ’s specialty intelligence which has been evolved for its environment .
Beneath this mix of specialty intelligences runs a more universal mind .
All creatures seem to share a core mind based on elemental learning , memory , and decision - making routines , but with different operational characteristics for different inputs and environment .
Up and down the six kingdoms of life , minds have evolved many times .
So many times , in fact , that minds seem inevitable .
Yet , as inordinately fond as nature is of minds , the technium , or the seventh kingdom of life , is even more so .
The technium is biased to birth minds .
All the inventions we have constructed to assist our own minds – our many storage devices , signal processing , flows of information , and distributed communication networks , – all these are also the essential ingredients for producing new minds .
And so new minds spawn in the technium in inordinate degrees .
Technology is anything a mind makes .
Built by minds , the technium is primed to make more minds .
These mind children will be small , dim , and dumb at first , but tiny minds keep getting better .
And more abundant .
Last year there were 1 billion electronic brains etched into silicon .
Many contained a billion transistors each but the smallest had a minimum of 100,000 transistors , about as many neurons as the brain of the rock ant .
They , too , can do surprising feats .
Tiny synthetic ant - minds know where on earth they are ( GPS ) , and how to get back to your home , and remember the names of your friends , and translate foreign languages .
These dim minds are finding their way into everything : shoes , door knobs , books , lamps , pets , beds , clothes , cars , light switches , kitchen appliances and toys .
We are blind to this massive eruption of minds in the technium because humans have a chauvinistic bias towards any kind of intelligence that does not precisely mirror a human’s .
Unless an artificial mind behaves exactly like a human , we do n’t count it as intelligent .
Sometimes we dismiss it by calling it “ machine learning . ”
So while we are n’t looking , billions of tiny minds , on the scale of biology , have blossomed in the technium .
One of the smartest artificial minds going is a website that plays the classic game of twenty questions .
Nobody , including the inventors , calls it an artificial mind .
In this game you think of something and the software mind in the website ’s servers , called 20Q , will guess what you are thinking of after 20 yes - no questions .
20 Q will guess right 80 % of the time , and if you let it go on to ask 25 questions , it will nail what you are thinking 98 % of the time .
With 10 million synaptic connections , 20Q is about as smart as a house fly – if a fly spent its brain power on answering questions instead of flying .
20 Q has been trained to think by people playing the game .
It has been played , or trained , over 70 million times so far .
It has been learning since 1988 .
No other AI has lived so long .
20 Q ’s bottom - up training produces answers that reflect what people in general think .
If most people believe a book has a spine , it does too .
If most people believe “ blue ” is something you can wear , it is .
What 20Q believes can change day to day .
Creator Robin Burgener says , “ It has a personality .
Some days it does well , and some days , it ’s just off . ”
There are a dozen different language - specific 20Qs , so the questions play out differently in different languages .
A smaller version of the American / English mind has been extracted and squeezed into a tiny chip inside a plastic toy orb about the size of a snow globe .
Some 35 million of these handheld micro-minds have been sold .
This autonomous 20Q knows only 2,000 objects , but its still a marvel .
Most children can’t stump it .
Because it is so small , so self - contained ( it sits in your hand like a sea urchin ) , its intelligence is shocking to the unprepared .
For about ten dollars you can get a tiny insect mind which , in one narrow specialty , is smarter than you are .
The cramped , autistic mind of a $ 10 digital calculator is another species of intelligence , currently produced in the hundreds of millions .
It also is an alien intelligence smarter than you — in mathematics .
Billions of insect - like artificial minds have spawned deep into the technium doing invisible , low - profile chores like reliably detecting credit - card fraud , or filtering email spam , or reading text from documents .
These proliferating micro-minds run speech recognition on the phone , assist in crucial medical diagnosis , and aid stock market analysis , power fuzzy logic appliances , and guide automatic gearshifts and brakes in cars .
A few experimental minds can even drive a car autonomously for a hundred miles .
Two arenas where artificial minds are flourishing without disguise is in multi-player online games , and in web search .
In game ’s artificial intelligences ( AI ) can inhabit non-human players in order to make the game more exciting or challenging .
Other types of game AIs ( such as those in Left 4 Dead ) work behind the scenes creating dynamic narratives for human players .
The artificial tiny minds generate new monsters , sounds , or actions based on a player ’s previous game .
Or they place enemies based on each player ’s location , status , and skill .
Some game AIs ( as in Spore ) will complete your actions in a smart way .
The artificial intelligence behind internet search does not pretend – at the moment – to be human .
In fact , web AI ’s main attraction is its ability to find material in a way no human could –- by remembering everything .
However , in the near future services which can understand queries asked in ordinary language will make the web ’s non-human intelligence seem more human .
Then the AI will feel less alien , and more familiar .
Unlike the billions of minds in the wild , the minds of the technium are getting smarter by the year .
There seems to be no place a mind ca n’t be born , or inserted .
Technology wants to produce minds .
The daily grinding of evolution , as accelerated by technology , churns out more and more complex organisms , with higher rates of energy use , and with increasing specialization .
Minds are the ideal way to express complexity , energy density , increasing specialization , expanding diversity — all in one system .
Mindedness is what evolution produces .
Mindedness is what technology wants , too .
The protections against any government department using surveillance unjustifiably are , in theory , considerable .
Public authorities have to be " satisfied " that surveillance is " necessary and proportionate " .
Officials are meant to " consider the impact of these techniques on the privacy of those under investigation " .
Public authorities who use surveillance are " subject to independent inspection " .
The practice , however , has been very different .
Officials frequently seem to think that they are justified in spying on private citizens if they suspect them of any violation , however apparently insignificant .
That explains the hundreds of hours spent secretly observing whether people have been
recycling correctly , or have let their dogs foul the pavement .

A Street View car with its camera mounted on the roof Angry residents in Milton Keynes blocked the driver of a Google Street View car when he started taking photographs of their homes .
Police were called to Broughton after residents staged the protest , accusing Google of invading their privacy and " facilitating crime " .
Councillor John
Bint told the BBC the camera mounted on a car was intrusive and people should have been consulted .
Google said it observed UK law and only filmed from public areas .
The company also said it had consulted various police forces and provided the means for residents to have their home removed from the service .
' Step too far '
Mr Bint said : " When a scene is viewed from street level it is acceptable but this camera is intrusive because it can peer into gardens and into the windows of homes .
" That is a step too far and Google should stop taking pictures in this way .
" They should consult with residents about what exactly they are going to do and provide a right of appeal . "
The Street View mapping project allows for 360 - degree views of roads and homes using footage taken by a camera mounted on a car .

Resident Paul Jacobs was one of the first residents in the village , which is part of Milton Keynes , to challenge the Google car .
Mr Jacobs said he saw the vehicle driving past his home on Wednesday and his first reaction was one of anger .
" I do n't have a problem with Google wanting to promote villages .
What I have a problem with is the invasion of privacy , taking pictures directly into the home , " he said .
" Google have taken a tremendous liberty in the way they 've gone about it .
" If they were simply going to view the street as a street scene rather than drive almost into people 's drives and take pictures of the houses - I think that 's a different issue . "
Thames Valley Police said : " A squad car was sent to Broughton at 1020 BST on Wednesday to reports of a dispute between a crowd of people and a Google Street View contractor .
The village was also featured in the local papers yesterday and much of the national press this morning .
So how private is this place now ?
Rory Cellan - Jones 's blog " A member of the public had called us to report that he , along with a number of others , were standing in the middle of the road preventing the car from moving forwards and taking photographs .
" They felt his presence was an intrusion of their privacy .
When police arrived at the scene , the car had moved on . "
Google 's Peter Barron said the system contained " simple tools " which allowed people to remove images of their house .
He said : " Many , many millions of people have used the service very happily , and it 's proved very useful .
" But we do recognise that a small minority of people wo n't feel comfortable about it . "

The party on Wall Street is over , and the holidays are n’t going to change that .
Banking company Morgan Stanley – having weathered a financial crisis that crippled profits and took its shares on a wild roller - coaster ride – has cancelled all plans for Christmas festivities this year , according to an internal memo distributed Friday that was obtained by The Post .
Christmas parties are a big deal at banks – a chance to blow off steam after a year ’s worth of unbridled dealmaking – so it ’s no small issue for top brass to cut them out .
After months of dreary headlines about layoffs and bankruptcies at competing banks , Morgan bankers lamented to The Post about the kibosh put to the year - end bashes , which now add to the insult of their nonexistent bonuses .
Nevertheless , the soured economy is poised to take a heavy toll on charities and nonprofit groups “ that depend explicitly on donations , many from the financial - services sector , ” Tom Nides , Morgan ’s chief administrative officer , said in the memo .
“ To help ease that pressure , we have asked all divisions to forgo their firm - sponsored holiday parties this year and instead help us apply those designated funds toward helping those most in need , ” Nides wrote .
Morgan ’s sober move follows similar measures at rivals including Barclays , which last month informed employees – including those corralled from its acquisition of Lehman Bros . ’
North American business - that the crisis was forcing firms to rethink the idea of spending company cash for a big party .
Media reps at Barclays and Morgan declined to comment .
Former President Carter Urges Marijuana Legalization
" In a message to Congress in 1977 , I said the country should decriminalize the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana , with a full program of treatment for addicts , " Carter wrote .
" I also cautioned against filling our prisons with young people who were no threat to society , and summarized by saying : ' Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself . '
" " Those ideas were widely accepted at the time , " Carter wrote .
" But in the 1980s President Ronald Reagan and Congress began to shift from balanced drug policies , including ...

It never ceases to amaze me how the Federal Government can take a simple issue , and make it as complex as an eight layer cake .
But if we take the time to do the math , we certainly spend a lot to stimulate a little .
First , it should be clear to everyone that in the end , it is you and I that spend our money that fuel the economy of this nation .
Take away the individual earners and consumers and you have no reason for any of the rest of the system called the US Industrial complex to exist .
When we do the math ( depending on which numbers you choose to use ) , we are spending via this Stimulus Plan a little less than $ 3000 per person to stimulate the economy .
But borrowing money to spend it has never been a good thing .
And in the end most of this money will be spent poorly , providing little return on the dollar for those that will have to pay it back at a later date .
If we want to restore confidence , if we want to restore faith , if we wanted to get money flowing once again , I suggest that we should have taken a different approach .
Each individual assigned a Social Security Number should receive a $ 3500 lifetime tax credit to offset their Federal Income taxes for the years 2008 and beyond .
This tax credit will exist until it has been fully used by each individual .
This plan leaves more money in the hands of those working now .
It encourages people to work harder to earn more now to take advantage of the tax credit .
This plan allows the individual to spend the money on what they need as they see fit rather than waiting for some sort of trickle around approach that will need to occur as the money flows from business back to the individual .
This plan is immediate .
Workers can change their tax withholdings today .
Tax filers could take the deduction from their 2008 Federal Income taxes today .
No delay .
No waiting to see if and when they receive a benefit .
This immediate benefit will provide confidence to all of us .
Individuals who cannot take full advantage of the benefit in one year will have the ability to use the benefit over multiple years .
We are all treated fairly in this manner .
This plan encourages individuals to seek work because they will earn income free of Federal Income taxes until they have used their credit .
That is what stimulus should be .
This plan requires no Federal oversight that is not already in place .
This plan is measurable as we will be able to see how much of this Stimulus is claimed each year via the Federal Income Tax filings .
Best of all , this plan would have reduced the power of the Federal Government and placed a bit of it back into the hands of We , the People .
This plan also means that we will be “ borrowing ” from the future tax revenues of the Federal Government .
Now they will have an incentive to get out of the way of business , something which they do not have today .
But no additional money would have to be borrowed or printed for this plan to be put into effect today .
We would just need to have the politicians control their spending as we accelerate our spending .
I 'd rather borrow from myself rather than the rest of the world .
Perhaps that is why we will never see a plan such as this .
What are your thoughts ?
Tell me what you think .
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
Improvements to unittest : new asserts , better failure messages and more to come
PyCon was simply amazing .
As with last year I really enjoyed the sprints , and this year I worked with Gregory Smith .
We integrated a patch contributed by Google that adds a whole bunch of new asserts for providing more useful failure messages when comparing containers , long strings etc .
We wired these into assertEqual so that you do n't need to call them directly unless you are using subclasses of the specified types .
The changes and discussion are tracked in issue 2578 .
These improvements are checked in and will be in the Python 2.7 and Python 3.1 releases .
One improvement already in unittest is to make assertRaises a context manager , and we added assertRaisesRegexp also as a context manager .
When you are testing APIs , the error messages are often ' part of the API ' , and this method allows you test the error messages with a regular expression :
with self .
assertRaisesRegexp ( TypeError , '^ You screwed up $ ' ) :
ThisFunctionTakesAString ( None )
Assert methods added , some more useful than others , are :
assertRaisesRegexp
assertIn / assertNotIn
assertIsNone / assertIsNotNone
assertIs / assertIsNot
assertDictEqual / assertListEqual / assertSetEqual / assertTupleEqual - used automatically by assertEqual
assertMultiLineEqual - for comparing long strings , shows a diff on failure
assertSequencesEqual - assert two containers have the same members without having to be of the same type
assertSameElements - compare containers have the same elements without comparing the ordering
assertDictContainsSubset
assertGreater / assertGreaterEqual / assertLess / assertLessEqual
Example of the new failure messages :
=====================================================
FAIL : testExample ( test.test_unittest.Test_TestCase )
-----------------------------------------------------
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " test_unittest.py " , line 2388 , in testExample self.assertEqual ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , [ 1 , 2 , 0 ] ) AssertionError : First differing element 2 : 3 0 - [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ? ^ + [ 1 , 2 , 0 ] ? ^
Many of these methods we 've also implemented in the Resolver Systems test framework , so it 's nice to see unittest gain this functionality .
By default the new assertMultiLineEqual is not used for comparing strings ( as they can contain binary data in Python 2.X ) , so you have to call it directly to get the pretty error messages .
As well as the new methods the failIf / failUnless synonyms are now pending deprecation ( there actually is a PendingDeprecationWarning , which if enabled warns you that in the next version of Python using this API will raise a warning ! ) .
About time !
We have also standardised on the singular form of asserts ( assertEqual rather than assertEquals ) ; I preferred the plural ( assert a equals b over assert a is equal to b ) but am happy with consistency .
One of the things that has long annoyed me about unittest is that passing in a custom failure message explaining what the failure means silences the useful default error message that tells you what the objects involved were in the failure .
I also fixed this .
Unfortunately the standard way round this problem is to craft a custom error message that includes a repr of the objects ( for example with assertEqual you want to see the repr of the two objects compared in the event of a failure ) it could n't be made the default behaviour .
Instead a new class attribute longMessage has been added .
This defaults to False , but if you set it to True then any explicit custom message you pass will be displayed in addition to the default error message .
Changing every assert method to use the new system ( including tests of course ) took all day , but it was my first real commit to Python so I was happy .
As this is a class attribute you can override it in individual tests by assigning longMessage as an instance attribute to True or False before calling the assert methods .
In addition I added useful default error messages to assertTrue and assertFalse ( currently the default is AssertionError : None ! ) and changed assertNotEqual to actually use the inequality operator ( which exposed a bug in the new ordered dictionary ) ...
There are further improvements left to go , some of which are implemented and just need to be committed , and some of which still need implementing .
None of them are strictly ' innovations ' in that they are all features that have long been provided in other test frameworks , as unittest is in the standard library the real innovations will always happen in these other libraries and unittest can just pull in the best and proven features .
One thing we intend to add is simple test discovery ; something badly needed .
As these features get applied I 'll post new blog entries explaining how to use them .
Dynamic Languages and Architecture
I received an interesting question by email from Mark Bloodworth , an Architect Evangelist at Microsoft .
I 've been interested in Dynamic Languages for a while now ( I blog about Ruby and Python from time to time ) .
I 'm presenting at AIC in May about Dynamic Languages and architecture .
As part of the preparation , I 'm contacting a few people to get their views on where dynamic languages fit best .
So , I 'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on Dynamic Languages , where you think the sweet spot for their usage is .
I 'd also be interested to hear what you think about the impact using dynamic languages has .
As is my wont , I wrote far more than was warranted in reply and thought I would post it here for your edification .
Dynamic languages are general purpose languages ; Python is used for , and suitable for , many of the same problem domains as C# .
There are some problem domains where a statically typed language is more to be preferred than a dynamically typed language - and vice versa - but in the realm of ' general programming ' these are the exception rather than the rule .
Some of these domains , like real time programming for example , the requirement is not specifically about the type system ( although strict type systems make provability easier ) but it is about managing resources .
You could n't use Python for a real - time application because resource allocation and deallocation cannot be strictly controlled ( the basic container types grow themselves in memory for example ) - but you should n't use C# or Java either because garbage collection means that the time taken by any individual operation cannot be specified or controlled .
Note
The decision whether one language or another is always a trade - off of competing factors .
I would argue that developers often make a less than optimal choice for flawed reasons , some of which I outline here .
Choosing one programming language over another is about balancing factors , and social factors are always a part of this .
Forcing a team to use Python ( or C# ) even where it would be appropriate would likely turn out to be a mistake ...
Here 's a try that you will certainly find unsatisfactory .
Areas where you should use a dynamically typed language :
Any kind of scripting where you need runtime behaviour
Including system administration where creating an object oriented application just to move a bunch of files around is silly
Areas where you should use statically typed languages :
Problems which are subject to provability
Areas of code that you have already profiled and optimised and need to improve beyond the capabilities of a dynamically typed language
The reason many developers prefer dynamically typed languages for general programming , including those who have switched from languages like C++ and Java , do so because they are more flexible and enable simpler solutions .
The more I use C# ( and I quite like it as a language ) , the more I become convinced that static typing forces ( and therefore encourages ) more complex architectures .
The simplest thing that could possibly work will usually be implemented in a language with a dynamic type system !
Along with this , dynamically typed languages are typically more concise and expressive - meaning the same concepts can usually be expressed with less code .
For those fluent in the use of their tools ( whether it be Eclipse of Visual Studio ) the code may not take longer to write in a statically typed language - but it certainly takes longer to read .
And typically you have to read code more often than you write it .
A few examples off the top of my head :
Generics in C# - elegant for sure , but actually a workaround for the problems caused by containers restricted on type .
Heterogeneous containers make constructing complex data - structures trivially easy by composing built - in types .
Reflection - because of the type restrictions .NET reflection is massively more painful and complex than the beautifully simple introspection capabilities of languages like Python , Ruby and Smalltalk .
Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control - sometimes useful in their own right , but often used as a workaround to make testing possible .
Not needed for these reasons in dynamically typed , late bound languages where you can override almost all behaviour at runtime for the purposes of testing .
Covariance and contravariance - wonderfully complex things to wrap your head around .
Not even an issue in a language like Python .
Delegates - a work around for not having first class functions .
Upcasting and down casting - not needed if you have runtime behaviour .
Although C# is growing support for functional programming , and will maybe grow support for metaprogramming , these have been a strong part of the culture of dynamic languages for years and also continue to grow .
I could go on ...
However it is the case that when you develop within a system you learn to think within that system .
For programmers used to a static type system , they use the type system to think within and reason about the programs they are building .
They look with pain on the idea of dynamically typed languages as it takes away part of how they reason about programming .
Similarly those used to dynamically typed languages are much more used to thinking in terms of object behaviour rather than types .
Having to shoe - horn this into a type system that feels rigid makes it much harder for them to reason about programming .
This is why the two ' camps ' fail to see eye to eye - they speak different languages and think in different ways .
I do think there are objective differences as well , some of which I have already outlined .
Besides this though , many programmers have been taught that static typing is safer and required for programming large systems .
They rule out the use of dynamic languages for reasons that are either not recognised by those who program large systems in dynamic languages or are only partly true :
Managing large systems in dynamic languages is impossible
Those who have moved to dynamic languages from statically typed languages are horrified at the idea of managing a large system , with its more complex architectural requirements and less readable code .
Without type safety dynamic languages are only suitable for advanced programmers
It 's quite a compliment to call us all advanced programmers , but as the languages tend to be easier to learn and easier to read .
This makes them more suitable for new programmers and more powerful for advanced programmers .
Without type safety you 're more likely to have bugs
Type safety only catches a very small proportion of all possible bugs , and largely the ones that are easiest to find .
If you think that just because a program compiles it does n't have bugs then perhaps you have n't been a programmer for very long !
Yes you can have runtime errors that a compiler would have caught .
The minimal amount of testing would catch those ( and automated tools like PyLint and PyChecker will also help ) .
This does mean that testing is more important in dynamic languages - but I 'm a firm believer that automated testing ( and preferably test driven development ) is preferable whatever language you are using .
As dynamic languages make testing much simpler ( see chapter 7 of IronPython in Action which is available free online ) , if you are a strong believer in testing you will love dynamic languages .
Statically typed languages tend to be faster Actually this is generally true .
The rub is that it is possible to write assembly code programs that run slower than Java , and Python programs that run faster than C#. Performance ( in the raw ) depends far more on the programmer than it does on the language .
In general dynamically typed languages are ' fast enough ' , and with IronPython moving performance sensitive parts of your application into C# is generally easy .
The faster you can produce your first version , the more time you have to spend on optimisation !
At Resolver Systems we have looked at performance in Resolver One ( a large application written almost entirely in IronPython ) several times .
Every time so far we have got the performance we were aiming for by improving our Python code and have n't yet had to drop down to C# .
We will look at performance many times again in the future ( in fact we 're probably due for another round of optimisation ) and maybe we 'll have to move some code away from Python - but looking at our algorithms and improving them is always our first step .
Ruling out a language because you do n't think it will be fast enough is a premature optimisation .
Tool support is not so good
In general this just plain is n't true ( the idea of the IDE and refactoring tools originate in Smalltalk implementations after all ) .
When people say this I often suspect that what they mean is that they are afraid of moving away from Visual Studio .
I wrote a blog entry listing some of the tools for Python in particular : http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2009/03/writing-ironpython-debugger.html
It is true that because the type system is n't fully known until runtime you can't do some of the same static analysis ( although there is an awful lot that a good tool can infer ) .
Martin Fowler , who has seen
Thoughtworks increase the amount of projects done in Ruby over the last few years , recently said that programmers within Thoughtworks who move from Java to Ruby usually end up using editors like Textmate , Vim and Emacs ( lightweight tools for lightweight languages ) and he has never heard of any of them missing the refactoring support .
Anyway - I 'm not sure if this is what you were looking for , but it 's enough typing for one email .
I hope it is helpful or interesting .
Parts of that reply are verging on a rant of course .
I think part of what I 'm ranting against is the inherent complexity in many modern languages and runtimes .
Some of the problems I mention , and some of the ones below , are at least partly ( or even completely ) orthogonal to the type system - but languages , their type systems , and runtimes they are predominantly used on are often so tightly bound together that it is impossible to fully distinguish them .
The issues I see are typified in the mainstream statically typed languages : Java , C# , VB.
NET , C++ , C .
The mainstream dynamic languages typically do n't have this class of problem : PHP , Perl , Ruby , Python , Javascript .
Specific problems that I have actually encountered with C# and the .NET framework that can't happen with Python include :
The differences between value types and reference types - especially the problems around boxing of value types and mutable value types
Uninitialized reference types can be null ( which can't happen in Python unless you explicitly assign something to be None )
Ca n't overload on return type ( partly why you need Func and Action in .NET 3.5 )
and in .NET 3.5 )
Can't cast between delegates with the same signature
I would include covariance and contravariance as issues that fall within the same ' inherent complexity ' of the .NET system .
The problem is that we programmers are prone to loving complexity , we mistake it for power .
In fact the opposite is true , conceptually simpler systems tend to be more powerful .
With Python all variables are references , no value types , which removes a whole heap ( pardon the pun ) of complexity .
Of course this is a trade - off - in particular having value types allows for certain optimisations .
This means that complexity has been moved onto the programmer for the sake of the compiler .
Modern JITs ( like the one being explored in PyPy for example ) can move the complexity into the runtime , allowing for the same optimisations .
Of course dynamic languages have problems too .
A lot of the ones pointed out to me are around issues of programmer discipline .
With more flexible languages you can do lots of things that wo n't work ( but you wo n't be warned until runtime ) .
This is one of the reasons that some .NET programmers have told me they think dynamic languages are only suitable for more advanced programmers .
The reason I take issue with that is that one of the trade - offs you are making when you leave a dynamic type system is that you are moving to a system with more inherent complexity .
This is not something that can possibly be better for less advanced programmers and can hardly make mistakes less likely !
Of course non-mainstream languages like the functional languages and those with more complicated type systems present whole new fields of problems for the beginner and experienced programmers alike .
Steve Yegge talks a lot of sense on the subject in his article Rhinos and Tigers ( Static Typing 's Paper Tigers ) .
On the subject of language design , I like Jim Hugunin 's quote in his story of Jython :
Guido's sense of the aesthetics of language design is amazing .
I 've met many fine language designers who could build theoretically beautiful languages that no one would ever use , but Guido is one of those rare people who can build a language that is just slightly less theoretically beautiful but thereby is a joy to write programs in .
Release : Mock 0.5.0 Mocking and Patching Library for Testing
One of the exciting things about PyCon was to discover that Mock was much more widely used than I thought .
It 's being used in Disney , Sourceforge , VMWare ( well - at least one developer at VMWare ) and BATS Trading .
Mock is of course heavily used at Resolver Systems ; I originally wrote it to simplify the testing patterns we were using and reduce the proliferation of simple but all slightly different mock objects that we had scattered throughout our test framework .
Mock is a library for the creation of simple mock objects that track how they are used so that you can make assertions .
It uses the action -> assertion pattern rather than the record -> replay pattern .
Action -> assertion puts your tests after you have used the objects , which seems more natural and means that you can make assertions about only the behavior you are interested in .
Mock also contains two decorators ( patch and patch_object ) which make it easy to safely mock out dependencies in the module under test purely within the scope of the test itself ( unpatching is done automatically on exit whether or not the test passes ) .
One of the changes in this release is that these decorators also become context managers allowing them to be used with the ' with statement ' .
I 've just released Mock 0.5.0 .
This is n't backwards compatible as it cleans up the API in a few ways , but they 're all good changes I promise .
One of the new features is that the Mock class now supports wrapping objects ; using the wraps keyword .
One of the other big changes is that the documentation is now built with the ever - wonderful Sphinx , so the homepage is new and there also a PDF of the documentation :
Mock can be installed with :
easy_install mock
The changelog for all changes in this release is :
Made DEFAULT part of the public api .
Documentation built with Sphinx .
side_effect is now called with the same arguments as the mock is called with and if returns a non-DEFAULT value that is automatically set as the mock .
return_value .
is now called with the same arguments as the mock is called with and if returns a non-DEFAULT value that is automatically set as the .
wraps keyword argument used for wrapping objects ( and passing calls through to the wrapped object ) .
keyword argument used for wrapping objects ( and passing calls through to the wrapped object ) .
Mock .reset renamed to Mock.reset_mock , as reset is a common API name .
renamed to , as reset is a common API name .
patch / patch_object are now context managers and can be used with with .
/ are now context managers and can be used with .
A new ' create ' keyword argument to patch and patch_object that allows them to patch ( and unpatch ) attributes that do n't exist .
( Potentially unsafe to use - it can allow you to have tests that pass when they are testing an API that does n't exist - use at your own risk ! )
The methods keyword argument to Mock has been removed and merged with spec .
The spec argument can now be a list of methods or an object to take the spec from .
Nested patches may now be applied in a different order ( created mocks passed in the opposite order ) .
This is actually a bugfix .
patch and patch_object now take a spec keyword argument .
If spec is passed in as ' True ' then the Mock created will take the object it is replacing as its spec object .
If the object being replaced is a class , then the return value for the mock will also use the class as a spec .
A Mock created without a spec will not attempt to mock any magic methods / attributes ( they will raise an AttributeError instead ) .
Many thanks to all those who gave feedback , feature requests and patches !
What is n't in 0.5.0 is support for mocking magic methods .
I do have a technique in mind for this , which I implemented for the container methods .
It is very clean , but different from the pattern used to mock out other methods .
As I 'm not currently using it I 'm going to wait until I need it and see if it works well in practise .
If you 're interested in trying it , the code ( with full documentation ) in a ' magics branch ' :
PyCon Videos : IronPython Tutorial
The last videos from PyCon 2009 are going up , which means videos from the tutorials .
This includes the three hour IronPython tutorial taken by Jonathan Hartley and me :
The tutorial was great fun , exploring different aspects of programming with .NET and IronPython by creating a Windows Forms Twitter client called Stutter .
I have n't watched the videos , so I have no idea what they are like , but apparently the first five minutes of the first part has no audio .
Of course if you are interested in programming with IronPython , then the very best tutorial and reference is IronPython in Action .
Once I 've done a new release of Mock , finished some work I 've started on the standard library unittest module , and got one or two other items off my list , I 'll turn the IronPython tutorial into a series of articles .
There is a lot of good material in the tutorial .
Topics we covered in " Application Development with IronPython " included :
Differences between IronPython and CPython , including " Why Use IronPython ? "
Introduction to the .NET framework - a dynamic language on a statically typed framework
GUIs with Windows Forms
Databases
Network requests and web services ( the Twitter REST API )

Pentagon may have up to 2,000 photographs of prisoner abuse Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday April 24 , 2009
Print This Email This The Pentagon will release for the first time 44 photographs depicting prisoner abuse after the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) won a court ruling in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in 2004 .
A " substantial number of other images " are also being processed for release , the Department of Justice wrote in a letter to a US federal court : according to the Guardian , citing an unnamed official , that " substantial number " could be as many as 2,000 photos .
" These photographs provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by US personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib , " ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh said in a release .
The Iraqi prison at Abu Ghraib became infamous after photographs showing Iraqi detainees being humiliated and abused by their US guards were published in 2004 .
The latest disclosure " is critical for helping the public understand the scope and scale of prisoner abuse as well as for holding senior officials accountable for authorizing or permitting such abuse , " added Singh .
" The Pentagon has noted that it investigates all allegations of detainee abuse , and since 2001 has taken more than 400 disciplinary actions against U.S. military personnel found to have been involved in such abuse , " reported the Washington Post .
" Calling the ACLU push to release the photographs ' prurient ' and ' reprehensible , ' Dr. Mark M. Lowenthal , former Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production , told ABC News that the Obama administration should have taken the case all the way to the Supreme Court , " reported ABC News .
" They should have fought it all the way ; if they lost , they lost , " Lowenthal said .
" There 's nothing to be gained from it .
There 's no substantive reason why those photos have to be released . "
The Obama administration released four sensitive memos last week that blew the lid on harsh CIA terror interrogation tactics approved by the Bush administration , including the use of insects , simulated drowning and sleep deprivation .
But Obama has said that CIA officers involved in interrogations should not be prosecuted as they had received legal guidance from their superiors .
Obama has faced criticism from both ends of the political spectrum , with rights groups demanding prosecution of former Bush administration officials and conservatives charging the move endangered national security .

OTTAWA–Want to know how your MP has been voting in the House of Commons ?
Finding out has just become a whole lot easier .
The House of Commons website has launched a feature that allows visitors to see how MPs voted .
Friday 's change brings Canadian transparency one step closer to the U.S. – where Congress regularly posts voting results within an hour , and has detailed records going back 20 years .
Unlike the U.S. , Canada 's parliamentary system usually results in MPs toeing a party line , so votes in the Commons tend to be far less dramatic than in Congress .
But MPs are sometimes allowed by their party leaders to vote freely on matters of conscience , non-binding resolutions that express the will of Parliament , or on bills not deemed matters of confidence .
The new changes will allow viewers four different ways to access MPs ' voting records through the parliamentary website ( www.parl.gc.ca.)
One of those methods was launched Friday ; the rest will be up next week .
To view an MP 's record , head to the website and click on the Members of Parliament link to find your member of the House of Commons .
Your MP 's site will will have a tab for votes that takes you to a list showing whether they voted yea , nea , or did n't vote at all on any given bill .
It gets a little trickier if you want to figure out what each bill actually means : you 'd have to click on the link to the individual vote and bill , then at the very least go through its summary for a description of it .
For example , if you clicked on the link for Prime Minister Stephen Harper , the MP for Calgary - Southwest , and clicked on the Votes tab there , you would see that he last voted in the Commons on March 25 .
That day Harper voted in favour of C - 9 , a bill to amend the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act .
The summary of the bill outlines its goal of strengthening transportation safety regulations , and the text goes into far more detail about how C - 9 will change the existing federal law .
Or , if you click on the Today in the House link on the Parliamentary website and then on Votes on the left side of the page , you can search and navigate to lists of how all MPs voted on particular bills or dates .
It was the NDP that began pushing for the website changes last year .
MP Libby Davies sent House of Commons Speaker Peter Milliken a letter bemoaning the lack of transparency in Parliament .
She noted that Americans could , for instance , see that Barack Obama missed 37.4 per cent of votes in the U.S. Senate , and voted in line with the Democrats 96.7 per cent of the time .
" Each of us finds signs of growing voter disengagement – like declining turnout in elections – worrisome , " Davies wrote to Milliken in March 2008 .
" And each of us desire to find ways of opening the House and its deliberations to greater public interest and knowledge .
. .
Compiling and presenting these records on the public Internet site is a rather modest , yet at the same time critically important , step in modernizing the relationship between Canadians and their members of Parliament . "

Commons technical staff began working on the design , and the chamber 's board of internal economy agreed at a meeting last month to launch the feature .
Starting next week , the website will also include a search engine that allows people to see how MPs have voted since October 2004 .
NEW DELHI : About 43 members of the US Congress have written to financial services firm JP Morgan Chase , asking it to explain its plans to increase outsourcing to India .
ET had earlier reported that JP Morgan plans to increase outsourcing to India by 25 % .
The financial services firm has been the recipient of $ 25 - billion from the US government���s Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
In a letter addressed to JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon , the Congress members asked : ���How should these American workers , many of them your consumers , be expected to have hope for a better future when the very companies they contributed to through TARP outsource the jobs they desperately need ?���
A JP Morgan Chase spokesperson in India refused to comment on the matter .
There has been furore over outsourcing by American financial institutions that have received billions of government funds under its bailout package .
For such firms , outsourcing , and offshoring to low - cost destinations such as India in particular , makes greater sense than ever before , as they look to cut costs .��
�Most banks are looking to offshore more to India .
With anti-outsourcing noises being made in the US , everyone is watching as to whether and how they will translate into action , ��� said sourcing advisory firm Everest principal Nikhil Rajpal .
Senators Chuck Grassley and Bernie Sanders recently introduced a legislation in the US Senate to prevent recipients of the government bailouts from hiring H1 - B visa holders for one year .
The Senate later cleared a watered - down version that allowed such companies to hire H1 - B workers , but first prove they had made efforts to hire American workers .

Broward County , FL , has dropped all charges against a local Election Integrity advocate whose arrest , described by an election official and other colleagues at the time as " outrageous , " was captured on video tape late last year .
Ellen Brodsky , who had been a non-partisan candidate for Supervisor of Elections in last November 's election , was arrested at the apparent behest of the office of the county 's current Supervisor of Elections --- Brodsky 's Democratic opponent in the race --- Dr. Brenda C. Snipes , while trying to view public , post- election counting and canvassing of ballots .
She was charged , at the time , with " disorderly conduct " and " trespassing , " forced to spend the night in jail , and not released until nearly 6:00 am the next morning , even though her son had posted the required $ 25 ( twenty - five dollar ) bail for her by 8:30 pm on the evening of her arrest .
The " disorderly conduct " charges were dropped some time later , following the release of a video tape of the incident as posted by The BRAD BLOG in the days following the arrest .
The tape , reposted again at the bottom of this article , revealed that Brodsky 's conduct had been anything but disorderly when the county police were summoned by Fred Bellis , a deputy election official from Snipes ' office , and Brodsky was thrown into handcuffs and hauled away .
While Brodsky 's trial on a " trespassing " charge had been set to start today , a last - minute offer to drop all charges , in exchange for admissions by Brodsky that she would not be disruptive in the future , was sent to her last night from Snipes ' attorney .
" There was no way I was gonna agree to such demands , " Brodsky told The BRAD BLOG today , following the county 's dismissal of the court case .
" We offered our own compromise , " she said .
" We will accept a withdraw of all charges , and will , as I 've always done , agree to follow Florida law regarding public meetings . "
It was an oral agreement .
Her attorney , Tanner Andrews , echoed her sentiment .
" We agreed to do what we 're already doing .
We 'll obey the law , " he explained during a phone call this afternoon .
" I could agree not to rob the bank next Sunday and it'd have the same legal effect , " he added ...
" I guess they were afraid to go to trial based on the evidence , " Brodsky told us .
The trespassing charge was based on her attempt to gain access to a " rented space , inside the Lauderhill Mall , in Broward County , " where the Supervisor of Election had leased space to canvass the election --- property which Brodsky contends she " never stepped on . "
After reviewing a copy of the county 's lease , she found that " the lease demonstrated that ... the majority is a public area , as part of the mall . "
As to SoE " property " being accessible to the public , nonetheless , under Florida 's Sunshine Laws governing public meetings , Brodsky explained that such access is granted " only as 'an invitee . '
Which means they put up a notice that there 's going to be a meeting of some kind , counting , or recounting .
Broward County is famous for not putting up public noticing .
So I had to do fishing to find out when they were meeting . "
That 's when she was arrested , while inquiring about a meeting , outside of the leased space , as seen in the video tape .
" Anytime there is a public meeting , the public must be allowed in , and they can't consider which members of the public they consider members of the public , " she said .
' Outrageous Abuse of Power '
Brodsky told us : " Brenda Snipes is ready to arrest people as a first resort , rather than only in a serious situation .
You do n't go arresting people as a first resort .
It 's a matter of the discretion of the use of power ....
It 's an irresponsible abuse of power .
I really see a danger there . "
At the time of Brodsky 's arrest last November , Snipes ' colleague , Ion Sancho , the legendary Supervisor of Elections in Leon County ( Tallahassee ) , noted similar concerns : " For a candidate , or a member of the public who wishes nothing more than to observe the process , to be taken into custody would be outrageous absent really extraordinary reasons --- none of which I 've heard articulated in this matter , " he The BRAD BLOG back in November .
Sancho , who was chosen by the FL Supreme Court to oversee the state 's eventually - aborted Presidential Election recount in 2000 , explained that in twenty years as an election official , " not even one time has it become necessary to even threaten someone 's removal by law enforcement at any kind of meeting that I 've ever attended . "
" Elections officials in Florida really are uniquely placed , because of the power we have over the process --- and it 's pretty immense --- so there 's a tendency , a lot of times , for election officials to act in an autocratic manner , " he told us at the time .
" I 'm not saying [ Snipes ] did , but it would n't surprise me . "
Other colleagues of Brodsky's , including Ellen Theisen , of the non-partisan election integrity watchdog organization VotersUnite.org , and David Earnhardt , director of the documentary Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections were similarly troubled by the arrest last year .
" It 's outrageous , " Theisen said , calling the disruption charges " nonsense . "
Earnhardt described Brodsky as " a remarkable woman who has dedicated the better part of the decade to demanding fair and honest elections . "
He described the arrest as " offensive " and " ridiculous . "
" The power that we as elected officials have , has to be used very , very , very judiciously , " Sancho said .
" I would caution officials over the removal of any observer from the elections process , because only by keeping the process as open as possible can we maintain credibility within the elections process . "
" Quite frankly , I 've never found the use of police powers an effective answer to people who are looking for the truth , " Sancho told us .
Brodsky 's arrest in November had the been the latest in what appears to be a growing trend of arrests of Election Integrity advocates attempting to excercise their rights to participate in the public process of voting and overseeing election counts .
In August of last year , a Missouri activist was arrested while attempting to vote , because he had legally refused to offer a photo ID to pollworkers who had illegally required one before voting .
In September , an Arizona activist was arrested after noticing , and questioning officials about seals that had been broken on ballot bags during a post-election audit .
" The power that we as elected officials have , has to be used very , very , very judiciously , " Sancho , himself an Election Integrity advocate , said following Brodsky 's arrest last year .
Pending Suits Against Snipes
Brodsky already has two pending civil suits on file against Snipes ' office for violations of Sunshine Laws , requiring public access to public meetings .
One was filed last August when she says she was barred from attending a recount following Florida 's primary election last Summer .
She says that Fred Bellis , the same deputy who summoned county police prior to her arrest in November , had told her during the August incident that " Brenda Snipes does n't want you in the building . "
Her second suit was filed in January of this year , in response to her November arrest which barred her from overseeing the canvassing of even her own election against Snipes .
Florida 's Sunshine Law " requires that the public 's business , be done in public , " Brodsky 's attorney Tanner told us .
" We intend to uphold that portion of the law . "
As to whether or not a civil suit would be brought against Snipes and the county for false arrest , Tanner refused comment .
" We 're not talking about any litigation that is not filed . "
Brodsky 's comments , however , seemed to indicate that such a suit might be forthcoming .
" There is no way we would let this thing slide by like this , " she said .
" There 's been too much of abuse of power , too much cruelty .
I believe it should be exposed .
If we 're going to have any kind of meaningful change in how our government is conducted , we can't let them get away with this stuff . "
According to the election results as posted at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections website , Broward County Supervisor of Elections Snipes defeated Brodsky in November 's election for Broward County Supervisor of Elections , 81.79 % to 18.21 % .
Snipes ' office did not immediately return a voice message seeking comment for this story .

Mmmmmmm , syrup .
I wish the people who designed these kinds of things would come forward and admit their intentions .
Ain't no way that was by accident .

Darwinism
Evolution vs Stupid Design Theory
February 11 , 2009
In Unspeak , I suggested that there was a problem with the use of the term “ Darwinist ” :
[‘ Intelligent Design ’ proponents ] tended to refer to their opponents — that is , biologists — as ‘ neo - Darwinists ’ .
What was actually known as the ‘ Neo - Darwinian Modern Synthesis ’ of evolutionary science combined Darwinian theory with twentieth - century genetics .
Yet the consistent use of the term ‘ neo - Darwinist ’ by evolution ’s enemies imputed to science an idolatrous reliance on the supposedly outdated ideas of one man , as though he were the false god of an ‘ evolutionist ’ religion .
(( Unspeak , 2nd edn ( 2007 ) , p.50 . ) )
Now , in the New York Times , Carl Safina argues persuasively that biologists themselves have erred in accepting the term :
By propounding “ Darwinism , ” even scientists and science writers perpetuate an impression that evolution is about one man , one book , one “ theory . ” [ … ]
Science has marched on .
But evolution can seem uniquely stuck on its founder .
We do n’t call astronomy Copernicism , nor gravity Newtonism .
“ Darwinism ” implies an ideology adhering to one man ’s dictates , like Marxism .
And “ isms ” ( capitalism , Catholicism , racism ) are not science .
“ Darwinism ” implies that biological scientists “ believe in ” Darwin ’s “ theory ” .
And this , Safina argues , leaves a rhetorical door open for liars :
Using phrases like “ Darwinian selection ” or “ Darwinian evolution ” implies there must be another kind of evolution at work , a process that can be described with another adjective .
For instance , “ Newtonian physics ” distinguishes the mechanical physics Newton explored from subatomic quantum physics .
So “ Darwinian evolution ” raises a question :
What ’s the other evolution ?
Into the breach : intelligent design .
I am not quite saying Darwinism gave rise to creationism , though the “ isms ” imply equivalence .
But the term “ Darwinian ” built a stage upon which “ intelligent ” could share the spotlight .
For a case in point , see this remarkable farrago of unreason by the Telegraph ‘s anti-science correspondent Christopher Booker :
[ Darwin ] might [ … ] have recognised that some other critically important but unknown factor seemed to be at work , an “ organising power ” which had allowed these otherwise inexplicable leaps to take place .
But so possessed was he by the simplicity of his theory that , brushing such difficulties aside , he made a leap of faith that it must be right , regardless of the evidence .
In this he has been followed by generations of “ Darwinians ” who have found his theory so beguiling that , like him , they have refused to recognise how much it cannot explain .
It ’s true that “ Darwinism ” cannot explain what Booker invokes , a “ critically important but unknown factor [ … ] an organising power ” , because such a power is by definition inexplicable .
But hang on , if this “ factor ” is “ unknown ” , how does Booker know it ’s “ critically important ” ?
Indeed , if it ’s “ unknown ” , how does Booker know it ’s an “ organising power ” ?
These are rhetorical questions : what is going on here , piquantly , is that a major broadsheet columnist is outing himself as a creationist .
Like his fellow creationists , Booker does n’t have much truck with known facts .
As Richard Wilson helpfully points out , Booker ’s Telegraph column recycles two of its dunciac paragraphs from this earlier piece in the Spectator , wherein Booker confidently asserts that “ genetically we are all but identical ” to “ mice and sea urchins ” , and wonders plaintively how “ much the same genetic coding can produce such an infinite variety of life forms ? ”
Me , I wonder how the same alphabetic coding can produce such a stunning variety of tongue - dragging moronitude in purportedly high - minded periodicals .
And from long meditation on that improbability , I am inevitably driven to believe in a Stupid Designer .
Surely the accretion of random changes could not possibly have resulted in organisms so ill - suited to rational thinking ?
Soon after black - and - white televisions became commonplace in British living rooms , a nasty thought began to spread among the more paranoid members of society .
If you could watch the characters on the box , could they watch you watching them ?
Of course they could n't , but that did n't stop some people from harbouring delusional notions .
The same sort of thoughts come to mind when you are logged on to your computer .
Is it possible that other people could be viewing your screen as you check your bank account or compose that love letter ?
It always comes as a bit of shock in the office when the IT department logs on to your computer remotely and starts moving the cursor around the screen .
But that 's the office , where work is not supposed to be a private activity , and a local area network allows IT to play at being an all - seeing digital deity .
The home is different .
We are told about the dangers of the internet and how a computer that is logged on to a broadband connection is vulnerable to viruses , spyware , malware and all kinds of electronic eavesdropping .
But is it possible for anyone to really see your screen from outside your home without the technical infrastructure of the Government Communications Headquarters ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The answer is " yes " , and you can do it quite legitimately using a simple device that allows you to log on to your computer from any internet connection in the world .
It allows you to open up the screen of your home computer or laptop through the internet and do whatever you want to the files , photos or documents that are stored there , using a remote terminal .
And you can to it from an internet cafe in Basildon or Buenos Aires .
It is called BeAnywhere and is marketed by a company called Ability Software International ( ASI ) , based in Crawley , West Sussex .
It comes as a little orange USB memory stick which acts as a " drive " that controls access to as many as three different computers , all of which have to be registered .
From my office computer I can access my home computer , a laptop and a screen in the London headquarters of MI6 .
Of course I made that last one up .
You can only see the desktop screens of computers that you have been physically in front of in order to set up the right access passwords , but it is a surprisingly simple affair .
Apart from a little problem I had with Windows Vista – the font size on the desktop settings was set to a non -default setting – I managed to set up my computers first time .
I was able to see my office computer from a hotel in Chicago , and search my home computer from the office .
To set up a computer for remote access , the BeAnywhere USB drive is used to install a server on the machine .
When the computer is left on and connected to the internet , the server detects a remote user with the right passwords and allows them to see the desktop screen and to control the mouse and keyboard as if they were sitting in front of the computer .
Chris England , of ASI , said that security is the paramount concern .
" The BeAnywhere system is very concerned about security , about making sure that the users are completely safe using the service and about making sure that their data and information is completely secure , " he says .
To ensure this , there are three levels of security .
Two sets of passwords are used , one to access the USB drive and another to access the remote computer .
The communications between the computers have a digital signature to prevent interception by third parties .
" All the keyboard commands or the mouse clicks are encrypted and a digital signature is applied to each one , which enables guaranteed inviolability , " Mr England says .
The final layer of security is to do with system encryption .
" This is the same security level used in security communication protocols , like for example the SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) protocol which is used by internet banking , or to internet pages dedicated to processing online payments , " he says .
But I can't help but feel that if it was so easy for me to see my computer from anywhere in the world , the same could be true of someone else .
What about BeAnywhere employees ?
Could they spy on me ?
" No. BeAnywhere only knows if the PC's have had a remote - access session , and we use this information to reach our users and try to understand if they are having problems using the service , " Mr England explains .
" We have no way of knowing what goes back and forth between the two computers .
This is due to the communications security : the digital signature is known exclusively by the two connected computers at that particular session .
The next time they connect , a new digital signature will be issued making sure the communications are protected . "
Costing less than £ 40 , and an annual fee of £ 29.99 , BeAnywhere is a remarkable device .
Makes you wonder what GCHQ can do with its multimillion - pound budget .
When Che Guevara crossed into Bolivia in 1966 , his intent was to create a rural foco insurgency .
A foco insurgency is one that forgoes the methodical political indoctrination of the population in favor of small bands of fast moving guerrillas that gain victories against state forces .
In Che 's model , the victories of these guerrillas would ignite an organic revolution that would overthrow the government .
His hope was that it would avoid the innevitable corruption he saw in communist revolutionary parties .
Foco insurgencies did n't work for a variety of factors related to the time , to wit :
Che died in 1967 , hunted by government forces .
The urban guerrilla / terrorists ( who felt that urban environments provided better protection than the rural terrain that Che favored ) that followed him , suffered the same fate .
Che 's theory lives on
Iraq 's insurgency is a variant of Che 's foco insurgency in that it operates without a need popular support .
However , the environment today differs in many important ways that provide it with the opportunity of success .
Here 's why Iraq 's insurgency has gained traction :
Multiplexed loyalties .
Iraq is riven by ethinic , tribal , political , and religious loyalties .
This provides numerous fault lines for guerrillas to exploit .

An occupation .
The US occupation serves as a focal point for guerrilla activity .
The elimination of the Baathist military sufficiently weakened the state in ways that made it easy for a foco insurgency to gain momentum .

Modern networks .
Iraq has a modern ( although dilapidated ) infrastructure that is ripe for attack .
This infrastructure is critical for its economic recovery and is in stark contrast to the sparse networks of developing nations ~ 40 years ago .
Additionally , a diverse set of global media networks allow guerrillas to circumvent state controls on information to amplify fault lines .
A diverse set of small groups with different motivations .
These groups do n't have a center of mass ( hierarchy ) that can be targeted .
Their small size provides them excellent OPSEC and the collapse any subset of groups does n't disrupt the whole .

Leverage from markets and networks .
These networks provide Iraq 's guerrillas rates of return far in excess of those expected for groups of their size .
Iraq 's bazaar will outlast the US occupation .
The choice for the US will be to either continue to write a blank check for Iraq and run up deficits or withdraw .
It is only a matter of time before the decision to withdraw is made .

Organic Islamic order .
The goal of this insurgency is very much in line with Che 's vision ( an organic order that arises out of state weakness ) .
However , in Iraq , the complete disruption of state power is n't replaced with another state but rather organic Islamic order -- the Fallujah and Taliban model .

How this will spread .
Given the factors that power Iraq 's bazaar , it will be difficult but not impossible to export this insurgency to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan without one of the following events ( here 's what to look for ) : Intervention by the US military in Saudi Arabia to prevent collapse , a coup or open conflict between factions in Pakistan 's military ( triggered through assassination of Musharref and other key people ) , and a civil war in Iraq that draws in adjacent states .
A series of tactical innovations allows global guerrillas to both survive and thrive in Iraq .
These innovations ( cumulatively called the bazaar ) allow it to survive state counter - pressure , learn / advance , and deplete the ruling government of funds / authority / legitimacy .
In contrast , the foco was unable to accomplish this .
Also , unlike the foco , the end point of the bazaar is n't a new state but the destruction of the state .
Here 's how global guerrillas have improved on the model : A vibrant bazaar insurgency in Iraq will set the stage for the following events :

Mars is not the dead world we once thought it was , and these images portray that fact .
Stuart Atkinson ( not a relative , but a good pal ) is part of the UnmannedSpaceflight.com crew , the folks who have created fantastic visual treats from raw images sent back from our space exploring robots .
Stu also has his own website , Cumbrian Sky .
Today ,
Stu posted some pictures on his website , along with his story of how he came to create an utterly fantastic image from a rather ordinary - looking picture from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaisaince Orbiter .
After seeing
Stu ’s handiwork today , I asked him if he would n’t mind sharing his story on Universe Today of how he came to make an amazing discovery on Mars .
( Click on the image above for a larger version . )
Stu said he found the image above on the “ dangerously addictive ” Mars Global Data website .
The image , of the Aram Chaos region , did n’t look very interesting at first .
But then he zoomed in to get a better look at the “ slumpy ” feature in the middle of the image , and then zoomed in some more .
“ It looked like a section of the valley wall had come loose and slid down to the lower ground below , ” Stu said as he raised a Spock - like eyebrow …
There , he discovered the track of a huge boulder that had “ fallen from the valley wall and tumbled down , bouncing and rolling and boinging along for a long , long way . ”
Adding color to the image really highlighted the tracks left by the bouncing boulder , and a few other tracks showed up as well , creating an absolutley awesome image and discovery !
“ You know what I love about these images ? , ” Stu wrote on his blog .
“ They show movement , they show that things are moving on Mars right now .
It ’s not the dead , lifeless , corpse of a world I grew up with ; it ’s a world – we now know – where dust devils whirl and twirl across the plains … where clouds drift through the pale pink sky … and where huge stones fall from high cliff face , fall to the ground below , then bounce and roll and crash over it … unseen by anyone . ”
“ For now . ”
Great detective work , Stu !
I propose that this region should be named after Stuart Atkinson ( at least the boulders , if nothing else ! )

Tool and Puscifer lead singer Maynard James Keenan drew approximately 1,000 fans to the Whole Foods in Plano yesterday as he promoted his partial ownership in Arizona Stronghold Vineyards , signing bottles of wine from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m .
Those seeking an autograph and a glimpse of Keenan were required to show up as early as possible to grab a numbered wine menu , which secured their place in line .
When I heard about Keenan 's appearance a couple weeks ago , I jumped at the chance to get a good look at him considering I 've put down 75 bucks for Tool and A Perfect Circle tickets plenty of times , only to see Keenan hide in the shadows near the back of the stage .
And , heck , asking him a few questions would be the interview of a lifetime .
My obsession with the guy has even translated to his wine endeavors , as I celebrated my graduation from SMU with a bottle of 2005 Primer Paso from Caduceus Cellars , the winery associated with Merkin Vineyards , which Keenan owns .
An interview and a photo op were confirmed ahead of time with Keenan 's publicist , Monica Seide .
But when I arrived , things started falling apart quickly , and it had nothing to do with Seide .
I never got to see Keenan , and even worse , I was left wondering if the man known for staying true to his art ( releasing just four albums and one EP since forming Tool with Adam Jones 19 years ago ) had finally sold out .
Despite my media badge , I was stopped at the door by security and told I needed clearance by Whole Foods , which was fine by me .
After tracking down their public relations peeps , I was told no access would be granted .
I explained my pre-arranged deal with Seide , and they headed back inside to confirm .
Again , no worries by me .
Suddenly , there was a brand spankin ' new deal .
No interview would be granted , and my photo session would be restricted to two minutes with no flash , and it needed to be from a " safe " distance .
I walked inside the store and was escorted to the room where Keenan was located .
It 's normally used for cooking classes , but it was cleared out to accommodate Keenan and his handlers .
Fans , each of whom paid between $ 24.99 and $ 99.99 for bottles of wine , waited patiently outside before getting access to Keenan , who sat behind a closed - off area with wine boxes stacked up against a barricade .
I 'm told the new deal is off , per Keenan 's handlers .
Now I 'm pissed .
Seide sends a text message to the handler , letting him know what has been discussed .
Still no dice .
I 'm told , again through Whole Foods ' public relations people , that Keenan 's handler claims there is n't enough room for me to take pictures .
Can I take pictures after he 's done ?
No .
Can I simply observe for a couple minutes ?
No .
Can I buy a bottle of wine and go through to get a quick glimpse ?
No .
This was all quite disappointing , but much more so when I ran into Stacie Clark , an account executive with Clear Channel Radio .
She told me she had spent the morning with Keenan , who bought some time on 102.1
The Edge to promote the signing .
She said Keenan walked right into the building yesterday morning , sans handlers , and allowed them to take pictures .
They even kidded around about his likeness to Moby .
He hardly sounded like the ultra - reclusive type I was dealing with .
So as I digested that , along with the premise of Keenan 's appearance in Plano ( and subsequent appearances today in Austin , Thursday in Sugar Land and Friday in San Antonio ) , and began to wonder :
Do the actions of Keenan the winemaker parallel those of Keenan the artist ?
Or , to put it plainly : Has he become a sellout ?
For Keenan the artist , it 's always been about the music .
It 's never been about the money .
It 's never been about the celebrity .
It 's never been about making albums for the sake of making albums .
For Keenan the winemaker , it 's about using his celebrity to sell as many bottles of wine as possible , barricading himself into a small corner so that fans are forced to spend big bucks just to get a peek at him .
People could n't bring in cell phones , cameras or recorders , and he would n't sign anything that was n't a newly - purchased bottle of wine .
Why ?
So he can prove to Whole Foods that he can move wine in large quantities with hopes that they 'll carry his brand in their stores .
If that 's not a sellout , I 'm not sure what is .
Last week a 22 year - old was sentenced to 6 months jail for running a file - sharing site carrying links to copyright works .
On the surface it appeared that court ruled that due to placing advertising on the site , the admin had profited from infringement and therefore committed a crime , but all is not as it seems .
A week ago we reported that a Spanish Court made its decision in the case of file - sharing site Infopsp.com .
According to the complainants – Spanish Association of Publishers and Distributors Entertainment Software ( ADESE ) and the Spanish Videographic Union ( UVE ) – the site , which had around 17,300 members , operated illegally .
InfoPSP did n’t host any illicit content itself but instead offered links to video games , movies and music hosted on 3rd party sites .
In Spain , merely linking to copyright works is not illegal .
InfoPSP carried advertising and it was widely reported in the Spanish media that this was the reason the admin , Adrián Gómez Llorente , aka Kuve , was found guilty and sentenced to fines and 6 months in jail .
However , in the murky world of copyright infringement , it ’s no surprise to discover that all is not as it seems .
In September 2008 we reported on the case of Sharemula , a site which offered eDonkey links to movies , music , software and games .
Just like InfoPSP , Sharemula found itself the subject of legal action but eventually the admins were found not guilty , since they had not carried out copyright infringement for profit .
Here ’s the strange part though – Sharemula DID carry advertising , just like InfoPSP .
Seeking clarification , TorrentFreak contacted the offices of David Bravo , a Spanish lawyer who specializes in intellectual property rights .
According to Spanish law , the reason why the Sharemula admins were acquitted was because in order to have committed a crime , direct profit must ’ve been made from the actual dissemination of the copyright works .
Since the site carried only links , any dissemination was carried out by the site ’s users and not the site itself .
In short , no crime was committed on Sharemula and bizarrely , no crime was committed on InfoPSP either .
So it begs the question ; how on earth did the admin of InfoPSP get found guilty of criminal copyright infringement and sentenced to 6 months jail and fines of 4,900 euros ?
The answer lies , unsurprisingly , with the complainants in the case – the Spanish Association of Publishers and Distributors Entertainment Software ( ADESE ) and the Spanish Videographic Union ( UVE ) .
Of course , file - sharing site admins being protected under Spanish law is the last thing these groups need .
What they actually need is someone ’s severed head displayed prominently on a pike in order to deter others , and a widely - reported 6 month jail sentence is ideal for reaching this aim .
To get the truth , lawyer David Bravo conducted an interview with KUVE , the convicted InfoPSP admin , which shines an awful lot of light on this issue – and pretty shocking it is too .
First off David asked Kuve if he ’d ever carried any copyright material on the InfoPSP server ;
“ Absolutely not .
The web server contained only the files needed for the operation of the forum , ” explained Kuve .
“ Under no circumstances did we ever host any copyrighted works . ”
David then asked Kuve if it was true that InfoPSP simply displayed links which were supplied by users of the site .
“ Indeed , the website was a forum where users could share a link to a file , ” Kuve replied .
“ These links were torrents , hosting servers or file upload sites like Megaupload , Gigasize , Rapidshare etc . ”
Kuve then went on to explain that he and his lawyer understood that all ongoing trials against similar sites ( such as Sharemula ) were resolved in the favor of the sites in the criminal courts .
However , the threat of being chased by the complainants for damages through the civil courts was very real and the costs associated with this would have been too much for Kuve to cope with .
So a deal was done .
Kuve would admit to being a criminal and accept the court ’s decision with the assurance that he would n’t be chased through the civil courts by the plaintiffs .
Kuve and his lawyer decided that it would make sense , financially at least .
“ I am a student and therefore do not have the financial resources needed to hire a defense expert that could ensure results in the trial .
Besides , continuing with the trial meant that the civil courts could convict me and I would be forced to pay financial compensation which I could n’t cope with , ” said Kuve .
“ I would have loved to defend my interests to the end and it is for this that I wish all the people in my situation who can afford to stay and fight for something that affects us all , the best of luck . ”
“ The real news here is that a person has been found guilty of something that was not an offense under 100 % of the judges who had resolved earlier identical cases , ” says a concerned David Bravo .
Javier de la Cueva , a lawyer working with David , told Torrent Freak something that will be of interest to lawyers representing admins like Kuve in the future .
Javier and David maintain a repository relating to Spanish court decisions on hyperlinking and release these documents under a CC - By License .
Thanks to this repository , any lawyer in Spain can use the documents to defend similar cases .
The documents have already enabled lawyer Franciso José Andújar to successfully defend TVMix .

Mick Schumacher set for F1 race weekend debut
Mick Schumacher is one of three Ferrari academy drivers who will be given Formula 1 race weekend debuts in forthcoming races .
Photo by oskayOur twin boys left for science camp yesterday morning .
Oh man , were they excited !
They have been counting down the days since they first brought home the informational brochure last August .
Since science has been the topic of conversation around our house lately , it was especially fitting that my good friend , Geoff , emailed me yesterday with some cool science - and - robot - related tidbits .
First up , he linked me to this fantastic circuitry snack .
( The resistor values are 100 k ( x2 ) , and a 1 uF Nilla wafer ceramic cap .
The LED load resistor is 330 ohms .
( orange-orange- black - gold )
The wires that are used here are the berry Twizzler strips . )
** not vegan , but hey , this one is not for eating , eh ?
Our conversation then turned to robots ( among many other interesting subjects ) , when he told me that the Capek brothers invented the word " robot " for their play , R.U.R. ( Rossum 's Universal Robots ) .
I did not know about this play , nor the robot word origin , so I started researching and found all sorts of interesting goodies .
R.U.R. is a science fiction play in the Czech language that was written by Karel Capek .
It premiered in 1921 in Prague ; debuted in the US in NYC in 1922 ; and first ran in London in April of 1923 .
The play starts out in a factory that makes artificial people , who were called robots .
Though happy to work for humans at first , they eventually begin a robot rebellion that leads to the end of the human race .
Before the play introduced the word robot , the machines had previously been called androids or automatons .
Though Karel Capek was certainly responsible for introducing the term robot and making it popular , he credits his brother Josef , a cubist painter and writer , as the true inventor of the word .
The word robot is derived from the czech noun " robota " meaning " labor . "
This excerpt from Lidové noviny ( Dec , 24 , 1933 ) , a daily newspaper published in the Czech Republic , as translated by Norma Comrada , discusses the robot origin .
About the Word Robot
translated by Norma Comrada
A reference by Professor Chudoba , to the Oxford Dictionary account of the word robot's origin and its entry into the English language , reminds me of an old debt .
The author of the play R.U.R. did not , in fact , invent that word ; he merely ushered it into existence .
It was like this : the idea for the play came to said author in a single , unguarded moment .
And while it was still warm he rushed immediately to his brother Josef , the painter , who was standing before an easel and painting away at a canvas till it rustled .
" Listen , Josef , " the author began , " I think I have an idea for a play . "
" What kind , " the painter mumbled ( he really did mumble , because at the moment he was holding a brush in his mouth ) .
The author told him as briefly as he could .
" Then write it , " the painter remarked , without taking the brush from his mouth or halting work on the canvas .
The indifference was quite insulting .
" But , " the author said , " I do n't know what to call these artificial workers .
I could call them Labori , but that strikes me as a bit bookish . "
" Then call them Robots , " the painter muttered , brush in mouth , and went on painting .
And that 's how it was .
Thus was the word Robot born ; let this acknowledge its true creator .
Isaac Asimov wrote " I , Robot " in 1950 ; a collection of nine short stories , in which he set out the principles of robot behavior known as the Three Laws of Robotics .
1 ) A robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
2 ) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
3 ) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
I especially love this line from Asimov 's book : " How old are you ? " she wanted to know .
" Thirty - two , " I said .
" Then you do n't remember a world without robots .
To you , a robot is a robot .
Gears and metal ; electricity and positrons .
Mind and iron !
Human -made !
If necessary , human - destroyed !
But you have n't worked with them , so you do n't know them .
They 're a cleaner better breed than we are . "
An interesting commentary , given that the book tells the stories of robots gone mad , robot - politicians , and robots who secretly run the world .
Who would have known what a reality those ideas would later become .
Check out this cool robot .
He is amazing !
And forward ahead to 44 sec on this one .
Awesome !
Maggie Koerth - Baker is a guest blogger on Boing Boing .
A freelance science and health journalist , Maggie lives in Minneapolis , brain dumps on Twitter , and writes quite often for mental_floss magazine .
So I 'm currently working on an article for Prevention magazine about some of the surprising ways that climate change can screw with your health .
The thing I least expected is the dirty lambada of destruction being danced , as we speak , by global warming and the common North American Toxicodendron radicans .
Part of what makes this so nifty to me , is that , once you think about it , it 's sort of a " duh " moment .
While not so great for you and I , carbon dioxide is , basically , plant food .
I 'm told that rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere affect different plants in different ways , but poison ivy is definitely one of the winners of global warming .
For this unpleasant little weed , more CO2 seems to mean more growth
But wait , it gets worse .
Lewis Ziska , a plant physiologist with the Agriculture Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , has been studying poison ivy both in the lab and out in the natural wilds of Duke University 's research forests .
He says that , not only is poison ivy growing fat and happy on the spoils of our carbon emissions , but that plants getting more CO2 also produce more , and stronger , levels of urushiol — the toxin that makes the ivy so darned appealing to begin with .
In fact , while other factors like the local growing season and the amount of light the plants are getting can alter CO2's results , Ziska says we can definitely see a difference between the poison ivy of today and the stuff your parents were chasing each other around with at Camp Thankgodthekidsrouttastate 50 years ago .
Um …happy summer !

ARE you confused about whether large federal budget deficits matter ?
No wonder , when disagreement about deficits is popping up everywhere .
Even among Republicans , there is no unity on this basic issue .
Defending his recent proposal to freeze government spending , Representative John A. Boehner , the House minority leader , said , “ We simply cannot afford to mortgage our children and grandchildren ’s future to pay for this big government spending spree . ”
But Martin Feldstein , the Harvard economist , disagrees .
An adviser to the past three Republican presidents , Professor Feldstein warns that failure to run large deficits would prolong the current economic downturn .
Because important policy decisions hinge on whether deficits matter , this is an opportune moment to take stock of what we know .
The good news is that there is little disagreement among economists who have studied the issue .
The consensus is that short - run deficits help end recessions , and that whether long - run deficits matter depends entirely on how government spends the borrowed money .
If failure to borrow meant forgoing productive investments , bigger long - run deficits would actually be better than smaller ones .
In 1929 , President Herbert Hoover thought that the best response to a collapsing economy was to balance the federal budget .
With incomes and tax receipts falling sharply , that meant cutting federal spending .
But as almost all economists now recognize , President Hoover was profoundly mistaken .
When a downturn throws people out of work , they spend less , causing still others to be thrown out of work , and so on , in a downward spiral .
Failure to use short - run deficits to stimulate spending amplifies that spiral , causing further declines in tax receipts and even bigger deficits .
That this path makes no sense is a settled issue .
A leading Tory youth activist apologised " unreservedly " to Kate and Gerry McCann tonight after dressing up as their missing daughter at a New Year 's party .
Conservative Future ( CF ) member Matthew Lewis was criticised by the family after bragging about the stunt on his Facebook site .
In a statement released tonight , he said : " I unreservedly apologise to Mr and Mrs McCann for my actions .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I completely regret my behaviour that night and since , and cannot express how sorry I am for the incredible hurt I have caused .
" Whilst my actions were not meant to be malicious , I fully understand the pain they have brought . "
Mr Lewis attracted criticism after writing on Facebook that his Madeleine McCann costume had included a blonde wig , " pink pyjamas , a teddy bear and a vial of fake blood " .
Other figures from Conservative Future joined in the joke , with one responding : " Is this a cunning ( Baldrick style ) plan to obtain the reward money ? "
Tory chairman Caroline Spelman branded Mr Lewis 's behaviour " totally unacceptable " and confirmed he had been expelled from the party .
" This offensive behaviour is not only shocking but intolerable and completely unacceptable , " she said .
" There is no place for this sort of person in the party . "
The party is also understood to be examining whether action should be taken against other CF members involved .
Clarence Mitchell , spokesman for the McCanns , earlier called for Mr Lewis to issue a public and private apology to the family .

" The offensiveness of this activist 's actions is almost beyond belief , " he said .
" I know Gerry and Kate will be grateful that the Tory party has taken swift and appropriate action by ejecting him from the party .
" His actions are not only disgraceful in themselves , they will also cause great hurt to Kate and Gerry .
I feel it is appropriate that he now apologises both privately and publicly to them .
" It is a complete disgrace that Madeleine 's name and image should be made fun of in this way . "
Mr Lewis - believed to be in his early 20s and a student at Queen Mary , University of London - resigned as chairman of Staffordshire CF last month in protest at internal reforms .
Images on the group 's website show him campaigning with David Cameron for last year 's Crewe and Nantwich by - election .
Mr Lewis was not answering his mobile phone today , but most of the exchanges remained visible on his Facebook profile until late this afternoon .
Page snapshots showing other comments were featured on the Tory Bear blog .
On New Year 's Day , after the party , Mr Lewis told another CF member , Flick Cox , online : " There was a brief moment when I thought I might have gone too far with elements of the costume , but it was ok . "
He added that another guest at the bash was dressed as Baby P , the toddler who died after a catalogue of horrific abuse .
" There may not be photos , I do n't think anyone wants to risk being associated with them ! "
Mr Lewis went on .
Ms Cox suggested that he may have " pulled a Prince Harry " - a reference to the royal 's controversial decision to wear a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party in 2005 .
She said she would " hate to have to end our friendship when I become an MP " if he got into trouble over the outfit .
Madeleine McCann went missing while on holiday with her family in Portugal in May 2007 .
She has yet to be found despite a massive worldwide hunt .
It is far from the first time Tories have found themselves in trouble after dressing up .
Last February two young activists in Scotland came in for widespread criticism after impersonating a master and slave at a party .
Brian Gordon , a Conservative councillor in the London borough of Brent , was also condemned after painting himself black to act as Nelson Mandela .
Party researcher Emma Claire Pentreath , faced a backlash after pictures appeared on Facebook of her also painted black .
Telstra 's attempts to cover up the fact that it tried to silence Fake Stephen Conroy have backfired spectacularly .
The Telstra employee who created the satirical Twitter profile has told his bosses not to " throw me under the f --- ing bus just to make Telstra look social - media savvy " .
After it was revealed that the popular Twitter profile impersonating Communications Minister Stephen Conroy was written by senior Telstra employee Leslie Nassar , the postings stopped .
Nassar refused to speak to media , saying he was told to direct all comment requests to Telstra 's public relations unit .
Step back just for a moment .
Much of the existing U.S. intelligence apparatus consists of officials empowered by the Bush Administration .
Leon Panetta , the incoming CIA director , has his confirmation hearing today .
The Director of National Intelligence , Dennis Blair , arrived at the job this week .
The State Department 's intelligence overseer began her job this week has not even been nominated yet .
Policy review processes remain .
It is quite possible that the White House , or some intelligence authority acting on behalf of the White House , asked Britain not to reveal the information provided to them because the new administration has n't gotten a handle on evertyhing that its intelligence authorities did and are doing .
As much as there 's a preference for disclosure and transparency , when it comes to national security , precuations and prudence are legitimate .
It may well be that Mohamed was tortured -- and that information was obtained legally using methods that are legal and ethical , and that a blanket disclosure of information would threaten the former as well as the latter .
The Bush Administration left the Obama Administration with a Gordian knot .
Untying it is not easy .
Strands will be frayed , jagged , and can cut deep .
The idea that the U.S. would actually threaten to cut off intelligence cooperation with the U.K. is absurd .
There are so many entagling operations , so many pre-existing agreements , so many pre-existing relationships so as to render that threat inoperable .
But something spooked the British judges .
And given the allegations , attention by reporters here in the states is required .
Update : a full response from the British government is here .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Today 's NY Times has a brief article about a speech and Q&A session justice Thomas had with a group of high school students .
The piece focuses on Thomas ' morose presence , on and off the bench , and includes the tidbit that he has n't asked a question in two years .
But the real eye openers are these :
The evening was devoted to the Bill of Rights , but Justice Thomas did not embrace the document , and he proposed a couple of alternatives .
‘ Today there is much focus on our rights , " Justice Thomas said .
" Indeed , I think there is a proliferation of rights . "
" I am often surprised by the virtual nobility that seems to be accorded those with grievances , " he said .
" Should n’t there at least be equal time for our Bill of Obligations and our Bill of Responsibilities ? "
How is this man allowed to serve on our Supreme Court when he seems to have no idea what is contained in the Constitution ?
He does not " embrace " the Bill of Rights ?
Clarence , here 's a radical idea that may not have occurred to you yet :
Look at the fucking Constitution , you dipshit .
It sure as hell contains a Bill of Rights , but does not contain any sort of Bill of Obligations or Bill of Responsibilities .
There should not be " equal time " for " our " Bill of Obligations or Bill of Responsibilities because they do not exist in the Constitution .
The founders wisely set forth a Bill of Rights to protect the freedoms of society .
Is Clarence Thomas basing his rulings on the contents of fictional Bills of Obligations and Bills of Responsibilities that he incorrectly thinks are actually in the Constitution ?
Or does he know they are not in the Constitution but is basing his rulings on what he think ought to be there ?
If so , he is either unfit to serve or violating his oath .
We all know how conservatives love to bitch and moan about " activist " judges when an interpretation of the Constitution does n't go their way .
So I 'm sure they will call for Thomas to resign now that he has almost proposed not even basing interpretations on the actual Constitution , right ?
Well , we all know the answer to that .
There are some other choice quote indicating that in addition to not understanding the very basics of our system of government , Thomas might be completely off his rocker in general :
" I have to admit , " he said , " that I ’m one of those people that still thinks the dishwasher is a miracle .
What a device !
And I have to admit that because I think that way , I like to load it .
I like to look in and see how that dishes were magically cleaned . "
Perhaps someone who thinks a dishwasher is ' magic ' is not up to the task of protecting the constitution of the United States in the 21st century .
Update :
Thank you for inclusion on the rec list .
To address some concerns that I 've read in the comments , these quotes are not proof , in of themselves , that Clarence Thomas does n't understand or does n't intend to apply the actual Constitution to his decisions .
But to me , they certainly hint at that , and it is very scary and telling that he so casually dismisses grievances that result from people being deprived of their Bill of Rights protections - protections actually unambiguously codified in the Constitution - and in the same sentence invokes competing legal standards ( the Bills of Responsibility and Obligations ) that just do n't exist in constitutional law .
At a minimun , he should be forced to clarify that he does indeed understand that 1 ) the rights enumerated in the Bill Of Rights are not conditional upon individuals or groups in society doing anything in return to earn or keep them , 2 ) the Supreme Court must interpret the Constitution as written , and that 3 ) there are no competing Bills of Responsibility on which Constitutional rulings can be based .
Update 2 : For an alternate perspective , from the comments - jlowery was actually there for this event and says that these quotes were taken out of context :
This is a pretty awesome bug found by fefe and affects almost every 2.6 kernel .
This massive destruction bug can be found under fs / cifs / connect .c .
Here is the code from 2.6.28.9 release of the Linux kernel :
3441 int 3442 CIFSTCon ( unsigned int xid , struct cifsSesInfo * ses , 3443 const char * tree , struct cifsTconInfo * tcon , 3444 const struct nls_table * nls_codepage ) 3445 { 3446 struct smb_hdr * smb_buffer ; 3447 struct smb_hdr *smb_buffer_response ; 3448 TCONX_REQ *pSMB ; 3449 TCONX_RSP
*pSMBr ; 3450 unsigned char * bcc_ptr ; 3451 int rc = 0 ; 3452 int length ; 3453 __u16 count ; ... 3458 smb_buffer = cifs_buf_get ( ) ; ... 3561 if ( smb_buffer ->Flags2 & SMBFLG2_UNICODE ) { 3562 length = UniStrnlen ( ( wchar_t *) bcc_ptr , 512 ) ; 3563 if ( ( bcc_ptr + ( 2 * length ) ) - 3564 pByteArea(smb_buffer_response ) <= 3565 BCC(smb_buffer_response ) ) { 3566 kfree( tcon->nativeFileSystem ) ; 3567 tcon->nativeFileSystem = 3568 kzalloc( length + 2 , GFP_KERNEL ) ; ... 3579 /* else do not bother copying these information fields */ ... 3606 cifs_buf_release(smb_buffer ) ; 3607 return rc ; 3608 }
As you can see , if the user controlled buffer smb_buffer ( line 3458 ) is Unicode ( line 3561 ) , it calculates its length ( again , this is a signed integer for some reason but that ’s irrelevant here ) using UniStrnlen ( ) and if this is less than , or equal to smb_buffer_response ‘s bytes using BCC ( ) macro which is defined as fs / cifs / cifspdu.h simply like this :
416 /* given a pointer to an smb_hdr retrieve the value of byte count */ 417 # define BCC ( smb_var ) ( *( __u16 *) (( char *) smb_var + sizeof ( struct smb_hdr ) + ( 2 * smb_var->WordCount ) ) ) 418 # define BCC_LE ( smb_var ) ( *( __le16 *) ( ( char *) smb_var + sizeof ( struct smb_hdr ) + ( 2 * smb_var->WordCount ) ) )
Then , free the allocated native filesystem memory ( line 3566 ) , and re-allocate it using kzalloc ( ) at line 3568 .
This should have enough size to store the unicode string but instead of doing :
( length + 1 ) * 2
Since unicode needs at least 2 bytes for each character and another one for NULL termination , it does this :
length + 2
Clearly , this insufficient allocation leads to a nice remotely exploitable buffer overflow .
The patch was simple as that :
tcon->nativeFileSystem = - kzalloc( length + 2 , GFP_KERNEL ) ; + kzalloc( 2*( length + 1 ) , GFP_KERNEL ) ; if ( tcon->nativeFileSystem )
This definitely worth more research since it might still be exploitable .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Almost 90 percent of the tens of thousands of U.S. - backed fighters who helped purge much of Iraq of al Qaeda have been transferred to Iraqi control , the U.S. commander in charge of their program said Saturday .
Major General Mike Ferriter told journalists around 84,000 members of predominantly Sunni Arab “ Awakening Councils ” -- neighborhood guard units that were paid by the U.S. military to fight militants -- were handed to Iraqi government authority and thousands of those had since left the program for other work .
Only about 10,000 , all in the northern province of Salahuddin , remained to be handed over in the coming months .
Putting the guards , many of whom were once insurgents who switched sides , on the payroll of a government they once fought is seen as a major test of reconciliation as the United States prepares to pull its combat troops out of Iraq by August 31 , 2010 .
“ The eyes of the world are on you , Iraq , and it ’s the opportunity to prove that you ’re going to pull it together ... in spite of the many , many doubts , ” Ferriter said .
Called Awakening Councils or “ Sahwa ” in Arabic , the units led mostly by Sunni Arab tribal sheikhs began turning against al Qaeda militants two years ago in western Iraq ’s Anbar province , providing a model that was rolled out nationwide .
The guards had been receiving roughly $ 300 a month from the U.S. military , paid through local tribal sheikhs .
In October , the Iraqi government started paying roughly 50,000 in Baghdad .
Since then , the northern provinces of Diyala , Kirkuk and Nineveh , the southern Shi’ite provinces of Wasit , Babil and Qadasiya , and in the west , Anbar , have been ceded to the Iraqi government , which will start paying salaries in these provinces at different times between now and May , Ferriter said .
Many former insurgents in the program have feared arrest .
Others feared being abandoned by the government , which has promised jobs in its security forces for a fifth of Sahwa members but says it will find civilian work or training for the rest .
Ferriter said the program had defied gloomy predictions and Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki had kept his word not to detain ex-insurgents or pursue vendettas against them .
“ A lot of concerns that we ’ve heard ... have not come to fruition , ” he said .
“ The concern that ... they ’d be disbanded or would n’t get paid or be arrested ... have n’t occurred . ”
Questions remain over their long term future .
Iraq is committed to finding jobs for the four fifths who do not get into the security forces , but so far only the Education and Health ministries have vacancies , for 10,000 and 3,000 , respectively .
The police have taken in 5,000 so far and the army , 500 .
But Ferriter was upbeat .
“ It ’ll take 6 to 7 months to complete the job transition and I predict success , ” he said .

Logic Tips & Techniques DAWs > Logic By Paul White
Getting great recorded vocals can seem like rocket science , especially with all the complicated editing and processing tools that Logic now provides .
So here we 'll be giving you the advice you need to produce that big commercial sound .
Recording vocals , in a generic sense , has been covered in Sound On Sound on numerous occasions , but this time we 're going to look at the process of recording and processing vocals using Apple 's Logic .
The process starts with getting a microphone signal into Logic , which usually means connecting a suitable mixer or mic preamp to the line input of your audio interface , or using an audio interface that has a mic preamp built in .
Of course the choice and positioning of the microphone is just as crucial as in any other recording situation ( see the ' Getting A Good Recording ' box for some pointers ) .
If you 're using a capacitor mic , then the preamp or mixer must have phantom power — unless you 're using a tube mic that is .
You may have a rack compressor that always sounds absolutely fantastic with your voice , but my inclination would usually be to avoid any form of processing while recording .
In the bad old days , we needed to compress while recording to tape in order to maintain a high average recording level that would mask the tape noise , but with 24 - bit recording you can easily leave 12 dB or more recording headroom and not lose any quality at all .
If you feel you must compress while recording , then at least make sure that you under - compress slightly rather than over - compress , as you can always add a bit more compression when you come to mix .
The same applies to EQ — it 's much easier to add it than to undo the effect of inappropriate EQ , so it 's safest to record everything flat and then EQ while mixing if you need to .
If your mic preamp has a low - cut switch , it may be worth using that to exclude very low - frequency sounds , such as passing traffic , but try a test recording with and without the filter to ensure that it does n't compromise the low end of the voice in an unacceptable way .
The next issue with any computer recording system is to see whether you can get the latency value low enough for the singer to feel comfortable when monitoring the output from your audio interface .
Nobody can give their best performance when what 's coming back through the headphones is delayed to a noticeable degree .
Most reasonably modern computer audio systems are happy to work with buffer sizes of 128 samples or lower , Logic included , but you may need to increase the buffer size if the computer is being forced to work particularly hard .
Software instruments place the greatest drain on CPU resources and Logic 's Freeze function can help you here by rendering these instrument tracks as temporary audio files to free up CPU power .
As a rule , I record with a buffer size of 128 , which amounts to a latency of around four milliseconds ( by the time you 've added in the delay attributable to the A - D and D - A converters ) at 44.1 k Hz and 48 k Hz sample rates — roughly the time it takes sound to travel four feet .
Most singers do n't perceive this delay , but please be aware that if you are using any DSP - assisted plug-ins such as those hosted by the Universal Audio UAD1 card or TC Electronic 's Powercore , the latency will double and is then likely to be noticed .
You 'll also suffer greater monitoring latency if any of the tracks in your existing song use any plug-ins that themselves generate large delays , as Logic 's plug - in delay compensation will ( if active ) delay all the other tracks to match .
Most of Logic 's processing plug-ins introduce only very short delays , but there are exceptions such as the new linear - phase equaliser .
Note that plug - in delay compensation seems to be switched off when you first configure Logic , in which case you 'll need to turn it on in Logic 's Audio Preferences .
Where high latencies can't be avoided , you can still get around the delayed monitoring problem by taking a second feed from your preamp .
Many preamps now have both jack and XLR outputs so you can record from one and monitor from the other , but a splitter lead can do the job just as well .
The extra preamp output can then be mixed with the output from your soundcard , either in a separate monitoring mixer or in a master monitor controller that offers the facility to mix two or more inputs .
You 'll need to turn off Logic 's software monitoring in the Preferences to avoid hearing both the direct and delayed sound , and you wo n't be able to add any plug - in reverb to make the singer more comfortable .
However , if you have an old hardware reverb unit , you can patch this into the mixer you 're using for monitoring and set up some ' comfort ' reverb that way .
You can feed the singer 's phones directly from the monitor mixer 's own headphone output or use the mixer to drive a separate headphone amplifier .
Getting A Good Recording
Most vocal parts are recorded using a cardioid - pattern condenser microphone , usually a large - diaphragm model .
There are lots of these to choose from these days , and most will give good results if used carefully , even the relatively cheap ones .
In most instances where users complain of a mic sounding boxy or coloured , what they 're really hearing is the acoustic properties of their recording space affecting the recording .
If you 're working in a typical domestic room , you can make the best of the situation by following a few simple guidelines .
Firstly , hang up some acoustically absorbent material , such as a duvet or some heavy blankets , behind and to either side of the singer .
This will help prevent sound bouncing from the room surfaces back into the microphone .
Then set up the mic well away from walls , but avoid putting it exactly halfway between any two sets of walls , as this may exaggerate any room coloration — a couple of feet from the dead centre of a room is generally fine .
Always use a mesh pop screen between the singer and the mic , and leave at least a couple of inches between this and the mic — it wo n't work properly otherwise .
As far as singer - to - mic distance is concerned , start with a gap of around six inches , as this is far enough away to avoid the worst of the proximity bass - boost effect , but close enough to give a good ratio of direct sound to room reflections .
Finally , provide the singer with a comfortable headphone mix , and do n't record in the same room as your computer setup unless you really have to , otherwise you 'll probably pick up some fan and drive noise .
If you have no alternative , face the mic away from the computer and try to keep as large a distance as is practical between the mic and the computer .
If all has gone well , you should now have a clean recording of what was hopefully a good vocal performance .
To turn this good recording into a great one , you can use Logic 's Expander or Gate to remove low - level noise between phrases , you can use Compressor to add density and to even out the vocal level , and you can add EQ to fine - tune the tonality of the sound .
The final touch is to add reverb , but if the vocal pitching needs a little work , there 's always Logic Pro 7 's new Pitch Correction plug - in to help you out .
As a matter of course , I usually get the singer to do at least two complete takes of each part , as well as revisiting sections that might need patching up .
The complete takes can be handled on separate tracks , muting the first before you record the second .
If you 're lucky , you 'll be able to use the scissors tool to compile the best sections from each to produce a definitive take , but more often than not you 'll need to retake specific sections .
The easiest way to do this is to create a new track that has the same Track Instrument as the original vocal take ( or compiled take ) and then use the automatic punch - in / out function to handle the recording for you .
First drag ( from left to right ) in the upper part of the Time Ruler bar in the Arrange window to mark out the section you want to record , activate the punch - in / out transport button and enable the record switch on your new track .
Pressing Record will then start the process , playing from the current cursor position .
Logic will play what 's on the existing track right up until the punch - in point whereupon it will monitor the new recording source ( the voice ) and record it .
When the system punches out , you 'll hear the original track again .
If the new section was OK , you can snip a hole in the original vocal track and then slide the new take into its place , holding down the shift key to prevent the start time of the insert from being accidentally moved .
Once in place , you can use the crossfade tool to avoid glitching if you 've cut in the middle of a phrase , but most times it 's best simply to arrange the edit ( punch in and out ) points in the pauses between phrases .
During this compiling and optimising process , you may also find that some chorus sections or other repeated phrases sound better than others , in which case you may wish to copy them and replace the less good ones .
Using Logic 's new Marquee tool , you can identify your source section without having first to cut the sequence into pieces using the Scissors tool and then copy it using the usual Alt - drag procedure after first switching back to the normal Pointer tool .
Once you 're happy with the quality of the vocal part , you can start to process it .
Logic 's Gate is perfectly adequate for removing low - level noise between words and phrases , and its side - chain filters are useful if there 's any other very low - or very high - frequency sound present that might otherwise trigger the gate and open it when it should be closed .
The gate should be the first process used , so it 's best to put it in the top Track object insert slot .
If you set the side - chain filters to 150 Hz and 6 k Hz respectively , the gate should trigger reliably on vocals while ignoring things like traffic rumble or fan whine .
For vocals , it 's usually best to set the gate to open as fast as possible , but to close over a period of around a quarter of a second , so that naturally decaying notes are n't cut off too abruptly .
You can see if this can be improved upon by trying faster release times , as a lot depends on the performance and the level of noise present .
While gates can apply almost infinite attenuation when closed , you may get a more natural sound by setting the gate range to around 12dB , which should still be enough to hide any noise ( unless your recording is really noisy ) .
I 've tried Logic 's own noise - reduction plug - in , but found it rather disappointing , and though an Expander will work just as well as a gate in this application , there 's no real advantage under normal conditions .
Once you 've gated the vocal track to clean it up , you can then compress it by inserting Logic 's compressor in the next available insert slot .
For vocals , I tend to use the RMS compressor mode with the Knee slider over towards the Hard end of its range .
The ratio can be somewhere between 4:1 and 8:1 , depending on how assertive the compression needs to be .
A fast attack followed by a 100 - 200 ms release time usually works well , but if you like your compressors to audibly pump , then try a shorter release time .
That leaves the Threshold control , the setting of which depends on the level and dynamics of the vocal recording .
A good rule of thumb is to adjust it until you get around 6 dB of gain reduction on the loudest peaks if you are being subtle , or up to 16 dB or so if you 're after an obviously compressed rock vocal sound .
However , be aware that for every decibel of noise reduction applied , any background noise and room ambience on the recording will come up by exactly the same amount between phrases , which underlines the need to capture a clean recording in the first place .
That 's another good reason to gate the track , even though it may not appear noisy prior to adding compression .
Logic 's Pitch Correction plug - in can be placed before or after a compressor and , intuitively , I feel it has a better chance of working properly if it comes afterwards , as it will receive a more constant level .
Having said that , this plug - in is so good that it copes with all normal vocals , compressed or not .
Normally I only use pitch - correction where I really have to , and you can slow the rate of pitch - correction right down between the phrases that need treatment , using Logic 's automation , which has the effect of reducing the amount of processing applied — only long , sustained notes are then corrected .
You can also automate the plug - in bypass button if you prefer to do it that way .
An alternative approach is to split the audio part over two tracks with identical plug-ins and track settings , then insert the Pitch Correction plug - in on one of them .
By moving just the parts that need correcting onto the track with the Pitch Correction plug-ins , you can easily control where the processing is and is n't applied without having to use any automation .
If you 've yet to upgrade to Logic v7.1 then it'll be necessary to duplicate the track plug-ins ( which can be copied over , complete with their settings , using the Audio Configuration window ) rather than routing both audio tracks to a Buss object and putting the common plug-ins in its insert points — although this saves on processing power , the lack of plug - in delay compensation in Logic 's busses will cause the vocal part to be delayed slightly .
You can fix this manually using a negative track delay if you 're really short of processing power , but under normal circumstances , duplicating a gate , a compressor , and possibly an equaliser wo n't add significantly to the processing load .
As with most pitch - correction plug-ins , the most natural results are obtained by setting the response time as slow as possible commensurate with still controlling any obvious pitch wandering .
If you set it too fast , natural inflections start to get ironed out , and the result becomes somewhat robotic .
Although this misuse of pitch - correction has been successful as a special effect on a number of pop records , it 's not the way to go if you want a natural - sounding vocal performance .
EQ is best applied after pitch - correction , and what you need to do , as always , is emphasise the positive aspects of the source sound while reducing any unpleasant characteristics .
Often a sizzle is added to the high end by applying a broad boost ( around two octaves wide ) at anywhere from 8 k Hz to 12 k Hz using Logic 's Channel EQ ( the standard version , not the new linear - phase option ) .
It 's also worth setting up a fairly narrow band ( half an octave or so ) and then sweeping this through the mid-range to see if it picks out any nasal or boxy artefacts that need suppressing .
More experienced users will be able to estimate the problem frequency and then try the cut without having to sweep first , which can help maintain a better sense of perspective .
Which approach you prefer is up to you —
I still tend to be a bit of a sweeper !
EQ seems to be a very personal thing , where some people use hardly any and others pile it on .
Different musical styles demand different approaches , but if the end result sounds right , then it is right .
However , never judge the result of EQ in isolation — it 's essential that you hear the part in the context of the complete mix .
Until very recently , the majority of native - powered software reverbs have been , frankly , rather disappointing .
Logic 's Platinumverb used to be top of the Logic reverb range , but it 's really not that great .
It is fine for demos , and it suits some instruments , but it 's not a classy vocal reverb by any stretch of the imagination .
As for the Gold , Silver , Lead , and Cardboard variants , just forget them .
If you 're using a version of Logic that only offers these , and you do n't have any third - party alternatives , then the best option is to use a mid-price hardware reverb unit and feed it from one of Logic 's aux sends via a spare output on your soundcard .
If you only have stereo digital and analogue I/O , then choose a reverb unit with a choice of digital I / O so you can feed it directly from the soundcard 's S / PDIF output .
Its output , analogue or digital ( depending again on what your soundcard offers ) , can then go back into two soundcard channels routed to a stereo Input or Aux object within Logic , which will then act as an aux return .
Having said all that , anyone with Logic Pro 7 also has Space Designer , a fantastic reverb , at their disposal .
It is a bit processor - intensive , as it uses impulse responses and convolution techniques , but you can halve its appetite by choosing a halved Sample Rate setting at the left of the plug - in window and then clicking the Preserve Length box .
This in effect halves the frequency response of the reverb , giving it an upper limit of around 10 k Hz , but that 's still enough to emulate most classic reverb effects .
Normally Space Designer would be placed in a Buss object and fed from track sends — even if you do n't have plug - in delay compensation , who cares if your reverb comes back a few milliseconds late ?
It 's the same as increasing the pre-delay very slightly .
Just remember to ensure the Space Designer mix controls are set so that the Direct signal is off and the Reverb signal is at maximum .
You can then adjust the amount of added reverb using the send controls , and in most cases somewhere around 20 percent reverb sounds about right .
As to which reverb setting to use , you 're spoilt for choice , especially if you have Logic Pro 7 with all its extra reverb impulse responses .
There are many vocal plates and vocal studio presets to try , but my advice would be also to try out some of the less likely - sounding presets such as the woods and forests , as some of these sound stunning on vocals .
Even the Station Platform preset can sound great .
Whereas the synthetic reverbs in Logic sound grainy and do n't really gel with the original sound , Space Designer behaves just like a high - end studio reverb , becoming part of the sound itself rather than seeming to be layered on .
For conventional pop music , the impulse responses based on other hardware reverbs rather than on real spaces often work best , as that 's what we 're used to hearing .
Some people find the need to de-ess vocals , and Logic has a plug - in for that too , though I do n't think it works as well as a dedicated de-esser box , such as the one made by SPL .
In most cases , changing the mic position or choosing a different mic works in all but the most extreme cases .
In fact , I find that the most common requirement is to make the vocals sound more crisp , which can be done using ' air ' EQ in the 12k Hz range or by using Logic 's Exciter plug - in , which essentially resynthesizes the upper harmonics based on what 's going on in the mid-range .
It 's important not to set the filter frequency too low ( 1.5 - 2 k Hz seems good for vocals ) and not to over - process , but switching to bypass on a regular basis should ensure you 're not overdoing things .
Although there is a lot of esoteric hardware and software available for processing vocals , the plug-ins that come as part of Logic Pro are capable of doing a great job if used correctly .
However , the most important thing is to start with a good , clean recording made in a well - damped or acoustically sympathetic space , as any boxiness caused by the room can't be fixed afterwards .
After that you need to use your ears to judge what the sound needs , rather than processing just because you feel you have to .
If you get the best sound without compression or EQ , then do n't use it .
Similarly , do n't smother the sound in reverb just because you can .
On many mixes , I find it 's appropriate to use less compression and then compensate for more excessive level changes using Logic 's level automation .
The less you have to do to a vocal to get it sounding right , the more natural the end result is likely to be .
David Rothkopf has a long post going after Stephen Walt .
It feels to me like an attempt to reaffirm his credentials against the Walt - Mearsheimer thesis , but he also makes some important points .
Read the whole anguished thing .
Walt himself concludes the debate with this zinger :
If Freeman were Israeli , he could write a regular column in Ha'retz and nobody would bat an eye .
I think that 's true - and the fact that there is a broader , clearer debate in Israel than in Washington should be troubling .
It does seem to me that the issue , framed in the best light , is simply : what kind of relationship should the US have with Israel ?
With the rise of Islamism , America and Israel face a common foe , but their interests in confronting that enemy may not always be identical .
If we are to give Obama the diplomatic space necessary for progress , we need a little less Schumer and a little more Freeman .
Sometimes , it seems to me , the admirable passion many have for the Jewish state can flood the frontal cortex and not allow for a more measured take on specific issues .
As the US prepares to make the toughest decision since the Iraq war - whether to launch an Iran war - this is more vital than ever .
To put it more bluntly : assertions of " conspiracy " or a view that the Israel lobby is in some way more nefarious than , say , the Cuba lobby , or many other lobbies , need to be confronted directly .
These things are not true .
But equally , the notion that those who want to establish a more normal relationship with Israel are all closet anti-Semites or " hostile to Israel " seems to me to be just as damaging .
In the Hot Topics section of gay.com there is an article called " Can Guys Actually Be Bisexual ? "
There have been a plethora of so called " LGBT " sources lately that continually question the legitimacy of the bisexual orientation , how is that acting as a community , or accepting non-heteronormative identities besides just gay and lesbian .
Here are some of my reactions to some select quotes in the article :
" So what do we make of these guys who define themselves as bi ?
Are they really fooling themselves as they screw their way down the path to gayhood ? "
I accept peoples choice to self - identify as they like , and am fully comfortable in accepting bisexuality as a variant of human sexuality .
The sexual continuum allows for varying degrees of sexuality , while some people are exclusively heterosexual or homosexual , many people fall somewhere along the long , complicated and often blurred line of human sexuality .
" Some people are just sexually charged and will take it wherever they can get it . "
Bisexual people are no more sexually charged than any other sexual orientation .
The capacity to have sexual / romantic feelings for either gender , does not mean you have a high sex drive nor does it mandate that you not follow monogamy .
Bisexuals can be just as exciting or boring as the rest of society , regardless of their sexual orientation .
" Women on the other hand are more emotionally driven than men and can , I believe , be bisexual . "
There are emotional men , and non-emotional women , and to preach otherwise is to make a broad statement that when held to the test will fail .
Emotion has nothing to do with gender , males are emotional , society shuns male emotion regarding it as effeminate , but that does not mean that it does not exist .

This February 28 , Haitians will observe an important anniversary in the 205 - year history of their country .
But it wo n’t be a celebration .
There will be protests across the country condemning events five years ago that continue to reverberate .
On February 29 , 2004 , Haiti ’s popular and elected president , Jean - Bertrand Aristide , was overthrown by a right - wing paramilitary rebellion that received essential material and political backing from the United States , France , and Canada and from the neighbouring Dominican Republic .
An apparatus of the UN Security Council , known by its acronym , MINUSTAH , has played a dominant role in the affairs of the country ever since .
MINUSTAH is the only military mission in UN history to operate without the assent of the government or major political forces of the target country .
It counts 10,000 military , police , and administrative personnel and spends some $ 600 million per year , a fantastic sum in this , the poorest country in the Americas .
The annual budget of Haiti ’s national government is half that amount .
Most Haitians are losing the last of their reserves of patience with the foreign presence .
Two months ago , tens of thousands marched and rallied in Port - au - Prince and in other cities across the country to protest MINUSTAH ’s heavy - handed police and military patrols and draw attention to its failure to tackle the country ’s crushing poverty .
Conditions at every level have worsened in Haiti since 2004 .
Poverty and hunger are rising .
Agricultural production is weak and suffered further following a succession of four hurricanes last summer .
Malnutrition is widespread and starvation has appeared in some parts of the country .
Half of Haiti ’s children do not attend school .
Half of its people have no access to medical care .
The medical situation would be a whole lot worse but for networks of clinics operated by the Cuban government , Zanmi Lasante ( founded by Dr. Paul Farmer and his Partners in Health project ) , and Doctors Without Borders .
In Washington on February 6 , Haitian president René Préval called on the U.S. to help with an immediate aid boost of $ 100 million , according to the Washington Post .
He also said he wants an end to the U.S. policy of channelling all its aid money to Haiti through nongovernmental organizations .
It should instead go directly to the sovereign government , which Préval says can do a better job in most cases .
NGOs have been used by the big powers as a weapon against Haitian sovereignty .
Many , in Canada as elsewhere , supported the overthrow of Aristide or acquiesced through silence .
The Canadian government and its Canadian International Development Agency say they provide $ 110 million per year to assist Haiti .
But little reaches ordinary Haitians .
Much of it props up institutions of foreign domination , in particular the national police and a dysfunctional judicial system .
According to Brian Concannon of the Oregon - based Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti , “ It ’s very difficult for the big powers to assist with improvements to the judicial system because of their support to the 2004 coup and the widespread political persecutions that followed .
Where is the credibility when a foreign trainer tries to teach a Haitian judge or police official to follow proper legal procedures ? ”
Concannon believes that the new U.S. administration offers hope for improvements in U.S. –Haiti relations .
“ I am confident that we will see an end to the failed policies of the past eight years , notably the overthrow of an elected government , ” he said in an interview .
“ But we also need a change in the failed policies of the past two centuries .
The U.S. , in particular , must end the long , sad history of interference in Haiti ’s political affairs .
That ’s the starting point for a change in Haiti that we can believe in : respect for the sovereignty of the country and the political choices of its people . ”
Actor Matt Damon , sharing a platform with Concannon at a public forum in Boston on January 27 , spoke about his visit to Haiti in September 2008 , after the hurricanes .
Haiti needs “ a Marshall Plan ” , Damon said , referring to the reconstruction of European countries following the Second World War .
“ I am hoping that the hopeful , and youthful , energy generated by the election of Obama in addressing issues of poverty [ in the United States ] can lead to focus on issues of extreme poverty [ in Haiti ] . ”
The Canada Haiti Action Network will hold public events across Canada coinciding with the anniversary of the 2004 coup d’état in Haiti .
Filmmaker Kevin Pina will speak on Sunday ( March 1 ) at 2 p.m. at Harbour Centre in downtown Vancouver .
Roger Annis is a coordinator of the Canada Haiti Action Network and its local affiliate , Haiti Solidarity B.C .
Foreign detainees ' have US right '
About 600 so - called enemy combatants are held at Bagram air base A US judge has ruled that foreign suspects held by the US in Afghanistan have the right to challenge their detention in US civilian courts .
Judge John Bates denied the motion by the US government to withhold the right to three detainees at Bagram air base .
The US Supreme Court ruled last year that detainees at Guantanamo had such a right .
The justice department later said those held at Bagram did not .
Judge Bates said the cases were essentially the same .
The three detainees have been held at the US military prison at Bagram for at least six years after having been captured outside Afghanistan .
Judge Bates ' ruling now allows them to challenge their detention in the US justice system .
The three detainees are Fadi al Maqaleh and Amin al Bakri from Yemen and Redha al - Najar from Tunisia .
Today , a US federal judge ruled that our government cannot simply kidnap people and hold them beyond the law
Ramzi Kassem , detainee 's lawyer A fourth detainee , Haji Wazir , who had also brought a lawsuit seeking his release is an Afghan citizen .
Judge Bates reserved judgement on his case , saying the implication that he could be released could create " friction with the host country " .
" Bagram detainees who are not Afghan citizens , who were not captured in Afghanistan and who have been held for an unreasonable amount of time - here over six years - without adequate process " have the legal right to challenge their detention in US courts , Judge Bates said in his 53 - page opinion .
The justice department said it was reviewing the ruling .
' Great day for justice '
The ruling is a rebuff to the Obama administration , says the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington .
It is not definitive , says our correspondent .
Legal proceedings will continue for some time .
A lawyer representing one of the detainees said it was " a great day for American justice " .
" Today , a US federal judge ruled that our government cannot simply kidnap people and hold them beyond the law , " lawyer Ramzi Kassem was quoted as saying by the Washington Post .
About 600 so - called enemy combatants are held at the US prison at Bagram air base .

Our family loves onions .
All three kids love them .
Steve loves them .
I love them .
I add them to any dish I can where it wo n't be completely odd to sneak an amaryllis lovely into ; and I adore the aroma of chopped onions and garlic simmering in my kitchen .
So last night while I was chopping two plump red onions to add to my sizzling pan , I wondered how something so terrific could make me CRY !
Photo by Darwin BellIt seems that when you slice into an onion , you break open onion cells that have enzymes inside of them .
When these enzymes are cut open , they escape and then decompose some of the other substances ( amino acid sulfoxides and sulfenic acids ) that have been released from the sliced cells .
These substances rapidly rearrange themselves into a volatile gas .
This gas then reaches your eyes and reacts with the natural water that keeps your eyes wet and it changes the form of the chemical again , generating a sulfuric acid that irritates your eyes .
The nerve endings in your eyes are extremely sensitive and they relay the message to your brain that something is suspicious and that you need to start making more tears , to protect your eyes by diluting that annoying acid .
That volatile compound that stirs up the crying problem in the first place is ALSO responsible for making the onion taste so yummy and giving off such a delectable smell .
Green onions , leeks , garlic , and shallots do not make us cry because while they produce sulfenic acid when cut , they have fewer LF - synthase enzymes and do n’t produce syn- propanethial - S - oxide .
A few tips to aid in the prevention of onion weeping include :
1. Chill or slightly freeze the onion before cutting , as it will mildly change the chemical reactions and reduce the gas released .
2 . Cut fast !
( my method )
3 . Cut the onion under running water , as it prevents the gas from reaching your eyes as quickly .
4 . For the extremely sensitive , wear goggles .
I know that nobody wants to wear scuba gear to prepare dinner ; but hey , extreme onion situations sometimes call for extreme measures .

As the global financial downturn continues and pressure for profits increases on corporations across the world , a small group of lawyers in the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing an aggressive crackdown against an international business tactic -- bribery -- which the World Bank says amounts to as much as a trillion dollars a year in payments .
( more »)
" Over the past two years , the U.S. government has collected almost a billion and a half dollars in fines in foreign bribery cases , " says Mark Mendelsohn , the Department of Justice prosecutor in charge of more than 100 ongoing cases , one of which culminated in a record seven - year prison term for the former CEO of a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corp. , and another which ended in a record $ 800 million fine against the German giant Siemens .
" There 's a whole world of conduct that rarely sees the light of day . "
In Black Money , FRONTLINE correspondent Lowell Bergman investigates this shadowy side of international business , shedding light on multinational companies that have routinely made secret payments -- often referred to as " black money " -- to win billions in business .
" The thing about black money is you can claim it 's being used for all kinds of things , " the British reporter David Leigh tells Bergman .
" You get pots of black money that nobody sees , nobody has to account for , ... you can do anything you like with .
Mostly what happens with black money is people steal it because they can . "
Leigh knows .
In his groundbreaking reporting for The Guardian newspaper , he helped uncover one of the biggest and most complicated cases currently under investigation -- a story involving a British aerospace giant , the Saudi royal family , and an $ 80 billion international arms deal known as Al Yamamah , or " The Dove " in Arabic .
" If there was one person who was the main man behind this arms deal , it turned out it was the U.S. ambassador , Prince Bandar bin Sultan , " says Leigh .
It all started back in 1985 , when the charismatic Prince Bandar was put in charge of acquiring new fighter jets for the Saudi Arabian air force .
The Israeli lobby in Congress reportedly stood in the way of the United States making a deal with the Saudis , so President Ronald Reagan sent Bandar to the British .
The prince approached a willing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and they sealed the massive deal between the United Kingdom , BAE Systems ( formerly British Aerospace ) and the Royal Saudi Air Force .
Rumors swirled that billions in bribes had changed hands to secure the deal , but British officials denied wrongdoing .
" Of course there is suspicion , and of course people are entitled to be suspicious , " says Lord Timothy Bell , who was involved in the deal from the beginning on behalf of the Thatcher government .
" But as far as I 'm concerned , if the British government ... and the Saudi government reached a sovereign agreement over an arms contract that resulted in a tremendous number of jobs in Britain , a great deal of wealth creation in Britain , ... and enabled Saudi Arabians to defend themselves , ... I think that 's a jolly good contract . "
But then , as a growing , international anti-bribery movement -- led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- spread , Britain signed onto a binding treaty .
Soon after , a whistleblower came forward with documents and firsthand knowledge of alleged corrupt payments .
Peter Gardiner , a high - end travel agent in London , laid bare the details of how he provided luxury services for Saudi Prince Turki and his family -- charter airplanes for massive shopping sprees , the purchase of expensive cars and extravagant honeymoon trips -- all paid for by BAE Systems .
" It 's the lifestyle that many people would like to have if they could afford it , " says Gardiner .
" It 's a little bit beyond that of a film star , because you 've got the diplomatic passport with it . "
Gardiner took his allegations first to The Guardian 's Leigh , and then to the British agency that investigates white - collar crime , the Serious Fraud Office , which began an investigation .
That probe would turn up evidence of huge payments from the Al Yamamah funds to bank accounts controlled by Prince Bandar in Washington , D.C .
As the investigation grew , the Blair government was pressured by the Saudis and by Prince Bandar himself , who went to 10 Downing Street and threatened to end cooperation with the British in the fight against terror if the investigations into Al Yamamah continued .
" The expression was , ' You know , there 's going to be a lot of people dead on the streets , ' " a senior British fraud prosecutor tells Bergman of the Saudi threats that ultimately led to the shutting down of the British BAE investigation .
" If we go forward with an investigation into these accounts in Switzerland , we may find we 're not going to be able to do what we can do to stop terrorism . "
There was widespread frustration among corruption fighters about the British capitulation , and fears that the fledgling international anti-bribery movement would be undermined .
Soon thereafter , the U.S. Department of Justice began its own investigation into BAE 's worldwide network of suspicious payments .
The case is now being watched closely by countries around the world interested in seeing whether the United States is willing , in a depressed economy , to press forward with an investigation and possible legal case against a company like BAE Systems , whose major client is the Pentagon , and which currently employs some 40,000 American workers .
For its part , BAE says that it is cooperating with the investigations .
Black Money includes exclusive interviews with current and former prosecutors involved in the cases against BAE Systems , as well as with Prince Bandar 's legal representative on this matter , former FBI Director Louis Freeh .
Parallel to the documentary , FRONTLINE and its international newsmagazine FRONTLINE / World have launched The Business of Bribes , an unfolding online investigation .
The site offers breaking news stories , as well as in - depth interviews with middlemen , prosecutors , whistleblowers and former presidents , detailing the stories behind some of the largest bribery investigations in corporate history .

Lately many top AIG employees who were targeted by Congress in the $ 165 million " Bonusgate " incident have returned their bonuses .
Some people are still holding out , and in my opinion , they would be better off if they simply donated their bonuses instead of returning it to AIG .
Here is an open letter to these employees and others who may be targeted and threatened with confiscatory taxes .
Dear targeted bonus - receiving employees ,
If I were in your shoes , I would be furious at the congress critters who have no idea what merit pay means .
After all , they have the power to vote for their own pay raises even though their approval rating were in the single digits .
Right now you are simply a tool for some political smoke and mirrors to distract the citizens from the trillions of dollars the government is throwing around carelessly .
I think many of you know that already , and it sucks to be the scapegoat .
Many of you already promised to give your bonuses back , but why would you return the money to an institution that we all know is failing ?
If you do not need the money , I think it would be much better to give the money to a local food bank , homeless shelter , or whatever charity you support .
Many of these private nonprofit organizations are much more efficient than the government in helping those in need .
Right now many charities are in need because less people are donating , and the millions you have will definitely help .
If you do donate your bonus , the government cannot tax it 90 % because the money is gone .
I also highly doubt that they will go after a charity for the money because that would just be plain tacky .
You would actually get significant tax deductions for the money you donate and in a way say " screw you " to those who are trying to single you out for their own political gain .
If any of you do decide to donate your bonus and it is a significant amount , I suggest making a ruckus about it and tell the media .
This way you will get some good PR .
Seriously , why give the money back to a financial black hole when you could get your name on a building and help the homeless ?
Sincerely ,
Xin Lu
( CNN ) --
As President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon talk tough about cracking down on the deadly drug war , the United States is changing tactics in the battle against illegal narcotics at home .
Legalizing marijuana is off the table , the White House says .
The man Obama picked to be the new " drug czar , " Gil Kerlikowske , has made it clear that the United States is going to do a better job of treating addicts to try to reduce the demand for narcotics .
Kerlikowske , 59 , is a military veteran with 36 years of law enforcement experience .
The drug czar oversees an agency that sets the country 's drug - control strategy .
The White House and Congress want to see more drug courts , and increased funding for the program 250 percent in the spending bill signed in March .
It 's a campaign pledge that the Obama administration thinks will give nonviolent offenders " a chance to serve their sentence , where appropriate , in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior , " according to the White House Web site .
Judge Paul Gluchowski , who works with the Prince William County Juvenile Drug Court in Virginia , dismissed the notion that a drug treatment program is the easy way out .
Watch what it 's like inside the drug court »
If anyone thinks that , he said he'd tell them they should " come and talk to some of the participants .
A lot of them probably wish they never agreed to undergo drug court .
And a lot of them have given up because it 's too hard . "
Those who slip up in drug court can be forced to wear ankle - monitoring bracelets or put into juvenile detention .
" If they do n't give up , then when it comes time for graduation and you see the shine on their face , when you know that they have accomplished something , and they know that .
That 's what it 's all about , " Gluchowski said .
Vice President Joe Biden stressed the importance of drug courts and prisoner re-entry programs when he announced Kerlikowske 's position in March , saying they " can serve as the light at the end of the tunnel , of a very long , long dark tunnel , for those who are stuck in the cycle of drug addiction and incarceration . "
Kerlikowske said he was committed to tackling the nation 's drug problem , but noted that it would take a " coordinated and multifaceted effort . "
" The success of our efforts to reduce the flow of drugs is largely dependent on our ability to reduce demand for them , " Kerlikowske said , calling the nation 's drug problem one of " human suffering . "
" It requires prosecutors and law enforcement , courts , treatment providers and prevention programs to exchange information and to work together .
And our priority should be a seamless , comprehensive approach , " he said .
In meeting with Calderon on Thursday , Obama tried to show Mexico 's president that he is committed to ending a crisis that hits so close to home .
Obama vowed to beef up security along the border and to work to slow the flow of guns and drugs .
He said the United States shares responsibility for the drug problem , saying " a demand for these drugs in the United States is what is helping to keep these cartels in business . "
But he also tried to limit expectations that there could be any sort of quick fix .
" Now , are we going to eliminate all drug flows ?
Are we going to eliminate all guns coming over the border ?
That 's not a realistic objective , " he said .
" What is a realistic objective is to reduce it so significantly , so drastically that it becomes once again a localized criminal problem , as opposed to a major structural problem that threatens stability in communities along those borders . "
The White House has listened to those who say legalizing marijuana will pull the rug from under the violent cartels in Mexico and boost the U.S. economy , but that option is not on the table .
Asked Thursday if that is something realistic , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano quickly responded , " No , it is not . "
Sixty percent of drug criminals sent to prison re-offend , compared to 17 percent of graduates of drug court , according to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals .
Drug policy experts like those numbers , but say the nation needs more treatment options .
" For individuals who do n't have the resources , do n't have public health insurance , can't afford it themselves , the single best way that they can access treatment is to get arrested , " said Ryan King , a policy analyst with the Sentencing Project .
" And that 's wrong .
What we need to do is make sure for every American that is abusing drugs and wants to stop , that they have the resources made available to them , regardless of whether they can afford them . "
CNN 's Jim Acosta and Kristi Keck contributed to this report .

A Tax on Sugared Beverages ?
A tax on sugary soft drinks would result in health benefits no matter how the revenue from the tax would be used , according to a New England Journal of Medicine article written by New York City Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden and Kelly Brownell , a Yale University professor and director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity .
But the popularity of such a tax , they conclude , would increase if the proceeds were dedicated to childhood obesity prevention programs , including media campaigns , physical activity facilities and programs , and more - healthful food options in schools .
One poll showed that 52 percent of New York residents said they supported a " soda tax , " and that figure increased to 72 percent when they were told that the money raised from such a tax would be used to help prevent obesity .
A tax of one penny per ounce could decrease the intake of sugary beverages by more than 10 percent and generate revenue of $ 1.2 billion in New York State alone , Frieden and Brownell predict .
If you 're concerned about your family 's sugar intake , be wary of fruit drinks when grocery shopping for your household ; opt for real fruits and vegetables and drink water instead .
Why It 's Important to Shed Excess Belly Fat
If you 're like most women , you probably know whether you 're shaped like an apple ( big waist , small hips , thin legs ) or a pear ( small waist , big hips and thighs ) .
And you probably have heard that it 's better healthwise to be a pear .
Having too much fat on your belly increases your risk of age - related diseases like heart disease and diabetes , Deborah Kotz reports .
In fact , a study published this week in the journal Circulation : Heart Failure indicates that having a large waist size ups your risk of heart failure , a condition that 's often fatal .
A second study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that exercise does n't harm those with heart failure and could actually provide some benefits .
Learn why excess belly fat is so dangerous and how shrinking your waist size can reduce dangerous inflammation in your body .
Medicare Advantage Premiums May Rise $ 40 to $ 70 Monthly in 2010
Next year , seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans may have to pony up an extra $ 40 to $ 70 a month in premiums or see services reduced by a comparable amount , according to estimates by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association based on new plan payment rates that the government announced this week .
" The most likely thing that plans will be forced to do is to change their benefit packages , increase benefit premiums , or increase cost sharing , " says Kris Haltmeyer , the deputy executive director for legislative and regulatory policy for the association , which represents 39 independent Blues plans across the country .
Collectively , the plans cover 1.5 million Medicare Advantage members , Michelle Andrews reports .
Altogether , roughly 10 million seniors are in Medicare Advantage plans .
The Obama administration had signaled for months that it planned to trim the higher reimbursement rates that the government currently pays for beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans .
Some expect to see fewer zero - premium plans offered in the future and a reduction in benefits .

A hacker now claims he was behind the Amazon.com " glitch " that caused hundreds of gay - and lesbian - themed books to lose their sales ranks over the weekend .
The hacker , who identifies himself only as " Weev , " posted a confession of sorts within a LiveJournal discussion group Monday morning .
Amazon's ' Adult ' Title Issue
The Amazon incident resulted in books ranging from Annie Proulx 's Brokeback Mountain to James Baldwin 's Giovanni's Room being labeled as " adult " titles and thereby having their sales ranks removed .
Amazon 's sales ranks indicate how well a product is selling on the site .
A stronger score can lead to better placement within in - site searches and best - seller lists .
The issue was first observed by author Mark R. Probst , who discovered that his own work -- a gay romance novel called The Filly -- was among the items affected .
A Twitter campaign soon followed under the heading " #amazonfail , " and petitions and even calls for a boycott arrived shortly thereafter .
A Hacker 's Story
" Weev " says he was able to spark the sales rank strippings by exploiting an Amazon.com feature for reporting inappropriate content .
A small number of reports on any given title would cause it to lose its ranking , he says -- so he created a script to find all gay - and lesbian - themed books , then worked with owners of some ( unnamed ) popular Web sites to send in scores of complaints .
" They put ... invisible iFrame(s ) in their Web sites to refer people to the complaint URLs , which caused huge numbers of visitors to report gay and lesbian items as inappropriate without their knowledge , " he writes .
The inappropriate content reporting feature no longer appears to be present on Amazon.com book pages .
" Weev " claims the option was removed from the site on Sunday , following his attack .
" Weev , " incidentally , was profiled in a 2008 story about online " trolling " in The New York Times .
The story discusses his reported connections to various attacks on LiveJournal as well as on cell phones and credit ratings .
Amazon 's Stance
Amazon has yet to discuss exactly what led to the gay - and lesbian - themed book sales rank removals .
Spokespeople from the company have gone on the record calling the issue a " glitch " and promising it would be repaired .
The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) has also indicated that it " reached out " to Amazon and received the same message .
" They indicate this was an error , so we expect to start seeing evidence of its correction immediately , and any loss of visibility of gay - themed books as a result of this error will be made right , " GLAAD president Neil Giuliano told The Wall Street Journal .
An Amazon representative was not immediately available to comment or provide any further detail for this story .
Update : Amazon spokesperson Drew Herdener responded via e-mail shortly after this story 's publication .
He initially described the issue as " an embarrassing and ham - fisted cataloging error . "
When asked specifically whether Amazon had any stance on the hacker 's claims of involvement , he responded only by stating that it was " an embarrassing and ham - fisted cataloging error by * Amazon * " ( his emphasis ) .
Herdener did point out that the effects were not limited to gay - and lesbian - themed titles : Nearly 60,000 products were impacted , he says , including titles within the site 's health and mind & body sections .
The errors , Herdener indicates , are being corrected as quickly as possible .

Israel has built tens of thousands of homes for Jews in East Jerusalem Construction has begun on approximately 60 new homes in a Jewish settlement in Israeli - occupied East Jerusalem , the Israeli campaign group Peace Now says .
The work , in East Talpiot settlement , is aimed at creating a belt around East Jerusalem that would sever it from the rest of the West Bank , the group says .
Settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law .
Israel disputes this and also argues that East Jerusalem is not subject to its pledge to freeze settlement work .
Israel 's claim is based on its annexation of East Jerusalem , unrecognised by the international community , which it captured along with the West Bank and other Arab territory in the 1967 war .
Israelis view settlements such as East Talpiot as neighbourhoods of Jerusalem .
Such areas tend to be well integrated into the city 's infrastructure .
' Not one centimetre ' Peace Now 's Hagit Ofran said the work in East Talpiot in south - east Jerusalem aims to build " housing units for Orthodox religious Jewish families right next to the Palestinian neighbourhood of Arab al - Sawahra " .
The housing complex is made up of three blocks of flats containing about 60 homes , Peace Now says .
" We are against this project , which is harming the hopes for peace , " Ms Ofran said in remarks to AFP news agency .
Jerusalem municipal officials declined to comment about the building work , which Peace Now said began two months ago .
Successive Israeli governments have asserted that East Jerusalem is an " eternal , indivisible " part of Israel .
In a speech in Ramallah , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not give in to Israeli or international pressure to resume negotiations if settlement construction continues .
" All I know is that there is the state of Israel , in the borders of 1967 , not one centimetre more , not one centimetre less .
Anything else , I do n't accept , " Mr Abbas said .
About 200,000 Israeli Jews live in homes in East Jerusalem , with a further 250,000 settlers living in other parts of the West Bank , on land Palestinian negotiators have sought as part of a future Palestinian state .

" Hi , handsome .
Are you free for lunch ? "
" Are you selling something , or do you have a horrible defect that is n't apparent ? "
" Is it so hard to believe that a hot , intelligent , sane woman would be attracted to a man like you ? "
" Gaaa !!!
It 's worse than I thought ! "
" Maybe we could just drink coffee and talk about the last episode of Battlestar Galactica . "
" GAAA !!! "

Aston Martin 's range - capping exotic sportscar , the new One - 77 , has been revealed in final form .
What Aston calls its " definitive sports car " takes the general silhouette of the latest Aston sportscars , from the DB9 to the Vantage .
Only this time , the core of the car is constructed not from aluminum , but from carbon fiber .
The monocoque does have aluminum body panels fastened to it , for a lightweight body that 's designed to catapult Aston back into new racing realms .
The handbuilt car , according to Aston Martin Chief Executive , Dr. Ulrich Bez , fulfills a vision inside Aston , now on its own after being spun off by Ford .
Alongside the newly revealed 2010 Aston Martin Rapide four - door , the One - 77 will " demonstrate the unique capabilities and passion of our designers , engineers and technical partners , " Bez said in a release .
The essentials beneath the svelte aluminum skin include a 7.3 - liter , normally aspirated V - 12 engine , mounted low in the chassis for exceptionally low center of gravity .
The engine shares its roots with the 6.0 - liter V - 12 found in the Aston DBS , Aston DB9 and the new V - 12 Vantage - - only here , it 's completely reworked by engine specialists Cosworth to churn out more than 700 bhp and weigh 25 percent less than the smaller - displacement version .
A paddle - shifted six - speed sequential manual transmission is fitted .
A double - wishbone pushrod suspension arrives from the factory with each owner 's specified settings , though 20 - series tires are shod on all One - 77 coupes .
The settings can be changed without removing the shocks from the car , as is usual in racing , Aston says .
Carbon - ceramic brakes haul the estimated 3,300 - pound coupe down from extreme racing speeds .
Those speeds , Aston Martin estimates , include a 0 - 60 mph time of 3.5 seconds .
Top speed should pass 200 mph , too .
Aston says these figures and exceptional engineering and construction will make the One - 77 " a driving experience of unrivalled intensity and excitement while representing the world ’s most desirable automotive art form . "

Not all federal politicians believe that marijuana law reform is a laughing matter .
Senators Jim Webb ( D - VA ) and Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , along with fifteen co-sponsors , have introduced legislation in Congress to critically evaluate America ’s drugs and prisons policies .
Senate Bill 714 , the National Criminal Justice Commission
Act of 2009 seeks to establish a blue - ribbon commission to “ undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system ; make findings related to current Federal and State criminal justice policies and practices ; and make reform recommendations for the President , Congress , and State governments to improve public safety , cost - effectiveness , overall prison administration , and fairness in the implementation of the Nation ’s criminal justice system . ”
Specifically , the Commission will examine “ current drug policy and its impact on incarceration , crime and violence , sentencing , and reentry programs , [ including ] an analysis of the general availability of drugs in our society , the impact and effectiveness of current policies on reducing that availability and on the incidence of crime , and in the case of criminal offenders , the availability of drug treatment programs before , during , and after incarceration . ”
Writing this past weekend in Parade Magazine , Sen .
Webb stated :
America ’s criminal justice system has deteriorated to the point that it is a national disgrace .
…
The United States has by far the world ’s highest incarceration rate .
With 5 % of the world ’s population , our country now houses nearly 25 % of the world ’s reported prisoners .
… Drug offenders , most of them passive users or minor dealers , are swamping our prisons .
…
Justice statistics also show that 47.5 % of all the drug arrests in our country in 2007 were for marijuana offenses .
Additionally , nearly 60 % of the people in state prisons serving time for a drug offense had no history of violence or of any significant selling activity .
… African - Americans — who make up about 12 % of the total U.S. population population — accounted for 37 % of those arrested on drug charges , 59 % of those convicted , and 74 % of all drug offenders sentenced to prison .
… It is incumbent on our national leadership to find a way to fix our prison system .
I believe that American ingenuity can discover better ways to deal with the problems of drugs and nonviolent criminal behavior while still minimizing violent crime and large - scale gang activity .
And we all deserve to live in a country made better by such changes . ”
Senator Webb ’s analysis is accurate and his advocacy is politically courageous .
It ’s been many years since any federally appointed commission has taken an objective look at American criminal justice policies , and it ’s been nearly 40 years since federal lawmakers have undertaken a critical examination of US marijuana policy .
Webb ’s stance is all the more admirable as it comes just days after President Barack Obama and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs found themselves unable to even utter the word ‘ marijuana ’ without laughing , no less engage in a critical assessment of America ’s failed pot policies .
Writing in Salon.com , best - selling author and commentator Glen Greenwald assesses the situation and nails it :
For a Senator like Webb to spend his time trumpeting the evils of excessive prison rates , racial disparities in sentencing , the unjust effects of the Drug War , and disgustingly harsh conditions inside prisons is precisely the opposite of what every single political consultant would recommend that he do .
There ’s just no plausible explanation for Webb ’s actions other than the fact that he ’s engaged in the noblest and rarest of conduct : advocating a position and pursuing an outcome because he actually believes in it and believes that , with reasoned argument , he can convince his fellow citizens to see the validity of his cause .
And he is doing this despite the fact that it potentially poses substantial risks to his political self - interest and offers almost no prospect for political reward .
Webb is far from perfect … but , in this instance , not only his conduct but also his motives are highly commendable .
At long last , some ‘ change ’ in Washington , DC that we can believe in !

Facebook is blocking Pirate Bay torrents from being shared on the popular social - networking site , a week after Pirate Bay unveiled a feature to allow Facebook users the ability to link torrents on their profiles .
Beginning Wednesday , the " Share on Facebook " bookmarklet does not function .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told TorrentFreak on Wednesday that the social - networking site " respects copyrights and our Terms of Service prohibits placement of ' Share on Facebook ' links on sites that contain any content that is infringing .
Given the controversy surrounding
The Pirate Bay and the pending lawsuit against them , we ’ve reached out to The Pirate Bay and asked them to remove the ' Share on Facebook ' links from their site .
The Pirate Bay has not responded and so we have blocked their torrents from being shared on Facebook . "
The development came the same day that The Pirate Bay announced more than 100,000 users of the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker have signed up for its new $ 6 - monthly anonymity service designed to hide IP addresses from the authorities .
In case you forgot .
the four co-founders of the Pirate Bay are awaiting an April 17 verdict to criminal copyright infringement charges from their home country of Sweden .

Lord Browne , the former chief executive of BP and one of the earliest proponents of carbon trading to tackle climate change , has conceded his enthusiasm was misplaced .
Speaking to the Observer at the government 's low carbon industrial strategy summit last week , he said : " My view has shifted over time .
Pinning all your hopes on the European Union ETS [ emissions trading scheme ] and carbon trading is wrong . "
Until recently , energy companies and governments all around the world - particularly Britain's - argued that carbon trading was the best way of reducing global emissions .
Under the EU scheme - the first of its kind in the world - companies are awarded carbon credits .
If they pollute more than their allocation allows , they have to buy extra credits on the market .
But the scheme has been dogged by controversy .
In the first phase , starting in 2005 , companies were given too many credits , allowing them to bank billions of pounds of credits without having to clean up their act .
Now , the price of carbon is so low that it provides little incentive for companies to cut their emissions .
In the next phase , companies will have to buy more of their credits , rather than receive them all for free .
In the late 1990s , Browne started BP 's internal carbon trading scheme and executives helped the British government design its own experimental scheme , which predated that of the EU .
Browne said last week that carbon trading could play a part , but only alongside legislation and government targets .
" It requires consensus , not least selling permits to everyone , " he added .
" But this is politically impossible ; when you issue free permits , it undermines the system .
You also have to persuade people that it wo n't destroy competitiveness . "
The reaction to the government 's low - carbon strategy was mixed .
Jeremy Leggett , chief executive of Solarcentury , said : " It 's thrilling to hear the government speak of a green new deal so comprehensive it will transform our economy .
Ed Miliband [ secretary of state for energy and climate change ] says we are in a race , and he is right .
But we need more running , less conferring . "
It comes as wind developers warn that the plummeting pound and the drying up of project finance is threatening the viability of the major schemes needed to meet government renewable energy targets .
The British Wind Energy Association is working on a detailed package of demands , to be submitted ahead of next month 's budget , calling for government loan guarantees and other measures .
The industry has already won a deeper level of subsidies to make the recently launched third round of offshore wind licensing more attractive but its representatives argue that wider action is still required to save existing round - two schemes .
One dictionary defines treason as " disloyalty or treachery to one ’s country or its government , " but Article III of the U.S. Constitution takes a narrower view , specifically limiting charges of treason to time of war " in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . "
The Federalist Papers reveal that this definition of treason was crafted deliberately to avoid politically motivated ex post facto exploitation of the only crime named as a capital offense in the Constitution .
The Founding Fathers knew full well from their own personal experience that English kings had played fast and loose with the concept of treason , frequently trying and executing opponents without any actual evidence that a crime had been committed .
Charges of treason intended to destroy political rivals would not be permitted in the new republic .
Treason trials have been rare in the United States .
Elected officials and government employees with access to classified information are bound by statutes authorizing severe penalties lest they betray that confidence .
Congressmen are elected to represent the best interests of the voters in their districts and , in a broader sense , the citizens of the United States , a trust that they frequently betray when they give in to the importunities of lobbyists and vote for pork or laws that help only special interest groups .
That is generally referred to as corruption .
But what does one call it when a senior elected official tells a citizen of a foreign country that he or she is willing to interfere in a judicial process in exchange for that country ’s support to obtain a more senior position in the government ?
A single word appears to be lacking , though " betrayal " and " treachery " seem to come close .
Some have resorted to " obstruction of justice " or " influence peddling , " both of which are actually crimes when committed by a government official .
If the U.S. Constitution had not limited treasonous activity to wartime , the word " treason " might well be considered .
Until the transcripts of Rep. Jane Harman ’s telephone conversations are made public , if they ever are , her transgression can only be assessed secondhand .
It appears to have consisted of talking with someone who may be an Israeli citizen regarding influencing the outcome of the ongoing trial of ex-American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman .
The conversation took place in late 2005 , when it appeared that the two men might well be convicted .
The Israeli citizen appears to have been on the receiving end of an FBI wiretap because he was an associate of a known Israeli intelligence officer based in Israel ’s Washington embassy , possibly station chief Naor Gilon , who was responsible for running influence operations in the United States , or Uzi Arad .
Both Gilon and Arad were involved in the FBI investigation of AIPAC that led to the imprisonment of Larry Franklin and the indictment of Weissman and Rosen .
Both now hold senior positions in the Israeli government .
Intelligence officers refer to influence operations as covert actions because they are designed to manipulate the activity of a foreign government without that manipulation being attributable to any outside source .
In this case , Israel wanted the men to go free to minimize any public perception that it was engaged in spying on the United States , which is what the AIPAC trial was all about , but it did not wish to be seen as directly interfering .
Harman reportedly was receptive .
She agreed to do what she could on the AIPAC trial in exchange for the powerful Israel Lobby ’s support for her bid to become chairman of the House Permanent Committee on Intelligence .
Harman ’s contact suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be informed that contributions from Israeli billionaire Haim Saban and others of a like mind to the Democratic Party war chest might diminish if Harman were not given the chairmanship .
The conversation might well be dismissed as a congressional version of phone sex but for the fact that Israel and its lobby were well positioned to deliver what they had promised .
Their influence over key congressmen and , most particularly , the Democratic Party leadership meant that Harman could act with confidence that she would be rewarded .
Did Harman know what she was getting into ?
She reportedly concluded the phone call by saying " this conversation does n’t exist . "
Harman has called for the transcripts of her conversations to be released , a demand that she knows will not be acceded to because it would blow an entire FBI operation .
She has decried the " abuse of power " involved in tapping her phone , even though she is on record supporting the tapping of the phones of millions of American citizens .
She has appeared on National Public Radio and CNN in interviews that have been described as " train wrecks " in which she rambled and alternatively admitted and denied the charges against her .
Her salvage operation continues .
Even friends of Harman describe her as intensely ambitious .
She has long been an outspoken friend of Israel and has benefited from pro-Israeli PACs to the tune of $ 104,000 , the most given to any California congressman .
She is also a strong supporter of AIPAC and is scheduled be a keynote speaker at its annual conference in Washington next month .
Less well known is her enthusiasm for the more questionable practices of the Bush administration , positions that many of her constituents in liberal Los Angeles would most likely find troublesome if they had bothered to look at her record before pulling the ballot - box lever .
Harman was a proponent of various infringements on civil liberties , including the warrantless NSA wiretap program , the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 , the PATRIOT Acts , and the Military Commissions Act .
She actively supported congressional motions to effectively declare war on Iran , and she sponsored the truly horrific Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2007 , which fortunately never passed into law .
Her bill , described by one critic as an " unconstitutional , Orwellian throwback , " mandated the creation of a congressional commission empowered to hold hearings , conduct investigations , and propose new legislation to deal with the threat posed by the various groups designated as " homegrown terrorists . "
Like the House Un- American Activities Committee in the past , the Violent Radicalization bill would have empowered congressmen to travel around the United States to hold hearings and identify " homegrown terrorists . "
Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales reportedly intervened to stop the ongoing FBI investigation of Harman because the administration needed her to intercede with the New York Times to suspend its story on the illegal NSA wiretaps .
She did so , twice , though the Times denies that she was a decisive factor in delaying the story .
If the report had come out on time , it might have influenced the outcome of the 2004 presidential elections , and John Kerry , a member of Harman ’s own party , might have become president .
Harman may or may not have attempted to intervene in the AIPAC case , which apparently is about to be dismissed for reasons unrelated to her , but the FBI investigation did not slow her down a bit .
She made an aggressive bid to obtain the position of chairman of the Intelligence Committee , obtaining the promised support from pro-Israeli donors , though she was eventually turned down because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been secretly briefed on the FBI investigation and had become nervous about endorsing her .
Harman then made a run at the position of President Barack Obama ’s intelligence director and was even reported to be on the short list for the job when similar concerns derailed her bid .
The two aborted promotions might have been the only times the Democratic Party has ever hesitated to appoint anyone to a senior position because they were too close to Israel .
The real Harman story is about Israel intelligence operations directed against the United States which have brought about the systematic corruption of the America ’s political system by a foreign power aided and abetted by friends strategically placed throughout the government and the media .
Just imagine if Harman had obtained either senior intelligence position that she sought .
She would have had access to every sort of top secret intelligence possessed by the US government and would have been in a good position to influence policy .
From the Israeli perspective , she would have been their spy , a highly placed agent of influence who could also provide every bit of sensitive intelligence in the CIA cupboard .
The apparent fact that she agreed to help an agent of a foreign government and was to be rewarded with advancement makes her something like Kim Philby , the British spy of the 1960s who progressed through his own system while secretly working for another country , Russia .
Philby was a whole lot smarter , but the essential betrayal was the same .
Those who argue that Israel is no Cold War Russia miss the point , as the national interests of the U.S. and Israel are far from identical , particularly after a series of right - wing governments in Tel Aviv has culminated in the current monstrosity of Netanyahu - Lieberman .
Once you are on the hook in an intelligence relationship , there is no getting off it .
Had Harman done a favor for the Israelis and been rewarded in return , it would have been a skeleton in her closet forever .
The Israelis might also have taped the incriminating conversations , presumably unaware that the FBI was also on the line .
The Israelis would surely remind her of her crime whenever they need a favor , and she would be forced to pay the piper whenever called upon .
What could have been better for Israel than owning the director of central intelligence or the head of the House Intelligence Committee ?
What could have been worse for the United States ?
To describe Harman ’s actions as unacceptable would be an understatement .
Unless the contents of her telephone conversation have been totally misconstrued , she should salvage what self - respect she has left and resign her office .
But one suspects that she is yet another politician on the make with no sense of country or dignity .
Do n’t expect her to do the right thing .
Jet lag is the bane of many travelers , and similar fatigue can plague people who work in rotating shifts .
Scientists know the problem results from disruption to the body 's normal rhythms and are getting closer to a better understanding that might lead to more effective treatment .
New University of Washington research shows the disruption occurs in two separate but linked groups of neurons in a structure called the suprachiasmatic nucleus , below the hypothalamus at the base of the brain .
One group is synchronized with deep sleep that results from physical fatigue and the other controls the dream state of rapid eye movement , or REM , sleep .
The ventral , or bottom , neurons receive light information directly from the eyes and govern rhythms in tune with periods of light and dark .
The dorsal , or top , neurons do not receive direct light information and so govern rhythms as a more independent internal , or circadian , biological clock .
It turns out that some of the body 's rhythms are " more loyal " to the ventral neurons and others are much more in tune with the dorsal neurons , said Horacio de la Iglesia , a UW associate professor of biology .
Normally the two neuron groups are synchronized with each other , but disruptions such as jet travel across time zones or shift work can throw the cycles out of kilter .
Deep sleep is most closely tied to light - dark cycles and typically adjusts to a new schedule in a couple of days , but REM sleep is more tied to the light - insensitive dorsal neurons and can be out of sync for a week or more .
" When we impose a 22 - hour light - dark cycle on animals , the ventral center can catch up but the dorsal does n't adapt and defaults to its own inner cycle , " de la Iglesia said .
In the laboratory rats he uses for his research , that normal cycle is 25 hours .
When the artificial 22 - hour light - dark schedule was imposed , he found that the rats ' deep sleep , largely governed by light but also a response to fatigue , quickly adapted to the 22 - hour cycle , while their REM sleep continued to follow a 25 - hour cycle .
As a result , REM sleep did not occur in a normal progression following deep sleep .
" We found that after exposing rats to a shift of the light - dark timing that simulates a trip from Paris to New York , REM sleep needed 6 to 8 days to catch up with non-REM , or deep , sleep , the sleep you usually experience in the first part of the night , " de la Iglesia said .
The two types of sleep overlap immediately after the simulated jet lag occurs , he noted , and there is a greater likelihood of the animals entering REM sleep earlier than they should .
That likely explains why it can take several days for travelers and shift workers to adapt to their new schedules , he said .
" It also could explain why jet lag is associated with lower learning performance .
We think the disruption of the normal circadian sequence of sleep states is very detrimental to learning , " he said .
" One of the problems is that you are doing things at times that your body is n't prepared to do them .
One group of neurons tells your body it is Paris time and another says that it is New York time .
You are internally desynchronized , " said de la Iglesia .
He is lead author of a paper describing the work published online April 16 by Current Biology .
Co-authors are Michael Lee and Beryl Swanson of the UW .
The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Mary Gates Endowment for Students at the UW .
Previous research has indicated that treatments such as physical activity can help the body resynchronize its rhythms following jet lag .
The new work , de la Iglesia believes , could be useful in fine - tuning pharmaceutical and other therapies .

While 15 years is a long time to go without a visit from the greatest living songwriter this side of Bob Dylan , the sold - out crowd that packed into the Beacon Theatre for a visitation from songwriter / saint Leonard Cohen Thursday night could be forgiven for feeling just the tiniest twinge of trepidation .
After all , Cohen is 74 years old now ( for those doing the math , that ’s eight years older than Paul McCartney ) , and had n’t been seen in these parts since the Clinton Administration .
Any such reservations were completely washed away almost instantly , from the moment Cohen opened the evening with “ Dance Me to the End of Love , ” bent down on one knee like the romantic poet king he was born to be , finessing the tune with a voice as deep as ever but perhaps twice as flexible as the last time he hit a Big Apple stage .
Fronting a six - man band plus three female backing singers , Cohen shuffled around the Beacon with elan , spiffily attired in a dark suit and hat that made him look like a film noir detective .
He threw himself into the music with a measured pace but unfettered emotional depth , as he offered up the old favorites like “ Bird on a Wire ” and “ Hey , Thats No Way to Say Goodbye ” alongside more recent compositions like “ A Thousand Kisses Deep ” ( delivered as a recitative ) and “ Democracy ” ( whose sociopolitical landscape seemed more timely than ever now , especially with its reference to “ the battered heart of Chevrolet ” ) .
As deep and dark as Cohen is capable of going , he never fails to throw in a graveyard grin , both in his writing and on stage .
In the midst of wryly claiming that he ’d been undertaking intense religious studies , for example , he observed that he ’d been foiled because “ cheerfulness kept breaking through . ”
And as heavy as the messages and imagery of the evening ’s fare were , that ’s the very phenomenon the audience seemed to experience too when all was said and done .
Or we would if we could afford them .
To fully understand our collective shock over our pulse - less economy , take a good look at the upgrade cycle that we ’ve been gleefully riding for at least three decades .
Until last year , if you were living the 2.3 version of Life , you had your eyes on version 2.4 and odds were pretty good that you ’d get it .
Maybe on an overextended credit card , or from a loan that you really could n’t afford .
But you ’d get it .
Now , if you ’re living Life 2.3 , your ambition is to avoid Life 2.2 .
Forget the upgrade .
The game now is avoiding the downgrade .
This is grim and troubling , in part , because so much of our consumer culture is built around the enticements of the Better .
Entire corporate strategies target the bottomless American appetite for the upgrade .
Holders of American Express ’s regular old green card might eventually get an invitation to upgrade to a gold card .
( More privileges , more perks !
For a fee , of course . )
And once you ’ve swiped that baby for a while , you might get an invitation to upgrade to platinum .
( Yet more privileges , yet more perks !
And higher fees . )
If you behave yourself with the platinum card , you could join the purportedly exclusive ranks of black card holders , who pay a one - time initiation fee of $ 5,000 and then $ 2,500 annually .
All of these slabs of plastic do basically the same thing  help you acquire stuff  but they also confer ever larger increments of cachet on the holder .
This allows you to upgrade your material life while signaling , to anyone who can see you in midpurchase , just how upgraded your material life already is .
No company has exploited America ’s upgrade fever quite as deftly as Apple .
The company is one of the very few that has kept most prices at prerecession levels while managing to report profits , as it did last week .
Of course , Apple makes wonderful computers , software and gadgets , but is also brilliant at making everything you bought from it nine months ago seem slow , fusty and passé .

want to try something hard ?
voice drawing ....
here is an early test of a voice - based drawing toy I made today ( you need an active or built - in mic ) :: low volume curves counterclockwise , medium volume is straight , high volume curves clockwise :: pretty tough to control :: below are some screen grabs of faces i tried to draw - hum ( click to enlarge ) .
Send me what you come up with , or better yet send me a video of you " drawing " and the final result !...( PS - the file is 1000x1000 pixels , and blank when you start - drawing begins from the center - so you may have to scroll if you have a tiny screen - also , click to reset )
NOTE : although it is perhaps the most accessible to the public , this is by no means the first toy to play with the relationship between sound and drawing .
Messa di Voce ( below ) , by Golan Levin , Zachary Lieberman , remains the gold standard for this type of work , and i was reminded that my voice drawing app resembles a portion of their application .
They have a line guided by pitch ( 360 degree mapping ) and are more focused on expressive drawings ( i spoke with Golan about this ) , while I am still in search of a tool that can be used to draw representational forms ... although I 'm sure with a bit of tweaking Golan and Zach could produce something that did just that .
The Drug War : A Bonanza for the Enemies of Freedom
If it had been dreamed up by Satan himself in the bowels of Hell , the War on Drugs could n’t be more diabolically calculated to destroy our liberties and promote the cause of evil in the world .
In the Netherlands , where marijuana is ( de facto ) legal , and most hard drugs are virtually decriminalized and available to addicts by prescription , the rates of drug use are actually lower than in the United States .
That means we ’ve militarized and corrupted our police forces , turned the Bill of Rights into toilet paper , and handed the country over to gangs ( including gangs in police uniforms ) — all for absolutely nothing .
Radley Balko regularly reports on the gross abuses — or standard practices , rather — of SWAT teams .
Urban police forces , using military surplus equipment and given military training , increasingly see the local population as an occupied enemy to be terrified into docility .
The Fourth , Fifth and Sixth Amendments are so riddled with loopholes , after thirty - odd years of helpful “ interpretation ” by a compliant judiciary , as to be absolutely meaningless .
Your “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” does n’t extend to uniformed trespassers snooping in a woodlot or pasture , or any other acreage beyond your actual home and the yard immediately surrounding — even if you have “ No Trespassing ” signs posted .
It does n’t extend to helicopters over your home , or snooping your home itself with infrared heat sensors .
It does n’t extend to your car on the road — no need for a warrant or probable cause at a “ random checkpoint . ”
The prohibition against depriving you of your property without “ due process of law ” does n’t count against “ civil forfeiture . ”
The government can steal everything you own without ever formally pressing charges or convincing a jury , all on the bare allegation that you were engaged in drug crime .
See , the Fifth Amendment does n’t apply because the government ’s not acting against you — in lawyerese , it ’s an action “ in rem ” against the property itself , so there ’s no need to give you any due process protections .
Criminalizing consensual behavior necessarily leads to a police state .
In a non-consensual crime , involving aggression against person or property , there ’s no need for the surveillance state because the injured party will complain to “ the authorities . ”
But when a “ crime ” consists entirely of voluntary trade between two non-violent parties , there ’s no injured party to complain .
The only way to stop such “ crime , ” therefore , is for the state to keep the citizenry under total surveillance .
As for gangs , when you prohibit the sale of any commodity people want to buy , a lucrative black market in that commodity will inevitably spring up — followed by organized crime fighting to control the black market .
That ’s how Al Capone made his living back during Prohibition , and how organized crime got its start in this country .
Organized crime lords are by far the leading supporters of drug criminalization .
It ’s quite likely that the campaigns of the most hardcore drug warrior politicians are financed , to a large extent , by laundered drug cartel money .
In the American Bible Belt , it ’s known as the “ Baptists and Bootleggers ” phenomenon .
In Mississippi , when a county ’s “ dry ” status periodically came up for a vote , according to Willie Morris , the most prominent displayers of “ Vote Dry ” bumper stickers were bootleggers .
“ A handful of people would come right out and say that liquor should be made legal , so that the bootleggers and the sheriffs would not be able to make all the money … . ”
And as that last quote suggests , police forces are the biggest gangs of all .
Paying protection money to local police for the right to operate on their turf is just another cost of doing business in the drug trade .
But the police gang activity does n’t stop with protection money and collusion .
Even when drug traders are prosecuted , police motivation is frequently identical to that of their non-uniformed gangster cousins .
Never mind outright , unambiguous illegality like planting evidence ( even though it ’s hardly uncommon ) .
Just consider the legal gray areas , like coerced testimony from jailhouse snitches , the use of plea bargain blackmail , entrapment , etc. , all of them frequently used in conjunction with civil forfeiture when the cops covet some particularly valuable item of yours for funding the civil forfeiture gravy train and buying themselves a new helicopter or other expensive cop toys .
But so far , we ’ve only seen one side of the problem — the domestic side .
Outside the United States , the black market price of drugs is an enormously valuable tool for the organized criminals in the CIA and the rest of the “ national security ” community , for whom drug running is a primary source of funds for illegally funding death squads and other “ black operations ” around the world , independently of Congressional oversight or appropriations .
The main beneficiaries of drug prohibition are the criminal gangs that control the drug trade .
And of the criminal gangs that benefit from drug prohibition , the criminal gangs in uniform are the biggest beneficiaries of all .
( CNN ) -- A Saudi judge has refused for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8 - year - old girl and a 47 - year - old man , a relative of the girl told CNN .
The most recent ruling , in which the judge upheld his original verdict , was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza , where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl 's mother , who was seeking a divorce for her daughter .
The relative said the judge , Sheikh Habib Al - Habib , " stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty . "
The family member , who requested anonymity , added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter .
The case , which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups , came to light in December when al - Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality .
The judge ruled the girl 's mother -- who is separated from the girl 's father -- was not the girl 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , according to Abdullah al - Jutaili , the mother 's lawyer .
The girl 's father , according to the attorney , arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man , who is " a close friend " of his .
At the time of the initial verdict , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , al - Jutaili told CNN .
The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty , she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court , the lawyer said .
Last month , an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting al - Habib 's verdict , and sent the case back to al - Habib for reconsideration .
Under the complicated Saudi legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect , but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing .
The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month , according to the relative .
The issue of child marriage has been a hot - button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently .
While rights groups have been petitioning the government to enact laws that would protect children from this type of marriage , the kingdom's top cleric has said that it 's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed .
" It is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , " Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al - Sheikh , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in remarks last January quoted in the regional Al - Hayat newspaper .
" A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married .
Those who think she 's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her . "
Al - Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry .
" We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , " he said , according to the newspaper .
" We should know that Sharia law has not brought injustice to women . "
Sharia law is Islamic law .
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism .
CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment .
Christoph Wilcke , a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch , told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages .
" We 've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men , " Wilcke said .
Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to protect children , " It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts , and in many realms beyond the court . "
Last December , Zuhair al - Harithi , a spokesman for the Saudi government - run Human Rights Commission , said his organization is fighting against child marriages .
" The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia , " al - Harithi said .
" Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed . "
He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place .
Wajeha al - Huwaider , co-founder of the Society of Defending Women 's Rights in Saudi Arabia , told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to " keep us backward and in the dark ages . "
She said the marriages cause girls to " lose their sense of security and safety .
Also , it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured .
It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression . "

1 Arthur Mole ’s Living Formations
Almost a century ago and without the aid of any pixel - generating computer software , the itinerant photographer Arthur Mole ( 1889 - 1983 ) used his 11 x 14 - inch view camera to stage a series of extraordinary mass human photographic spectacles that choreographed living bodies into symbolic formations of religious and national community .
In these mass ornaments , thousands of military troops and other groups were arranged artfully to form American patriotic symbols , emblems , and military insignia visible from a bird ’s eye perspective .
During World War I , these military formations came to serve as rallying points to support American involvement in the war and to ward off isolationist tendencies .
2 Eugene Goldbeck ’s Photographs
Another of the most notable photographers of living people groups was Eugene Omar Goldbeck .
Along with the large scale work , he also took photographic portraits of important personalities , such as Albert Einstein .

A Human MIG
In 1962 , Arthur C. Clarke was touring Bell Labs when he heard a demonstration of a song sung by an IBM 704 computer programmed by physicist John L. Kelly .
The song , the first ever performed by a computer , was called “ Daisy Bell ” , more commonly known as “ Bicycle Built for Two ” or “ Daisy , Daisy ” .
When Clarke collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on 2001 : A Space Odyssey , they had HAL sing it while Dave powered him down .
A clip of a 1963 synthesized computer speech demonstration by Bell Labs featuring “ Daisy Bell ” was included on an album for the First Philadelphia Computer Music Festival .
You can listen to it ( it ’s the last track ) and the rest of the album at vintagecomputermusic.com .

Update : A reader just reminded me that HAL may have been so named because each letter is off by one from IBM , although Arthur C. Clarke denies this .
