Toxic nuclear waste is stored at sites around the U.S. and debate surrounds the construction of a large - scale geological storage site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada , which critics maintain is costly and dangerous .
The storage capacity of Yucca Mountain , which is would open by 2020 , is set at 77,000 tons .
The amount of nuclear waste generated by the U.S. is expected to exceed this amount by 2010 .
A new invention could drastically decrease the need for any additional or expanded geological repositories , say physicists at The University of Texas at Austin who have designed a new system that , when fully developed , would use fusion to eliminate most of the transuranic waste produced by nuclear power plants .
The invention could help combat global warming by making nuclear power cleaner and thus a replacement for carbon - heavy energy sources , such as coal , without the drama that the American environmental activists have brought to nuclear energy in the past .
"
We have created a way to use fusion to relatively inexpensively destroy the waste from nuclear fission , " says Mike Kotschenreuther , senior research scientist with the Institute for Fusion Studies ( IFS ) and Department of Physics .
" Our waste destruction system , we believe , will allow nuclear power - a low carbon source of energy - to take its place in helping us combat global warming .
" This illustration shows how a compact fusion - fission hybrid would fit into a nuclear fuel cycle .
The fusion - fission hybrid can use fusion reactions to burn nuclear waste as fuel ( people are shown for scale ) .
It would produce energy and could be used to help destroy the most toxic , long - lived waste from nuclear power .
The hybrid would be made possible by a crucial invention from physicists at the University of Texas at Austin called the Super X Divertor .

" Most people cite nuclear waste as the main reason they oppose nuclear fission as a source of power , " says Swadesh Mahajan , senior research scientist .
The scientists propose destroying the waste using a fusion - fission hybrid reactor , the centerpiece of which is a high power Compact Fusion Neutron Source ( CFNS ) made possible by a crucial invention .
The CFNS would provide abundant neutrons through fusion to a surrounding fission blanket that uses transuranic waste as nuclear fuel .
The fusion - produced neutrons augment the fission reaction , imparting efficiency and stability to the waste incineration process .
Kotschenreuther , Mahajan and Prashant Valanju , of the IFS , and Erich Schneider of the Department of Mechanical Engineering report their new system for nuclear waste destruction in the journal Fusion Engineering and Design .
There are more than 100 fission reactors , called " light water reactors " ( LWRs ) , producing power in the United States .
The nuclear waste from these reactors is stored and not reprocessed .
( Some other countries , such as France and Japan , do reprocess the waste . )
The scientists ' waste destruction system would work in two major steps .
First , 75 percent of the original reactor waste is destroyed in standard , relatively inexpensive LWRs .
This step produces energy , but it does not destroy highly radiotoxic , transuranic , long - lived waste , what the scientists call " sludge .
"
In the second step , the sludge would be destroyed in a CFNS - based fusion - fission hybrid .
The hybrid 's potential lies in its ability to burn this hazardous sludge , which cannot be stably burnt in conventional systems .
" To burn this really hard to burn sludge , you really need to hit it with a sledgehammer , and that 's what we have invented here , " says Kotschenreuther .
One hybrid would be needed to destroy the waste produced by 10 to 15 LWRs .
The process would ultimately reduce the transuranic waste from the original fission reactors by up to 99 percent .
Burning that waste also produces energy .
The CFNS is designed to be no larger than a small room , and much fewer of the devices would be needed compared to other schemes that are being investigated for similar processes .
In combination with the substantial decrease in the need for geological storage , the CFNS - enabled waste - destruction system would be much cheaper and faster than other routes , say the scientists .
The CFNS is based on a tokamak , which is a machine with a " magnetic bottle " that is highly successful in confining high temperature ( more than 100 million degrees Celsius ) fusion plasmas for sufficiently long times .
The crucial invention that would pave the way for a CFNS is called the Super X Divertor .
The Super X Divertor is designed to handle the enormous heat and particle fluxes peculiar to compact devices ; it would enable the CFNS to safely produce large amounts of neutrons without destroying the system .
"
The intense heat generated in a nuclear fusion device can literally destroy the walls of the machine , " says research scientist Valanju , " and that is the thing that has been holding back a highly compact source of nuclear fusion .
" Valanju says a fusion - fission hybrid reactor has been an idea in the physics community for a long time .
" It 's always been known that fusion is good at producing neutrons and fission is good at making energy , " he says .
" Now , we have shown that we can get fusion to produce a lot of neutrons in a small space .
" Producing an abundant and clean source of " pure fusion energy " continues to be a goal for fusion researchers .
But the physicists say that harnessing the other product of fusion - neutrons - can be achieved in the near term .
In moving their hybrid from concept into production , the scientists hope to make nuclear energy a more viable alternative to coal and oil while waiting for renewables like solar and pure fusion to ramp up .
" The hybrid we designed should be viewed as a bridge technology , " says Mahajan .
" Through the hybrid , we can bring fusion via neutrons to the service of the energy sector today .
We can hopefully make a major contribution to the carbon - free mix dictated by the 2050 time scale set by global warming scientists .
" The scientists say their Super X Divertor invention has already gained acceptance in the fusion community .
Several groups are considering implemented the Super X Divertor on their machines , including the MAST tokamak in the United Kingdom , and the DIIID ( General Atomics ) and NSTX ( Princeton University ) in the U.S.
Next steps will include performing extended simulations , transforming the concept into an engineering project , and seeking funding for building a prototype .

Seven - year - old Wyatt Wilke wanted to be a Marine and a doctor .
( CNN ) --
On the morning of last year 's annual Sunflower Fair in La Porte , Indiana , a family , appearing a little lost , walked up and down a crowded street , looking in vain for the table to sign up their entry .
They carried a large sunflower with them .
If no one noticed the exhausted , grieving look in the family 's eyes , that was understandable .
The Sunflower Fair is a place of happy noise : rides and music and food booths .
It is La Porte 's fall festival , and people from across northwest Indiana come to spend a Saturday in the midst of the milling , chattering crowds .
The family silently bearing the large sunflower had never been to the fair before .
But this was important .
They finally located the entry table , and asked for a form .
They carefully filled it out .
Their flower was entered in the seed head category -- the one that judges the largest seed head , which is the circular area in the middle of a sunflower .
They wrote down the name of the person who had grown the sunflower :
Wyatt Wilke .
He was their 7 - year - old son .
He had died earlier that same day , at a few minutes after midnight .
Now , less than 10 hours later , here they were , with Wyatt 's flower .
" He loved growing his sunflowers , " said his mother , Cathleen Wilke .
" Every year we talked about coming into La Porte for the Sunflower Fair , but we never got around to it .
Wyatt really wanted to be part of the contest . "
That 's what they had planned -- a day at the fair , to enter his sunflower .
He was a healthy , constantly laughing boy -- he loved school , where he was in the second grade , he loved horses , he loved his big brother John , with whom he shared a bedroom .
The Wilkes lived in the tiny town of Hamlet , about 15 minutes from La Porte ; Wyatt would look out the back window , watching for blue jays and cardinals .
" He planted his sunflowers in our garden , " Cathleen Wilke said .
" He was so careful with them .
A few weeks before the fair , there was a heavy windstorm that knocked his biggest sunflower over .
He called to me : ' Mom , it 's on the ground -- my flower , it 's down . '
He was afraid it was ruined .
But he managed to save it . "
The week before the fair , Wyatt was n't feeling well in class -- he had a sore throat .
The school called on a Wednesday .
He came home .
" But the next morning , he was up , and he wanted to go to school , " his mother said .
" He was always so responsible -- he said , ' I did n't get my homework done last night . '
I told him that was all right , that the school would understand .
But as I made him his toast , he sat there on the couch , doing his homework . "
She told him he really should n't go to school .
He stayed home .
That day , he seemed to get sicker and sicker .
" We drove over to the hospital in South Bend that night , " his mother said .
" He was talking in the car .
As sick as he was , he said to us : ' Mom and Dad , when are we going to get to go camping ? '
There was this big , round , moon in the sky , and he looked out the window of the car and told us to look at it .
He said the moon was so beautiful . "
At the hospital , they knew he was in very bad shape .
Wyatt , it would turn out , had contracted an overwhelming bacterial infection that had entered his bloodstream and that was attacking his organs .
He was in the hospital that Thursday night and all day and all evening Friday .
His body went into septic shock ; it could n't fight off the infection .
Friday turned to Saturday .
His life ended just as the new day began .
" He had always told us he wanted to grow up to be a Marine , " his mother said .
" Then he said he wanted to be a doctor .
So we told him he could be a Marine doctor . "
And now they were at the hospital , and at age 7 , he was gone .
Someone remembered :
This was going to be the day of the Sunflower Fair .
How they found the strength to do it is hard to conceive .
But that morning , carrying Wyatt 's favorite sunflower -- the one he had saved when the wind had knocked it down -- they were at the fair in La Porte .
They waited together as all the categories were judged .
No one around them had any idea .
And then , through the loudspeaker system at the fair , the winner of his category was announced :
" First place . . . Wyatt Wilke . "
The judging committee looked around , waiting for the winner to come forward and accept his trophy .
His family .
. . .
Well , you can imagine .
" I do n't even remember which one of us went up to accept it for him , " his mother said .
" But Wyatt had won .
He had won . "
That was a year ago .
A few months later , the fair 's organizer , Phyllis Jones , approached Cathleen Wilke and asked her if she would like to serve on the committee .
She said yes .
And this year at the fair , the contest -- all the categories , the whole competition -- had a new name :
The Wyatt Wilke Sunflower Contest .
The seeds from Wyatt 's winning flower were given to his classmates at Kingsford Heights Elementary School .
The children planted them in the school 's new memorial garden , the one that is named for Wyatt .
The sunflowers are blooming now .
Soon enough winter will arrive , and the snow will cover Indiana .
But the seeds will be planted in the school 's garden every year , and forever the flowers will return , bright and vibrant and full of life 's very best promise , like the smile of a boy who believes he can do anything .

An insurance industry CEO explains why American health care costs so much
On Friday , I sat down with Kaiser Permanente CEO George Halvorson to talk about health - care reform .
The conversation was long and ranging and will take a while to transcribe .
But before we really got into the weeds , Halvorson handed me an astonishing packet of charts .
The material was put together by the International Federation of Health Plans , which is pretty much what it sounds like : an association of insurance plans in different countries .
But it showed something I 've never seen before , at least not at this level of detail : prices .
The packet 's 36 pages are mostly graphs showing the average prices paid in different countries for different procedures , diagnostics and drugs .
There is a thudding consistency to the pages : a series of crude bars , with the block representing the prices paid by American health - insurance plans looming over the others like a New York skyscraper that got lost in downtown Des Moines .
There is a simple explanation for why American health care costs so much more than health care in any other country : because we pay so much more for each unit of care .
As Halvorson explained , and academics and consultancies have repeatedly confirmed , if you leave everything else the same -- the volume of procedures , the days we spend in the hospital , the number of surgeries we need -- but plug in the prices Canadians pay , our health - care spending falls by about 50 percent .
In other countries , governments set the rates that will be paid for different treatments and drugs , even when private insurers are doing the actual purchasing .
In our country , the government does n't set those rates for private insurers , which is why the prices paid by Medicare , as you 'll see on some of these graphs , are much lower than those paid by private insurers .
You 'll also notice that the bit showing American prices is separated into blue and yellow :
That shows the spread between the average price ( the top of the blue ) and the 90th percentile ( the top of the yellow ) .
Other countries do n't have nearly that much variation , again because their pricing is standard .
The health - care reform debate has done a good job avoiding the subject of prices .
The argument over the Medicare - attached public plan was , in a way that most people did n't understand , an argument about prices , but it quickly became an argument about a public option without a pricing dimension , and never really looked back .
The administration has been very interested in the finding that some states are better at providing cost - effective care than other states , but not in the finding that some countries are better at purchasing care than other countries .
" A health - care debate in this country that is n't aware of the price differential is not an informed debate , " says Halvorson .
By that measure , we have not had a very informed debate .
But download this pack of charts ( pdf ) , and you 'll be a bit more informed .

Over the course of a lifetime , humans take in more information and memories than their brains can handle .
Microsoft researcher Gordon
Bell believes this to be a bug , not a feature .
And as he chronicles in his new book , Total Recall , he 's working on an upgrade .
Since 2001 , Bell has been compulsively scanning , capturing , and logging each and every bit of personal data he generates in his daily life .
This trove includes Web sites he 's visited ( 221,173 ) , photos taken ( 56,282 ) , emails sent and received ( 156,041 ) , docs written and read ( 18,883 ) , phone conversations had ( 2,000 ) , photos snapped by the SenseCam hanging around his neck ( 66,000 ) , songs listened to ( 7,139 ) , and videos taken by him ( 2,164 ) .
To collect all this information , he uses a staggering assortment of hardware : desktop scanner , digicam , heart rate monitor , voice recorder , GPS logger , pedometer , smartphone , e-reader .
Called MyLifeBits , the project is feasible only because of the shrinking cost of storage , but creating the archive is just half the battle .
" The problem is n't putting it all in .
The problem is getting it out , " says Bell , who works at Microsoft 's Silicon Valley Research Group .
" When I started , I could n't find anything ! "
A classic file - and - folder hierarchy forces you to shoehorn multifaceted data into specific , rigid categories .
Bell 's solution is to make everything miscellaneous .
He switched to a database that lets info exist in multiple categories and began full - text indexing , which increased his metadata — and , therefore , potential search terms — by orders of magnitude .
In Total Recall , which Bell published with research partner Jim Gemmell , the 75 - year - old describes how his archive has worked for him .
After the disappearance and presumed death of a friend , computer scientist Jim Gray , Bell combed through thousands of files to find forgotten photos and stories he was then able to arrange into a powerful slide show for Gray 's memorial .
Bell 's data dump is more than just a glorified photo album .
By using e-memory as a surrogate for meat - based memory , he argues , we free our minds to engage in more creativity , learning , and innovation ( sort of like Getting Things Done without all those darn Post- its ) .
But perhaps there 's some virtue in truly forgetting — and not storing memories anywhere at all .
Maybe our innate lack of RAM serves some evolutionary purpose .
We all have unwanted bits we should be free to discard .
( That whole freshman year of high school , for example . )
" If you think you should forget , you should , " Bell concedes .
" But for God 's sake , keep all the papers you 've written and the photos you take .
Sometime down the road you might be looking for something and you wo n't even give yourself the chance of finding it . "

MASTERSHAUSEN /KÖLN. ( hpd ) Die Giordano Bruno Stiftung wehrt sich gegen Kardinal Meisners Diffamierungen religionskritischer Wissenschaftler und rückt die historischen Zusammenhänge zurecht .
Der Kölner Kardinal Joachim Meisner hat in seiner Allerheiligen - Predigt religionskritische Wissenschaftler in die Nähe des Nationalsozialismus gerückt .
Der Kardinal warnte vor „ ideologisierten Biophysikern , Hirnforschern und Evolutionisten “ , die den Menschen weismachen , " dass es keinen Gott gibt und deswegen auch nicht Wahrheit oder Lüge , Gut oder Böse " .
Das „ System des Nationalsozialismus und des Kommunismus im vergangenen Jahrhundert “ habe gezeigt , wohin das führe : „ an den Rand des Abgrunds , in letzter Konsequenz zur Abschaffung des Menschen .
Dafür stehen die KZs und Gulags . “
Der Vorstandssprecher der Giordano Bruno Stiftung , Michael Schmidt - Salomon , bezeichnete Meisners Predigt am Montagmorgen als „ Propaganda der übleren Sorte “ .
Meisner habe die Positionen religionskritischer Wissenschaftler völlig entstellt und darüber hinaus „ kolossale Geschichtsverfälschung “ betrieben .
Anders als der Kardinal es darlegte , sei die Menschenrechtsidee maßgeblich von religionskritischen Personen vorangetrieben worden , während katholische Päpste diese als „ unerträgliche Anmaßung “ verworfen hätten .
Erst 1961 habe sich der Vatikan zu einer halbgaren Anerkennung der Menschenrechte durchgerungen .
Seither sei es zwar Mode geworden , die katholische Kirche als Vorreiterin der Menschenrechte hinzustellen , mit der Realität habe dies jedoch wenig zu tun .
Gottesglaube der Nationalsozialisten
Als „ demagogisch “ beziehungsweise als „ erschreckend uninformiert “ wertete Schmidt - Salomon den Nazi- Vergleich , den Meisner bemühte , um konfessionsfreie Menschen zu diskreditieren .
Schließlich sei der Nationalsozialismus keineswegs atheistisch gewesen .
„ Der Gottesglaube avancierte im Nazi-Regime sogar zur Staatsdoktrin ! “ , führte der Stiftungssprecher aus .
„ Kurz nach der Machtübernahme der NSDAP wurde der atheistische Freidenkerverbund verboten und in dessen Büro die ‚ Reichszentrale zur Bekämpfung des Gottlosentums ’ eingerichtet .
Während Nazideutschland mit dem Vatikan das ' Reichskonkordat ' abschloss , waren Atheisten im NS - Regime unerwünscht , da ' Gottlosigkeit ' als Ausdruck des ' zersetzenden jüdischen Geistes ' galt . “
Wenn man unbedingt einen Vergleich mit dem Nationalsozialismus ziehen wolle , müsse man festhalten , dass es weit größere Parallelen zwischen Meisners Glauben und der Naziideologie gebe als zwischen den „ neuen Gottlosen “ und dem Nationalsozialismus .
So hätten sich die Nationalsozialisten wie Meisner „ als Streiter des Guten “ im Kampf gegen „ das universelle Böse “ verstanden .
Eine zentrale Rolle habe dabei die Wahnidee gespielt , dass sich „ im Juden “ „ das Böse “ verkörpere .
„ Ich gehe nicht davon aus , dass Meisner dieser speziellen Wahnidee unterliegt “ , sagte Schmidt - Salomon , „ aber es ist nicht zu leugnen , dass sich die Nazipropaganda vom ‚ Juden als Teufel in Menschengestalt ’ maßgeblich aus dem jahrhundertealten , christlichen Antijudaismus speiste , der schon lange vor dem Nationalsozialismus zu fürchterlichen Pogromen führte .
Die katholische Kirche hat ihre Mitverantwortung an den nationalsozialistischen Gräueltaten bis heute nicht kritisch aufgearbeitet .
Dass Meisner ausgerechnet jene Weltanschauung in die Nähe des Nationalsozialismus rückte , die vom Nazi - Regime von Anfang an verfolgt wurde , setzt diesem Trauerspiel die Krone auf . “
Schmidt - Salomon , der in seinem aktuellen Buch „ Jenseits von Gut und Böse “ unter anderem die christlichen Wurzeln des Holocaust herausarbeitete , erklärte , dass er dem Kardinal sein Buch in den nächsten Tagen zusenden werde .
„ Vielleicht hat er ja ein Einsehen , wenn er mit den realen Fakten konfrontiert wird “ , sagte der Stiftungssprecher .
Allzu optimistisch sei er jedoch nicht .
„ Ich fürchte , dass der Kardinal alles leugnet , was im Widerspruch zu seinem Glauben steht . “
Deshalb müsse Meisner insbesondere gegen die Erkenntnisse der Evolutionsbiologie und der Hirnforschung zu Felde ziehen , die das tradierte Menschenbild in Frage stellten .
„ Da dem Kardinal in seinem Kampf gegen die Wissenschaft keine vernünftigen Argumente zur Verfügung stehen , bleibt ihm nur das Instrument der Stimmungsmache .
Insofern werden wir wohl auch in Zukunft mit Diffamierungen durch Herrn Meisner rechnen müssen .
Doch wir ‚ideologisierten Biophysiker , Hirnforscher und Evolutionisten “ können das durchaus mit Humor nehmen .
Schließlich sind die bissigen Reaktionen des Kardinals ein Beleg dafür , dass sein dogmatisches Weltbild zunehmend unter Druck gerät – und das ist auch gut so . “

A PIONEERING IVF screening test dramatically increases the chance of a woman getting pregnant , a trial has shown .
The test checks for abnormalities and more than doubles the chance of a woman conceiving .
Initial results also show a live birth success rate of 80 per cent per cycle of IVF .
The screening checks chromosomes in the embryo and only those embryos with the best chance of success are used .
It also " virtually eliminates " the risk of conditions such as Down 's syndrome and cuts the risk of miscarriage .
Dr Dagan Wells , from Oxford University , who led the study , described the results as " astonishing " .
More than 20 babies have so far been born as a result of the screening .
He hopes the test could become standard practice and help boost birth rates in private and NHSclinics .
It is particularly useful for older women , who have a higher chance of producing eggs with genetic defects .
But it could benefit younger women - maximising their chances of falling pregnant in each IVF cycle .
The trial results showed that 66 per cent of women fell pregnant after screening - compared to 28 per cent who fell pregnant without it .
Many of the women were on their " last chance " at IVF - they were typically aged 39 with two failed IVF cycles behind them .
The screening technique , called comparative genomic hybridisation ( CGH ) , enables doctors to remove cells from an embryo when it is a few days old .
The cells are analysed and the best embryos selected for transplantation into the mother 's womb .
CGH is only offered at a handful of UK clinics but it is expected to become more popular if further studies confirm its value .
Dr Wells said : " We were taken aback by the impact it had on the success rates .
" We can say with great confidence that we are seeing a positive effect . "
The research involved 115 patients in the US and cells were transported to Oxford for analysis .
Dr Wells added : " The thing that 's got a big impact for us in the UK is that the implantation rate is high - that 's the probability of one embryo becoming a baby .
" After this test , if we transfer one embryo , we would expect two - thirds of women to get pregnant .
" Traditionally , we have not done this test with younger patients because the risk of chromosomal abnormality in embryos increases with age .
" But this may help younger women because it virtually eliminates the risk of conditions like Down's .
If these results are replicated then there would be an argument for making this the standard of care .
" This would have huge emotional implications for patients and financial implications for the NHS . "
CGH costs £ 2000 on top of the normal fee for IVF .
The world 's most famous IVF mum is Nadya Suleman , 33 , who gave birth to octuplets in January .
Consultant gynaecologist Stuart Lavery said : " The figures are amazing compared to conventional approaches . "
Fertility expert Dr Allan Pacey said : " Embryology is crying out for something like this . "
Women who lived in villages sprayed with DDT to reduce malaria gave birth to 33 per cent more baby boys with urogenital birth defects ( UGBD ) between 2004 and 2006 than women in unsprayed villages , according to research published online by the UK - based urology journal BJUI .
And women who stayed at home in sprayed villages , rather than being a student or working , had 41 per cent more baby boys with UGBDs , such as missing testicles or problems with their urethra or penis .
The authors suggest that this is because they spent more time in homes where domestic DDT - based sprays are still commonly used to kill the mosquitos that cause malaria , even in areas where organised mass spraying no longer takes place .
Researchers led by the University of Pretoria in South Africa studied 3,310 boys born to women from the Limpopo Province , where DDT spraying was carried out in high - risk areas between 1995 and 2003 to control malaria .
The study compared boys born to women in the 109 villages that were sprayed , with those born to women from the 97 villages that were not .
This showed that 357 of the boys included in the study - just under 11 per cent - had UGBDs .
The incidence of UGBDs was significantly higher if the mother came from a sprayed village .
" If women are exposed to DDT , either through their diet or through the environment they live in , this can cause the chemical to build up in their body " explains lead author Professor Riana Bornman from the University 's Department of Urology .
" DDT can cross the placenta and be present in breast milk and studies have shown that the residual concentration in the baby 's umbilical cord are very similar to those in maternal blood .
" It has been estimated that if DDT exposure were to cease completely , it would still take ten to 20 years for an individual who had been exposed to the chemical to be clear of it .
Our study was carried out on boys born between 2004 and 2006 , five to nine years after official records showed that their mothers had been exposed to spraying .
" Records were not kept before 1995 in the Limpopo Province , but it is reasonable to assume that DDT was being used before that date to combat malaria .
" Although most countries have now banned the use of DDT , certain endemic malarial areas still use indoor residual spraying with DDT to decrease the incidence and spread of the disease , which is caused by mosquitoes . "
The two - year study included 2,396 boys whose mothers had been exposed to DDT and 914 whose mothers had not .
A number of other factors were taken into account to rule out possible causes of the birth defects .
These included smoking and drinking , the mother 's age , how long she had lived in her village and her race .
These all proved statistically insignificant .
The authors believe that their study highlights the importance of educating people in high - risk malaria areas about the dangers of DDT .
" The use of DDT has contributed to the success in reducing malarial transmission and malarial deaths in South and Southern Africa " says Professor Bornman .
" However , the present findings also strongly suggest that indoor residual spraying with DDT is associated with UGBDs in newborn boys .
" With global concerns about the effect of chemicals on health , and the possibility of malaria resurgence and spread as a result of climate change , all authorities should ensure that the general public , including those living under indoor residual spraying conditions , are aware of the possible health risks .
" Educating people living in the DDT - sprayed communities about ways of protecting themselves from undue DDT exposure needs to be carried out as a matter of extreme urgency .
" There must be long - term monitoring of possible environmental and human health impacts , particularly in those areas where DDT will be introduced as part of the fight against malaria .
" We are now carrying out further research to find out how indoor spraying using DDT - based products affects humans and how this risk can be reduced . "

Victoria 's Attorney - General Rob Hulls has decided that religious groups should remain exempt from many of the state 's anti-discrimination laws .
Is Hulls pandering to the Christian Right ? asks Luke Williams .
Until very recently , Victorian Attorney General Rob Hulls has not had a happy relationship with Christian groups in his state .
He has a bad habit of calling the Christian far - Right “ doomsdayers ” and perhaps an even more fatal habit of approving laws that decriminalise abortion and improve access to IVF for lesbians and single parents .
Last month , he announced ( and here ) that religious groups would still have the right to hire and fire on the basis of sexuality , marital status and gender under proposed changes to the Equal Opportunity Act .
While the exemptions will be narrowed ( it will no longer be lawful for religious groups to discriminate on the basis of things such as disability , age or race ) , his proposal is really a crucial concession to some key religious groups on the touchstone issue of school students and their sexual morality .
Schools want their teachers to be good role models .
Christian schools also want their teachers to uphold Christian values .
Take for example , a school teacher at a religious school in the Victorian suburb of Box Hill , who complained this year to a legal service after being told by the principal she could not be promoted because the students knew she had divorced her husband and remarried .
The school was acting lawfully , religious groups have had a blanket exemption from all of the state ’s statutory anti-discrimination laws since their creation in the 1970s .
An employee can be hired or fired by a religious group for just about anything — being single , having children , being a Christian , not being a Christian or for their sexual orientation .

Following a strong campaign from community groups and the Equal Opportunity Commission , the state Labor government ordered a review into the controversial laws late last year .
Hulls put a parliamentary committee ( the Scrutiny of Act and Regulations Committee , SARC ) to work and made an immediate call for public submissions .
The reaction from religious groups was fierce .
Immediately , the review was framed by influential religious groups as a secularist attack on core religious beliefs and launched a massive public relations campaign .
Christians wrote to MPs , newspapers and each other .
The unifying issue was undoubtedly schools and the moral conduct of their employees .
When the SARC committee published its Options Paper in March , nearly all the submissions it received related to two of the 53 exemptions under review — those for religious groups and in particular , religious schools .
Four - hundred and fifty of the 500 submissions were from Christians supporting the exemptions .
Free2believe — a multi-denominational group created to lobby parliament on religious exemptions — set - up its website at the start of the year so visitors could send in an automated submission straight to the committee in a few “ simple steps ” .
Free2 believe ’s director told Crikey he thinks the site was responsible for facilitating more than 200 submissions .
( They have a similar function remaining on the website for sending a letter to an MP )
There ’s some indication that the highly organised lobbying exercise may have been — at least to a degree , a success .
The usually Left - leaning Hulls jumped in before the release of the committee ’s parliamentary report to announce the government ’s planned changes to the act ( released on the day of the AFL grand final so it would n’t get as much attention ) .
The question is exactly who in the now very fractured religious - Right Hulls was trying to appease with his proposal .
For starters , the ALP obviously had traditional churches in its sights , its closest adviser throughout this process has been the Catholic church and it was its Archbishop who was the first to publicly support the proposal .
However , it ’s probably equally fair to say Hulls is probably not terribly concerned with what the religious far - Right think of him or his government ( groups such as the Salt Shakers , the Australian Family Association and Catch the Fire were not invited to the public hearing in August ) .
But , the important third factor here is the large numbers of swinging evangelical voters who live in Victoria ’s most marginal seats , the majority of whom live in Melbourne ’s suburban Bible belt .
According to Phillip Hughes , the director of the Christian Research Association : “ The bible belt starts around Camberwell and extends out to Blackburn , Box Hill , Burwood , Mt Waverley and Mulgrave .
These are places with the highest number of churches and church attendance in Melbourne . ”
“ Christians in this area also tend to take their religion much more seriously than the average Anglican or Catholic .
Christians who live in the Bible belt are more likely to have an evangelical style .
“ They go to church , actively recruit and practice their religion a lot more .
Very high numbers attend Baptist and Pentecostal type churches in those areas . ”
Evangelism is often hailed as third - way for Christianity — a kind of middle - ground between fundamentalist and liberal theologies .
However , on approaches to s-xual morality , evangelicals and fundamentalists are often inseparable .
The data indicates evangelical Baptists and Pentecostalists are almost twice as likely as their Anglican and Catholic counterparts to believe that pre-marital sex , homosexuality and pornography are always wrong .
Now , the important thing for Labor is three of its most marginal seats sit within this Bible belt .
Take , for example , the marginal seat of Burwood ( ALP by 2.2 % ) — home to Australia ’s largest Baptist church — the self - branded Crossways is a massive , contemporary building and podcasts it ’s sermons on its website .
Like many of the churches in the area , it is entrepreneurial , it has its own unique branding and the denomination is not immediately clear .
Many of these religious groups are also now starting to offer services usually provided by business or government .
Their influence in their local communities should not be underestimated .
Take the very - hip LOMAH ( short for the Biblical reference Land of Milk and Honey ) cafe in Labor ’s most marginal seat of Mt Waverley .
It ’s linked to the Syndal Baptist church - run Karinya Services , which offers services for Christians from conflict resolution to disability and corporate services and psychotherapy .
The Syndal Baptist church is known for its strong sense of social justice and conservative approaches to sexuality .
One working group of the church focuses on issues such as “ poverty , slavery , fair trade and the Millennium Development Goals . ”
Yet its counseling service still treats homosexuality as a mental illness and encourages gay conversion therapy .
The Bible belt is also home to two marginal Upper House electorates .
Labor holds just 19 of 40 seats in the Legislative Council .
Ten of those sit within and around the belt — currently seats divided evenly between them and Liberal .
As far for the anti-discrimination exemption , in the fragmenting world of the Christian Right — matters of sexuality still have the power to unite and politicians know it .
Labor may not have specifically targeted the evangelicals with its decision to keep key exemptions in the act , but the spin - off approval was surely in their sights .
Evangelicals have traditionally been swinging voters who tend to vote on moral issues .
While they swung to Liberal during the Howard years , the evidence now shows large numbers swung to Labor at the last federal election .
“ There are a number of evangelicals who have a strong social justice bent on their Christianity . ” said Hughes .
“ More and more of them are developing Left - wing approaches to social issues like poverty and the environment , while remaining conservative on moral issues like abortion , pornography , pre-marital sex and the like . ”
It could even be the sign of a new progressive evangelical movement better adapted to a changing global - political landscape and the ideology of the ALP .
And if you ’re an evangelical who believes that sex outside heterosexual marriage is a potential path to hell , you do n’t want it condoned or even mentioned in schools .
If anything , some Christians still believe students should be taught that homosexuality and pre-marital sex are never OK .
Take Adrian Rowse , a young Evangelical who runs his own ministry .
He tours schools , youth seminars and runs support groups for “ sexually broken ” young people .
His main message is that homosexuality is a mental illness and it therefore can be treated and overcome .
He does much of his work around the marginal Liberal seats of Kilsyth , Ferntree Gully and Box Hill .
Recently , as a role model , he gave a talk to 12,000 high school students at a Christian conference .
Take this testimony from one 17 - year - old , who now feels he can overcome his gay feelings with a combination of therapy and prayer :
… While battles with these issues are constant and horrible to endure , age has not only helped me see that my walk with God can improve , but that I can use that improvement to help others in similar painful situations .
Role models , it seems , should really make the big difference in who you and do not sleep with — a probable vote decider for a crucial bloc of voters in some very marginal seats .

US researchers have genetically modified bacteria to eat carbon dioxide and produce isobutyraldehyde - a precursor to several useful chemicals , including isobutanol , which has great potential as a fuel alternative to petrol .
The modified bacteria are highly efficient and powered by sunlight , so a future goal is to set up colonies near to industrial plants .
This would allow greenhouse gases to be recycled into useful chemical feedstock - supplying several hydrocarbons that are typically obtained from petroleum .
Cyanobacteria and microalgae that consume CO 2 have been identified for a long time , but none produce any liquid molecules that can easily be used as fuel .
In the past , attempts have been made to engineer these organisms to produce hydrogen or ethanol , but making the process efficient is a challenge .
’ Here , we were successful in engineering CO 2 - eating bacteria to produce isobutyraldehyde very efficiently , ’ says James Liao , who led the work at the University of California , Los Angeles , US .
’ Our process is around 10 times faster than hydrogen production and about 100 times faster than genetically engineered ethanol production . ’
Liao ’s team modified the genome of the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus by incorporating four genes from other bacteria into the structure .
These genes , which come from L. lactis , B. subtilis and E. coli , produce enzymes that hijack the metabolism of the microbes - turning them into miniature reaction vessels .
The synthetic pathway begins with the photosynthetic conversion of CO 2 to pyruvic acid by the bacteria .
Next , the reaction continues in the bacteria as the added genes trigger three further steps to make isobutyraldehyde .
Importantly , extracting the final product from the mix is a simple process .
’ The fuel vaporises to the gas phase easily , making separation extremely simple .
Afterwards , we can liquefy it again by simple condensation , ’ Liao told Chemistry World .
This process helps keep the bacteria alive longer , as they are not exposed to large amounts of chemicals .
’ The bacteria are very stable , and in our flasks without much environmental control , the bacteria continued to produce for about 10 days , ’ Liao says .
But there are still much work to be done before the process can be commercialised , Liao notes , particular with scaling up the process .

Last night , world - famous magician and endurance artist David Blaine taught me how to hold my breath .
For four months , David held the Guinness world record for oxygen - assisted static apnea ( holding your breath after breathing pure oxygen ) : 17 minutes and 4.4 seconds .
His record was then surpassed by Tom Sietas on September 19 , 2008 .
David ’s record for doing what I ’ll describe is between 7 and 8 minutes .
I was born premature and , unlike David , I could n’t then remember the last time I held my breath for more than one minute .
It has always been my physiological Achilles heel .
What were the results of his training ?
My first baseline test : 40 seconds .
15 minutes later : 3 minutes and 33 seconds ( !!! ) .
Out of roughly 12 TEDMED attendees he also taught , all but one beat Harry Houdini ’s lifelong record of 3 minutes and 30 seconds .
One woman held her breath for more than 5 minutes .
Here is a photograph of the session .
I ’m sitting in the vest , four people to the right of Roni Zeiger , MD , Google Health product manager .
Here ’s how we did it …
The David Blaine Method
DISCLAIMER : THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY .
DO NOT ATTEMPT IN WATER OR WITHOUT PROPER SUPERVISION .
First and foremost , this is not a joke .
David himself has almost died on several occasions .
See 2:15 forward for a warning :
Moving onward to the method , which we did seated .
These notes were taken on a scrap of paper while performing the exercises .
Much of it was written after I lost almost all sensation in my hands following the purging exercises , and after colors began to morph .
After 3:20 –I really , really wanted to beat Houdini ’s record –I was shaking .
Needless to say , this means these cliff notes are a bit shaky and may not be 100 % accurate .
FYI , the above side - effects are common .
Definitions :
Deep breathing : “ Deep breathing ” involves taking a big breath in through the mouth , holding for one second , and then exhaling for 10 seconds through your mouth through your almost - closed mouth with tongue pressed against your lower teeth .
It should be a hissing exhalation and make a “ tsssssss … ” sound .
All breathing and exercises are performed though the mouth .
Purging : “ Purging ” involves a strong exhalation as if you were trying to blow a toy sailboat across a pool , followed by a big but faster inhalation .
David ’s cheeks were puffed out as he demonstrated the exhalation ( imagine the big bad wolf blowing the pigs ’ homes down ) .
Be careful not to heave or rock back and forth , which wastes oxygen .
Keep as still as possible .
Semi-purging : Breathing between the above two .
More forceful than deep breathing but less forceful than full purging .
Used for recovering after each time trial .
The Steps :
1:30 deep breathing
1:15 purging ( if you feel like you ’re going to pass out , do it less intensely )
Hold breath for target 1:30 , no more
After 1:30 :
Take 3 semi- purge breaths
1:30 deep breathing
1:30 purging
Hold breath for target 2:30 , no more
After 2:30
Take 3 semi- purge breaths
2:00 deep breathing
1:45 purging
Hold breath for as long as possible
After exhalation :
Take 3 -10 hard semi-purge breaths until your recover
Other Observations
David ’s record using the above method : 7:47 .
His heart rate dropped below 20 beats per minute
He had us move our right index finger slightly every 30 seconds or so while holding our breath to indicate we were alright .
More motion would waste O2 .
He also suggested , and this was incredibly useful , going from A to Z in your head during time trials , visualizing a friend for each letter whose name starts with that letter .
Use celebrities or historical figures when needed .
This serves to distract you from the fact that you ’re holding your breath .
If you continually check your time , it seems you hold your breath for less time .
It is the opposite of the above .
Too much focus on the time creates tension .
All of the test subjects , myself included , had a harder time holding their breath when David announced the time every 5 seconds vs. 30 seconds .
If I do this a second time , I will have someone else watch the time for me .
Do not let any air out whatsoever after taking your big inhalations for the time trials .
This is important protective training for water - based breath holding .
Why ?
If you pass out in the water ( not good ) , you want the uncontrolled release of bubbles to indicate to those supervising that you ’ve passed out .
It is easier to hold your breath if you have n’t eaten for 4 - 6 hours .
It is also easier to hold your breath if you have less body mass to support .
David will purposefully lose 30 + pounds during serious training to improve his lung - to - body volume ratio .
Want More ?
I ’ve finally met someone who screws with their body as much as I screw with mine .
There are some incredible possibilities .
Would you like to see more on this blog with David Blaine ?
If so , follow him here on Twitter to let us know .
He has a hell of lot to teach , and I ’d enjoy more body hacking and mischief .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Ford Motor reported a surprise profit for the third quarter Monday , helped by a bump in sales from the Cash for Clunkers program , a reduced cost structure and problems at its U.S. rivals .
The company also announced plans late Monday to raise $ 3 billion in order to further boost its balance sheet .
The only major U.S. automaker not to file for bankruptcy this year earned $ 997 million , or 29 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 161 million , or 7 cents a share on that basis a year earlier .
Excluding special items , Ford reported a profit of $ 873 million , or 26 cents a share , in the period .
Analysts had been forecasting a loss of 12 cents a share for the quarter on this basis .
Ford said it was the first pre-tax operating profit since the start of 2008 .
In a separate announcement , Ford said it will issue $ 1 billion in common stock and $ 2 billion of debt that will be convertible to common shares .
The company said it will start issuing them beginning next month .
The automaker also said it hopes to extend the maturity of its revolving credit facility by two years to 2013 .
" We expect the moves will enhance Ford 's automotive liquidity and over time reduce the company 's debt burden , providing an additional cushion given the still uncertain state of the economy , " said Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally in a statement .
The company said cost cutting during the past year and an improved outlook for sales leads it to believe Ford will be " solidly profitable " in 2011 , excluding special items .
That 's the most bullish outlook Ford has offered investors since it started losing money in 2005 .
The company had previously said it was looking for break - even or better results that year .
Turning the corner .
The guidance raised hopes that the company may have turned the corner on nearly five years of losses for its key North American auto operations .
" Our third quarter results clearly show that Ford is making tremendous progress despite the prolonged slump in the global economy , " said Mulally .
The company said it lowered its structural costs by $ 1 billion compared to a year earlier , with about half of that improvement coming in North America .
While Ford did not need federal assistance or a bankruptcy reorganization as rivals General Motors and Chrysler did , it was able to win concessions from its unions that resulted in a $ 300 million structural cost reduction .
Ford also said it paid about $ 200 million less for materials and commodities in the quarter .
Ford still faces some potential problems in the near term .
In a vote announced Monday afternoon , the United Auto Workers union rank and file rejected additional contract concessions sought by Ford management , including a freeze on entry level wages .
And Ford said it expects sharp declines in European sales in the next year partly because an even larger Cash for Clunkers there this year will steal demand from future months .
Still , Mulally told investors that the company remains hopeful it could be profitable in 2010 , not just by 2011 , and that the longer time frame in the new guidance is a way of being cautious .
" The reason we couched it that way is we 're just not sure about the strength of the recovery , " Mulally said .
Ford will detail further guidance on 2010 profits when it reports fourth - quarter results in January .
Digesting the details .
Results in North America were helped by much stronger sales than a year earlier , particularly in the United States , where the company was one of the prime beneficiaries of the Cash for Clunkers program that gave buyers up to $ 4,500 if they traded in a gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient vehicle .
Even without the Cash for Clunkers program , which lifted the whole industry out of the doldrums , Ford made gains on many of its rivals during the quarter .
During the quarter , Ford 's U.S. market share rose by 2.2 percentage points to 14.6 % .
Ford benefited from steep market share declines at GM and Chrysler in the wake of their bankruptcies , but it also posted bigger market share gains than Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) .
Shares of Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) gained more than 8 % Monday .
The company reported overall revenue of $ 30.9 billion in the quarter , down $ 800 million from the same period a year ago due to a decrease in revenue at its Ford Credit unit .
Ford said that global auto sales rose $ 100 million from the third quarter of 2008 , to $ 27.9 billion .
It sold 1.23 million vehicles worldwide , up 5 % from a year earlier , and its average net pricing also improved along with its sales volume .
Auto revenue in North America soared by $ 2.9 billion , or 27 % , to $ 13.7 billion .
Ford also said it made money on its auto operations , and that it reported positive cash flow of $ 1.3 billion from its auto businesses .
The company had been burning through significant amounts of cash every quarter since the second quarter of 2007 as it suffered from years of ongoing losses .
" While we still face a challenging road ahead , our [ company ] transformation plan is working and our underlying business continues to grow stronger , " Mulally added .
Ford 's automotive unit earned $ 446 million in the quarter , compared to a loss of $ 2.9 billion in the year - earlier period , as the company 's core auto operations in North America returned to profitability for the first time since the first half of 2005 .

3/5/2010 – Snow Leopard xmonad configuration detailed in this follow - up post
12/25/2009 to fix several hours and point out functionality of Fluxbox and Blackbox on Snow Leopard .
Perhaps you have used a full - time * NIX box as your main desktop in the past .
In many cases , you will probably find that many of those folks are just using Apple machines now , due to the aesthetics of the hardware , ease of native use of Windows and * NIX applications , giving you the best of all three worlds ( licensing is another topic . . . ) .
This is a great way to stick with your normal OS X install , but be able to switch back to just X11 so you can have tons of windows open and be able to read everything quickly .
This setup does not require any dual - booting , nerfing ofÂ copy / paste , etc .
I ’ve been doing this with Leopard and Snow Leopard .
I prefer xmonad , but have n’t succeeded in building it cleanly on fresh installs of Snow Leopard , so am providing two sets of instructions .
Ratpoison and xmonad are both very lightweight , minimalistic , fast window managers for X11 .
You ’ll find that they both strive to be as simple and quick as possible to permit the fastest usage of lots of windows while allowing you to maximize the use of your screen real estate .
Ratpoison instructions will work for either Leopard or Snow Leopard .
xmonad only works with Leopard at the moment , due to the 64 - bit haskell compiler ( GHC ) build work being done for Snow Leopard .
They each allow you to dynamically create and remove workspaces that are independent within X11 , and do not overlap with OS X’s “ Spaces ” .
xmonad stands out in a couple areas :
easy to rotate / resize / retile windows
a bit cleaner , simpler
mouse highlighting to switch windows
Try them out .
Other applications like tmux may be helpful to create another dimension of windows and flexibility .
Fluxbox and Blackbox are both fairly simple and clean , and each have functional ports available from MacPorts , so you can copy the settings below for Ratpoison and use those if you are interested .
1. Load X11 and XCode development tools from Apple OS X media .
If you want to use xmonad , perform the following steps , or skip to step 6 for Ratpoison .
( Leopard only at this point )
2. Download the GHC package for Apple Leopard ( same package for Leopard and Snow Leopard at this time )
3. Download the GHC X11 source package ( bottom of page )
4. Install the Haskell X11 package :
tar xf X11 - 1* tar *
cd X11-1 *
runhaskell Setup.hs configure
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install
5 . Install xmonad ; pull down the latest source core distribution from the xmonad site
tar xf xmonad - 0 * tar *
cd xmonad-0 *
sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install
If you want to use Ratpoison , perform the following steps , or skip to step 8 . ( Leopard or Snow Leopard )
6. Install MacPorts using their instructions .
7. Install Ratpoison : sudo port install ratpoison
Combined steps for either window manager .
8. Launch x11 , and set a few settings in preferences .
On the “ Input ” tab , ensure that only the following two options are checked :
Emulate three - button mouse
Enable key equivalents under X11
9. Close x11 .
10 .
Pull down awesome X11 fonts from proggyclean .
Save them in ~/ Desktop / fonts / or a directory of your choice .
Gunzip the PCF files .
11 . Open a command prompt and run mkfontdir in the directory to create a fonts dir file .
12 . Copy over the stock xinitrc : cp /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc
~/.xinitrc
13 .
In ~/.xinitrc , comment out twm , clock , all the xterms , and the if / for loop that runs the stuff in / usr / X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/
14 . Append to ~/.xinitc :
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/10-fontdir.sh
xset fp+ ~/ Desktop / fonts
xset fp rehash
cd
quartz - wm -- only - proxy &
if [ -f /usr/local/bin/xmonad ] ; then
/usr/local/bin/xmonad &
elif [ - f /opt/local/bin/ratpoison ] ; then
/opt/local/bin/ratpoison &
fi
xterm
15 . Create ~/.Xmodmap with the following contents :
clear Mod1
clear Mod2
keycode 63 = Mode_switch
keycode 66 = Meta_L
add Mod1 = Meta_L
add Mod2 = Mode_switch
16 . Create ~/. Xdefaults with the following contents ( adjust the font name if you selected a font other than ProggyTiny with slashed zero ) :
XTerm*font : -*-proggytinysz-medium-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
XTerm*reverseVideo : on
*VT100*reverseVideo : on
17 . Launch X11 .
Welcome to faster scrolling , paging action , and nice automatic ( and fast ! ) tiling of windows .
A couple of notes :
Cut and pasting : within x11 only , you can highlight text and it is on the clipboard to put it on the clipboard for aqua apps , hit command -c as usual with aqua apps to paste within x11 ( from either x11 or aqua ) , just use option - click or middle - click
xmonad specific : ctrl - n – new xterm meta - 1 through meta - 9 will take you through different workspaces in xmonad , which are independent of your built - in virtual desktops in OS X meta -. and meta- , will rotate and redo tiling of windows
Ratpoison specific : ctrl-t , s – split vertically ctrl-t , S – split horizontally ctrl-t , tab – moves focus ctrl-t , c – creates new terminal window ctrl -t , ? – help and tips
The only real issue I have with this approach is that I rarely have windows strictly 80 characters wide , so that makes it harder to visually realize when I should be wrapping lines .
Luckily nvi(1 ) and fmt ( 1 ) have that covered for me .
Hat tip to Eric Hanson for pushing me in the xmonad direction !
Major Adrian Agassi did not make the connection between the Bible , the land and the Jews when , fresh out of university , he left England for Israel in search of his roots .
He was not even a practising Jew .
But over the past quarter of a century , the Israeli army lawyer and then military judge at the forefront of arguably the most significant battle in the occupied West Bank – the confiscation of Palestinian land for the construction of Jewish settlements – has come to see himself as in service of a higher duty .
In an unusually frank interview , which offers insights into the melding of religion , politics and law that underpins land seizures in the occupied territories , Agassi has laid out his belief that Israel has a biblical claim to territory beyond its borders and that he , even as an immigrant , has a right to live on it when those born there do not .
" When we [ Israelis ] say that this is a political conflict , then we lose the battle , " he told the Guardian , adding that it should be remembered that the ancient land of Israel is " given to us by the Bible , not by some United Nations " .
Agassi , one of the most important officials in the military courts wielding authority over large parts of the West Bank , says settling Jews on lands that made up ancient Israel stands above all other biblical commandments and only when it is done can they have " a promised land and a promised life " .
" You say that these lands ' passed into Jewish hands ' .
Others would say that they came back into Jewish hands .
Others would say that they are obviously ours , inherently , " he said .
It was , he claims , a mistake to call it the State of Israel .
" If we would have named it the State of Jews , the Arabs would have understood that this land belongs to the Jews . "
Agassi served in the legal department that oversaw the confiscation of land in the West Bank to build Jewish settlements and was then appointed to the military court that decided Palestinian appeals against the seizure of their property .
The Palestinians almost never won .
His court also ruled on legal disputes between Jewish settlers and Palestinians .
Agassi denies his credo affected his legal judgments but his court was considered so biased by some critics that on one occasion the military prosecution , in an unusual step , appealed against Agassi 's ruling in favour of settlers to Israel 's high court .
Agassi was born in Southgate , London , in 1964 to a family of rabbis from Baghdad .
He studied law in the UK and emigrated to Israel at the age of 24 " with £ 500 and all of Bob Dylan 's records " .
Four years later he found himself dragged into the first Palestinian uprising , the intifada , as a legal adviser to the military in the West Bank .
" I was very young and suddenly found myself in front of the stones and Molotov cocktail and the hate .
I studied law , I had a liberal education , but I was at war and I knew we were right , " he said .
" I was 26 years old , I came from a foreign land .
Those actions guarded our existence in the land of Israel .
It lies at the heart of the conflict .
It 's a legitimate means to continue the works of our forefathers Abraham , Joseph and David . "
Agassi says a peace agreement with the Palestinians " goes against nature " because as far as he can see nothing had changed in last 4,000 years in the land of Israel , and that back to biblical times Arabs and Jews were at each other 's throats .
Agassi uses the term Arabs because he claims Palestinians do not exist .
He came to this conclusion over the past decade while serving as a special judge for administrative arrest .
Based on confidential intelligence reports , without trial , Agassi sent several hundred Palestinians – deemed to be terrorists or security threats – to prison for six months or more .
" You read the raw intelligence material and you see that most of them are moved by religious doctrine , not by a political one .
They use religion in order to justify killing as many Jews as possible .
Is this not a religious war ? "

Every morning I find myself having a media breakfast way before I have an actual breakfast .
This is what keeps me growing , learning and evolving as a designer .
Here you 'll find the components of that meal ... and some random stuff on the side
SANTA CRUZ GUERILLA DRIVE -IN is an outdoor movie theater under the stars that springs up unexpectedly in the fields and industrial wastelands .
Beyond showing great free movies year - round and bringing a broad community together , part of our mission is reclaiming public space and transforming our urban environment .
The bystander effect is the somewhat controversial name given to a social psychological phenomenon in cases where individuals do not offer help in an emergency situation when other people are present .
The probability of help has in the past been thought to be inversely proportional to the number of bystanders .
In other words , the greater the number of bystanders , the less likely it is that any one of them will help .
This list describes the prototype of the effect and cites nine particularly heinous examples .
10 The Parable of The Good Samaritan
First , the prototype of the bystander effect .
Jesus tells a story to a lawyer , who , in all other ways , is blameless and upright in God ’s eyes .
He obeys the Ten Commandments , and loves his neighbor as himself .
But he asks Jesus , “ Who is my neighbor ? ”
Jesus then explains , with the following parable , that everyone is everyone ’s neighbor , and that help should be offered to anyone in need of it , regardless of who or what that person is .
A Jew is going along the road , and is beset by bandits , who beat him severely , strip his clothes , and rob him .
They leave him for dead .
Later , a priest walks by .
He sees the Jew , moves to the other side of the road , and walks by without helping .
Later , a Levite goes by , sees him , and gives him a wide berth , going on without helping .
Later , a Samaritan ( considered by the Jews to be outcasts ) comes by , sees him , and immediately helps him , taking him to a nearby inn , caring for him , and paying the innkeeper .
“ Which of these is the neighbor of the Jew who is beaten by robbers ? ” Jesus asked .
“ The merciful one , ” replied the lawyer .
“ Go and do likewise . ”
In the following nine examples , no one goes and does likewise .
9 Shanda Sharer
From the 10th to the 11th of Janury , 1992 , 12 - year - old Shanda Sharer was abducted and tortured by four teenage girls , Laurie Tackett , Melinda Loveless ( a propo ) , Hope Rippey , and Toni Lawrence .
Tackett was more or less the leader of the four , and interested the others in the Goth lifestyle , punk rock , vampirism , witchcraft , Satanism , lesbianism , and such , and devised the plan for abducting Sharer and stabbing her to death , out of revenge for stealing Loveless ’s girlfriend .
They abducted Sharer from her house just after midnight , pretending to take her to see their mutual friend , Amanda Heavrin , the girlfriend Loveless believed Sharer to have stolen .
As soon as she was in the car , Loveless put a knife to her throat and interrogated her about Heavrin , until they arrived at “ the Witch ’s Castle , ” a local run -down house where teenagers liked to hang out .
They took her inside , tied her up and discuss how they would kill her , at which point Sharer started crying .
They claim to have been frightened by passing headlights , so they took her to a nearby landfill in thick woods , where Loveless beat her savagely with her fists .
Lawrence and Rippey claim to have wanted out of the situation by this point , but did not dare try to run and call the police .
Loveless then tried to cut Sharer ’s throat but the knife was too dull .
Rippey then got out , had Loveless and Tackett hold her down , and strangled her with a rope .
They thought she was dead and threw in the trunk , then went to Tackett ’s home to wash up .
They heard Sharer screaming , and Tackett went out with a kitchen knife and returned covered in blood .
The screaming had stopped .
She then took out her runes , part of the Wicca lifestyle , and told the girls ’ futures .
They then Tackett and Loveless went joyriding from 2:30 AM , while Lawrence and Rippey stayed at her home .
Sharer began struggling to get out of the trunk , so Tackett stopped , and beat her unconscious with a tire iron .
They returned a little before dawn , washed up again , and Tackett laughed as she told what she had done .
They left and went to a neighborhood burning area , where leaves and limbs , etc. , are disposed of , and showed Sharer , nearly dead in the trunk to the others .
Lawrence claimed to have been so disgusted that she turned away .
She still refused to rat out her friends .
Tackett sprayed Sharer with Windex , probably to exacerbate her wounds , and taunted her , “ You ’re not looking so hot , now , are you ? ”
They then filled a 2 - liter Pepsi bottle with gasoline at a nearby station , drove to a secluded field , laid Sharer , alive , in a blanket in the grass , doused and set her afire .
Loveless returned a moment later and poured the rest of the gasoline on her , to be sure .
Lawrence was scared to death by this point , and finally called a friend of the same age , and told her what had happened .
She refused to call the police , now out of fear as an accomplice .
Loveless strangled became hysterical , sorry about what she had done , and called Amanda Heavrin to tell her .
Heavrin did not believe them , until she and another friend saw the trunk of Tackett ’s car with blood and Sharer ’s socks .
None of them called the police .
Sharer ’s body as discovered by two hunters earlier that morning , the 11th , and reported .
By 8:00 PM that night , the whole community knew , and Loveless finally confessed in a fit of hysteria to the police .
Tackett , Loveless , and Rippey were sentenced to 60 years in prison , Lawrence 20 years .
Lawrence was released on good behavior in 2000 , Rippey in 2006 .
8 Ilan Halimi
Ilan Halimi was a French Jew who was kidnapped in Paris by Moroccan “ barbarians , ” as they like to be called , on Janury 21 , 2006 , and tortured for 24 days , finally dying on February 13 .
During this time , his kidnappers , at least 20 of them , beat him all over his body , especially his testicles , completely wrapped his head in duct tape , except for his mouth , so he could breathe and eat , stabbed him , burned his body and face with lighters and cigarettes , and broke his fingers in order to extract a ransom of 450,000 Euros from his family .
They stripped him , they scratched him , they cut him with knives , and finally poured gasoline on him and set him afire .
During these three weeks , neighbors in the apartment block where his kidnappers had taken him ( and where they lived ) heard the commotion and came to watch .
No one ever called the police .
27 people have so far been charged with joining in .
19 people have been convicted and given long prison sentences .
One of the torturer ’s fathers knew what was happening and did nothing to stop them .
This man , Alcino Ribeiro , was sentenced to 8 months , but this sentence was suspended .
He has served no time .
Those neighbors known only to have watched were not convicted , most not even indicted .
Halimi was found handcuffed and bound with nylon rope , naked , to a tree about 40 yards inside a woodlot from a railway outside Paris , on February 13 .
More than 80 % of his body had been burned with acid , as well as gasoline , to the point that he was difficult to recognize .
He had severe contusions , blood blisters , and hematomas covering most of his body , to the point that he was more blue than flesh - colored , multiple broken bones , one ear and one big toe missing , and his testicles looked like “ blackened oranges . ”
Halimi died en route to a hospital .
7 Edison Electrocutes an Elephant
Not just Topsy the Elephant , but a rather long series of animals , all of which had shown themselves to be a danger to humans .
This included horses , lions , tigers , and bears .
Edison was happy to oblige the state of NY in executing these “ menaces to society , ” by employing alternating current , but his ulterior motive was merely to show the world the danger of alternating current , invented by Nikola Tesla , his arch -rival .
Edison ’s direct current did n’t have the strength to electrocute an elephant , and he considered it safer .
So , on January 4 , 1903 , at Luna Park Zoo , Coney Island , Topsy was hooked up to Edison ’s lighting plant , and electrocuted with 6,600 volts of AC .
But this was after they fed her carrots that had been soaked in cyanide , just to be sure .
They deemed Topsy to be a permanent threat to humans , as she had killed three handlers in three incidents , one of which involved a handler , who regularly whipped her , trying to feed her a lighted cigarette just to watch her suffer .
She stomped on him .
1,500 people watched , and no one said a word in complaint .
Edison filmed it , and the film is available on YouTube , if you feel like being outraged .
The funny thing is that the ASPCA , which is supposed to protect the rights of animals , considered hanging to be cruel , as it would cause strangulation , not a snap of the neck , and yet had no problem with cyanide poisoning and electrocution .
6 Kevin Carter ’s Famous Photograph
Kevin Carter was a South African Photojournalist who , in March 1993 , took the most infamous photograph , so far , of the brutality and disregard for human suffering in sub-Saharan Africa .
The photo shows a female Sudanese toddler , alone and severely emaciated , attempting to crawl to an aid station for food .
A vulture is standing on the ground behind her , waiting for her to die so it can eat her .
Carter claimed that he waited 20 minutes for the vulture to spread its wings , which he thought would make a better picture , and when it did n’t , he took the picture as is .
For those 20 minutes , the toddler had to rest before resuming its trip .
She whimpered and panted , and Carter did nothing to help her .
He took the picture , scared the vulture away , then left the girl to continue crawling on her own .
No one knows what became of her , but it very likely that she starved to death .
This account is denied by Joao Silva , a journalist friend of Carter , who stated that the child ’s parents left for only a moment to take food from a plane .
Either way , Carter claimed later that he just “ did n’t want to get involved . ”
He killed himself the next year , after winning the Pulitzer for this photograph , by carbon monoxide poisoning , in his truck in Johannesburg .
5 Forced Relocation of the American Indians
This was not a single incident , but all the major crimes against the Indians were perpetrated for the same reason .
European settlers and their descendants wanted more land .
They thus drove the Indians westward , killing hundreds of thousands over the centuries , in order to make way for themselves .
Unfortunately , no land is ever enough land .
They wanted more , and the Indians continued being deprived of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
The most astonishing aspect of this crime is that many notable Americans , especially Andrew Jackson , considered it righteous , as the Indians did not have the military strength to defend themselves , and thus deserved to lose their rights .
Survival of the fittest , so to speak .
Jackson is the man most directly responsible for the “ Trail of Tears ” relocation of the Cherokee .
Later , the Navajo and Sioux , to name just two large tribes , were slaughtered in outright warfare .
Very few Europeans or their descendants , from 1585 with the Lost Colony , to the turn of the 20th Century , ever raised much of a fuss , if any at all , over this disgustingly awesome mistreatment of an entire race of humans .
4 Murders of Three Civil Rights Workers
If you ’ve seen the film “ Mississippi Burning ” you ’re familiar with the murders of James Chaney ( black ) , Michael Schwerner , and Andrew Goodman ( both white , Jewish ) .
The White Knights of the KKK shot them dead and buried them in an earthen dam in 1964 .
The outrage in the northern half or so of the United States was immediate and fierce , as it should have been .
But there was no public outcry of any kind in the South .
Very few black people , especially in Mississippi , had anything to say about the crime , as they did n’t dare incur the wrath of the white authorities .
But the truly astonishing aspect is the absence of an outcry by many white people , if any , as they either agreed with the crime , or just did n’t care about the plight of blacks ( and Jews , and anyone other than “ WASPs ” ) in the South .
Racial hatred had become so rampant and impudent that the Judges who presided over the various criminals of this sort of case rarely convicted them , and then imposed the lightest sentences .
The culprits of the three 1964 murders , 17 of them , were tried , and only 7 were convicted , not of murder , but of “ civil rights violations , ” because the prosecution did n’t believe they could be convicted , in Mississippi , of murder , which was probably true .
The harshest sentences were 10 years each to two culprits .
Others received 7 years , or 3 years .
No one served more than 6 .
3 Kitty Genovese
The most infamous example of the bystander effect took place on March 13 , 1964 , in Kew Gardens , Queens , NY , when Catherine Genovese was entering her apartment building at about 3:15 AM , from work .
She was stabbed twice in the back by Winston Moseley , a heavy machine operator , who later explained that he simply “ wanted to kill a woman . ”
Genovese screamed , “ Oh , my God !
He stabbed me !
Help me ! ” and collapsed .
Several neighbors in surrounding buildings reported hearing her voice , but decided it was probably just a drunken brawl or lovers ’ spat .
One man shouted from his window , “ Let that girl alone ! ” which scared Moseley away .
This neighbor was sure to have seen Genovese crawling across the street , under a streetlight , to her apartment , but did nothing to help her .
Witnesses saw Moseley drive away , then return about 10 minutes later .
He had put on a wider - rimmed hat to hide his face , and searched for Genovese in the parking lot , the train station , and the apartment complex , for 10 minutes , before finding her prone in the external hallway at the rear of the building , where the door was locked .
She could not get in .
Moseley proceeded to stab her to death , inflicting multiple wounds in her hands and forearms , indicating that she tried to fight him off .
She finally succumbed and he raped her as she lay dying .
He then stole around $ 50 from her and fled .
The whole incident spanned 30 minutes .
A newspaper blasted it the next day as “ Thirty - eight Who Saw Murder Did n’t Call Police , ” but this is inaccurate .
There were approximately 12 people who claimed to have seen the first attack .
Many of them later stated that they “ just did n’t want to get involved . ”
A simple phone call to the police would have sufficed , but everyone assumed someone else would do it .
2 The Richmond High School Incident
The events that transpired on the night of October 27 , 2009 inspired me to compile this list and I admit that it has caused me to reconsider the crime of the # 1 entry .
The girl ’s name has not been released to date , as she is 15 years old , but the accounts of the crime all agree , and it is beyond belief .
For 2 and a half hours , while the High School Homecoming Dance was taking place inside the gymnasium , approximately 10 men gang - raped the 15 - year - old student , beating her savagely the whole time , all the while 10 others stood around laughing and taking pictures with their cell phones .
The crowd eventually numbered more than 20 , and no one called the police .
No one went inside to tell a security guard or a policeman , several of which were on campus at the time .
A little earlier , the assistant principal looked out his office window and saw 12 to 15 grown men sitting around near the scene of the crime , none of whom had identification badges , as is required , and none of whom appeared to be a teenager , and the assistant principal did not call the police , or alert any teachers or students .
He returned to his job and ignored them .
The girl is still in critical condition at a hospital , having been found later by someone leaving the dance .
1 The Holocaust
The most repugnant , globally violent disgrace of the reputation of humanity gave rise to the equally infamous use of the phrase “ diffusion of responsibility , ” as the Nazi officers tried at Nuremberg all claimed the same defense , “ We were just following orders . ”
They argued that if the Holocaust really was as bad as journalists were saying , then someone else must surely have known of it , and thus it was not necessarily their responsibility to report it to the authorities .
They also argued that the only authorities in Continental Europe at the time were German , and thus , they would only have killed themselves by attempting to inform the outside world , and would have accomplished nothing .
This is not true .
Most of the German population knew nothing of it , but had they , they could easily have banded together and demanded that the Holocaust be stopped .
The Nazis would have been reluctant to exterminate their own “ master race , ” and by that point , the Allies would have heard news of it .
So the Nazis wisely concealed the concentration and death camps from all but the small villages nearest to them .
The Holocaust achieves # 1 , however , because the populations of the villages near these camps , Dachau , Buchenwald , Bergen - Belsen , Sachsenhausen , Mauthausen , and Ravensbruck , to name a few , knew perfectly well of the atrocities and horror inside the camps .
The camps were established near fairly large towns and cities , the inhabitants of which could not have ignored the stench coming from them .
Allied soldiers all reported smelling camps before finding them , from as far as 20 miles if the wind blew right .
The Allies accused the German citizens of these towns of knowing full well what was happening to Jews and other “ undesirables ” and yet making no effort to save one life .
These German populations were thus forced to clean up the emaciated corpses and bury them in mass graves , as punishment for their passivity .
Bloomberg news reports on why the acting U.S. attorney in Boston is blasting a top pharmaceutical company for engaging in “ clearly criminal ” actions .
“ Prosecutor Michael Loucks remembers clearly when lawyers for Pfizer Inc. , the world ’s largest drug company , looked across the table and promised it would n’t break the law again , ” David Evans writes for Bloomberg .
ADVERTISEMENT
It was January 2004 , and the attorneys were negotiating in a conference room on the ninth floor of the federal courthouse in Boston , where Loucks was head of the health - care fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney ’s Office .
One of Pfizer ’s units had been pushing doctors to prescribe an epilepsy drug called Neurontin for uses the Food and Drug Administration had never approved .
In the agreement the lawyers eventually hammered out , the Pfizer unit , Warner - Lambert , pleaded guilty to two felony counts of marketing a drug for unapproved uses .
New York - based Pfizer agreed to pay $ 430 million in criminal fines and civil penalties , and the company ’s lawyers assured Loucks and three other prosecutors that Pfizer and its units would stop promoting drugs for unauthorized purposes .
What Loucks , who ’s now acting U.S. attorney in Boston , did n’t know until years later was that Pfizer managers were breaking that pledge not to practice so - called off - label marketing even before the ink was dry on their plea .
Loucks tells Bloomberg news ,
“ At the very same time Pfizer was in our office negotiating and resolving the allegations of criminal conduct in 2004 , Pfizer was itself in its other operations violating those very same laws . ”
“ They ’ve repeatedly marketed drugs for things they knew they could n’t demonstrate efficacy for , ” Loucks added .
“ That ’s clearly criminal . ”
Pfizer agreed in September to pay out a record 2.3 billion dollars to settle a high - profile fraud case , pleading guilty to a criminal charge for marketing its painkiller Bextra illegally .
The settlement by the world ’s biggest drugmaker was trumpeted as a major victory by President Barack Obama ’s administration in its efforts to cut down fraud as part of a major overhaul of America ’s health care system .
ADVERTISEMENT
Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held a press conference to announce the settlement , which will end criminal and civil proceedings against Pfizer over the allegations it illegally marketed drugs for off - label purposes .
“ This historic settlement will return nearly one billion dollars to Medicare , Medicaid , and other government insurance programs , securing their future for the Americans who depend on these programs , ” she said in a statement .
The agreement with Pfizer is divided into several parts , the largest of which is a 1.195 billion dollar fine — the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter , according to the Justice Department .
ADVERTISEMENT
The company will also forfeit 105 million dollars and pay an additional one billion dollars “ to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims
Act that the company illegally promoted four drugs . ”
The case arose from allegations that Pfizer illegally marketed Bextra , the anti-psychotic drug Geodon , the antibiotic Zyvox , and Lyrica , an anti-epileptic drug , for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Justice Department had alleged that Pfizer ’s inappropriate marketing “ caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs for uses that were not medically accepted indications and therefore not covered by those programs . ”
The settlement also ends civil proceedings over “ allegations that Pfizer paid kickbacks to healthcare providers to induce them to prescribe these , as well as other , drugs , ” the Justice Department said .
Assistant Attorney General Tom Perrelli said the investigation into Pfizer ’s activities illustrated that combating healthcare fraud “ is one of this administration ’s top law enforcement priorities . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This case is a great example of the department ’s commitment to fiscal accountability , combating fraud , and returning much - needed dollars back to the US Treasury and state treasures , ” he said .
Amy Schulman , senior vice president and general counsel for Pfizer , said the drug company welcomed the settlement , which it had agreed to pay in principle back in January .
“ These agreements bring final closure to significant legal matters and help to enhance our focus on what we do best — discovering , developing and delivering innovative medicines , ” Schulman said , adding that the company did “ regret certain actions taken in the past . ”
The agreement was announced amid continuing efforts by the Obama administration to advance a healthcare reform package that faces stiff opposition .
ADVERTISEMENT
The administration has countered that a key provision of the reform package is an effort to reduce waste and fraud .
“ Illegal conduct and fraud by pharmaceutical companies puts the public health at risk , corrupts medical decisions by health care providers , and costs the government billions of dollars , ” said Tony West , assistant attorney general for the Justice Department ’s civil division .
“ This civil settlement and plea agreement by Pfizer represent yet another example of what penalties will be faced when a pharmaceutical company puts profits ahead of patient welfare . ”

Are you sitting down ?
I have something shocking to tell you .
The people who run our fisheries have been struck down by an unprecedented attack of good sense .
I expect them to recover soon , but while the sickness persists , anyone who values the ecosystem has something to celebrate .
On 1 November , the fleet of nomadic scallop dredgers that moves around the country trashing the sea floor was due to resume its assault on Cardigan Bay off the Welsh coast , near where I live .
Partly because it harbours one of the only two large populations of bottlenose dolphins in the UK , most of the bay 's coastal waters are classified as special areas of conservation – the strictest protection available under EU law .
But until now , dredgers from all over the country have been allowed to drag their steel hooks and chain mats over the seabed between November and May , trashing everything that lives there : all the sessile animals , the fish , their spawn , and any features that might harbour life .
The damage they inflict is out of all proportion to the catch , and they probably cost other fisheries far more money than they make themselves .
Banned from other sensitive areas , they have poured into Cardigan Bay , where as many as 70 boats have been working at once .
Until now , the regional fisheries committee , which is supposed to defend the marine ecosystem , has wrung its hands and claimed there is nothing it can do .
But a vocal campaign by local people , led by the Friends of Cardigan Bay , has prompted it at last to act .
This month , the county 's Fisheries Committee announced it has banned scallop dredging in the bay indefinitely , pending the results of an ecological assessment by scientists at Lancaster University .
There are two remaining problems .
The first is that , amazingly , an assessment has n't yet been conducted .
The dredgers have been the subject of huge controversy for years , but the fisheries committee has allowed them to keep operating without bothering to discover how much damage they are doing .
Divers ' photos and research from other parts of the UK suggests it is likely to be horrendous .
But the scallop dredgers might challenge the ban on the grounds that their impact has n't yet been assessed .
Why was n't this research carried out before ?
The other problem is that the dredgers are n't going to give up : they will just move to another part of the UK , where they have n't yet been banned , and start trashing the marine ecosystem there .
Is n't it time this practice is banned all around the UK , and even throughout Europe ?
But do n't let me spoil this rare moment , in which a concern for the health of the ecosystem has been allowed to trump raw greed and plunder .
Enjoy it while it lasts .

Attorney vs Lawyer
In the world that is constantly pondering over new rules and laws , questioning the grounds of ethics that guide the system of lawmaking and justice , it does n’t bother to look up at the obvious .
‘ Attorney ’ and ‘ Lawyers ’ are two terms that most of the public understands as synonyms of each other .
However , is that really the case ?
We are in an era where being ignorant is not an appreciable thing even if it is the smallest of the things .
An ‘ attorney ’ is an individual who is a part of the legal profession .
He / she is responsible for representing a client in court .
That is when the client needs to plead or defend a case .
They can have different titles depending upon the position they hold .
While a ‘ lawyer ’ is used for a person who trained in the field of law , they give legal advice and aid .
It is a much - used general term .
Terms and their definitions are the minute details in the world of law .
For example , interchanging words like ‘ shall ’ and ‘ must ’ will change the entire implication of a statement .

Scrum Roles - an Unsolvable Puzzle ?
Anna Forss , TUI Nordic , https://annaforss.wordpress.com/
When I became part of my first Scrum project , I tried reading and participating in the agile community but found that as a " business person " , I was rather lonely .
Scrum and software development methodology is all too often seen as a problem for " the developers " .
I�m not a coding person .
And yet I develop software .
Not by writing code , but by acting product owner in my projects .
To enable the successful Scrum project , we need to break down this wall between developers and business folks .
We business people must get involved , feel ownership and get ourselves educated .
If you want to feel that you �re in control of your Scrum project , get educated and chances are that your view on the word control change in the process .
I sometimes hear that so many Scrum projects fail .
That it�s so hard to implement Scrum .
Is that true , and if so ; why ?
It �s my belief that many problems lies in how the different roles are implemented ; who is selected to which role , how the roles interact and how people perceive their role ( and other�s ) in a Scrum project .
For me Scrum is all about how you communicate .
And which communication works if the wrong people are discussing the wrong things in the wrong forum ?
So , you need to get this right to succeed .
But what " right " is depends on your organization and the problem you need to solve .
This article is built on a number of questions which you need to ask yourself and the other stakeholders in your organization .
And you need to find your own answers .
I hope I can give you the basis for you to be able to answer these questions for your situation .
The questions are divided into two main chapters .
In the first chapter , What is Scrum , I present the basic roles and how they are connected .
In the second chapter , But this really didn�t answer my questions , I discuss a number of common questions , especially ones you might ask in an enterprise environment .
What is Scrum ?
In this chapter we answer the questions which needs to be answered before the Scrum project begins ; or at least very early into the project .
A successful Scrum project is much about understanding what Scrum is and what it�s not .
As Ken Schwaber puts it ; Scrum does not bring out excellence , it exposes incompetence .
Much of the success lies in the selecting a product owner and a Scrum master .
You can perhaps succeed with a Scrum project with the wrong product owner , but I�ve never heard of such a case .
Quite the opposite ; I have firsthand experience of a Scrum project which fell to pieces within weeks of assigning an unsuitable product owner .
You can perhaps succeed with a less than suitable Scrum master , especially if there is a seasoned Scrum team , but chances that a new Scrum team succeed with a non functional Scrum master is probably slim .
I don�t get wiser by reading on the Internet about Scrum , so what is it ?
I�m just a business person and now they are talking about Scrum .
I�ve tried to read on the Internet what it I , but I�ve not made it through those long articles and I �m none the wiser .
To give you a short description , Scrum tries to answer the following questions :
How to decide what to develop ?
Who decides what to build ?
How deliveries are presented ?
How team member keeps each other updated ?
Scrum does not specify how you develop and if you look at the list above you can see that Scrum specifies rules for communication during development .
This is the reason why Scrum is most often combined with a more detailed software development methodology like Extreme Programming : since it does not help the developer during the actual programming you might want to add other rules or methods
The Scrum process can be described as the following :
You take the highest prioritized requirements on a regular basis and during a meeting ( called the sprint planning meeting ) specify which tasks are needed to fill the requirements .
After this meeting , during a time boxed period ( called a sprint ) , the team finishes the tasks and keep each other updated during daily 15 minutes meetings ( called Daily Scrum ) .
When the sprint comes to the end , the team releases working software and present the result to the stakeholders during a meeting ( called the demo or sprint review ) .
So , here are some principles
Sprint planning meeting During the sprint planning meeting it is decided what is to be accomplished during the sprint .
The person who presents the options is the product owner .
During the sprint planning meeting , the team takes the highest prioritized feature (s ) .
The team commits to which objectives they are to meet during the sprint .
They should select the highest prioritized item (s ) .
Product owner and product backlog
The product owner has collected a list of the requirements of the system (s ) .
This list is prioritized so that each requirement has a unique priority .
This list is called a product backlog .
Sprint During the sprint , the objectives of the current sprint cannot change without the product owner and the team members accept this .
This means that the product owner cannot add or change features without the team accepting the consequences .
The product owner can add and change details within the scope of the feature .
Scrum master
The principle is that the Scrum team works undisturbed by external distractions during the sprint .
They are self organizing in the sense that they pick their own tasks .
This does not mean that they cannot communicate with others .
Quite the opposite , team members are welcome to ask stakeholders and users about details , usability and preferred behavior .
But outsiders should not themselves confront and disturb individual team members with questions and input .
Instead one person is selected to be the one to which an outsider addresses questions .
This person is called the Scrum master .
The Scrum master is the guardian of the process and protects the team from distractions .
The Scrum master does not say what people should do but keeps taps on that things are done .

But what business is it of mine how Scrum works ?
Scrum is a software development methodology , so why should business people like me get educated about how Scrum works ?
Can�t I just give those code guys my list and let them work that out ?
What you don�t understand , you can never control .
What you cannot control , you cannot affect .
Scrum is about control , but not at a micro level but a strategic level .
So , how about it ?
Do you want to be the one who decides what gets done ?
Not everyone involved will read a line of writing about agile or Scrum .
Many won�t listen to the podcasts which you recommend or take the classes you want them to .
But everyone involved in a Scrum project need to understand the basic principle .
So , you must help them .
Some will never understand , some will understand but think the rules do not apply to them .
But besides this , you can offer a basic understanding of the process using a simple exercise .
Remember that this exercise is just one example .
Depending on the participants , you can use another example .
Start by saying that this is an example of how they can view a Scrum project from a situation , well known to them .
And the situation is that the wife comes in and says " We�re having a party ! " .
What does this mean ?
Depending on who you are you will think different things when you visualize what the party means .
Alas , the need for a project vision .
You then decide on a product vision , for example that you �re having a family party at home , directed to your parents and the kids in your family and you �re not having anything like the Christmas party .
You then move towards the other steps in the planning phase .
Then , when this is done you can move to the actual project .
You can say that there are five days to the actual party .
Consider what would happen if you made all the plans today and just expect everything to be done on Friday .
Therefore , you make every day a sprint .
And this can exemplify some of the issues on one of the sprint planning meetings :
On day two , you get together and see what will be done next .
Getting the party hats proved easy but buying the stuff for the case was not completed since the icing was not available at the store .
Can we do without the icing or will we remove something else ?
Doug bought the wrong type of chicken , so here is the question if we should change recipes or if should take the time to go back to the store .
You can discuss the importance of quality , of communication , the ease with which confusion is built and how you can become agile .
The exercise probably takes about an hour and time for discussions afterwards is needed .
Scrum is a method which you can use to make clear the pulse which you have when you develop .
It also specifies the rules for who makes the decisions what is to be done and when changes can be made .
The principle is that the timeline is divided into time boxed sprints during which you don�t change the priorities .
Try
Enable that everyone involved can build an understanding of the general process , for example using an exercise as described in this chapter .
Have the knowledge exercise for managers for both team members and other stakeholders .
They will need an understanding of how their teams are affected .
Avoid
Skipping daily Scrum , sprint planning meetings or sprint review , even if you don�t understand why .
At least in the beginning .
When you�ve tried using the artifacts , you can perhaps understand better the implications of including or not including .
Having just one Scrum sponsor on the project .
You need multiple people involved , and multiple opinions on how Scrum is to be implemented .
If only one person have knowledge and an interest , this becomes an issue for this person
Reading just one book on Scrum and agile .
Different books have so different approach and perspective .

Agile Estimating and planning , by Mike Cohn
Should I be the product owner ?
What does it mean to be a product owner and who is the most suitable person ?
I�m the product manager ; doesn�t that automatically make me the product owner ?
It has often been stated that the product owner is the most difficult role to fill and the single most important reason for project failure .
So who is the product owner ?
The product owner is
the one person who ultimately decides what is on the product backlog and
the one person who sets the priority of all the items on that list .
The product owner is responsible for making sure that all the items on the product backlog can be understood by the team and all the stakeholders .
The team needs to know what is to be built and the stakeholders must know where on the list their " stuff " can be found .
The product owner needs to take responsibility for the priority .
All the items have their own priority and it�s important that you get the most value for the least cost .
It is all about understanding all the requirements .
This to understand
how important an item is
the difficulty of each item
the dependencies between items
The product owner needs to be able to explain the needs and requirements to the developer and must be able to give answers to their questions about details .
This does not mean that they need to know everything but a good product owner knows who knows .
The product owner needs to be able to make decisions on the spot if this is necessary .
And a product owner needs to take responsibility for these decisions .
The product owner should also give some fire and emotions to the team � to make them want to build the stuff !
The product owner should not prioritize the things he likes or which he can benefit from : a product owner must look at the whole picture and all stakeholders and be able to know which brings the most business value to the product .
Perhaps the biggest challenges in the Product Owner role just come from the fact that the many different interest and stakeholders are concentrated into a single role .
This is of course not impossible , but challenging !
If you are going to act as a product owner , prepare to be involved in conflicts .
There is a good chance you�ll be in the middle of lots of conflicts .
Try
Time box everything from meetings to sprints .
When people know the time frames , they most often work more effectively .
Enable that stakeholders can build an understanding of the general process .
Have an open product backlog .
Let stakeholders and team members have access to the current backlog so they can find out priorities for themselves .
This does not mean that people besides you should edit the product backlog but making the information available takes off the burden off information from you .
Have a product backlog which you keep updated .
That means that you should use a format and detail level which you can handle .
Having an open time or list for input to the product backlog .
Sometimes people don�t have time or the knowledge how to post a real change request , bug or something like that .
By answering any question within a week you get people to give input which can be very useful , you learn a lot and people get confident in you and the process when they feel that they are heard .
Estimation poker for business value .
Take the stakeholders and give them a list of items .
Let them set a value of the relative business value for each item .
Gives room for discussions and builds understanding for how planning poker works during time estimations .
Avoid
Thinking that you don�t have time for being involved in daily routines or skipping sprint review meetings or sprint starts .
If you don�t have the time , you are not the right person and someone else will make the decisions .
If the meeting time is up : call for another meeting and ask yourself why you couldn�t stick to the deadline
Not making time for real customers .
Take the time , but value it against the chance of missing out on important decisions in the team room .
This means that if a meeting with the customer is about how to solve an important need which can be accomplished by the product it�s all go .
But if the meeting is about general customer care , leave that to the sales people .
If your most important task is to participate in general customer meetings , the role should be casted with someone else .
If you have a lot of customer knowledge , you will be an important and powerful stakeholder .
You will probably have more of a saying if you leave the product owner role to someone else .
Reading just one book on Scrum and agile .
Different books have so different approach and perspective .
Skipping the product backlog .
Good product owners have product backlogs .
A product backlog is about having a clear and open strategy for the product .
Yes , the product backlog can change , but if you don�t have a product backlog you and others might not know when things change .
Having unclear rules for prioritization .
Don�t just let the guy with the highest salary get his stuff on top of the list but use business value and cost result in a priority
Skipping calculations of velocity .
If you don�t calculate velocity , you don�t know the speed and you cannot give estimations when a stakeholder can start to hope for a wanted feature .
By including estimations on an open product backlog and sharing the current velocity , you can avoid a lot of questions concerning " when will I get this " .

Confessions of a serial product owner , by Anna Forss
Should I be the Scrum master ?
Scrum master , that �s the Scrum term for project manager ?
Or is the Scrum master the most senior developer ?
The Scrum master is not the team member who does the most work .
It �s the person who can inspire everyone to do the right job .
It �s the person who can communicate to both team members and stakeholders .
As with the product owner , the communicative skills are crucial .
The Scrum master should also be the kind of person who has a good " feeling " for how the status is ; without having to look at dashboards and backlogs .
He should be able to know how things are going .
The Scrum master needs also to be a person who can say yes and no .
He is the person who takes responsibility when it comes to delivery and inspires the team to deliver expected value in the form of working software .
All team members should feel a sense of responsibility but the Scrum master is responsible .
A Scrum master should not see his role as full time : the best implemented Scrum needs the least of its Scrum master .
This means that the Scrum master will probably have to put in a lot of work in the beginning of a Scrum project but this should be a task with declining size .
A maximum of one hour a day should be spent and most of that time should be spent on communicating verbally .
Try
Leave the everyday leading to the team .
You don�t manage the team in your role as a product owner .
If you think people are doing the wrong stuff or stuff wrong , bring it up with the Scrum master .
Question if a Scrum master who after a couple of sprints work the tasks of a Scrum master .
Either this is not a good Scrum master or there are other issues which must be resolved in the team .
Pointing at the former project manager and without discussion deciding that this person is now the Scrum master .
Instead , read about the traits and select the most suitable person .
Avoid
Micro management .

Scrum from the trenches , by Henrik Kniberg
But this did not really answer my questions �
How do the Scrum master and the product owner work together ?
It is often said that the Scrum master role and the product owner role are so important .
How does the interaction between the Scrum master and product owner work ?
The best product owner and the best Scrum master both work for the same objective : to enable the team to deliver the most business value to the product and the users .
But the tools used are not the same .
The product owner represents the customer and makes sure that the team can get a feeling for what the users need .
To achieve this , the product owner keeps a product backlog and participates in daily work to be able to answer questions .
The Scrum master on his hand makes sure that the contract is kept .
He�s the speaking partner for the team but also keeps an eye on the progress so that the product increment really becomes delivered .
In the best implementation of Scrum , the product owner and the Scrum master have a big trust in each other .
And the trust is nurtured .
The Scrum master does not have to worry about the product owner having made his priorities or being part of the daily work .
The product owner does not have to worry about the team doing the right stuff or that impediments are not handled .
But the trust must also be in the other�s decision and recommendation .
If the Scrum master tells the product owner that a bug cannot be fixed during the sprint , the Scrum master must be trustworthy in that recommendation and the product owner must respect that statement .
The communication between the Scrum master and product owner can work as the glue which binds the business and the team together .
A big risk if the product owner and the Scrum master do not view their work as glue but as a wall : when they control the communication and / or hide things from the team or the business people .
This calls for an example .
Scenario A : A customer reports a bug .
The product owner talks to the Scrum master who says that the bug cannot be fixed in the sprint so it should be done in an upcoming sprint .
The product owner registers the bug on the product backlog , which is open for anyone to see .
A developer hears something about a bug and asks the product owner what it�s all about ( or checks in the product backlog ) .
The developer learns what there is to know about the bug .
The developer does not fix the bug .
Scenario B : A customer reports a bug .
The product owner talks to the Scrum master who says that the bug cannot be fixed in the sprint so it should be done in an upcoming sprint .
The product owner keeps the bug on his private list , so that it doesn�t become such an issue .
A developer hears about the bug but when he asks about it , the Scrum master says it�s no deal and that it�s nothing he should bother about now since it will be fixed later .
The developer does not fix the bug .
In none of the cases , the bug was fixed in the sprint , so what was the main difference ?
Scenario
A was built on trust , scenario B on mistrust .
What happens in a Scenario B environment is that the developers feel that they are not trusted with information .
And if they are not trusted with information , how can they be trusted with the code ?
It is one thing to force information down someone�s throat , another to make available .
Try
Trusting others
Avoid
Thinking that you can hide information .

The five disfunctions of a team , by Patrick Lencioni
Can I combine the Scrum master and product owner roles ?
I think that product owner and Scrum master seem to be the same thing and doesn�t it make it very complicated to assign different people ?
Can�t I just keep both roles and be in charge of everything ?
If you view these roles as roles , then they can be combined .
But it �s not for all to combine roles .
A person who combines roles needs to be able to make clear when he�s playing a certain role so that everyone else knows if it�s the product owner or the Scrum master who is talking .
There is also a risk when you combine the product owner role and the Scrum master role : you get a project manager who takes all responsibility and both think and is perceived as the " boss " .
It is good to take responsibility but this can lessen the others sense of responsibility .
To summarize , it�s best to keep the roles separate .
Try
Keep the roles separate .
Even if you are both Scrum master and team member , use some method for making clear when you have a specific role .
For example , have different e-mail addresses .
Avoid
Combined Scrum master and product owner .
Seeing the product owner and the Scrum master as the most powerful and having managers take these roles without them having the time or the right sentiment for the tasks .
Does Scrum mean that business people can�t talk directly to the developers ?
Doesn�t Scrum state that all communication goes to and from the team via the Scrum master and the product owner ?
Is that really effective ?
The product owner gathers and prioritizes the requirements from all the stakeholders .
The Scrum master protects and motivates the team to complete the tasks and by doing so , he has a close dialog with the product owner .
But this does not mean that team members should not communicate directly with stakeholders !
Encourage team members turning to real customers and users to get input .
You have a problem if the stakeholders turn directly to the developers and get their stuff fixed at the expense of other things .
If requirements are changed the product owner must make the final decision and the team should all be in on the changes .
The Scrum master is the team representative in these discussions and if he�s not up for a change , the rest of the team should not be involved .
If the Scrum master thinks it�s an issue worth bringing up to the team , he takes responsibility for the effect of the diversion .
Try
Make everyone involved ( stakeholders and team members ) understand that decisions concerning what should be accomplished are always made by product owner
Being a good example and put up everything on the product backlog .
If you cut corners for what is considered your items anyone can lose belief in the process .
Reevaluate the roles and how they work .
Have an open mind to all the roles .
Perhaps you are not the best product owner , even if you have all the traits needed ?
Avoid
Controlling communication .
You don�t want to stop the business people from talking to the developers .
Sticking roles to individuals .
See the roles as just roles .
The responsibility is individual but only when that person is casted in that role .
Things must work even if a person is on vacation or sick .
Have plans for these scenarios and let other take the role when this occurs .
Superman does not work on your team , or ?
If you get a problem with stakeholders " placing orders " directly to developers , talk to them and explain why this is sub optimizing .
Perhaps you need to change how input to the product backlog can be done and people feel that " this is the only way to get things done " .
How can I control the team members ?
How can I as the product owner contribute to making a team member a part of a successful team ?
The team members of a Scrum team should be able to take a high prioritized task from the sprint backlog and complete it .
He should ask for help when he gets stuck and reports on his progress .
A team member is active during formal and informal meetings so he keeps himself updated .
A team member focuses on the team result , not the individual result .
This means that he takes pride in his job but he�s even more pride of the team effort .
This means that he�s not the guy who just grabs the fun tasks and ignores helping others .
He the guy who drops his task if he�s working on a low priority task and someone is stuck on something with a higher priority .
To help a team member become this excellent team player and developer you need to be around and help him evolve .
This means less of micro management , and more leadership .
You need to educate the team member about the domain and give feedback .
Try
Get the team members to understand why you �re doing something .
Don�t just give statements : ask questions back .
If a team member asks if A or B is to be implemented , ask him what he thinks .
You might learn things that make you make a better decision .
You also learn about how he perceives the problem .
Ask the difficult questions too !
Don�t be afraid to ask how things are tested , what the code coverage is and how things are documented ?
Will this work with 200 users ?
If you don�t ask these questions and gives thumbs up just based on visual things on a screen , you �re saying that those things don�t matter .
Invite team members to meet with real users .
If a user comes and visit the plant , let the developers meet this person .
Set off just an hour to let the customer share his views and for the developers to ask questions .
This is often really appreciated .
Let the Scrum team decide on the sprint length .
Just state how often you expect a public release and let them decide if the time between public releases is divided into separate sprints
Avoid
Rewarding individual achievements over group achievements .
It �s very easy to give gratifications to an individual without considering the whole picture .
Ignoring when a team member does not meet the team criteria .
Yes , this is a team question , but you can have requirements on the team member achievements as well .
If someone�s lack of competence , interest or devotion cost you in lost velocity , bring it up with the Scrum master .
What if I �m really the only suitable product owner , but I don�t have the time to around all the time ?
But I don�t have the time to be with the developers !
I can perhaps squeeze in an hour every month .
But I know everything , so I better keep that product owner role and assign a proxy ?
A term often used in Scrum implementation is product owner proxy .
Most of the times
I�ve seen this is when the product owner is inactive and the Scrum master takes on his role as well and calls himself product owner proxy .
This is worthless .
A role is a personal responsibility and by saying someone is a proxy : who is responsible ?
In most cases this will result in no one feeling really responsible .
Think of a Broadway play .
When one of the actors is sick a replacement is called in .
Someone else plays the part .
Someone else is responsible for playing that role .
That �s not a proxy , that �s a replacement .
If a product owner is not part of the development , the product owner needs to be replaced .
A product owner needs to be around and needs to communicate with the team members and stakeholders .
A good product owner should of course have routines for involving managers and others so they are " in " on the priorities .
Someone always makes the decisions .
And chances are that whoever is present makes a decision , even if he�s not aware of it .
Try
Be available as much as you can .
Make the product owner tasks priority or skip the tasks .
Avoid
Thinking that YOU are the only one .
If you think that you can give the best input , is there someone else to whom you can channel this information but can make the daily decisions .
Having one point of failure in the product owner role .
If you get sick , someone needs to be able to work this part .
And product owners should also go on holidays .
I�m working in the enterprise , does Scrum really work here ?
When I read about Scrum there are always these small teams and products .
But we have 30 developers and a big product so then I should stay product owner and assign a number of proxies , or ?
In large software developments for large organizations , a single product owner may not be realistic .
Because a smooth flow in the Scrum process puts demands on the product owner to the readily available for detailed questions on the prioritized issues , a single person may not be able to be all this for a large system at once .
In this case it�s common to run multiple Scrum teams each concentrating on certain parts of the system , where a Chief Product Owner for some large organizations fills the role of being the single source of high - level prioritization and strategic decision making .
Your own organization�s size , decision - making culture and readiness for Scrum should guide you in choosing the right blend for you .
It is important to clarify where one product owner�s responsibility starts and ends in these situations .
One example is that the chief product owner is not responsible during implementation phases .
It can also be a good idea to have a separate title for the chief product owner .
Try
Discuss different solution for the scaling of product ownership and just not jump to one solution .
Example of a scaling of the product owner role in a company with an Office product suite including three application where each application has its own product owner , under each there are different product owners for the different features .
Observe that this can lead to very different solutions for tables in the different applications .
Example of a scaling of the product owner role in a company with an Office product suite including three programs where each feature has its own product owner and the lowest level is responsible for the implementation in a specific application .
This can lead to no one taking responsibility for one application
Am I part of the Scrum team ?
I�m the product owner , but does this make me part of the team or am I an outsider .
For example , should I talk during Daily Stand -ups ?
Why view the product owner as part of the team
Answering questions concerning the stories and requirements are part of the sprint and those tasks should be a part of the work .
If the product owner does not see himself as part of the team , he will not participate in team activities as daily Scrum , etc , and will therefore not be an active part of the daily life .
Which result in developers making decisions since the right person is not available to answer the questions .
Why not view the product owner as part of the team
To be able to make priorities , the product owner must be out with customers and users .
He therefore does not have time to be available on site and in the daily activities
If the product owner is there constantly , he will micro manage the developers
I 've not covered all the arguments in these views , but I think that this catches a bit of the problem : to be able to make the right decisions , the product owner must spend his time outside the team room but to make the decisions come true he must be on site so that the developers do n't make daily decisions which contradicts the objectives .
So , how do I think you should solve this ?
For myself , I solve the problem with sore arms .
What ?
Well , we have three floors and on each floor we have these heavy doors .
So , I try to move between the floors as much as I possibly can during the day .
I come to the developer 's room every day , to chat , to look on progress and if it 's possible : I try to help out with whatever I can .
It can be arranging a meeting with a technical guru from a supplier ; it can be testing , fixing with the Scrum dashboard or just hang out with the guys .
I want the Scrum team to view me as part of the crew .
A part of the Scrum team .
And it 's the same with our users and customers : I try to take part of their everyday activities .
Just listen in on their discussions , frustration and happiness .
To help out in their daily work when it 's possible .
Help out with small tasks , find out what is possible to accomplish , formulate a change request or something like that .
To make the business people understand that I 'm part of their team as well .
And what a joy it is to transfer experiences between these groups !
How rewarding it is for a developer to learn that Robert can work more effective now with the new release .
And how rewarding it is for a user to hear that Lisa could fix that problem so easily thanks to that really good formulated change request .
So , my answer to the question is yes and no .
You should as a product owner have the mindset that you 're always part of the team .
But you work on all the teams .
So , what do I cut ?
I try to work my own product backlog and try to do what brings the most business value to the product : in this case my work .
Which means that what is most often cut is those long off site meetings which are probably very nice but which in reality brings very little value to my actual work .
Which is to make sure that we do the right stuff in our projects .
This can also mean that I do n't participate in whole meetings .
People do n't have a problem if I from the beginning say that I actually do n't have the time but I can be there for 30 minutes or an hour .
OK , I probably miss out a lot of nice trips and lunches but what is that really worth .
Really ?
Try
Take on items on the product backlog .
Avoid
Take on items on the backlog and don�t fix them .
What happened to the project manager ?
But I�m the project manager , what happens to me ?
What are the objectives of a project manager and which ones of these tasks bring real value to the people , the process and the product ?
If you read this article and other texts about Scrum , you can see that a lot of the tasks are divided between the Scrum master and the product owner .
Some of the tasks are removed all together and some are handed over to the team .
A project manager can be an excellent product owner or the best of Scrum masters .
But a project manager can also be a terrible product owner or a lousy Scrum master .
In other words , don�t move the project manager over to one of these roles without considering if this is the best solution .
Look at the person�s traits and the traits of the roles .
If you have a match , go ahead .
If they don�t , choose another solution .
An indication if someone is not suitable at all is if they want to combine Scrum master and product owner or if they feel like their task is to " have control " .
Scrum is trust based , not control based .
Sometimes you need more of the traditional project manager skills .
This is most common in an enterprise environment where there are a lot of Scrum teams which are interdependent .
A project manager can be the Scrum master of the scrums of Scrum .
But this is a tricky position and should be held by a seasoned Scrum master .
The Scrum master of the scrums of scrums should not be the one lacking an understanding of Scrum principles but the one who embraces these and can combine this with an enterprise perspective .
Try
To delete the project manager�s role from the organizational chart
Use Scrum of scrums in an enterprise environment .
This calls for more traits than the ordinary Scrum master .
Avoid
Placing the project manager by default as Scrum master or product owner
Placing the project manager who does not embrace the Scrum principles as Scrum master for Scrum of scrums .
Conclusions
Be a good guy .
Have fun , empower others and help in making your team the most successful .
And go home when the normal office day is over .

Creationists Say Science and Bible Disprove ' Ardi ' Fossil Is Evidence of Evolution Discovery of 4.4 million - year - old fossil does not shake creationists ' faith .
Oct. 7 , 2009  --
Sometimes an ape is a 4.4 million - year - old fossil that sheds light on the evolutionary origins of human beings , and sometimes … an ape is just an ape .
In the case of " Ardi , " the ape - like fossil recently discovered in Ethiopia and already being celebrated as the oldest found relative of modern human beings , the final determination depends on who is doing the talking .
In one camp are evolutionary scientists who last week published and hailed the discovery of an upright walking ape named Ardipithecus ramidus , or " Ardi " for short , who made Ethiopia her home nearly 5 million years ago .
But despite the excitement from the paleontology community , another group of researchers , many of them with advanced degrees in science , are unimpressed by Ardi , who they believe is just another ape -- an ape of indeterminate age , they add , and an ape who can not be an ancestor of modern man for a range of reasons , including one of singular importance :
God created man in one day , and evolution is a fallacy .
" What creationists believe about human origins we get from the Bible , " said David Menton an acclaimed anatomist and also a creationist .
" The creation of the world takes place on page one of the Bible .
If you throw out the first page of the Bible you might as well throw out the whole thing .
If you can't live with the first page then pitch out the remaining thousand pages . "
And so for creationists , this latest piece in the puzzle of human evolution is just more bunk , Godless claptrap wrapped in the language of science and all too conveniently rolled out on the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth and the 150th anniversary of his seminal work " On the Origin of Species . "
" In ' The Year of Darwin , ' this is a concerted campaign to capture the public mindset and say the ' jury is out ' and relegate the Christian view to the trash bin , " said Gary Bates , CEO of Creation Ministries International .
In a deluge of Web postings , articles and lectures , creationists have -- with scientific language and precision -- set out to debunk the importance of Ardi and have collectively asked , " What 's the big deal ? "
" This is not the latest and greatest discovery .
We have a different interpretation of the facts , and that is that Genesis is the real view of the creation of man .
There is nothing Christians need to worry about , " Bates said .
Creationists Aim to Debunk Ardi
" This is a meaningless discovery of another ape .
As far as the creationist community is concerned , this is a big yawn .
There is nothing about Ardi that has anything to do with the evolution of man , " said John Morris , president of the Institute for Creation Research in Dallas .
That 's a tone significantly different than the one C. Owen Lovejoy , an anthropologist at Kent State University in Ohio , struck in a recent interview with ABCNews.com , when he called Ardi perhaps " the most important specimen in the history of evolutionary biology . "
For Morris and other creationists , the approach to handling new discoveries like Ardi by evolutionary scientists is twofold : fight the science and promote the Bible .
" People are talking about Ardi .
It 's all over the news , so we have to explain it and answer people 's questions .
We 're not making a theological argument , but a scientific one .
The science of evolution is so flawed we have to be opposed to it , " Morris said .
The response to Ardi opens the door on a decades - long shift in the way creationists fight evolution in schools , universities and occasionally the courts .
Nearly a dozen states allow for the teaching for " intelligent design " in public elementary and high schools , or otherwise require teachers to explain evolution as a still unproven theory .
Creationists have written books about complex organisms and natural processes like photosynthesis to argue that only a designer 's work , and not the chance inherent in evolution , could result in the Earth 's natural diversity .
In 2007 , Answers in Genesis , better known as the Creation Museum , opened in Kentucky giving creationists a place to promote their understanding of the world through exhibits that depict the Biblical flood and men living with dinosaurs .
Menton , an anatomy professor for 20 years at Washington University School of Medicine , is a researcher in residence at Answers in Genesis and has made a new career out of picking apart evolutionary discoveries .
Direct Ancestor , But Not a ' Missing Link '
The scientists who have spent the past decade pouring over Ardi 's fragmented skeleton believe she walked upright and that her teeth resemble modern human teeth more closely than they do those of a chimpanzee .
Though they do not believe Ardi is a direct ancestor of humans or the long - sought " missing link , " paleontologists say she helps show that both human beings and apes evolved from a common ancestor about 6 million years ago , that did not look much like either .
Ardi , paleontologists say , was capable of grasping , something chimps need in order to climb in trees , but likely did not swing from branches the way modern chimps do .
For Menton , all the fragments indicate is that Ardi is an ape , plain and simple -- and not anywhere nearly as old as scientists would have you believe .
" This is just a pea and shell game .
Is it a human ancestor , or is n't it ? " asked Menton .
Menton believes scientists sat on the Ardi discovery for over a decade just to roll it out during the Darwin anniversary .
He questions the ability to accurately date any fossils more than a few thousand years old , let alone millions , and he said the condition of the skeleton was so incomplete and fragile that serious research was almost impossible .
Menton said Ardi's skull and feet are exactly the kind of skull and feet you would expect an ape to have and have none of the features of modern humans .
" Evolutionists want to call Ardi ' ape - like . '
This creature is ape - like , because she is an ape .
Just call it an ape , " he said .
The biggest problem Menton has with Ardi is her estimated age .
The Earth , he says , is no more around 5,000 years old , a number creationists have estimated by counting the generations of man named in the Bible from Adam to Jesus .
" Evolution is supposedly based on science , but the science does not prove what they want it to .
Creationism is not based on scientific observation but on God 's word .
God created everything in six days , and that 's it . "

What it is
Bullard TacSight SE35 Thermal Imager
Who uses it
Police officers and crime scene investigators
Those old night - vision goggles ?
Kid stuff .
All they do is amplify low light .
If you really want to see things , grab this handheld thermal - imaging camera , which can spot a person in absolute darkness at 1,000 feet or reveal hidden objects in the light of day .
Its sensor 's amorphous silicon pixels respond to infrared radiation , showing differences in surface temperature down to half a degree centigrade .
The 3.5 - pound TacSight is also rugged , waterproof , and portable ( early military versions had a cumbersome cooling system ) .
Police generally use it for spotting perps and evidence : A gun tossed into the woods , for example , shows up when the metal absorbs solar energy .
But the $ 15,000 cam has proved handy for tracking , too .
When someone stole a front - end loader in Cheney , Kentucky , last year , a quick - thinking sergeant trained the TacSight on the roadway .
" I saw their tracks , " the officer said , " as if God himself had painted arrows on the roadway . "
Amen .
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The Cleveland Browns contacted the FBI about possible threats to former Browns wide receiver Braylon Edwards , an FBI official said Saturday morning .
The threats followed the incident earlier this month when Edwards was accused of punching a man outside a downtown nightclub .
Edwards was traded to the New York Jets a few days later .
The altercation prompted the Browns organization to call the Cleveland FBI , Special Agent Scott Wilson said .
" They were concerned regarding that incident , " Wilson said .
" We had some conversations with the Browns about possible threats . "
There is no investigation into the threats , Wilson said .
No charges have been filed in the scuffle .
Witnesses told police Edwards punched entertainment promoter Edward Givens outside the View Ultralounge & Nightclub on Prospect Avenue .
Givens is a friend of Cavs forward LeBron James .
The incident prompted James to say Edwards is jealous of the basketball superstar .
All skeptics have heard this from someone at some point in a debate : “ You need to be more open - minded ” or “ You ’re too closed - minded ” .
This is presented as though it is actually a valid argument .
In reality it just shows they have run out of arguments .
They hide behind it to disguise the complete lack of any rational reason for you to accept what they are telling you .
It 's the last resort of someone who has nothing – if they had evidence they would obviously present it .
Even so , it can seem compelling , since calling someone closed - minded is pejorative .
But it ’s fallacious rhetoric : doubting something is not necessarily closed minded .
In fact , the closed minded ones are the believers who insist some fantastic story is true despite a complete lack of evidence to support it .
They are too closed minded to accept that their fantasy might be false .
An open mind is …
Here ’s the thing .
An open mind is open to all ideas , but it must be open to the possibility that the idea could be true or false .
It is not closed - minded to reject claims that make no sense .
If you ca n’t accept the possibility that an idea might be false , then you are the closed minded one .
An open minded person will critically examine all claims but will not accept them if there is no reason to believe they are true or if there is reason to believe they are false .
To do so would be fallacious .
And credulous .
The real problem
The “ have an open mind ” crowd are more than just logically wrong .
Their way of thinking is actually destructive to good ideas .
Bad ideas should be discarded - by weeding out bad ideas the good can flourish .
An earlier version of this argument would have gone , “ You ’re closed - minded in saying that humors do n’t exist ” to justify bloodletting .
But by focusing uncritically on bloodletting , germ theory would never have been discovered .
Germ theory was discovered by skeptical scientists who insisted on evidence , not by new - agers with open minds .
If you accept something when there is no reason to believe it is true you are just credulous .
And if you will not reject something when there is no reason to believe in it then you are in freefall – you will believe in anything .
This way of thinking is a complete dead end .
Or to put it another way , do n’t be so open minded that your brains fall out .
That ’s better – my mind is now completely open !

1. “ Ça plane pour moi ” ( French slang , “ This works for me ” ) : Plastic Bertrand , “ Ça Plane Pour Moi ”
Plastic Bertrand ’s 1977 hit “ Ça Plane Pour Moi ” is almost certainly the only instance of a song cut in English that then became a bigger hit recorded in French .
It followed an odd path from one language to another , beginning life as the 1977 Elton Motello song “ Jet Boy , Jet Girl . ”
That song ’s frank , homoerotic lyric about sadomasochistic underage sex pretty much assured it would n’t get much radio play —
“ I ’d like to hit him on the head until he ’s dead / the sight of blood is such a high / Oooooo , he gives me head ” etc . — but the beat would n’t be denied .
“ Using the same musicians , Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand re-recorded it as “ Ça Plane Pour Moi ” with largely nonsensical French lyrics about whiskey - drinking cats and a divan king .
Both versions enjoyed second lives : “ Jet Boy , Jet Girl ” found its way into The Damned ’s songbook , while Plastic Bertrand ’s version became a staple on ’ 80s hits collections , providing a classic “ Aha ! ” moment for French 101 students .
2. “ Qu’est - ce que c’est ? ” ( French , “ What is it ? ” ) : Talking Heads , “ Psycho Killer ”
Speaking of rock lyrics that double as French 101 lessons , Talking Heads enjoyed a breakthrough song with this 1977 track that spreads alienation across two languages .
David Byrne assumes the persona of a troubled guy who hates people when they are n’t polite , and saves his blunt expressions of confusion for French .
Whichever language he ’s speaking , the guy ’s clearly messed up .
Better run run run , run run run away .
3 . “ Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ( ce soir ) ? ” ( French , “ Would you like to sleep with me ( tonight ) ? ” ) : Labelle , “ Lady Marmalade ”
Disco is pretty unreservedly about getting it on , but this 1974 hit for Labelle ( and later Christina Aguilera and friends ) is more brazen than most .
But really , should a song about a New Orleans prostitute “ struttin ’ her stuff on the street ” and inviting a john into her bed bother with subtlety ?
Still , why does she hit him up in French ?
Because as the song makes clear , the girl who asks “ You wanna give it a go ? ” is Creole Lady Marmalade .
4. “ Hakuna Matata ” ( Swahili , “ No worries ” ) : The Lion King , “ Hakuna Matata ”
As the lyrics tell us , “ Hakuna Matata , ” both the song and the saying , “ ai n’t no passing craze ” :
It ’s still popping up in pop culture and everyday conversation 15 years after The Lion King hit theaters .
A standout of one of the last Disney animation soundtracks to break into the public consciousness — and the last to hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart — “ Hakuna Matata ” heavily incorporates the Swahili phrase into a catchy , comedic tune sung by a talkative meerkat ( Nathan Lane ) and a flatulent warthog ( Ernie Sabella ) .
The Lion King ’s Elton John / Tim Rice - helmed soundtrack incorporates other instances of the Swahili language — which the hit Broadway musical that followed in 1997 did to an even greater degree — but none stuck quite like “ Hakuna Matata , ” since the translation is right there in the chorus and it ’s so damn fun to say .
In fact , it begs kids everywhere to repeat it ad nauseum .
5 . “ Yo no soy marinero , soy capitan ” ( Spanish , “ I ’m not a sailor , I ’m a captain ” ) : Richie Valens , “ La Bamba ”
A straight - up translation of the lyrics of Richie Valens ’ much - covered Spanish - language hit “ La Bamba ” makes it sound like just another one of those “ how to do the latest dance ” songs : “ To dance La Bamba , you need a little grace / a little grace for me , for you / Higher , higher … ”
Who knew it had a complicated backstory as a traditional Mexican wedding folksong ?
While Richie Valens codified some simple verses and added a rock beat , “ La Bamba ” was traditionally a mariachi song with improvised - on - the - spot lyrics , which probably do n’t normally make much more sense than Valens ’ version ; the song is really just about providing a fast , repetitive beat for an increasingly complicated rhythmic dance .
Oh , and boasting a little — “ bambollero ” ( “ flashy ” ) is slang for a braggart , which partially explains the line “ I ’m not a sailor , I ’m the captain ! ”
Which the song helpfully repeats over and over , as if it was a Spanish 101 lesson .
6 . “ Bon soir , regret , à demain ” ( French , “ Good evening , regret , at tomorrow ” ) : Fugazi , “ Do You Like Me ”
The military - industrial complex and unrequited love are ominously correlated in “ Do You Like Me , ” the high point of Fugazi ’s 1995 album Red Medicine .
And while Fugazi ’s knack for being cryptically poetic is in full force , things are made extra confusing by the line “ Bon soir , regret , à demain ” — a phrase that , when translated into English , sounds like gibberish .
Just to make it nicely ironic , Guy Picciotto instructs listeners to “ Say like the French say ! ” right before delivering this mouthful of mangled français .
According to a friend of The A.V. Club who is French and a Fugazi fan , Picciotto “ probably meant to say something like ‘ Good night , sorry , see you tomorrow . ’
But that is really shitty French . ”
7. “ Domo arigato ” ( Japanese , “ Thank you very much ” ) : Styx , “ Mr. Roboto ”
How do you properly express your gratitude to the robot laborer whose hollowed - out shell you just used to escape from rock ’ n ’ roll misfit prison ?
With a lot of heavy - handed statements about the dehumanizing influence of technology , of course .
But you should also do it in Japanese , because “ domo arigato ” rhymes perfectly with “ Mr. Roboto ” ; otherwise , you ’d have to name the mechanical janitors sweeping up your fascistic dystopia “ Mr. SpankYou ” or something , which would just be silly .
While Styx ’s overwrought concept album Kilroy Is Here failed to ignite the great Luddite revolution of the latter 20th century , its most famous single did change the world in one significant way : by giving every American a go - to condescending rejoinder to any Japanese phrase they hear .
8. “ Combien , combien , combien de temps , ” ( French , “ How long ? ” ) : R.E.M. , “ Talk About The Passion ”
Fans of R.E.M.’s early albums were practically forced to make up their own lyrics , since Michael Stipe tended to murmur ( allusion intended ) his words , which were oblique to begin with .
( For many years , he also refused to share what he was actually singing , via printed lyrics . )
What sounds a little bit like “ Pull me in to talk ” on 1983 ’s “ Talk About The Passion ” actually turned out to be “ Combien de temps , ” which translates as “ How long ? ” or “ How much time ? ”
If you watch the video , which depicts homeless people and ends with a statement about the cost of an American warship , it ’s easy to extrapolate his question to something like , “ How long will we let this suffering continue while we waste our money on war ? ”
Food for thought , to be sure , but the song also taught R.E.M. fans a great phrase to use while impatiently tapping their watches in France .
9 . “ Eep opp ork ah - ah ” ( Martian , “ I love you ” ) : Jet Screamer , “ Eep Opp Ork Ah - Ah ”
In an early episode of The Jetsons , Judy has a crush on pop singer Jet Screamer .
In order to get close to him , she enters a songwriting contest , but her pop-music - hating father George Jetson tries to sabotage her by replacing her entry with her brother Elroy ’s “ Martian talk , ” a gibberish code he uses to pass secret messages to his friends .
Her entry wins the contest ; cue George making mildly - relevant - at - the - time cracks about that horrible , crazy rock music .
Surprisingly , the song also became a minor hit , and from there , a cultural obscurity that generations of kids raised on cartoons could toss out over 2 a.m. bong sessions .
More than 30 years later , the Violent Femmes recorded a rollicking cover of “ Eep Opp Ork Ah - Ah ” for the Saturday Morning Cartoons tribute album , making it the world ’s first multi-generational Martian - language rockabilly hit .
( Incidentally , while the song translates the title phrase as “ I love you , ” Elroy — who apparently was n’t declaring his forbidden passion for his school buddies — insists that it just means “ meet me tonight . ”
Possibly for forbidden passion . )

10 . “ Quien es esa niña ? ” ( Spanish , “ Who ’s that girl ? ” )
Madonna , “ Who ’s That Girl ”
Madonna taught the world plenty of lessons , most of them about sex and strange accents , but she also offered quickie Spanish lessons on occasion .
The most direct is from “ Who ’s That Girl , ” whose chorus plays out like a Rosetta Stone instructional tape : “ Quien es esa niña ? ” she asks en Español , then repeats herself in English , “ Who ’s that girl ? ”
Those interested in a second semester can continue to the song ’s next line , “ Señorita mas fina , ” which is n’t followed by a translation .
( It means , roughly , “ the finest lady . ” )
If that ’s too tough , though , check out “ La Isla Bonita , ” which sounds way cooler in Spanish than it does in English .
11 . “ Neunundneunzig luftballons ” ( German , “ 99 balloons ” ) , Nena , “ 99 luftballons ”
German outfit Nena scored a worldwide smash with “ 99 Luftballons , ” inadvertently teaching non-Germans the wrong lesson : Ethnocentrist English speakers wrongly assumed that “ luftballon ” translated as “ red balloon , ” when in fact it simply means “ balloon . ”
( The original German - language version does n’t mention the word “ red ” at all ; it was added to make the English cadence work . )
But because so many people made their own translation leap , word quickly got out that it was wrong .
And now , 20 years later , American tourists can go into any German restaurant and order a balloon , but they ca n’t specify the color .
12 . “ Que será , será ” ( Spanish and / or Portugese , “ Whatever will be , will be ” ) : Doris Day , “ Que Sera , Sera ( Whatever Will Be , Will Be ) ”
Back in 1956 , this monster hit for Doris Day — who sang it in Alfred Hitchcock ’s remake of his own The Man Who Knew Too Much — was big enough to win a Best Original Song Oscar for lyricist Jay Livingston .
His fatalistic but cheery little number hit number two on the charts , became Day ’s unofficial theme song , and taught a whole generation the meaning of a foreign phrase .
The only trouble is , most of the people who made it a hit did n’t know what language it ’s from — and neither did Livingston .
He ’d heard the phrase a few years before in The Barefoot Contessa ( though it dated to centuries before , even appearing in Marlowe ’s Doctor Faustus ) ; but he mistook it for Latin , when it ’s really Spanish , or , if you prefer , Portuguese , at least the way Livingston spelled it .
The title proved to be prophetic , though ; regardless of its accuracy , it became a classic and a big hit in a dozen foreign countries .
13 . “ Jeux sans frontières ” ( “ Games without frontiers ” ) : Peter Gabriel , “ Games Without Frontiers ” )
From the ’60s through the end of the ’90s , Jeux Sans Frontières was a popular European TV game show that pitted a variety of countries against each other in ridiculous contests involving ridiculous costumes .
( It ’s well worth checking out the clips on YouTube — they feature , for instance , people dressed as penguins trying to fill and transfer buckets of water while running on a rapidly rotating stage , or women in frilly frocks trying to plant gigantic faux flowers while being chased by a giant Frankenstein .
The announcers can barely stop laughing long enough for color commentary . )
Peter Gabriel ’s first Top 10 UK hit repeatedly evoked the title of the show — and its British spin - off , It ’s A Knockout — while evoking their ideals , the idea of countries coming together for competition without pain , “ war without tears . ”
Granted , Kate Bush warbling “ jeux sans frontières ” over and over in the background really sounds like she ’s singing “ She ’s so popular , ” or possibly “ She ’s so fucking large ” ; it ’s one of the most commonly misinterpreted lyrics on the Internet .
Gabriel maybe takes the whole thing a bit too seriously ; his morose video , which heavily features his maniacal leering , footage of weapon testing , and war scenes , could really use more Jeux Sans Frontières contestants stumbling through an obstacle course while dressed as gigantic Russian nesting dolls .
14 . “ Quando , quando , quando ? ” ( Italian , “ When , when , when ? ” ) : Englebert Humperdinck , “ Quando , Quando , Quando ”
Penned in 1961 by Italian pop singer Tony Renis , this bouncy little longing - for - love number got translated to English a year later by Pat Boone , who was the first person but not the last to make it a hit in America .
The most famous version is by crooner Englebert Humperdinck , who , like Boone , retained only the longing chorus in the original language .
While it went on to be a hit for everyone from Nelly Furtado to Michael Bublé , and in every country from Australia to Vietnam , two of the most memorable uses of “ Quando , Quando , Quando ” appear in popular movies :
The gold - suited Murph And The Magic - Tones sing a cheeseball lounge version ( with all the lyrics in Italian ! ) in The Blues Brothers , and in Stripes , Bill Murray belts it out to save his skin .
Ah , the healing power of music .
15 . “ Ich liebe dich nicht , du liebst mich nicht ” ( German , “ I do n’t love you , you do n’t love me ” ) : Trio , “ Da Da Da ”
No , the title ( which , technically , is the ridiculously overlong “ Da Da Da I Do n’t Love You You Do n’t Love Me Aha Aha Aha ” ) does n’t mean “ yes yes yes ” in Russian .
Well , it does , but the authors — a moderately popular German minimalist rock outfit called Trio — intended it only as a bit of nonsense vocalization .
The hook of the mixed German / English lyrics is the “ Ich liebe dich nicht , du liebst mich nicht ” bit , which nicely mirror the blasé , almost whimsical lost - love narrative and helped turn the song into an extremely unlikely hit .
The song became a huge success in America in 1982 , and spread across the world by 1983 — just in time for Trio to break up in 1984 .
The band is long gone , but the cynical lyrics and unforgettable hook live on in commercials and the collections of ’ 80s nostalgia hounds .
16 . “ Soy un perdedor ” ( Spanish , “ I ’m a loser ” ) : Beck , “ Loser ”
Beck ’s first big hit was a song filled with nonsense lyrics , typically jumbled surrealistic nonsense that developed from his freestyling gibberish in front of café crowds .
But the chorus , with its wicked sliding guitar hook and its memorable vocal ( “ Soy un perdedor / I ’m a loser , baby , so why do n’t you kill me ? ” ) perfectly captured the self - loathing slacker vibe of 1993 and turned its author into a star .
It also taught a generation of Anglo hipsters how to be self - deprecating while traveling south of the border .
The mixture of the bizarre Spanish mope , the bluesy guitar riff , and the solid hip - hop beat became the archetype for the crazed eclecticism of Beck ’s early period ; even “ Weird Al ” Yankovic knew “ Loser ” was a winner and led off his 1996 “ Alternative Polka ” with a parody version of it .
17 . “ Yo te quiera infinito , yo te queira , oh mi corazón ” ( Spanish , “ I want you forever , I want you , oh my heart ” ) : The Clash , “ Spanish Bombs ”
This track , a celebration of the struggle against Franco in the Spanish Civil War from the legendary London Calling album , is usually translated badly , but do n’t blame the transcribers : Joe Strummer ’s thick working - class British accent rendered the Spanish lyrics nearly incomprehensible .
A similar problem turns up in the band ’s biggest hit , “ Should I Stay Or Should I Go ” : Strummer ’s accent is so heavy that it takes a lot of listeners many spins to realize that the call - and - response in the second verse is actually him translating the English lyrics into Spanish ( “ ¿ Me debo ir o que dame ? ” ) .
The same problem crops up in the Pogues ’ 1988 single “ Fiesta , ” whose last verse — a drunken narrative about the marriage of former bassist Cait O’Riordan and Elvis Costello — is scuttled by the difficulty of making out the Spanish through Shane MacGowan ’s Anglo - Irish accent .
It does n’t help that some of the “ Spanish ” is actually Italian , either .
18 . “ Jai guru deva om ” ( Sanskrit , “ Hail to the divine teacher ” ) : The Beatles , “ Across The Universe ”
The Beatles absconded to India in early 1968 to study transcendental meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a time when they badly needed stability : Manager Brian Epstein had recently died , and the Liverpool quartet wanted clarity and focus .
While the short trip obviously influenced the group deeply by widening their sonic palette to include even more sitar , there was also a bigger , more philosophical impact on the band .
Though John Lennon later penned “ Sexy Sadie ” out of anger over the Maharishi ’s alleged flirting with female members of his workshops , his teachings stuck :
The above Sanskrit mantra kicks off the chorus in “ Across The Universe , ” a soothing , climbing moment breaking up the sigh - inducing sadness in the verses .
19 .
“ Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble ” ( French , “ These are words that go together well ” ) : The Beatles , “ Michelle ”
Sanskrit was n’t the only language The Beatles co-opted for a hit .
Paul McCartney breaks into French throughout “ Michelle ” to express his love in the only French words he knows .
Curiously enough , that ’s the simple “ Michelle , my beauty ” and then the more complicated phrase above .
But it scarcely matters :
At heart the song hopes that love and music can find ways to transcend language and all the divisions that come with it .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif .
 GPS navigation devices were the latest must - have tech toys just two years ago , and shares of device makers like Garmin and TomTom were soaring .
That did n’t last long .
In a turnabout that has been remarkably swift even for the fast - moving technology business , those companies have suffered as competition has pulled down prices  and as more people have turned to their cellphones for directions .
In the latest blow to the business , Google announced a free navigation service for mobile phones on Wednesday that will offer turn - by - turn directions , live traffic updates and the ability to recognize voice commands .
The service will initially be available on only one phone , the new Motorola Droid , but will be expanded to more phones soon .
In a briefing on Tuesday in advance of its announcement , Google said that the service might be supported by advertisements in the future .
That would make driving directions the latest form of information to shift from being a paid service to one that is ad - supported .
Following in the footsteps of California and other jurisdictions , the government in Ontario have passed a bill that effectively bans the use of mobile phones in the Canadian province .
You ’ll still be able to yak it up on the subway or while sitting in the office , of course , but Bill 118 prevents the use of handheld communication devices while driving .
As far as I can recall , studies have shown that cell phone use accounts for about the same number of auto accidents as drugs or alcohol .
When you are gossiping on the phone with a buddy , you have at least one hand off of the wheel and your attention is being distracted away from the road .
What I find strange is that so many of these bills only ban the use of handheld electronics .
This means that you can still use your mobile phone while driving , so long as you use a handsfree device like a Bluetooth headset .
You ’re still distracted from the task at hand and you could still get into an accident as a result .
Bill 118 is a step toward greater safety on the roads , but some people may ask if it goes far enough .
In addition to regular cell phones and smartphones , Bill 118 also applies to all kinds of hand - held communication and entertainment devices .
Based on this wording , it would also mean that you ca n’t fumble through your iPod playlist while behind the wheel either .
If you have an iPod integration kit and you adjust the tunes through your car stereo , that does appear to be okay .
Loophole much ?
Great idea here for a novel product .
A Shinkansen Zero case for the iPhone or iTouch .
They also had some versions of this for Chuo Line and I think Keihin Tohoku Line .
I could n’t see any for the Yamanote Line on display .
Anyone bought one of these ?

Nothing gets the NASA boys fired up quite like a rocket launch .
The Ares I - X rocket , a modified prototype of the Ares I rocket that may send humans back to the moon , and the 2.6 million pounds of thrust it put out , sent the engineers at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral into paroxysms of joy .
" You all did frickin ' fantastic , " said Ed Mango , the new launch director for Constellation at Kennedy , shortly before having his tie cut just above the navel by the director of Kennedy , Bill Parsons Robert Cabana .
The tie -cutting is an old tradition borrowed from the Air Force — and it matched the back - to - the - future mood of the event perfectly .
All the giddiness comes at an odd time for Ares I , and the Constellation program of which it 's a part .
An Obama - requested review of NASA 's plans for human spaceflight wrapped up its work last week with a thumbs - down for the Ares I .
" I got tears in my eyes .
All the naysayers ... " said Parsons , before breaking off and continuing along a more positive line .
" That was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I 've ever seen . "
The NASA engineers are also looking to get some real data from the 700 sensors aboard the vehicles to test their models of how the new rocket is supposed to behave .
" The most valuable learning is through experience and observation , " said Bob Ess , Ares I - X mission manager , in a release .
" Tests such as this — from paper to flight — are vital in gaining a deeper understanding of the vehicle , from design to development . "

After publicly doubting recovery all through the summer and early fall , the housing bears are definitely getting their moment , after two key numbers ( mortgages and starts ) came in particularly weak yesterday .
Today the WSJ adds some further evidence that the much - feared " double dip " is happening .
On Wednesday Pulte Homes Inc. , the nation 's largest home builder , warned investors of a grim outlook .
" As we look out to 2010 , we are expecting difficult conditions to continue , " said chief executive Richard Dugas .
Meanwhile , more Americans who bought homes during the boom are falling into mortgage limbo .
About 3.4 % of U.S. households -- or about 1.9 million homeowners -- are 120 days or more overdue on their payments , but not yet in foreclosure , according to LPS Applied Analytics , a research firm in Denver .
That is up from 1.5 % a year earlier .
Many of these people are likely to lose their homes over the next few years .
That means more bank - owned homes will hit a market already suffering from oversupply .
The housing - supply picture is tricky to read .
The number of homes listed for sale was 3.63 million in September , down 15 % from a year earlier , according to the National Association of Realtors .
That is enough to last about eight months at the current rate of sales .
Anything above about six months is considered a buyer 's market , in which prices may come under downward pressure .
Read the whole thing >
After yesterday 's bad mortgage number , there was some talk to the effect of " Well , maybe this was a temporary lull , in light of the fact that people were n't 100 % sure the tax credit would be extended . "
This may make a little sense , except that what it means is that without the tax credit , the market is TERRIBLE .
So that 's hardly a " bull " case .

This is a book about leadership .
This is not an easy topic to discuss in a book , but this one gives you some tools that will help you to assess situations and act on them .
I think that the authors give a very good definition of leadership when they explain their title : “ Standing back does not imply abdicating all responsibility , but rather requires leaders to perform a careful balancing act between stepping back to let the right people in the organization do their thing and stepping up to provide steering when the team has strayed off course ” .
The deliver part exists because the most important measure of success is defined as delivering value to the business .
The first chapter presents the key principles that will be discussed in the book : Purpose – Collaborate – Delivery – Decisions .
The chapter about purpose presents a model that allows classifying activities or businesses function according to their market differentiation and mission critical dimensions .
The chapter on collaboration emphasizes the importance of letting the people succeed .
In the delivery part , the authors propose a model to assess projects using their uncertainty and complexity dimensions .
The next chapter exposes ideas on how and when to make decisions .
After discussing all these principles , the authors offer you some hints on how to start putting them in practice to change your organization .
Finally , a last chapter offers a short summary of all the tools and models discussed in the book .
All the concepts are supported by many cases that show how the issues and ideas discussed relate to practical situations .
Despite grouping material from four different authors , this book has a good cohesion and provides a very smooth reading experience .
It is certainly recommended to everyone that has to solve business problems through projects in organizations .
Reading it , I was even thinking that it contains a lot of very good material that you can apply to your own personal development and projects .

My friend Kototama and I are both learning functional languages , and exchanging / comparing code for some classical algorithms .
The last to date is an insertion in a binary search tree ( BST ) .
The most intuitive algorithm is recursive , but not tail - recursive .
One cannot assume a BST to be balanced , and it behaves as a simply linked list in the worst case .
Having a tail - recursive algorithm will guarantee the insertion , even in a very deep tree .
Example of tail recursion
The data structure is quite simple : A BST containing elements of type a is either an empty leaf ( Nil ) or a Node with 3 items : an element of type a ( elt ) , and 2 sub - nodes which are BSTs containing as : l for left and r for right .
data Bst a = Nil | Node {
elt :: a ,
l :: Bst a ,
r :: Bst a} deriving Show
Intuitive algorithm
insert_ntr Nil x = Node x Nil Nil
insert_ntr n x | x < elt n = n {l = insert_ntr ( l n ) x}
insert_ntr n x | x > elt n = n {r = insert_ntr ( r n ) x}
insert_ntr n x | otherwise = n
The second line tells us that inserting x in n if x < n is the same node n with its left branch equal to the insertion of x in the left of n .
Let ’s take the numbers 4,3,1,2 and insert them in a BST of integers , with a root equal to Nil .
insert Nil 4 → this gives us a new root insert ( Node 4 Nil Nil ) 3 → this inserts 3 under 4 on the left .
insert ( Node 4 ( Node 3 Nil Nil ) Nil ) 1 → this inserts 1 under 3 on the left .
insert ( Node 4 ( Node 3 ( Node 1 Nil Nil ) Nil ) Nil ) 2 → this inserts 2 under 1 on the right .
The resulting tree is the following :
Node {elt = 4 , l = Node {elt = 3 , l = Node {elt = 1 , l = Nil ,
r = Node {elt = 2 , l = Nil , r = Nil}} , r = Nil} , r = Nil}
Tail - recursive algorithm
Suppose we already have 3 of the previous nodes ( 4,3,1 ) , and want to insert our final element , the number 2 .
We know that 2 is going to the left of 4 , but where exactly is not known yet .
So in effect , the root node is a function of its left branch .
It is a function that takes a tree ( not sure what it is yet ) , attaches it to the left of number 4 , keeps the right branch intact , and returns the whole thing as a root .
In turn , this left branch is the number 3 , with nothing to its right and something that is going to change to its left , since 2 < 3 .
So the node 3 is a function of its left branch .
We go like this all the way to the node with 1 , which is a function of its right branch .
root = λ a → Node 4 a Nil a = λ b → Node 3 b Nil b = λ c → Node 1 Nil c c = Node 2 Nil Nil
So there we have the general algorithm : if we compose these functions , we get a complete root
The key is to consider the root as a function of one of its branch , which is in turn a function of one of its branch , etc .
By composing those functions step by step , we create a root as a function of the node to insert , which is done at the leaf level .
The first function is composed with id , which is the identity function .
The last step is to attach the new leaf :
root = ( λ c → ( Node 4 ( Node 3 ( Node 1 Nil c ) Nil ) Nil ) ( Node 2 Nil Nil )
root = ( Node 4 ( Node 3 ( Node 1 Nil ( Node 2 Nil Nil ) ) Nil ) Nil )
In Haskell :
insert n x = recur n x id where recur Nil x fun = fun $ Node x Nil Nil recur n x fun | x < elt n = recur ( l n ) x $ fun .
( \k -> n {l = k} ) recur n x fun | x > elt n = recur ( r n ) x $ fun .
( \k -> n {r = k} ) recur n x fun | otherwise = n
The whole code is on github ’s gist ; I find it very beautiful .
This is an interesting post , as it came from this Israeli news site that until a few months ago appeared to be extremely hawkish .
It seems to recognize that a similar program has been launched by Gush Shalom and suggests that the Arab League cooperate with " leftist Israeli lawyers . "
Guysen , Francophone agency in Israel , reports :
The Arab League is finally figuring out that there may be legal steps to take to prevent fund raising in the United States for the West Bank settlements .
The League has called on President Obama to prevent groups such as the ” American Friends of Ateret Cohanim ” from transfering millions of dollars in tax - free funds to radical settler groups for the purchase of Arab property in East Jerusalem .
The strategy of fighting legal battles and tax fraud with lawyers , and why not with leftist Isrraeli lawyers is something that the Palestinians and the Arab League must explore .
It could be much more effective than throwing stones .
The " American Friends of Ateret Cohanim " is headed by millionaire Irving Moskovitz .
He made his money with bingo parlors and by stripping down health centers and selling them , in short , dirty money .
Most Israelis do not like this group , and see them as radical instigators against peace , but when violence erupts , the lines are drawn .
Alejandro Pisanty , profesor universitario y presidente de la Sociedad Internet de México , difundió un comunicado en su blog la mañana del lunes 19 de octubre : su rechazo a los impuestos a telecomunicaciones que analizaba el Congreso mexicano , por afectar directamente a los usuarios de Internet .
" Es contradictorio restringir aún más el acceso a Internet cuando numerosas clasificaciones internacionales hacen aparecer a México cada año en lugares inferiores " , escribió .
" Internet , como una necesidad básica y creciente , implica no dificultar ni encarecer el acceso sino todo lo contrario , facilitarlo e impulsarlo " .
Entonces , conversó con otros activistas sobre pasos a seguir .
Ya en un momento similar en Venezuela , recordó , hubo un movimiento exitoso llamado " Internet Prioritario " .
León Felipe Sánchez , abogado , uno de sus interlocutores , sugirió iniciar una campaña bajo el nombre de " Internet Necesario " .
A las 11:08 horas de ese lunes en la ciudad de México , Sánchez , colocó un mensaje ( post ) en twitter , la red social que es como un telégrafo en tiempo real , que decía : " Me sumo a esta campaña con @apisanty NO al impuesto a telecomunicaciones !
http://j.mp/2vJVHX # internetnecesario " .
El contagio de lion05 , su nombre en twitter , fue viral .
Por la noche de ese lunes , la campaña agarró vuelo .
" Las redes sociales no sólo sirven para echar novio " , dijo días después .
Pero el martes 20 , los twitteros mexicanos estaban en un frenesí .
Ese día intercambiaron 32,864 mensajes protestando contra los impuestos , un tráfico que hizo que se colocara como uno de los trendy topics del día en la red social global de twitter , que ya alcanza a más de 32 millones de seguidores .
El miércoles , la vida virtual se convirtió en real .
El presidente del Senado , Carlos Navarrete , recibió a los activistas que echaron a andar # InternetNecesario para escuchar sus objeciones .
El encuentro fue transmitido en tiempo real por internet , subido en video a YouTube , y reenviado ( retwitteado ) a través de diferentes redes sociales .
Navarrete anunció que abriría en ese momento una cuenta en twitter , y en menos de 24 horas , ya tenía más de 1,200 seguidores .
La reunión se difundió ampliamente por la radio y terminó como noticia de primera plana en varios periódicos .
Las casas encuestadoras salieron a medir el impacto de esa protesta cibernauta ciudadana en la población .
Este lunes , una semana después de iniciada la cruzada , Demotecnia , de la especialista María de las Heras , difundió sus resultados : 78 % de los mexicanos dijeron que internet era necesario y que gravarlo retrasaría el desarrollo tecnológico de México .
La cruzada contra los impuestos en telecomunicaciones quizás no tenga la fuerza política suficiente para revertir la decisión de los diputados de imponer un impuesto de 3 % , que esta semana será revisada por los senadores , junto con otros aspectos de la recién aprobada Ley de Ingresos .
Pero la respuesta obtenida por # Internet Necesario es un atisbo de un fenómeno social sin precedente en México .
Creció sin el cobijo de ningún partido político , sin padrinazgos de nadie , sin el respaldo de ningún medio de comunicación .
Viajó a través del sistema nervioso electrónico del mundo y se reprodujo con una simple causa común : no a los impuestos en telecomunicaciones .
A la semana exacta de haber iniciado la campaña , ya había 78,092 mensajes - un promedio de 11,156 por día- , y su impulso había trascendido las fronteras .
Una protesta de los twitteros este domingo en un parque de la ciudad de México , fue noticia en el servicio español de la BBC .
Súbitamente , la red social de twitter se convirtió en una palabra de uso doméstico y de sensibilidad política .
Navarrete es el último político que se montó en twitter .
Otros políticos importantes que abrieron sus cuentas son el presidente Felipe Calderón , el líder de la izquierda social Andrés Manuel López Obrador , y el gobernador del estado de México , Enrique Peña Nieto , aspirante más fuerte a la Presidencia en 2012 .
Sus tweets ( mensajes ) no llegan a ser propagandísticos , pero tampoco tienen gracia .
Entre los más exitosos de esta red social se encuentran aquellas voces y caras en radio y televisión , como la conductora de noticias Adela Micha , que tiene más de 10,000 seguidores o Martha Debayle , la más simpática de las conductoras en radio , con más de 9,800 .
El magnate Carlos Slim abrió una cuenta y hay más de 1.600 personas que lo siguen y siguen esperando a que envíe un tweet .
Pero este boom del twitter entre las celebridades no tiene nada que ver con la cruzada de # InternetNecesario .
De hecho , es una contradicción que ahora que los políticos descubren una nueva forma de comunicación horizontal , gratuita y en tiempo real , quieran gravarla .
Las telecomunicaciones en México se han venido desarrollando , como en el resto del mundo , de manera vertiginosa .
La teledensidad en México se encontraba cerca del 90 % en 2008 , con 9,6 millones de teléfonos de línea fija y móviles .
Veintitrés millones de mexicanos utilizan internet - poco más del 20 % de la población nacional - , y unos 8 millones utilizan banda ancha .
De acuerdo con las estadísticas del gobierno , cada año se suman entre 2,1 y 3 millones de usuarios a internet .
La información y el conocimiento se han democratizado , y para quienes tienen recursos limitados , ha sido un impulso para su desarrollo .
Aunque el costo de las telecomunicaciones sigue siendo elevado en función del poder adquisitivo de la mayoría de los mexicanos , hay caminos que se están abriendo para acceder a las nuevas tecnologías con el menor gasto posible .
Por ejemplo , en los dos últimos años el crecimiento de cafés internet en la ciudad de México ha oscilado entre 30 y 40 % , en buena medida por la utilización que hacen de ellos los estudiantes , quienes por el precio de un periódico , pueden leer los que quieran y hacer parte de sus tareas durante una hora .
Varios gobiernos municipales y estatales están tratando de proveer banda ancha gratuita para sus ciudadanos .
En comunidades rurales se han llegado a instalar facilidades privadas de internet , que son utilizadas para esos fines y como medio de comunicación , mediante el correo electrónico .
Pisanty afirmó en su blog del 19 de octubre , citando estudios internacionales , que por cada 10 % de incremento en la penetración de la banda ancha , se elevaba aproximadamente 1,3 % el PIB .
El impuesto a telecomunicaciones , apuntó , es " contradictorio con el desarrollo de la sociedad de la información , con el tránsito a la sociedad del conocimiento , contradictorio con la formulación de una agenda digital que lleve a un progreso extensamente distribuido de nuestra sociedad " .
Paradójicamente , mientras en México el gobierno proponía colocar impuestos a telecomunicaciones y el Congreso lo aprobaba , en Finlandia se establecía como un derecho constitucional el acceso a Internet .
Pisanty y Sánchez son parte de un minúsculo grupo que desató el fenómeno social de # InternetNecesario y que , con su impacto en la clase política y la opinión pública , demostró que un movimiento social con puerto de destino claro , puede llegar a convertirse en un instrumento de comunicación política y rendición de cuentas como hasta ahora , en una democracia tan pervertida como imperfecta que es la mexicana , no ha existido .
Por cierto , en lo que escribía este artículo , el número de nuevos mensajes de # InternetNecesario que se transmitieron por la red social protestando por el impuesto , fue 582 .
Y siguen subiendo .
Earlier this year , we took a look at a desktop phone running Android built by California startup Touch Revolution .
While that device provided a look into the potential application of the OS in fixed telephony , the devices we saw were running a version of Android almost indistinguishable from the publicly available build .
Today , Cloud Telecomputers has debuted a completely unique build of Android as a part of its Glass " telecomputer " platform .
The company 's reference design has the Android environment running on a TI OMAP processor , and all telephony ( VoIP and DSP , SIP Stack and Voice Codecs ) being handled by a separate Audiocodes processor .
" Our approach allows us to focus on innovation , continually increasing the functionality of the Glass platform , while our partners concentrate their resources on branding , selling and tailoring applications for vertical markets . " said Ravin Suri , Cloud Telecomputers CTO .

With Android running the front end , Cloud Telecomputers is leaving the door open for third - party or in - house application development .
Naturally , the platform comes with its own unique suite of apps ( screen sharing , visual voicemail , voice to text and salesforce.com integration ) , but the value is in Android 's extensibility .
" By basing Glass on Google 's Android , we have provided users with access to the entire world of Android apps .
Instead of asking users to conform to proprietary standards , we feel that the value of Glass is maximized by working with applications that are already available .
New Android applications are being created every day , and Android 's user - supported development community is constantly growing , " the company said .
Furthermore , because the Glass platform offers an open API , licensees can actually develop and build their own apps and sell them to other Glass users , or go a step further and create their own desktop app store specifically for Glass .
As much of a fixture on the filmic calendar as prematurely manic Oscar speculation , once Halloween approaches many minds turn to movies of a sinister bent .
Cue warm tributes to Brazil 's Nietzschean bogeyman Coffin Joe , or Facet Features ' annual 31 - day celebration of the likes of Wendigo and The Tingler .
But for me , as much as I try and broaden my horizons , every time I come to write or even think about the subject I come creeping back to the same film .
Because in my small corner of the world , Halloween , horror movies , even cinema , full stop , are all about The Shining .
And it 's strange , because I saw it young and was predictably awestruck , yet for years afterwards it never seemed to have any great hold on me .
But recently Kubrick 's monstrous tour de force has loomed ever more insistently over my whole relationship with film .
Its memory is , I 've found , unshakable , as if the same dreadful currents the story located in the walls of the Overlook hotel somehow bled into the film itself and then , in turn , my private headspace .
God knows , its physical presence was powerful enough : the sheer grim spectacle of the snowbound Overlook or the fleeting bear - suit fellatio – so much rendered so appallingly dreamlike by its lack of explanation .
All great horror films ( all great films , period ) share the ability to push your buttons , but The Shining was a symphony drummed out on the softest and most vulnerable points of the psyche .
In the murderous Jack Torrance , we 're presented with cinema 's greatest portrait of predestiny : helplessness before fate however awful , the Fourth of July group photo waiting for us all .
The true horror is n't that Jack wants to kill his wife and child , but that he sees it as his duty .
There is , I realise , nothing very original about being under the spell of The Shining , staple of Family Guy pastiches and old Channel 4 100 Moments shows that it is .
And yet , however overfamiliar its set pieces might be , there are times when even the most wilfully contrary of us have to fall in line with mainstream opinion .
Because no matter how often we see Jack Nicholson gurning his way through the bathroom door , the pure cold magnificence of The Shining still leaves us freaked out to our cores – no amount of comic parody able to house - train this most profoundly disturbing of movies .
Of course film is a subjective medium , and I know that my own ever - growing fixation here is at least partly down to my own circumstances .
I 'm not above admitting that on my first viewing as a pallid teenager , the mere fact this was in part the story of a ( then much younger than me ) only child called Danny was enough to ensure a small amount of personal investment .
Then , as an adult , I spent many long , dull hours in the course of my professional life staring at blank white space where joyful flights of fiction should be .
Eventually , I had a kid myself : a son , the business of fathers and sons of course at the very centre of the project .
But what makes
The Shining so extraordinary is that vast numbers of people I know of every conceivable background – non-writers , non-fathers , a whole lot of people not called Danny – has some kind of connection with it , a particular look to their face at just the mention of the title .
Kubrick 's subcutaneous brilliance gets to everyone somehow , a moment for every personality type : for some it's the Grady Girls , others Room 237 , for others still the bloody lift doors .
For me though , what I see when I close my eyes are the corridors – not even Danny Lloyd cycling through them but just the corridors , those silent , non-specifically unnerving hallways .
We can take the film as a comment on the family , or the west , or just a string of chilling set pieces ; but when I see those endless corridors it feels to me Kubrick could almost have been putting forward a visual take on the inside of one 's own head – so often the most awful place in which we 'll ever find ourselves .
In a meeting designed to reassure the most hawkish elements of Congress that the war in Afghanistan is n’t going to undergo any sort of radical change , President Obama has reportedly assured that the so - called “ Biden Option ” is officially off the table .
A long time advocate of war in Afghanistan , and indeed most everywhere else , Vice President Joe Biden has reportedly come to the conclusion that the disastrous war in Afghanistan is no longer worth the effort and has been advocating more scaled back goals and a refocusing of attacks along the Pakistani border .
Though a growing number of Congressional Democrats object to the McChrystal plan of adding another 45,000 troops , and the New York Times is reporting that there is growing support for the Biden position , the administration has sought to assure that it is n’t an either - or proposition and that Biden ’s calls to escalate drone strikes might yet be implemented in addition to a ground escalation .
It was only a few months ago that the Obama Administration had insisted that the 21,000 troops they already added was all that would be considered in 2009 , but a worsening war is increasing pressure on the president to double down and he is widely expected to add at least another 10,000 troops in the short term .
The dust released in the CARE experiment scattered sunlight , creating a bright cloud that could be seen at visible wavelengths for several minutes .
The cloud ’s effects on the ionosphere lingered longer , however , and were detected by radar for about four hours after the dust ’s release .

Update on 23 September :
The dust released in the CARE experiment scattered sunlight , creating a bright cloud that could be seen at visible wavelengths for several minutes before it dispersed .
The cloud ’s effects on the ionosphere lingered longer , however , and were detected by radar for about four hours after the dust ’s release .
Researchers are still analysing the data and expect to know more about the results in the coming weeks .

The study of Earth ’s mysterious noctilucent clouds got a boost on Saturday , when a rocket was launched to create an artificial cloud at the edge of space .
“ Noctilucent ” , or night - shining , clouds float dozens of kilometres higher than other clouds , at an altitude of about 80 kilometres .
Because of their height , they can be seen glowing before sunrise or after sunset as the sun illuminates them from below the horizon .
The clouds were first observed above polar regions in 1885 – suggesting they may have been caused by the eruption of Krakatoa two years before .
But in recent years they have spread to latitudes as low as 40° , while also growing in number and getting brighter – a change that some attribute to global warming .
The ice - covered particles in these clouds are commonly thought to get their start as tiny dust particles that had been sloughed off comets and meteoroids .
See a gallery of noctilucent clouds
These particles build up a charge as they are bombarded by fast - moving electrons and ions .
Since charged particles reflect radio waves , they are good candidates for radar studies , which could help measure the dust at an early stage in the clouds ’ formation .
But the radar data is hard to interpret .
To get a better sense of how high - flying dust reflects radio waves , researchers launched the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment ( CARE ) at 2346 GMT on Saturday from NASA ’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia .
The experiment , which blasted off on a Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket , spewed more than 100 kilograms of aluminium oxide into the atmosphere at an altitude of about 280 km .
Radar scatter
A combination of ground - and space - based instruments will watch this cloud for days and perhaps months as its particles become charged , sink , and disperse .
Laser pulses will be used to measure the density of the particles in the cloud .
These will be compared with radar measurements of the plume .
“ Our primary science goal is to understand [ how ] radar [ scatters ] from a dusty plasma , ” says CARE ’s principal investigator , Paul Bernhardt of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC .
“ We want to understand what kind of information you get back when you send out radar pulses . ”
Radar has been used to examine icy dust that hovers some 90 km above the Earth and can grow to become the ice particles inside noctilucent clouds , says Scott Bailey of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg .
He is a lead scientist for NASA ’s Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere spacecraft , which launched in 2007 to study noctilucent clouds .
Controlled experiment
But at the moment , interpreting radar measurements of these proto - cloud particles is difficult .
Although they reflect radar brightly , it is difficult to say how large the particles are or how many there might be , Bailey says .
Studying an artificial cloud created in a controlled manner could help resolve these uncertainties .
“ If the radar could be used to say exactly what the population of particles is up there that the ice is forming around , that would be a major step forward , ” Bailey told New Scientist .
The CARE experiment could also pave the way for future launches that would use the uppermost part of Earth ’s atmosphere as a large physics laboratory for studying charged dust , Bernhardt says .
Dusty plasmas , like those that will be created in the CARE experiment , are seen in a range of environments , from Saturn ’s rings and comet tails to the dust hovering above the lunar surface .

Spanish Grammar
Find topics in left sidebar in top menu .
Frankly , when most people think of “ grammar ” they do n’t get very excited .
But grammar can teach you something in minutes that might take days to figure out by immersion alone .
Grammar is your friend !
We believe in grammar , and we include it in our method .
But let ’s be honest .
Studying Spanish grammar will not make you fluent .
To reach a conversational level you need a complete course like the one provided by our app , Camino .
These days , it is popular in some circles to claim that there is no need to learn grammar .
The thinking goes something like this :
I did n’t learn grammar as a child , and yet I still learned to speak .
Therefore , I do not need to study grammar as an adult .
This sort of thinking ignores the fact that as an adult you have a higher mental capacity , and learning some grammar is easy and will be a big help to you .
Grammar is not the goal .
For most people , the goal is not to become a grammar expert — the goal is to be able to speak Spanish conversationally .
To do that , you need a complete conversation course .
Camino is the only course that is fully integrated with the material on this website .
By combining Spanish grammar exercises with real conversational practice , you will much more quickly reach a level where you can communicate effectively .
And for most people , communication is the primary goal .
Let ’s see raised hands for investors who have bounced back so strongly with their retirement plans .
Anyone ?
How many people in the real world are seeing such strong compensation this year ?
As they often do , the article also provides cover for the ridiculous pay , suggesting that without these bonuses the poor workers would starve .
Except we all know that is a lie .
Goldman Sachs is expected to have an average of $ 526,814 this year and in general traders are making around half or one third of their income via salary .
After saving them all from ruin and bankruptcy last year , the increases are not acceptable at all .
If Obama and the Democrats want to coddle Wall Street and give away money , open the check book and give some to everyone .
These numbers have been annoying for far too long and the Democrats should expect a thrashing at the polls next year if they do n’t wake up and do something to turn the tide .
Wall Street cash bonuses are set to increase by about 40 percent this year , the Wall Street Journal said citing a report by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates .
In a report to be released later on Thursday , Johnson Associates projects that the biggest increases in year - end cash bonuses and equity awards will go to employees in rebounding businesses such as fixed income and equities , the paper said .

Ten months after Jaycee Dugard was snatched off a South Lake Tahoe street in 1991 , a caller told police he thought he had just seen the girl at an Oakley gas station , staring for a long time at a picture of herself on a " missing " poster , authorities told The Chronicle on Monday .
The call came from a pay telephone at a Chevron station that is less than 2 miles from the home outside Antioch where police now say Dugard was held for 18 years in a backyard compound of sheds and tents by Phillip Craig Garrido and his wife , Nancy Garrido .
The man who called in the tip to the Contra Costa County Sheriff 's Office reported seeing the girl return to a yellow van , possibly a Dodge , authorities said Monday .
Last month , police towed away a dilapidated , yellow Dodge Ram van with flat tires that was half - buried in dirt behind the home of Dugard 's kidnap suspects .
Sheriff 's Capt .
Dan
Terry confirmed the possible early sighting of Dugard after being asked about it Monday by The Chronicle .
Terry said such tips are common in criminal cases that are highly publicized , as Dugard 's kidnapping was in the early 1990s .
He said his agency had responded appropriately , sending a deputy to the gas station , but that the yellow van was gone , as was the caller - who did not leave his name and has never come forward .
" We do n't know if there was any truth to it , " said Terry , who is head of investigations for his agency .
" We do n't know if it was real or a hoax .
Nothing ever came of it . "
Terry said the call was made about 6 p.m. on April 22 , 1992 , almost a year after Dugard was abducted on June 10 , 1991 , while she waited alone on a South Lake Tahoe street for a school bus .
She was 11 when she was kidnapped and is now 29 .
Police had no license plate to track and no good location to stake out , Terry said , and the caller did not say which direction the van had driven .
He said dispatchers would have alerted other officers to be on the lookout for the van , and that a copy of the report had been sent to investigators in El Dorado County , who were leading the search for Dugard .
The Sheriff 's Office searched for Dugard 's name in a database after she was found in late August and unearthed the old incident report , Terry said .
The Garridos have pleaded not guilty to charges that they kidnapped and raped Dugard .
She had two of Phillip Garrido 's children and eventually helped him run a printing business , authorities said .
After Dugard was found , Contra Costa County Sheriff Warren Rupf apologized for an incident in which a deputy had missed a potential opportunity in 2006 to spot Dugard .
A neighbor of the Garridos told authorities that " little girls and women " appeared to be living in the backyard , but the deputy left after delivering only a warning about potential code violations , Rupf said .
The Chevron station , located on a rural stretch of road near Highway 4 , was owned in 1992 by Jimmy Bean of Antioch .

Risiken für Kiffer Florian Rötzer
Eine Metastudie gibt einen Überblick über mögliche Gefährdungen der Droge , die weltweit von fast 170 Millionen Menschen konsumiert wird .
166 Millionen Menschen im Alter zwischen 15 und 64 Jahren oder 4 Prozent dieser Altergruppe haben 2006 zumindest schon einmal gekifft .
Cannabis ist die weltweit am meisten von meisten jungen Menschen konsumierte illegale Droge , die sich nun von den reichen Ländern auch auf die armen ausgebreitet habe .
Am stärksten wird Cannabis nach Angaben der UN - Drogenbehörde in den USA , Australien und Neuseeland konsumiert , gefolgt von Europa .
Prozentual die meisten Cannabis - Konsumenten gibt es aber in Asien .
Am stärksten zugenommen hat der Cannabis - Konsum 2006 in China , aber auch in einigen afrikanischen Ländern sowie in Peru und Bolivien .
Wie Wayne Hall von der School of Population Health an der University of Queensland und Louisa Degenhardt vom National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre der University of New South Wales in Australien in ihrem Beitrag " Adverse health effects of non-medical cannabis use " schreiben , der in Zeitschrift Lancet erschienen ist , kann der Cannabis - Konsum gesundheitliche Schäden mit sich bringen .
Epidemiologische und klinische Studien hätten gezeigt , dass regelmäßigere Konsum zu einer gewissen Abhängigkeit führe und neben einem höheren Risiko für Unfälle beim Fahren zu Schäden im Atemtrakt , zu Herz - Kreislauf - Erkrankungen und zu psychischen Störungen führen kann .
Im Gegensatz zu anderen Drogen wie Alkohol oder Nikotin seien gesellschaftlichen Folgen des Cannabis - Konsums allerdings gering .
Der Wirkstoff THC führt zu einem " High " , einer leichten Euphorie und setzt die Reaktionszeit , die Informationsverarbeitung und Koordination herunter .
5 - 24 Prozent des gerauchten THC erreicht das Gehirn .
Der Wirkstoff kann aber auch Ängste , Panikreaktionen oder psychotische Symptome auslösen .
Es gibt Hinweise , aber keine Beweise , dass der THC - Gehalt in beschlagnahmten Cannabis - Produkten in den letzten 30 Jahren gestiegen sei .
Nach den ausgewerteten Studien könnten 9 Prozent der Menschen , die Cannabis konsumieren , abhängig werden .
Das Suchtrisiko ist für Nikotin mehr als dreimal so hoch , für Kokain doppelt so hoch .
Von Alkohol werden 15 Prozent süchtig , von Amphetaminen 11 Prozent .
Während chronische Bronchitis bei Kiffern häufiger auftreten , gibt es noch keine Belege , dass Cannabis trotz der Karzinogene im Rauch zu Lungenkrebs führt .
Meist seien regelmäßige Kiffer auch Tabakraucher .
Bei starken Kiffern soll Cannabis zu Aufmerksamkeits - , Gedächtnis - und Lernstörungen führen können .
Verbunden sei Cannabis - Konsum bei Jugendlichen mit schlechteren Schulleistungen , vermutet wird , dass hier eine Reihe von Ursachen neben den direkten Wirkungen eine Rolle spielen .
Unklar ist , ob der Cannabis - Konsum direkt die Neigung steigert , auf härteren Drogen umzusatteln , wie man dies in den USA , Australien und Neuseeland beobachten könne , schreiben die Autoren .
Es könne auch daran liegen , dass die Kiffer bereits mit dem Drogenmarkt vertraut sein und so leichter an anderen Stoff herankommen .
Die Autoren weisen auf Studie hin , nach denen Cannabis zu psychischen Störungen führen könne .
So soll sich das Risiko , an Schizophrenie zu erkranken , bei denen verdoppeln , die unter dem Alter von 18 Jahren bereits gekifft haben .
Auch psychotische Symptome würden vor allem bei regelmäßigen Konsumenten auftreten .
Eine Verbindung mit Depression und Selbstmordneigung sei nicht nachweisbar .
Hinweise gibt es allerdings nach den Autoren auf ein erhöhtes Risiko für Herz - Kreislauf - Erkrankungen vor allem bei Erwachsenen und bei hohen Konsum .
Gesichert ist der Zusammenhang aber offenbar nicht .
We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion : the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases , while the citizens may act only by permission ; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history , the stage of rule by brute force .
— Ayn Rand
Industrial civilization has been a dirty affair .
While it helped give rise to the wealth we see in the Industrialized core nations — typically associated with the United States and Europe — it has also led to an unprecedented centralization of power and left the people of the world dependent on its industrial infrastructure ; and so for example , 75 % of humans today live in the city , away from farms and the soil .
To be sure , the city has allowed us much opportunity , not among the least of which is a tight knit framework in which to trade ideas , materials and useful stuff .
All of this stuff , though , had to come from somewhere , and to meet that need importation from ghostly elsewheres has kept cities the world over running .
And now , monumental problems face all of us as individuals and communities today , and the challenges and associated tasks ahead threaten the fairness strived for and achieved by concerned ancestors similar to ourselves .
The gains of these people ’s are encapsulated in such documents as the Magna Carta , Declaration of Independence , US Constitution and Bill of Rights .
A history of arts , also , reminds of our sometimes vibrant past .
However , plans by political , financial and industrial elites to forge new institutions unaccountable to the people represent new monopolies on force and favors which threaten the very social fabric of civilization .
In an article published by the Wall Street Journal , Janet Albrechtsen covers what she describes U.N. plans for a new government “ scary . ”
She states :
We can only hope that world leaders will do nothing more than enjoy a pleasant bicycle ride around the charming streets of Copenhagen come December .
For if they actually manage to wring out an agreement based on the current draft text of the Copenhagen climate - change treaty , the world is in for some nasty surprises .
Draft text , you say ?
If you have n’t heard about it , that ’s because none of our otherwise talkative political leaders have bothered to tell us what the drafters have already cobbled together for leaders to consider .
And neither have the media .
The article cites for the most part the words of Lord Chris Monckton , the former advisor to Margaret Thatcher , who , at an address at Bethel University in St. Paul , Minnesota in November , blew the whistle and exposed the new governmental entity .
He exposed the 181 page draft text , which entails United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , planned to be signed in December .
The ultimate aim of the treaty , as Monckton and myriads others are warning , is to erect a transnational government .
There is a provision under the Convention calling for a “ government ” which will have the power to directly intervene in the financial , economic , tax and environmental affairs of all nations that sign the Copenhagen treaty .
And so institutions which need not answer to the public are taking it upon themselves to solve environmental problems , but what do we do when their solutions are astoundingly wrongheaded ?
The treaty requires developed countries to pay what is termed an “ adaptation debt ” to developing countries under the guise of supporting climate change mitigation .
But the premise that the nation - state is the keystone institution in our social system is a misnomer , for the corporation fills that role .
The largest associations and bodies are corporations and , as we will see , it is , to use a phrase made popular in the past year , the too - big - to - fail corporation which owes the rest of a massive “ adaptation debt . ”
Moreover , many of the developing countries are servicing crippling IMF debts .
It is therefore unlikely representatives of the West , especially Britain and the US , are interested in repaying the developing nations ; unless , of course , much of these credits go towards fueling speculative economies in which those who sit on enough capital can line their bulging pockets .
Politically concerning are the number of “ alternatives ” and “ options ” featured in the treaty which officially undermine the democratic and republican bases of the modern Democratic Republics and give plenipotentiaries and policy makers room to do as they please .
In an interview with Alan Jones on Sydney radio Monday , Lord Monckton said , “ This is the first time I ’ve ever seen any transnational treaty referring to a new body to be set up under that treaty as a ‘ government . ’
But it ’s the powers that are going to be given to this entirely unelected government that are so frightening ….
The sheer ambition of this new world government is enormous right from the start — that ’s even before it starts accreting powers to itself in the way that these entities inevitably always do . ”
So , the power grab initiated last year with the collapse of Lehman Brothers — what actually was an assassination by other oligopolists — continues .
In his talk at St. Paul Monckton told attendees : “ in the next few weeks , unless you stop it , your President will sign for freedom , your democracy , and your prosperity away forever . ”
Ron Paul echoed Lord ’s sentiments , stating November 9 , 2009 on the Alex Jones show :
If it works it will work for a little while and companies like Goldman Sachs and a few others will rip us off and get even more wealth .
But it cannot help the economy ; it has to hurt the economy .
And it ca n’t possibly help the environment because they are totally off track on that .
It might turn out to be one of the biggest hoaxes of all history this whole global warming terrorism that they ’ve been using .
Paul is referring to the siren song of global warming , which is being touted by many of the well - connected as the sole reason for a revolutionary reorganization of human life on our planet .
In fact , in books published by the Club of Rome , a premiere think tank , climate change is touted as a mean by which the global order based on the nation - state ought to be reconstructed ; the think tank champions the politically useful reasons for this as opposed to concerning themselves with the environment — of which we the people are a part — at hand .
When the threat is global warming , the Club of Rome has stated :
The common enemy of humanity is man .
In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention , and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome .
The real enemy then , is humanity itself … .
The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last 200 years , but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation … .
Democracy is not a panacea .
It can not organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits .
These facts must be faced squarely .
Sacrilegious though this may sound , democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead .
The complexity and the technical nature of many of today ’s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time .
A who ’s who of popular political figures and CEO ’s has echoed the sentiments of that of the Club of Rome .
I believe it is appropriate to have an ‘ over - representation ’ of the facts on how dangerous it is , as a predicate for opening up the audience .
— Al Gore , Climate Change activist
I believe that the mere mass of industrial civilization poses a threat to the biodiversity of the planet : the building blocks which are responsible for us , for our ideas and emotions , inventions and systems .
But , it is increasingly lucid that the framework by which climate - change and environmental degradation is framed by social engineers through political enunciations and the corporate media leaves much to be desired .
For brevity ’s sake , I will only mention that there is an intimate connection between plant life and carbon dioxide .
So , why have we determined carbon dioxide is the main threat ?
We exhale it !
Should we continue playing our roles , hanging on the false realities created by the leaders ?
Humanity is sitting on a time bomb .
If the vast majority of the world ’s scientists are right , we have just ten years to avert a major catastrophe that could send our entire planet ’s climate system into a tail - spin of epic destruction involving extreme weather , floods , droughts , epidemics and killer heat waves beyond anything we have ever experienced — a catastrophe of our own making .
— Al Gore , An Inconvenient Truth
This is rather alarming rhetoric for someone who , in the same breath , claims to have the near - ubiquitous support of the scientific community in his corner .
He admits himself though that he is a pathological liar ?
Jokes on us if we let him cash in on our apathy and ignorance .
By the way , when politicians and the propagandists refer to the “ scientific community ” they usually mean scientists who are members of corporate or governmental funded associations .
Independent thinkers need not apply .
Is n’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse ?
Is n’t it our responsibility to bring that about ? — Maurice Strong , founder of the UN Environment Programme
Ok , so bringing down industrial civilization sounds pretty damn cool : Can we keep The Clash and Kurt Vonnegut ?
Hmm , I guess I could get a beer with this Maurice Strong fellow .
Thing is , we probably have different ideas about ways , means and outcomes .
Rule of thumb : During crises , the rich have almost always outsurvived poor , in many cases benefitting .
For instance , the founder of the Krupp fortune , a wealthy burgher during the time of the Black Death of 1349 , bought up the properties left vacant by families eradicated by the plague for pennies on the dollar .
His descendants greatly prospered .
I highly suspect Strong has an idea of this .
In the US a Cap - and - Trade bill has been proposed , but as of yet not passed .
While arguing the bill would leave to capital flight from the US , Ron Paul stated :
The Cap and Trade Bill HR 2454 was voted on last Friday .
Proponents claim this bill will help the environment , but what it really does is put another nail in the economy ’s coffin .
The idea is to establish a national level of carbon dioxide emissions , and sell pollution permits to industry as the Catholic Church used to sell indulgences to sinners .
HR 2454 also gives federal bureaucrats new power to regulate a wide variety of household appliances , such as light bulbs and refrigerators , and further distorts the market by providing more of your tax money to auto companies .
Spain legislated such progressive energy policy by massively diverting capital from the private sector into politically favored environmental projects for nearly ten years .
Their economy currently has a 20 percent unemployment rate , and for each green job created , 2.2 normal jobs are eliminated .
The legislation in the US will cement more governmental regulations , taxes , fees and bureaucracy dissuading companies from doing business in the US , as well as how many employees they can afford to hire .
This added governmental red tape will cause capital flight and job losses .
Jobs , therefore , are increasingly likely to go overseas .
Over the summer , approximately 30,000 scientists signed a petition disputing the claim that global warming is an anthropogenic phenomenon .
What ’s more , the US Department of Defense is the largest polluter in the world , producing more hazardous wastes than the five largest US chemical companies together .
Hazardous wastes employed by the military include , among others , pesticides and defoliants , like Agent Orange , many solvents , petroleum , perchlorate , lead mercury and depleted uranium .
Health problems associated with these toxins include miscarriages , low birth weight , birth defects , kidney disease and cancer .
Most affected are those on whom such weapons are used , those in the military , and those who live near a military site .
In the US one out of every ten persons lives within ten miles of a military site listed as a priority cleanup site .
Many corporations are right up there with the DoD .
So , then , why are their fellow conspirators the ones wording such legislation ?
The best argument in favor of the environment , I conclude , is also an argument against war .
Therefore any true and honest environmental movement has , at its core , an argument against war !
Depleted Uranium ( DU ) has been a hot topic since the war began , similar to Agent Orange use in Vietnam .
As a radioactive and chemically toxic heavy metal , it remains wherever it is lodged , in the body on the ground or in rivers , for decades .
In the human body particles of depleted uranium are a source of alpha particles .
Much research suggests that DU is linked to serious damage to the human body .
In Iraq alone hundreds of tons of Depleted Uranium have been fired and exploded in high populated areas such as Basrah , Baghdad , Nasriya , Dewania , Samawa , and other cities .
Exploration programs have found Depleted Uranium related contamination over most Iraqi territories .
Iraq ’s Minister of Environment said in July of 2007 in Cairo that “ at least 350 sites in Iraq are contaminated with Depleted Uranium . ”
She also said that Iraq is facing an unprecedented number of cancer cases and called on the international community to help Iraq alleviate this problem .
I will spare you the photos , but encourage you to look .
On domestic turf , the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management sell trees from public forests — that is trees owned , I mean shared , by all of us — to big timber corporations at reduced prices ; in short , we subsidizes the destruction of the biodiversity which gave rise to ourselves .
In the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska , four - hundred - year - old hemlock , spruce and cedar are sold to timber corporations for less money than a cheeseburger .
Taxpayers funded , also , are the construction of the logging roads .
The Forest Service — the public — loses hundreds of millions of dollars a year on timber - sale programs .
Now we are being told we have to pay taxes in order to preserve our collective land base .
In the continental United States just five percent of native forest still stands .
440,000 miles of logging roads run through National Forests , despite that the Forest Service maintains there are 383,000 miles .
The National Forest Service , exactly like the major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , Bank of America , Citigroup and Well Fargo , cook the books and routinely lie .
The logic behind the new global authority is flawed .
It targets nations funded by taxpayer ’s —us .
But damage caused by human households is nowhere near as criminal as the damage done by corporations .
Municipalities and individuals consume ten percent of the nation ’s water .
The other 90 percent is guzzled by agriculture and industry .
Individual consumptions of energy , furthermore , accounts for about one - fourth of all energy consumption .
The other 75 percent is consumed corporations .
Municipal waste represents three percent of total waste production in the US .
So we now see that we the people are unjustly carrying the burden of climate - change .
Further , there are strong indicators that a current push for power accumulation employs climate - change and environmental degradation as its smoke and mirrors .
Many analysts are insisting the only in which to rebalance and harmonize the global human community is by revolution , and many of them contend violent revolution is inevitable .
I do n’t necessarily think “ violent ” need be so ; but , it has to be global .
We have to aim for the fences and raise consciousness all over the globe .
The push for global government and the New World Order must be slowed by us and our environmental communities — our land base , families and friends — protected .

PARIS --
The word on the table that morning was " cloud computing . "

Sally Sinclair was head of business analysis at Vodafone A man accused of murdering his Vodafone executive wife has denied attempting to saw her head off with a knife .
Sally Sinclair , 40 , was found with more than 30 stab wounds at their home in Amport , Hampshire , in August 2008 .
At the time , she was head of business analysis at the mobile phone firm 's world headquarters near Newbury , Berks .
Alisdair Sinclair , 48 , formerly of Georgia Lane , Amport , admitted he and his wife were involved in a knife fight in which she died but denies murder .
Winchester Crown Court heard the attack in the kitchen of their rented luxury property was partly witnessed by children , who can not be named for legal reasons .
I have no reason to cut someone 's head off , I 've never cut someone 's head off
Alisdair Sinclair , defendant
The defendant said that when his wife of 21 years finally admitted during an argument to having an affair , he ran at her with his fists raised .
Mr Sinclair told the jury she got a knife from a block and stabbed him in the hands , which led him to also grab a knife .
They started swiping at each other before he slashed her throat .
He said his wife fell to the floor and he could not remember any more of the attack , which also caused a number of injuries to her legs , back and torso .
When asked about " sawing " injuries to her neck , which appeared to be an attempt to cut her head off , he replied : " I have no reason to cut someone 's head off , I 've never cut someone 's head off .
" It 's a dreadful , dreadful thing and I have no knowledge of it . "
Controlled the cash On Wednesday , Mr Sinclair said he had feared for his life but admitted the attack had gone " beyond self defence " .
The court heard Mr Sinclair had been a house husband for almost 10 years while his wife worked .
His duties included domestic chores and looking after their four motorcycles and 13 cars , which he admitted he hardly ever drove .
Mr Sinclair said he was the only one who withdrew money from the couple 's joint account and said he would pay for almost all purchases in cash because he was scared of credit card fraud .
When asked if he behaved obsessively about money , he said : " I managed the money so we did n't get into debt , I was obsessive to the point I wanted to avoid fraud . "
Christopher Parker QC , prosecuting , asked him if he allowed his wife to withdraw cash for herself to which he replied : " We were equals . "
He then asked him : " Up until she told you she wanted a divorce , were you in control of the finances in the same way you controlled much of her life ? "
Sinclair replied : " Our marriage was sharing , we shared everything , we were honest . "
The trial continues .

People living in a shanty town in the Algerian capital have clashed with police for a second night in a row over housing conditions .
At least nine officers were injured as protesters in the Diar Echams suburb threw stones and fire bombs at them .
Clashes first erupted on Monday , as residents of the district demanded that the city authorities include them on a list of those eligible for re-housing .
A large security presence in Algiers means such violent unrest is rare .
Protesters on high ground above the suburb threw missiles on police in riot gear as they attempted to enter the area late on Tuesday .
On Monday , about 400 police officers used tear gas and water cannon to break up the demonstration .
Residents said they were protesting against squalid conditions in the working class suburb and calling for the city authorities to provide them with new homes .
One man , who gave his name as Hichem , said up to 14 people were living in some homes , with not enough room for everyone to sleep at the same time .
" Some young boys spend all the night outside taking drugs so that their brothers and sisters can sleep .
We will not stop the riot , " he said .
Algiers has high levels of unemployment and poverty , but the strong security presence in place because of an ongoing Islamist insurgency means social unrest is usually contained .
The union does not want to increase its health - care contributions , but does want to increase its pension benefit to $ 100 , up from $ 75 , for every year of service .
The union also wants to remove the cap for those earning more than $ 50,000 a year , so that their benefits are commensurate with their salaries .
When it comes to maps , Google has had nearly everything : great satellite imagery , huge coverage , and even some basic navigation features , but not what everyone that 's ever used a GPS device really wants : turn - by - turn navigation .
This changes today , as Google just released a beta version of Google Maps Navigation for Android 2.0 .
Here 's a quick overview of the features :
- Search in plain English - quickly search and navigate to places , businesses , landmarks - Search by voice - View of live traffic data over the Internet .
- Search along route - find locations near your current path - Satellite view - you can view the same satellite imagery you 've seen Google Maps , on your phone - Street View - check out what the exact surroundings of a location look like - Car dock mode - when you place certain devices in a car dock , a special mode activates that enables easier operation
Google Maps Navigation does two very important things for Google : it makes it a competitor to established GPS firms like TomTom and Garmin , which should make this space a lot more interesting , and it suddenly makes Android - the only platform this app is currently available on - a lot more desirable .
And - you guessed it - the first Android 2.0 phone to support this app is the upcoming Motorola Droid .
Since the application is free , we can expect Google to add advertisements to it at some point .
But currently , since you have to pay for every other mobile turn - by - turn navigation app out there ( we 're not talking pocket change here , either ) , the sheer fact that this thing is free will certainly make it a huge hit .
Check out a video overview of Google Maps Navigation and some screenshots below .
The San Joaquin River is the second longest river in California ; however , water diversion for irrigation and urban use has caused 64 miles of the river to run dry .
Â
Dry riverbed will soon flow with water again , thanks to the Omnibus Public Lands Bill signed into law by President Obama on March 30 , 2009 .
Â
Federal officials plan to release extra water from the Friant Dam to restore river flows in early October . Â
Photo by jcookfisher
18 years of court battles have resulted in the The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act , “ one of the largest salmon and river restoration programs in the history of the United States ” .
Â Monty Schmitt , Senior Scientist of the San Joaquin River Project Manager , explains :
Under the Settlement , salmon will be reintroduced in 2012 – nearly sixty two years since the last fish died out in the face of a dry river bed – with the goal of nearly 30,000 spring run Chinook returning to spawn each year …
And the Settlement is also about protecting agriculture .
While some water ( around 18 % on average ) will now remain in the river instead of being diverted for agricultural uses , the Settlement provides certainty for farmers about what their future water supplies will be , as well as provisions to help mitigate water supply and other impacts .
AlthoughÂ October 1 , 2009 was slated as the day when restoration was to begin , federal officials were unable to release water from the Friant Dam because they were awaiting a permit from state water regulators .
Â
The delayed report was expected to stall flows by a few hours or a day at the most .
Â
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation called the process complicated in explaining the delay , even though they have had three years to prepare since the “ historic 2006 settlement between environmentalists , federal agencies and agricultural interests ” mandated San Joaquin river restoration .
The Friant Dam was completed in 1942 . Â Prior to dam construction , the San Joaquin River provided the southernmost habitat for salmon in the United States .
Â
Thanks to the efforts of many , the mighty San Joaquin River will once again flow providing habitat for salmon and drinking water for 22,000,000 residents of California .

Thierry Henry insists
France will have no one but themselves to blame if they miss out on next the World Cup .
Veteran striker desperate for Les Bleus to qualify
Suffer
No bust - up
Thierry Henry insists
France 's players will have no one but themselves to blame if they miss out on next summer 's World Cup .
Les Bleus are currently second favourites to qualify automatically from Group Seven as they are four points behind Serbia with two games remaining .
The former World and European champions have only won half of their qualifiers to date and veteran striker Henry admits that is not enough .
Henry has now called on his team - mates to finish their campaign in style and restore pride in the shirt by qualifying for the finals in South Africa .
"
If we do n't go to the World Cup , everyone will suffer , " he told .
" But it 's all our fault .
" It 's up to us to give back to people the desire to believe in this team .
" I said before that we lacked a reference match .
Even though we did n't win , the one in Serbia could be that .
" The way the match was leaves me thinking that this team has a spirit .
This team is looking for itself , I hope it finds it . "
Football matters in the France camp have been overshadowed of late by off the field controversies .
Last months ' double header against Romania and Serbia was marred by reports of a bust - up between under - fire coach Raymond Domenech and his players .
Henry denied there was a clash and has played down the story .
" There was a discussion as there are in all the dressing rooms in the world , " he said .
" But no one raised their voice .
There was no clash .
" Domenech is not part of my family .
He 's not my father but he is someone humane and honest . "

The poison used against insects can make spider plagues even bigger .
Some people believe that using poison for insects on house furniture and stairs will not only kill insects but also the spiders that eat them , assuming that these ones are poisoned for having eaten their preys or just because they ran out of food .
However , a new research carried out by Jamel Sandidge , doctoral student in Kansas University , which was published in November in Nature magazine , shows that the use of insecticide can worsen spider plagues instead of reducing them .
Sandidge explained that according to conventional knowledge , the use of poison kills the insects that spiders usually eat , what in turn reduces their amount of food and leads them to starve to death .
But according to Sandidge , someone who is a doctoral student in ecology and evolutionary biology knows this is not the case .
After examining spiders in 71 houses in the city of Kansas and carrying out lab experiments , a conclusion was reached : the spider called Brown Recluse Spider , ( Loxosceles reclusa , Araneae : Loxascelidae ) of the United Sates , feeds itself on dead insects .
In fact - he said - , whenever possible , it prefers to eat dead insects to those who are alive .
“ This is really amazing ” , added Sandidge .
“ The brown recluse spider is supposed to be a predator and to feed itself on living insects ” .
The preference of the brown recluses for dead insects explains why there are so many spiders of this kind in the corners of typical houses , said Sandidge .
------------------
Necrosis produced in the bite of a Loxosceles
In his three - year research , he found that houses have an average of 65 spiders of this type .
The bite of a brown recluse can cause slight injuries that take long to heal and cause serious damages in the tissue .
The bite of the recluse spider can go from slight to serious and sometimes , it can also be lethal .
If using poison in houses does not work , what does Sandidge recommend ?
The insecticide can kill a spider if it goes straight to it but , in general , spiders do not receive a mortal dose when they move along corners , as it usually happens with insects .
In view of these facts , using sticky tramps is a helpful option .
Sandidge offers some advice in both of his Internet sites : Recluse Community Project and Problems with Brown Recluse Spider ?
The last one is a project that started in 2002 to help the owner of a house that needed to face a brown recluse spider .
Besides , Sandidge said that it is a good idea to shake covers and blankets before going to bed as well as shoes before putting them on , so as to make sure there are no spiders in there .
I recently talked to Sony 's Steve Haber , President of Digital Reading , about its flagship ebook reader .
Named the " Daily Edition , " it hits stores next month .
Notwithstanding differences between each manufacturer 's respective libraries , it offers all the best features of its main rival , the Kindle .
But Sony says it offers one thing that Amazon wo n't : actual ownership of your books .
" Our commitment is that you bought it , you own it , " Haber said .
" Our hope is to see this as ubiquitous .
Buy on any device , read on any device . …
We 're obligated to have DRM but we do n't pull content back . "
Sony 's adopting the ePub open file format and encouraging DRM - insistent publishers to offer files that use a less restrictive scheme from Adobe .
In doing so , Haber suggested that the worst case scenario would be 12 devices per account , effectively " books uncoupled from hardware . "
Ebooks can also be digitally " loaned " free of charge for up to 21 days , from participating libraries .
This works thought a deal with Overdrive , which facilitates such loans by backing them with hard copies .
Sony 's new reader also features a 9 " display , page - changing swipe gestures , annotations and a cellular connection to download new titles on the go .
At $ 400 , however , it 's as pricey as the top - of - the - line Kindle DX that it resembles ;
Sony already has a new generation of cheaper e-readers out which lack the fancy features and big screen .
Barnes and Noble announced its own reader , the Nook , a few weeks ago .
At $ 260 , it 's competitively priced and has a secondary LCD display .
It also focuses hard on consumer - friendly features that Amazon seems unwilling to indulge : in its case , books can be shared between devices and even with friends .
Not all books will be available , and shares are limited to 14 days at a time .
Without solid co-operation from publishers , Sony 's adoption of ePub and B&N 's sharing feature wo n't make much of an impact : what use are they if bestsellers are n't included ?
When the new devices appear and their associated stores are ramped up , we 'll get to find out if the proposed changes make a difference–and whether Amazon can be reeled in .
Joe Nocera of the New York Times has an article today on Obama administration pay czar Kenneth Feinberg ’s efforts to rein in top executive pay at banks bailed out by the American taxpayer .
You know , a story on the novel subject of accountability and transparency in American business , something that cuts as close to fiction as possible for the journalists tasked with covering Wall Street .
Nocera ’s piece is a column , not a straight piece of reporting .
But in either case , I do n’t think this paragraph would be differently written :
And the American International Group is contractually obliged to make bonus payments of nearly $ 200 million in March 2010 .
The company has promised to try to reduce that amount by 30 percent .
But once again , there is nothing Mr. Feinberg can do because those bonuses were already written into contracts — and there is a high likelihood that the bonuses will create another furor in Congress , just as they did earlier this year .
[ Emphasis added ]
It ’s really remarkable how inviolable contracts with Wall Street executive are .
Contracts , when written between big banks and investment firms , cannot be broken .
To break these contracts would undermine the basic foundations of America and would likely immediately turn the US into a communist country .
Or something .
Contrast this with the contracts between automakers and members of the United Auto Workers .
Let ’s look back and see what Nocera was saying when GM was looking at bankruptcy a year ago .
For instance , it is critical for General Motors to be able to break its contracts with both its unions and its dealers .
It needs to dramatically reduce its legacy benefits , perhaps even eliminating health care benefits for union retirees .
It needs to close plants .
It needs to pay its workers what Toyota workers are paid in the United States — and not a penny more .
It needs to reduce the number of brands it sells — which means closing down thousands of dealerships , which is difficult to do because of state laws that protect car dealers .
When General Motors shut down Oldsmobile , it cost the company more than $ 1 billion to buy out the Oldsmobile dealerships across the country .
If it slims down its dealerships from 7,000 to a more appropriate 1,500 , it will cost many times that amount .
[ Emphasis added ]
Not only was it imperative for Nocera that GM not honor their contract with the union , Nocera was also arguing that GM must find ways to go against laws in states that protect car dealerships .
Voiding contracts was not enough , he was arguing for voiding laws !
Another example of a prominent member of the press using two different standards for assessing the sanctity of the contracts of union auto workers and Wall Street executives is Ruth Marcus .
Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post went to great lengths to defend AIGs bonuses and contracts while simultaneously chiding unions to renegotiate — and if they did n’t like the deal they got , they could just stop coming in to work .
The autoworkers were not only required to renegotiate their previously negotiated contracts , but any protestations by their workers or supporters that these contracts be honored was met by disgust by the pro-business press .
The hypocrisy of how the contracts of Wall Street executives are being treated versus those of union workers is simply stunning .
All I want to see in an economic crisis is fairness .
If contracts are inviolable , they are inviolable for everyone , regardless of whether they are between blue collar workers in factories , white collar workers in office complexes , or the multi-millionaire executives on Wall Street .
If the economic crisis demands that auto workers take a haircut on their pay , benefits , and pensions , Wall Street executives must be held to the same standard .
Conversely , if the contracts between big banks and investment firms and their top executives simply cannot be changed , then it ’s time to go back and honor the contracts between the auto industry and organized labor .
It ’s that simple .
Volatiles , including hydrocarbons known to be present in comets , have been detected in lunar material kicked up by NASA ’s LCROSS mission ( Image : T.A. Rector / I.P.Dell'Antonio/NOAO/AURA/NSF )
The mystery of where the moon ’s water came from may soon be solved .
Evidence from NASA ’s LCROSS mission suggests much of it was delivered by comets rather than forming on the surface through an interaction with the solar wind .
In October , the mission crashed two impactors – a spent rocket stage and a few minutes later , the LCROSS spacecraft itself – into a crater near the moon ’s south pole .
The spacecraft snapped images and took spectra of lunar debris kicked up by the rocket ’s impact and found that it contained the unmistakable signs of water .
Previous missions have also found hints of lunar water but its source has not been clear .
One idea is that it forms when hydrogen atoms from the solar wind latch onto oxygen atoms in the lunar soil , creating hydroxyl and water .
Advertisement
But now , the evidence is mounting in favour of an alternative explanation – comet impacts .
The data was discussed this week at the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group meeting , a gathering of 160 lunar scientists in Houston , Texas .
‘ Dirty iceballs ’
The first line of evidence comes from compounds that vaporise readily , called volatiles .
LCROSS found spectral signs of volatiles containing carbon and hydrogen – likely methane and ethanol – as well as others such as ammonia and carbon dioxide .
“ It appears that we impacted into a very volatile - rich area , ” LCROSS principal scientist Tony Colaprete told the conference .
These compounds should have been mostly lost to space billions of years ago , when the moon coalesced from the debris of an impact between the Earth and a Mars - sized object .
Water formed through an interaction with the solar wind would therefore be relatively pure – and free of volatiles .
But comets , which are thought to have been responsible for many of the moon ’s impact scars , are “ dirty iceballs ” known to contain volatiles such as methane .
“ If you can nail down the source of the water [ on the moon ] , that could tell us a lot about the cometary history of the moon for the last couple of billion years , ” says Larry Taylor of the University of Tennessee .
High concentrations
The second line of evidence pointing to comets comes from the amount of water detected .
The solar wind is expected to form water in minute amounts , amounting to concentrations of no more than 1 per cent in the lunar soil .
LCROSS team members are still analysing the data , but calculations suggest the concentration of water is higher than that .
“ The data are consistent with a total hydrogen content in the range of several per cent , ” says Colaprete .
Beyond their link to comets , volatiles generated excitement at the meeting because of their value as a resource for human spaceflight .
While water is important for survival on the moon , it is the water ’s hydrogen that can be used as rocket propellant .
The possibility of finding compounds like ethanol and methane , which can be used as fuel directly , makes the economic case for returning astronauts to the moon even sweeter .
“ LCROSS has given us our ticket back to the moon , ” says Noah Petro of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
(...) combatir a la corrupción algunas veces se parece a desactivar una bomba .
Un movimiento en falso y todo estalla .
Petrobras produce dolor de cabeza , porque está llena de lecciones torcidas .
Esta empresa vivió su época de oro cuando estaba metida en el lodo hasta el cuello .
La exposición y ataque a la corrupción no generó valor para la empresa , sino todo lo contrario .
Le dio un segundo golpe , más fuerte que el que le produjo la caída de los precios internacionales del petróleo .
Entre 1997 y el 2014 , esta empresa brasile ña desarrolló a gran escala una maquinaria de corrupción .
Esos años fueron también gloriosos en materia económica para la petrolera .
Se abrió al capital privado y se internacionalizó .
Llegó a tener un valor de mercado superior a los 126,000 millones de dólares .
Petrobras lleva dos años en el desmonte del esquema de corrupción y tratando de lavarse la cara , pero no lo ha conseguido .
La empresa ahora vale alrededor de una quinta parte de lo que llegó a valer .
Ha dejado de ser una referencia a imitar y se ha convertido en un caso de estudio , dentro de la categoría Nota Roja empresarial .
La policía brasile ña estima que lo robado a Petrobras está cerca de los 14,000 millones de dólares .
La principal fuente de corrupción eran las relaciones con los proveedores .
En algunos rubros donde debía haber competencia , las empresas se ponían de acuerdo para coordinar sus propuestas a Petrobras y cargar un sobreprecio significativo .
En otros bienes o servicios , donde era difícil encontrar varios competidores , simplemente operaba una práctica de precios muy superiores a lo normal .
Los altos ejecutivos de Petrobras validaban los precios altos por acción o por omisión .
El botín se repartía en tres grandes partes : una , las empresas , que obtenían beneficios extraordinarios ; dos , los altos funcionarios de Petrobras , que recibían su comisión en paraísos fiscales y regalos de lujo ; tres , los líderes políticos , que se llevaban su tajada , en forma de contribuciones a campañas o depósitos bancarios .
El papel de los políticos era clave , porque ellos tenían la posibilidad de presionar para lograr algún nombramiento o renuncia en los puestos claves de Petrobras .
Dilma Rousseff fue presidenta del Consejo de Petrobras durante varios años .
¿ Qué tanto supo y participó del esquema de corrupción ?
Quienes defienden su inocencia , no pueden argumentar en favor de su inteligencia y/o de su capacidad para gestionar ...y viceversa .
Ése es uno de los problemas para la presidenta brasileña .
Otro es que las investigaciones parecen confirmar que su mentor , Lula da Silva , recibió alrededor de 7.8 millones de dólares .
¿ Cómo desmontar un sistema de corrupción sin destruir valor en la corporación que lo padece ?
Imagínense que ahora se destapara un gran escándalo de corrupción en la petrolera mexicana , algo parecido al Lava Jato o Petrolao brasileño .
El primer efecto sería devastador .
Impediría el reflotamiento de Pemex , en la medida en que destrozaría su valor , se reduciría su calificación crediticia y se aniquilaría su capacidad para hacer alianzas .
Es muy probable que paralizaría su gestión y operación normal , durante mucho tiempo .
No me malinterpreten .
Quiero que se erradique la corrupción en la mayor empresa mexicana y que no haya impunidad .
Sólo quiero destacar una cosa : combatir a la corrupción algunas veces se parece a desactivar una bomba .
Un movimiento en falso y todo estalla .
Petrobras me produce dolor de cabeza , porque intuyo que se parece a Pemex .

Did anybody empty the tan ...
The surprising recent buoyancy of the loonie is , as Stephen Harper said this week , cause for " concern . "
The PM was reinforcing an alarm sounded by Mark Carney , governor of the Bank of Canada , for several weeks .
A loonie that is gaining strength chiefly in relation to a weakening U.S. dollar is a competitive disadvantage to everything from Canadian - manufactured exports to the B&B sector .
But this phenomenon is a necessary price for rebuilding the United States economy , to which Canada 's fortunes are tied .
Despite dreadful economic conditions stateside , the U.S. greenback held up well until recently .
Global investors , in a flight to safety amid financial chaos last year , were attracted to U.S. - denominated investments .
For all that the U.S. was the epicentre of the world economic crisis , it remains an oasis of political stability that has never defaulted on its debt obligations .
That has been something of a curse for the U.S. , however .
Even before the downturn , its manufacturing sector was suffering not only from the low labour costs of offshore rivals , but from artificially low currencies in which those exports were priced .
For a decade , the U.S. has lobbied Beijing to free its currency to rise , but with scant success .
Fortunately , as the storm clouds have lifted this year , global investors have become emboldened to trade some of their U.S. - denominated investments – which have propped up the greenback – for higher - yielding bets on other currencies and other nations .
And that is a necessary boon to the U.S. economy .
A falling greenback makes America 's manufactured exports more price - competitive .
It will have the simultaneous effect of making imports more costly .
The net impact should be a much - needed boost in U.S. job creation .
There are about 15 million jobless Americans .
Officially , the U.S. jobless rate is just under 10 per cent .
But the more telling rate of underemployment , which few politicians or mandarins discuss , is about 17 per cent .
The higher figure accounts for Americans who would like to work but have given up looking for a job ; workers who 've had their hours cut ; people working a succession of low - paying temporary jobs with no health and pension benefits ; and people working two or three jobs to make ends meet .
The consensus opinion among economists is for a " jobless recovery , " with intolerably high joblessness and underemployment lasting into 2011 .
Economic growth as measured by GDP turned positive last summer for the first time since the recession began in December 2007 .
But hiring , always a lagging factor in economic recovery , has not resumed .
America is no longer losing more than 700,000 jobs a month as it did earlier this year during the worst of the downturn .
But only small comfort can be taken from lower U.S. job - loss numbers since , including the more than 200,000 jobs lost in September .
America , with a weaker social safety net than Canada , Europe or Japan , traditionally relies more than its peers on massive job creation as the principal source of household income .
By varying estimates , there remains a shortfall in U.S. economic activity – or a " capacity gap " – of between $ 2 trillion ( U.S. ) and $ 3 trillion .
That 's the difference between America 's GDP and where its GDP needs to be in order to recover the lost jobs and create the millions more to accommodate new entrants to the workforce .
For that to happen , moribund U.S. corporate investment in new plants and equipment needs the jolt of a greater export competitiveness that comes with a lower dollar .
Harper correctly noted this week that the greenback 's slide " does have difficult effects on our economy . "
Yes , a loonie that soon reaches parity with the greenback , as many Canadian economists have been predicting all year , does hurt .
But what hurts us more is that the trading partner with which we do $ 1 billion worth of business each day remains in the ICU .
Many U.S. exports , from Boeing aircraft to the Buicks that GM sells with growing success in Japan and China , contain high - value Canadian components .
Even putting aside that boost to our economy as America 's export prowess grows , our own economic conditions wo n't improve appreciably until the U.S. economy returns to robust health .
And for the next while , perhaps two years or so , one of our best hopes for that outcome is that the greenback finds and remains at a lower , more competitive level .

A dead salmon has become a scientific celebrity after its brain supposedly lit up when shown pictures of humans during a brain scan .
Some bloggers last week reported that the fish was still thinking or that the research is evidence of an ethereal soul .
However , the study was done to show that data from an fMRI brain scan can lead to false positives — misleading results — if not carefully analyzed .
Yes , the salmon was dead — bought in a lifeless state at a fish market and scanned an hour later .
No , the results are not shocking or miraculous .
Like many scientific studies , the study and its results , presented earlier this year in a poster at a conference , are technical and rather bland :
" The goal of the salmon poster was to encourage the minority of researchers who report uncorrected statistics to move forward and begin using basic multiple comparisons correction in their research , " says study leader Craig Bennett , a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychology at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
In a nutshell , the data reported by Bennett and colleagues in no way suggests the salmon 's brain was functioning , but rather reveal anomalies that can be misleading if you 're not careful .
[ In a separate study recently , researchers concluded that human brain scans are often done unnecessarily . ]
Scientific saga
The scientific saga of the salmon is as long and complex as a salmon 's journey from the ocean to a mountain stream to spawn .
It began in 2005 when Bennett picked up a salmon at a local market .
An hour later he and colleagues stuck the fish in an fMRI scanner and did a bunch of different scans as part of a project at Dartmouth College to develop MRI protocols .
They had previously scanned a pumpkin and a dead bird .
" The salmon was approximately 18 inches long , weighed 3.8 lbs , and was not alive at the time of scanning , " the poster presentation states .
" The salmon was shown a series of photographs depicting human individuals in social situations with a specified emotional valence .
The salmon was asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing . "
" By far it was our crowning achievement in terms of ridiculous objects to scan , " Bennett recently wrote , on his blog , of the fish .
Another look at the data
Then in 2008 , Bennett was working with one of his advisers on a presentation about false positives in MRI data , specifically about misleading results that can come from what 's called a " multiple comparisons problem . "
Bennett ran his 2005 fish data through some statistical programs and , sure enough , three false positives showed up in the salmon 's brain .
The results were presented at the Human Brain Mapping conference last June in San Francisco .
They almost never saw the light of day , however .
In the review process , " Just about everyone thought it was a joke — some rogue student who was playing a prank , " Bennett says .
The findings have been submitted to a journal — as a cautionary tale about data interpretation — but not yet accepted for publication ( it is normal for scientific papers to go through a months - long process of review , rewrite and resubmission ) .
With all of last week 's hoopla , Bennett blogged about some of the best comments he ran across regarding the dead salmon study .
Here is one he considers spot on : " The recorded signal is changing due to noise .
The point of the experiment is that if you look at enough signals , the noise in one will match the timing of your experimental stimulus , purely out of chance . "

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. financial advisors are due for upheaval as baby boomers , controlling $ 10 trillion in assets , reach retirement age and shift their investment priorities , said a senior executive at asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N .
Baby boomers will move the industry ’s main client goal from one from accumulation -- investing in assets that create the most value over time -- to one of “ decumulation , ” said Frank Porcelli , who heads U.S. retail for BlackRock , at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in Boston .
“ The questions wo n’t be , ‘ How did I do against the S&P 500 ? ’ ” he said .
“ It ’s , ‘ Can I meet these liabilities ? ’ ”
Instead of a focus on building wealth and a retirement nest egg , those clients will soon focus on making the money last .
Baby boomers , he said , are increasingly spooked by the turbulent markets of the past year , and concerned with ensuring their funds last through retirements that could last 20 years or more .
The $ 10 trillion that will be in the control of the newly - retired will dictate a more conservative investment and spending approach .
BlackRock is one of the world ’s largest investment managers and advisors , with $ 1.37 trillion in client assets under management and providing services to clients with $ 7 trillion in assets .
When it completes its purchase of Barclays BGI unit in December , it will be the world ’s largest asset manager with roughly $ 3 trillion in assets .
The New York - based firm , which built its reputation by serving institutional clients , does not cater directly to retail customers , but provides funds and services to financial advisors who work with retail investors .
Porcelli said research conducted by the firm found that 70 percent of retirement - age clients are willing to move their accounts to another firm , if the firm offered expertise on constructing portfolios to avoid running out of money during their golden years .
This was a far different , and more complex service than aiding in asset accumulation , he said .
“ This is the equivalent of financial brain surgery , ” said Porcelli , adding advisors would have to manage clients ’ spending expectations , as well as investment performance .
DONE WITH DEALS
Porcelli also said that that while he is not privy to such discussions , he sees another acquisition for BlackRock as unlikely .
The firm announced in June 2009 an agreement to purchase Barclays Global Investors for $ 13.5 billion .
“ I do n’t see a lot what we ca n’t do right now , ” Porcelli said .

The was word yesterday morning that CBS was considering a Criminal Minds spin - off with brand new characters and a female lead .
Other than that , the show will be the same .
A group of FBI agents solve cases relating to serial murders and crazy people .
I like Criminal Minds - I 've actually watched every episode of the show - but I do not see how a spin - off would benefit the audience .
Instead of one case per week , we get two .
If we wanted more cases of the nature , there are 4 season worth already , and a multitude of other cop shows .
At least with the CSI and NCIS spin - offs , there is a possibility for some originality , but how could a new Criminal Minds be different ?
The current Criminal Minds is almost straight profiling mixed with the interpersonal demons of the team members .
This is how I suspect the difference will be .
The team members will be having sex with each other left and right .
There is hardly any sexual tension on Criminal Minds which is in stark contrast to all other procedurals .
CBS proved that original shows can work .
Take The Mentalist and The Good Wife .
These shows do n't necessarily fit the mold of other shows and yet they do well in the ratings .
While CBS may not be as innovative as ABC or Fox , I am positive that making the easy decision is not always the best route .

GPS receivers installed to measure the movements of tectonic plates and help you find tacos could find yet another purpose : measuring snow depth .
By analyzing the way the GPS signals are transformed as they travel through snowpack , a team of scientists from the University of Colorado , Boulder , may have found a cheap , easy way to optimize an important variable in climate models .
" It 'll be hard , but it looks pretty good so far , " said Kristine Larson , a GPS specialist at CU , and lead author of a paper on the technique published earlier this month in Geophysical Research Letters .
Her team , basically , is using waste data from the global positioning process .
When a wave leaves a GPS satellite heading for a receiver , not all of it reaches the antenna directly .
Some of it bounces off the ground around the actual antenna .
For standard GPS purposes , people try to suppress this " multipath " signal , but Larson realized it could yield valuable information about the surfaces it 's hitting .
A few years ago , they trialed measuring soil moisture data based on the reflectivity of the ground .
Snow , theoretically , should reduce the frequency of the multipath wave .
" It 's one thing to say that you used a signal from a GPS satellite to estimate the depth of the snow , but unless I go out there with a yardstick and say this is 18 inches of snow , you do n't know , " Larson said .
So , after securing a seed grant and setting up the experiment , she went out there with a yardstick , husband and 10 - year old son in tow .
They drove out on Highway 36 , past the Costco , and took measurements of snow depth and density .
Though it might not have been the most glamorous fieldwork , it revealed two very important problems with existing measurement systems like the National Weather and Climate Center 's SNOTEL sensor network .
First , point measurements — no matter how accurate — do not account well for snow - depth variability due to wind or other hyperlocal conditions .
" The snowpack can be 12 inches here and you walk one foot and it can be 18 inches there , " Larson said .
" That 's your signal plus or minus 50 percent . "
GPS can measure a wider area than any current ground - based method , allowing it to account for that variability .
Theoretically , one could measure snow depth from space and get very broad area coverage .
Unfortunately , no current satellite can do it .
And any space - based system would be vastly more expensive and have a relatively limited life - span , maybe five years .
Second , climate modelers are n't interested in snow depth in the way that a skier might be .
Really , what they 're after is how much water is locked up in the snow .
To calculate that , you need both the depth and the density of the pack .
Right now , the best way to get snow density remains low - tech .
" We literally took plastic piping that you 'd use in your house and you put that into the snow , then cover up the bottom , then you pull it up , " Larsen said .
" Then you wait for it to melt . "
A little bit of high school math later , and you 've got a density measurement for the snow in the PVC pipe .
By matching up GPS signals with those density measurements , you can calibrate a model that yields snow density from GPS information alone .
With the depth and density in hand , you can calculate the snow - water equivalent data that climate modelers covet .
Someday soon , the hundreds of GPS receivers scattered around the world 's wintery wonderlands could be sending out snow data .
It 's about as close to getting something for nothing as a scientist could hope for .
" You 've got to convince people that are measuring what you say you 're measuring .
You have to have people with sticks .
You have to have ultrasonic snow - depth sensors , " she said .
" I 'm not there yet , but it 's a good first step . "

The 2010 Census is expected to find that 309 million people live in the United States .
But one person will be missing : the average American .
" The concept of an ' average American ' is gone , probably forever , " demographics expert Peter Francese writes in 2010 America , a new Ad Age white paper .
" The average American has been replaced by a complex , multidimensional society that defies simplistic labeling . "
The message to marketers is clear :
No single demographic , or even handful of demographics , neatly defines the nation .
There is no such thing as " the American consumer . "

The census is the biggest market - research project of the decade .
The Census Bureau will spend upward of $ 15 billion to count the population as of April 1 , 2010 , and amass a treasure - trove of data on U.S. consumers .
" The decennial census will tell us quite precisely how American consumers have changed in the past decade , " Mr. Francese writes .
" It also will give us clues about where the consumer marketplace is moving .
The census is the gold standard against which the results of all major consumer - research studies are benchmarked . "
The Census Bureau will begin releasing data in spring 2011 .
Mr. Francese , demographic trends analyst at WPP's Ogilvy & Mather , New York , and founder of American Demographics magazine , now offers projections and insight on what the census will show .
His 32 - page report , available at AdAge.com /2010America , will give marketers a window on what the census will show and how to adapt those findings in a marketing world reliant on broadscale demographics that no longer exist .

" The iconic American family -- married couple with children -- will account for a mere 22 % of households . "
The most prevalent type of U.S. household ?
Married couple with no kids , followed closely by single - person households , according to Mr. Francese 's projections .
The Census will give Americans 14 choices to define household relationships .
Mr. Francese says this will " enable the Census Bureau to count not only traditional families but also the number and growth since 2000 of blended families , single - parent families and multigenerational families , as well as multiple families doubling up in one household . "
That presents boundless opportunities for marketers and media in how they target and segment households .
Minorities are the new majority .
" One fact says it all , " Mr. Francese writes .
" In the two largest states ( California and Texas ) , as well as New Mexico and Hawaii , the nation 's traditional majority group -- white non-Hispanics -- is in the minority . "
And in the nation 's 10 largest cities , he says , " no racial or ethnic category describes a majority of the population . "
Mr. Francese notes how diversity varies greatly by age , " with the younger population substantially more diverse than the old . "
Consider these 2010 projections : 80 % of people age 65 - plus will be white non-Hispanics .
But just 54 % of children under age 18 will be white non-Hispanics .
Mr. Francese observes : " White non-Hispanics will surely account for fewer than half of births by 2015 . "
In 2010 , Hispanics will be both the nation 's fastest - growing and largest minority ( 50 million people ) .
The nation is moving .
Over the past decade , Mr. Francese says , 85 % of the nation 's population growth occurred in the South and West .
" During the still - nameless decade from 2000 to 2010 , " he writes , " a total of about 3 million people have moved out of the Northeast , and another 2 million have left the Midwest " for the South and West .
Mr. Francese 's report offers his " 2020 vision , " analyzing how things will change over the next decade .
" Our nation will be older and more diverse , and consumer markets more complex , " he writes .
The white paper pinpoints age and income groups where marketers could find the biggest opportunities .

: Does any one know where the phrase Crime Does n't Pay comes from ?
If so please enlighten me .
The Shadow knows ...
CRIME DOESN'T PAY --
" Inevitably , sooner or later , criminals will be caught and punished .
First attested in the United States in N. Martin's ' Mosaic ' .
The saying was popularized in the 1930s through the radio crime drama ' The Shadow . '. "

Dear EarthTalk : How are heating , cooling and electricity produced by geothermal energy ?
I do n’t understand how it works .
— Delano Stewart , Wyandanch , NY
The term “ geothermal ” is derived from the Greek words for Earth ( geo ) and heat ( therme ) .
In essence geothermal energy is power harnessed from the Earth itself .
Heat from the Earth ’s core , which averages about 6,650 degrees Fahrenheit , emanates out toward the planet ’s surface .
Heated springs and geysers up to three miles underground can be accessed by special wells that bring the hot water ( or steam from it ) up to the surface where it can be used directly for heat or indirectly to generate electricity by powering rotating turbines .
Since the water under the Earth ’s surface is constantly replenished , and the Earth ’s core will continue to generate heat indefinitely , geothermal power is ultimately clean and renewable .
Today there are three main methods for harvesting utility - grade geothermal energy : dry steam , flash steam and binary - cycle .
The dry steam process brings steam up directly from below to drive turbines that power electricity generators .
Flash steam plants bring the hot water itself up from below ; it is then sprayed into a tank to create steam to drive the turbines .
These two methods are the most common , generating hundreds of megawatts of electricity across the American West , Europe and elsewhere .
But expansion is limited as these plants only work in tectonic regions where it is easier to access ground heated water .
The binary - cycle technology extracts close - to - the surface warm ( not necessarily hot ) water and combines it with a second ( “ binary ” ) fluid , like butane or pentane , which has a low boiling point .
This fluid is then pumped through a heat exchanger , where it is vaporized and sent through a turbine before being recycled back into the system .
Binary - cycle geothermal plants already pump out dozens of megawatts of electricity in California , Nevada and Hawaii , among other places .
But geothermal is n’t just for utilities .
Homeowners looking to go green and lower their utility bills can install a residential system , essentially a scaled - down version of the binary - cycle system .
A series of pipes is installed underground .
Water circulating in the loop is heated naturally underground and then transferred to a heat exchanger which concentrate the energy and releases it inside the home as heat .
In summer and in warmer climates , the process is reversed to fill the home with geothermal - cooled air .
Geothermal has its drawbacks .
For homeowners , it may be hard to justify the up - front expense of $ 7,500 or more to install a system , though the IRS now offers tax credits for 30 percent of the cost .
At the utility level , geothermal plants are costly to build and operate .
And finding a suitable site requires digging expensive test wells with no guarantee of hitting a productive underground hot spot .
Nevertheless , analysts expect utility - grade geothermal capacity to nearly double over the next just six years .
The Obama administration has set aside $ 750 million for geothermal development , and Congress has also been generous , allocating $ 129 million to the Department of Energy for various geothermal programs .
Geothermal may be in its infancy in the U.S. , but it is a big player in Iceland , which derives 26.5 percent of its electricity needs from geothermal , and in New Zealand , which gets 10 percent of its electricity likewise .

Blanche De Chambly – White Ale on Lees
Unibrew , USA Inc. , Shelburne , VT
Beer Info : ( From the site ) “ Blanche de Chambly ( White of Chambly ) was the first bottle refermented ale produced by Unibroue .
It is brewed from a blend of pale barley malt , wheat malt and unmalted wheat , to which we blend selected spices and hops .
Blanche de Chambly is only partially filtered , retaining its natural cloud of yeast that is characteristic of the original white ales brewed during the Middle Ages . ”

Another in the 750 ml category I ’ve been lucky enough to find at one of my local stores .
I think I ’ve pretty much milked it , though , so it ’s time to move along to greener pastures .
Anyway , regardless of its size and style , I really do enjoy the corked bottle and its similarities to Champagne .
The scents after opening are a bit malty , quite bright , and nicely crisp and wheaty .
As it is a white ale , the color is a bright , vibrant yellow with just a hint of a head .
Once poured and subsequently opened up , the nose becomes a bit more wheaty with a slight background of citrus .
Its resemblance to any other white ale is not lost on its appearance and its shared beauty with others of its family is very evident .
Sadly , there really just is n’t much to it .
Sure , it ’s a white ale , but , unfortunately that just does n’t liven up its dull flavor at all .
It has notes of spices like coriander and also rinds of citrus , but neither are are as obvious as the crisp and full - bodied wheat and even yeast overtones .
This is not to say it ’s a bad beer by any stretch - as it is certainly a classic - it ’s just that it ’s slightly low on the excitement scale .
It ’s an easy drinker , so that ’s nice for those not inclined for a sipping brew , and it would certainly go well with pastas with cream sauces or even saltier fare like ham .
Decent , but dull .
Rating : * * 1/2
White ale means ( here , at any rate ) white ale .
Just nothing worth its price or even dirtying a glass .
This is a show you move through .
The creators of “ Sleep No More ’’ - Punchdrunk artistic director Felix Barrett , co-director / choreographer Maxine Doyle , and executive director Colin Marsh - have transformed the Old Lincoln School in Brookline into a sprawling , labyrinthine set that audience members roam .
You choose where to go and when .
Perhaps you ’ll follow a shadowy form that rushes past you on the stairs to the basement , or the sound of a party on the floor above .
You might decide to trail one performer for an hour , or set off to find the three witches you glimpsed earlier .
Take one whiff of the spoiled food in the Macduffs ’ dining room , and you may run the other way .
Go ahead and open the cupboards .
Rifle through drawers .
Find yourself completely alone in a room with an actor whispering in your ear .
In fact the show , which starts previews Thursday , marks many firsts , not least Punchdrunk ’s North American premiere , as well as a heretofore unheard bit of advice from the ART to ticketholders :
Wear sensible shoes .
“ Sleep No More ’ ’ is the second production in American Repertory Theater ’s “ Shakespeare Exploded ’ ’ festival and a co-production with the experimental British theater company Punchdrunk .
ART artistic director Diane Paulus describes the evening as art installation meets living video game meets theater .
The folks from Punchdrunk boil it down to “ Macbeth ’’ meets Hitchcock .
With all that meeting going on , it ’s hard to put a tidy label on these proceedings , but it ’s safe to say that “ Sleep No More ’ ’ will be a new kind of experience for most theatergoers .
By now you ’ve probably figured that the show - although that word is stretched nearly beyond recognition here - has begun .
And while there wo n’t be much sitting this evening , it may be wise to buckle your metaphorical seat belt .
Imagine you ’re walking through an alley behind an abandoned school .
You pass a deserted playground , scale a flight of metal stairs , and enter the building through a rear door on the second story .
Inside , it ’s dark and disorienting .
Music plays , something menacing and familiar .
You keep moving and find yourself in a small boudoir , where the scent of perfume lingers .
You might linger , too - perhaps wondering how and when and why your night at the theater turned into a stroll through a stranger ’s bedroom .
Eventually you push aside a set of thick draperies to enter a boisterous bar , done up in decadent 1930s style , where a live band plays and beverages are made with unusual ingredients .
Question the staff , and you may learn that rosemary helps to ward off evil .
“ I was hearing about Punchdrunk from opera people , theater people , everyone , and I took note , because here was an art event breaking out of its circle and reaching the culture in a larger way , ’’ Paulus said .
“ I just knew that for my mission , to expand the boundaries of theater and move it forward , I needed to look at artists who are wrestling with that mission , too .
And they ’re at the top of their game . ’’
The idea of theater as a social , interactive event is at the heart of Paulus ’s vision , as well .
She first learned of the group in 2008 when she was in London directing “ Lost Highway , ’’ an opera based on the David Lynch film , and in the midst of planning her debut ART season .
Punchdrunk ’s “ The Masque of the Red Death , ’’ inspired by Edgar Allen Poe , was playing at an old Victorian town hall .
Punchdrunk was founded as a response to the formulaic experience of conventional theater :
Take your seat and passively observe the action onstage .
With a range of influences spanning European dance theater from the likes of Pina Bausch , the Fluxus movement , and American avant - garde theater artist Robert Wilson , the founders set out to blur the lines of presentation by bringing dance , music , art , and theater together , weaving in elements of surprise and making the audience the epicenter of the action .
“ The most difficult space is one that ’s been lived in recently , ’’ says Barrett , who has devised and designed 10 immersive theatrical productions for Punchdrunk , in such alternative venues as derelict warehouses , shuttered factories , and the garden of a 16th - century manor house , since the company ’s 2000 debut - a radical reworking of Chekhov ’s “ The Cherry Orchard ’ ’ set in a former geological survey building in Exeter , England .
“ Once it ’s been empty for a while , ghosts and echoes start to infect it .
You almost feel the rot starting to set in , and that ’s a much more creative starting point . ’’
Punchdrunk ’s creative team sat down for an interview back in May , when it was in town scouting deserted buildings , and spoke with the Globe again a few weeks ago during a tour of the partially finished Old Lincoln School set .
The school fit the group ’s top criteria for a space : lots of it , with age and character .
These are artists who get excited at the sight of chipped paint and peeling wallpaper .
“ That ’s where you can find the people you ’ve come with and piece it together , ’’ says Marsh .
“ You pick your own show , ’’ says Barrett .
“ And of course at any point , you can take off your mask and go to the bar . ’’
Cast of 17 , no dialogue Punchdrunk first staged “ Sleep No More ’ ’ in 2003 with a tiny budget in a much smaller space .
Eight members of the original cast will appear in this year ’s far more elaborate staging , which features triple the space , a cast of 17 , and a nightly audience of up to 300 people , who will arrive at staggered times and , outfitted with masks , be set loose in small groups of as few as five - or , for a lucky or unlucky handful , one .
Shakespeare aficionados will be heartened to learn that the complete story of “ Macbeth ’ ’ is told during the course of the evening , albeit without a word of dialogue and with a large dose of creative license .
Doyle jokes that Shakespeare probably just never got around to writing about Banquo ’s dalliance with one of the witches .

Doyle jokes that Shakespeare probably just never got around to writing about Banquo ’s dalliance with one of the witches .
“ We ’ve lifted the quintessential images and created an alternative physical and visual text of the play , ’’ Doyle explains .
“ We work with dancers who are actors and actors who can really move , and have come up with this hybrid of performers who are very dynamic .
The space is so epic it will eat you up and you ’ll be ignored if you ’re not really charismatic and alive . ’’
One of those performers is Sarah Dowling , an associate artist at the Royal Opera House in London and a Punchdrunk veteran who plays Lady Macbeth in “ Sleep No More . ’’
She describes the relationship with the audience at a Punchdrunk show as the most extraordinary a performer can hope to have .
“ There ’s nowhere to hide , ’’ Dowling says .
“ They can literally be breathing down your neck , looking into your eyes the way only someone very close to you would normally .
All of the rules are thrown up in the air because of this allowed proximity and intimacy .
I feel powerful , like I can really take them on my journey . ’’
That proximity can also be disruptive , depending on the audience .
Dowling recalls one Punchdrunk production that was presented in collaboration with Britain ’s Big Chill Festival , an alternative music gathering that draws a young , party - oriented crowd .
“ We ’d have people who were drunk or heightened in some way , and they really tested the boundary between performer and audience in a way that tested our control of the situation , ’’ Dowling says .
“ Ultimately , we want to lead the audience . ’’
For all the freedom enjoyed by the audience , “ Sleep No More ’ ’ unfolds within a phenomenally complex structural framework and is 100 percent choreographed , down to where each performer is at a given moment in time , who he or she will meet and where , and how long a particular situation ( Punchdrunk ’s word for scene ) will last .
The plot unfolds in around an hour , but the evening lasts for three , meaning situations are repeated and audience members have a chance to encounter all the action .
The range of responses to Punchdrunk productions is always vast , say the creators .
Some treat the space like a giant gallery ; others are there for the storytelling .
Still others may wind up hanging out at the bar listening to the band .
“ You can learn quite a bit about yourself as a person , ’’ says Doyle , “ because you ’re placed in a situation where you have to make decisions . ’’
“ People are n’t used to doing that in a theatrical context , ’’ adds Marsh , “ and they surprise themselves with how much they ’re willing to do . ’’
Or how little .
Barrett expects American audiences will be more game than their British counterparts : “ There ’s something about the American character that ’s quite exploratory .
English audiences are actually quite reticent .
They have to be teased into it . ’’
Diane Paulus expects “ Sleep No More ’ ’ to do nothing less than change the course of American theater , and she believes the fact that Punchdrunk is making its US debut in Boston is a significant step in her mission to make this city a hub of cutting - edge art and culture .
“ New York missed it , ’’ Paulus says .
“ People are flying in from all over to see this .
It ’s going to challenge people , it ’s going to stretch what people call theater , and that ’s a conversation I ’m interested in having . ’’

Reviewing Risen here would n’t be right .
For one thing , it ’s too big and time right now is too short to mainline it in such a way .
For a second thing , to mainline it in such a way would probably be the wrong move .
This vast German RPG is really not a game designed to be rushed through .
For a third thing , it ’s the successor to the Gothic games – a series which , in the US and UK at least , has n’t reviewed anywhere near as rapturously as the reception they ’ve won from their fans ( with the exception of the much - maligned third ) .
To a fair few people , Risen is the most important game of the year .
What ’s the reason for this disparity of opinion and enthusiasm ?
Well , that ’s probably another post .
For this post , the first of several , I want to do something else – I simply want to play the game at a leisurely / sporadic pace .
As I do so , I ’m going to document my experiences , as a mix of narrative and opinion .
Narrapinion
I ’d call it , if I was a massive arsehole .
What I ’m hoping to see during this is what Gothic / Risen ’s fans see , rather than solely what a critic with a deadline and at least a veneer of mainstream - focused objectivity would see .
Take Eurogamer ’s controversial review , for instance – many of its complaints concern the game ’s failings on a technical level .
I ’m not saying there ’s anything wrong with that ( though I ’ll admit I had a bit of an eye - roll moment when he went off on one about file sizes ) , as the aim is to be a buyer ’s guide for folk who are n’t hardcore RPG players .
But it ’s not what I want to do in these posts .
I want to experience and understand the factors that make people adore these games , and passing critical judgement upon Risen is very much a secondary concern .
Whether or not I end up loving the experience myself should n’t matter .
Though I ’m pretty sure it ’ll be obvious if I ’m not , as I ’m an inveterate moaner .
( On which note , it ’s worth pointing out that I ’m going to go into much more fine detail than I would were this a review , both good and bad .
So if I whine at length about something minor , do n’t take it as me giving the boot to the game and get all cross .
I ’m just saying what I see , and writing these fairly stream - of - consciousness .
I daresay at the end of all this I ’ll offer a broader judgement of the game , but not yet .
I ’m a long , long way off having a definite opinion about it . )
Either usefully , annoyingly or both , I have n’t played any of the Gothics previously – outside of their essential structure , all I really know about them is that any mention of them tends to result in a odd cocktail of enthusiasm and bitterness from their fans .
Arguments in support of them often tend to be less about why they ’re great , and more about chastising people who do n’t play them or jealously accusing Oblivion of being the end times for roleplaying .
Man , screw all that .
Let ’s just talk about Risen .
So , Night One .
I awake washed up on a tropical yet gloomy beach , surrounded by fragments of the Inquisition ship I ’d stowed away on and the bodies of my nautical companions .
The first instinct I follow in this unfamiliar place is , perhaps understandably , a familiar one – I play the packrat .
If it ’s not nailed down , I pick it up .
This immediately reveals an interesting aspect of Risen – it ’s happy to fill its world with minor clutter .
A shipwreck leaves a lot of detritus , and when you ’re penniless and lost , a great deal of that would be useful .
In a lot of other RPGs , I ’d expect to find a sword conveniently lying in front of me , then I ’d head off on my merry way .
Here , I lose a good five minutes to combing the shore for gold , jewellery , food , booze and bits of stick I can use to hit giant vultures with .
Perhaps I ’m wasting my time – I do n’t have any sense of how useful all this junk I ’ve collected is in the long ( or even short ) term .
But I like that I can do it – it makes both the world and the shipwreck seem that much more believable .
My interfacing with it is n’t limited to one magic crate or something .
Still , the object collection interface is finickity and rudimentary , popping up an item ’s name in a really lousy font only when I ’m stood right on top of it , and refusing to do even this if I have the temerity to have a weapon equipped .
I can imagine someone defending this latter , Darkfall - style , saying it ’s only right that you ca n’t pick something up when you ’ve got something in your hand – and they ’re not wrong .
But I ’m not even able to see the name of something if I have my weapon out .
How does holding something make me blind to things on the floor ?
That ’s not a design decision I understand .
The unfortunate effect of it is I ’m constantly having to remember to put my weapon away at the end of a fight , or I ’ll miss a load of pick - uppables .
Once my scavenging comes to an end , I finally turn my attention to the most noticeable body on the beach .
Who is n’t a body at all – she ’s merely unconcious , and was a fellow – and thus friendly - stowaway .
I ’d been avoiding her until now – and , to be honest , that ’s because I ’ve been nervous about the quality of the voice - acting .
I ’m horribly susceptible to lousy voice - acting and / or translation to English making it near - impossible for me to lose myself in a game .
I do n’t want to start feeling sour towards Risen so quickly .
But I click on her now .
She starts talking – and she ’s pretty good .
She ’s voiced confidently by a posh-ish English lady who seems to get her emphasises right and puts plenty of verve into it .
A shame about her character model , which I ca n’t help but perceive a peurile intent behind .
She ’s all washboard - stomach and physically improbable bosom , wearing an outfit that ’s somewhere between noblewoman and stripper .
At this earliest of stages , I do n’t have the foggiest what the game ’s general attitude to women is – but the first example Risen gives of it is not a positive one .
I ’m not singling Risen out as having uncommonly unhealthy sexual politics here – grud only knows it ’s one of videogaming ’s most habitual sins .
It ’s more that , as well as being disappointingly teenage , her ( not terribly well - rendered , for that matter ) porn - fantasy appearance does n’t mesh with the air of ruin , strife and grime the game otherwise tries to convey .
Still – the voice actor ’s sterling work genuinely helps keep some of the tawdriness in check .
Then my character opens his mouth , and my great fear returns .
Flat , poorly - timed , sounds exactly like he ’s reading the script for the first time …
Bugger – and this is a voice I ’m going to be stuck with for the game ’s duration .
Dammit , Pirhana Bytes – how could you get such an important aspect of your game so horribly wrong ?
No doubt the German ( the developers ’ native language ) guy ’s a lot better , but this chap ’s bad news .
At least the translation seems pretty solid .
Onwards , and bird - thumping .
Combat ’s pretty straightforward at this early stage at least , a simple matter of real - time clicking for real - time thumping – if there are dice - rolls going on in the background , they ’re not at all evident .
My only gripe is that giant vultures seem to understand how swords work a bit too well , able to expertly and precisely jump backwards at the split - second I lunge .
I ’d expect that of a human , but I ’m pretty sure seabirds are n’t trained in fencing .
It stops me from simply steam - rollering through them , at least .
Another thing I enjoy is that the sea vultures are genuinely rather intimidating .
It ’s often the case that the early stages of RPGs pitch up you against something incredibly and obviously puny , which hardly makes you feel like Captain Hero .
I ’ll never forget how hard I laughed at the start of Star Wars Galaxies , when epic , John Williamsesque music soundtracked my thumping a mound of mud and a butterfly with a stick .
Here , however , the first thing I fight is big , ugly and makes frightening sounds .
It makes me feel like my life is in danger , and it makes me feel a certain survivalist satisfaction when I take the thing down .
The game does n’t explain much about its combat system , but I do n’t think it needs to – it seems agreeably organic , a mix of frantic clicking and observing your enemies ’ attack patterns .
It ’s not a one off , either – a little way up the road , I ’m fighting porcupine - rats and giant moths .
The first is openly silly , but the second are horrible – palpably vicious and sinister .
A lot of it ’s in the sounds , all malevolent hissing and creepily protracted death rattles .
Risen certainly seems a dab hand at creating an atmosphere of wildness and hostility , even if its people seem distractingly stilted and doll - like .
Risen ’s saddled , it seems , with more rough edges than the pyramid of Giza , yet at the same time it creates an impressively believable place .
I ’m looking forward to getting lost in it , even if I only have the vaguest sense of what ’s going on so far .
Hmm .
There was quite a lot more I ’d planned to say in this first post , but I want to keep these reasonably short .
More tomorrow – including gnome - bashing , meat - frying , drinking like an animal and more worrying about women .
When no one was around , Jassi Kaur quietly slipped into her niece 's room , where the 19 - year - old woman sat huddled in a corner sobbing .
Angry relatives had confronted her for one reason : she had a boyfriend .
" It was awful , " Kaur recalls .
She cradled the girl , told her everything would be fine .
It was n't .
Weeks later , in January , the entire clan – which resides in a sprawling house in Brampton – flew to Punjab , India 's northern province .
Within days , the Grade 12 student was married to a man she had never met before .
Sandeep Chand , 34 , a manager of client care for a bank in Victoria , B.C. , has been forcibly married twice ( see accompanying story ) .
" I hear stories like that almost every day , " says Deepa Mattoo , a community legal worker at the South Asian Legal Clinic in Toronto .
" The surprising thing is that many parents believe there 's nothing wrong with it ... they think they are doing what is the best for their child . "
Forced marriages have garnered little attention in this country .
But the plight of Canadian teen Hardeep Flora , who two weeks ago fought her way back to Canada after contacting consulate officials in India , has suddenly cast a spotlight on a deeply hidden form of abuse .
In Flora 's case , the 19 - year - old had been whisked away by family to Punjab where her money and travel documents were taken away .
She was told she could n't leave until she was married .
A phone call to the Canadian consulate led to a dramatic rescue .
Every year , dozens of young Canadian girls , and occasionally boys , are forced into marriages , social workers say .
Mattoo , who has been working with the South Asian legal clinic for three years , sees at least two dozen cases annually .
A majority involve families of South Asian origin , but girls have also been taken back to the Middle East or African nations like Sudan and Egypt , and coerced into marriage .
" It 's a cross-cultural and cross- racial issue , " says Zahra Dhanani , legal director for the Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children .
" It 's all about power , control and dominance ...
It might happen more among South Asians , but I have had clients from Nigeria , South Africa , Europe and even WASP-y Canadians . "
Dhanani cites the marriages of underage members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in Bountiful , B.C. , as an example of forced marriage among Caucasians .
The most common motive is preservation of culture .
" Parents think if they marry their daughter off to someone who was born and raised in , say , Pakistan , it will help preserve the culture , " says Mattoo .
" What they do n't understand is that they are wreaking havoc on their kids ' lives . "
Some parents see it as carrying on a long - standing tradition of arranged marriage – whether the kids agree to it or not .
Mattoo tells people an arranged marriage is one where you have a choice ; in a forced marriage you have no choice .
Forced marriage can also be a matter of family honour .
" It 's acceptable if the son is dating someone , but God save you if you , a girl , have a boyfriend , " says Amandeep Kaur , manager of Punjabi Community Health Services .
" It 's totally unacceptable . "
HARVINDER SIDHU , a long - haul truck driver from Brampton , says he and his 21 - year - old girlfriend were engaged to be married two years ago .
The wedding date was set , cards designed and a banquet hall booked for the occasion .
" My girlfriend and I were really excited , " says Sidhu , 25 .
" We had even checked out some apartments in Mississauga . "
Then his girlfriend and her parents went on an unexpected trip to India .
When they returned a month later , Sidhu 's girlfriend was married .
" I just spoke to her once after that , " he says .
" She says she was coerced into getting married .
Her father was unwell and put pressure on her to marry someone in the same caste . "
A common modus operandi is for the family to take the girl to their native country under some pretext .
Once there , she is pressured into marrying a man the family has chosen .
Some see their husbands for the first time on their engagement or wedding day .
Earlier this year , schoolteachers in England were urged to be aware of signs of possible forced marriages , since schools and colleges are often the only places where a potential victim can speak freely .
In 2005 , England set up a Forced Marriage Unit , run jointly by the Home Office and Foreign Office .
It received 1,600 reports of forced marriages last year , and intervened in 420 cases .
A specialized British team has launched secret rescue missions to bring home victims held captive by their families abroad .
The unit also runs shelters in New Delhi , India ; Lahore , Pakistan ; and Dhaka , Bangladesh , among other cities in the world .

" We have a lot of work to do yet before clamouring for a similar unit , " says Ritu Chokshi , coordinator of the South Asian Legal Clinic 's forced marriages project , which started in 2005 .
Its advisory board includes members of the federal departments of justice , foreign affairs and international trade .
" If we put emphasis on prevention , there 's a lot we can achieve . "
The federal justice department has researched cases involving forced marriage in Western Canada .
A similar study has been done in Montreal and Toronto but results have not been released , says spokesperson Carole Saindon .
Chokshi and Mattoo organize workshops to help parents and children understand the concepts of honour and marriage .
Depending on circumstances , Mattoo advises young girls to fight if they are being forced into marriage .
" But if I think the woman is in mortal danger , I advise her to lay low , get married and get back to Canada quickly . "
Once here , she tells them not to file sponsorship papers for the husband .
If the papers have already been filed , her advice is to withdraw them .
Meantime , she tries to get the marriage annulled or start divorce proceedings .
But in the past year Mattoo has noticed a disturbing trend .
" I 've seen that many girls forced into marriages are brought back when they are pregnant , " ensuring they do n't leave their new husbands once back in Canada .
Firdaus Ali , of the Alliance for South Asian AIDS Prevention in Toronto , says forced marriage is n't just a heterosexual issue .
Gays and lesbians are also forced into matrimony because parents believe it will " cure them of the disease . "
The results are tragic .
" It leads to turmoil , mental health issues and even depression . "
The worst , says Ali , is not being able to tell anyone " because of the shame factor . "
Because the situation involves family members , rarely do victims of a forced marriage press charges , says Manjit Mangat , a Brampton lawyer .
He recalls a particularly angry Brampton man who once turned to him for help .
His 19 - year - old girlfriend had been travelling in Pakistan when her parents suddenly announced she was getting married .
The girl escaped and returned to Toronto , but would not press charges .
" I do n't understand that but I guess that 's our culture , " says Mangat .
" That is among other things that has to change .
You just cannot accept what happens to you . "
Jassi Kaur 's niece , now 20 , is back in Canada .
She has filed sponsorship papers for her new husband , still in India but waiting to join her .
Kaur says there is little she can do for that niece .
But now she worries for the young woman 's sister .
She does n't think she can stand by and watch another forced marriage in the family .
" I can't see it happening a second time , " she said .

You ’d think they ’d at least read the thing .
A Senate committee has finished a version of a sweeping health - care reform bill — but at least one senator admits he has no intention of reading it .
“ I do n’t expect to actually read the legislative language because . . . the legislative language is among the more confusing things I ’ve ever read in my life , ” Sen . Thomas Carper ( D - Del. ) told an online news service .
And Carper says he doubts his fellow members of the Senate Finance Committee will read their handiwork either .
The committee finished hashing out details of the health - care reform bill at around 2 a.m. Friday .
But by yesterday , they still were n’t sure exactly what ’s in it .
Carper told CNSnews.com that the bill was “ incomprehensible ” and “ hard stuff to understand . ”
The committee is drafting a summary of the awkwardly worded bill , which is aimed at providing affordable health insurance to all Americans .
The summary would put the legislation in plain language for the public .
But at least one senator expressed suspicion that the summary would not tell the full story .
“ The conceptual language is not good enough , ” committee member Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) told CNSnews.com .
“ We ’ve seen that there are side deals that have been cut , ” Cornyn said .
“ So we need to know not only the conceptual language , we need to know the detailed legislative language , and we need to know what kind of secret deals have been cut on the side which would have an impact on how much this bill is going to cost and how it will affect health care in America . ”
A proposal that would have required the committee to publicly post the full text of the bill online 72 hours before the vote was rejected last week .
The 72 - hour proposal would n’t have helped anyone , Carper said .
“ I think if people had the chance to read that , they ’ll say you know maybe it does n’t make much sense for either the legislators or me to read that kind of arcane language , ” he said .
“ It ’s just hard to decipher what it really means . ”
In his weekly address to the nation yesterday , President Obama praised the Senate committee for its hard work drafting the bill , which he said was crucial for economic recovery .
“ Reforming our health - insurance system will be a critical step in rebuilding economy , ” Obama said .

“ I hate the guts of English grammar , ” an illustrious stylist once wrote .
Reader , perhaps you can relate .
But would you believe it if I told you the writer was E. B. White , as in half of Strunk and White , those august ambassadors of precision and clarity behind “ The Elements of Style ” ?
This grain of wit is one among many unearthed by Mark Garvey in “ Stylized , ” his “ slightly obsessive ” history of “ Elements , ” which is much more than basic history and undeniably obsessive .
Garvey , a writer and editor apparently drawn to minutiae ( a previous book was “ Come Together : The Official John Lennon Educational Tour Bus Guide to Music and Video ” ) , gives us Strunk ’s and White ’s lives and credos ; a meticu­lous record of “ Elements ” emendations ; a survey of the shifting theoretical winds in English departments ; expositions on the morality of writing — a whole lot for a 200 - page book .
( Then again , “ Elements ” is no lightweight tract , and it is half as long . )
Many people already know that in 1957 , White received from a friend a 43 - page version of “ Elements , ” which William Strunk Jr. , a professor of his at Cornell , had self - published in 1918 .
In a “ Letter From the East , ” White introduced New Yorker readers to what was known on campus as “ ‘ the little book ’ . . . stress on the word ‘ little . ’ ” It was meant to relieve the tedium of correcting papers ( teachers could jot in the margins “ See Rule 9 ! ” ) .
White admired “ Elements ” for the “ audacity ” of its author , for its “ clear , brief , bold ” advice leavened by “ Strunkian humor . ”
But now we have the full back story .
Strunk , a philologist versed in Sanskrit , Icelandic , Old Bulgarian and “ the history of French verbs , ” met White , a gifted student with no time for dreary courses — he got a D in English before finding Strunk — in 1919 .
Kindred spirits who talked shop while sipping “ shandygaff ” ( diluted beer ) , they stayed in touch as White ’s star rose , until Strunk ’s death in 1946 .

Obama agrees to keep Israel 's nukes secret
President Obama has reaffirmed a 4 - decade - old secret understanding that has allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections , three officials familiar with the understanding said .
The officials , who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were discussing private conversations , said Mr. Obama pledged to maintain the agreement when he first hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in May .
Under the understanding , the U.S. has not pressured Israel to disclose its nuclear weapons or to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which could require Israel to give up its estimated several hundred nuclear bombs .
Israel had been nervous that Mr. Obama would not continue the 1969 understanding because of his strong support for nonproliferation and priority on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
The U.S. and five other world powers made progress during talks with Iran in Geneva on Thursday as Iran agreed in principle to transfer some potential bomb fuel out of the country and to open a recently disclosed facility to international inspection .

( CNN ) -- Scientists at NASA have discovered a nearly invisible ring around Saturn -- one so large that it would take 1 billion Earths to fill it .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a massive , nearly invisible ring around Saturn .
The ring 's orbit is tilted 27 degrees from the planet 's main ring plane .
The bulk of it starts about 3.7 million miles ( 6 million km ) away from the planet and extends outward another 7.4 million miles ( 12 million km ) .
Its diameter is equivalent to 300 Saturns lined up side to side .
And its entire volume can hold one billion Earths , NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said late Tuesday .
" This is one supersized ring , " said Anne Verbiscer , an astronomer at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville .
Verbiscer and two others are authors of a paper about the discovery published Wednesday in the journal Nature .
The obvious question :
Why did it take scientists so long to discover something so massive ?
The ring is made up of ice and dust particles that are so far apart that " if you were to stand in the ring , you would n't even know it , " Verbiscer said in a statement .
Also , Saturn does n't receive a lot of sunlight , and the rings do n't reflect much visible light .
But the cool dust -- about 80 Kelvin ( minus 316 degrees Fahrenheit ) -- glows with thermal radiation .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , used to spot the ring , picked up on the heat .
One of Saturn 's moons , Phoebe , orbits within the ring .
As Phoebe collides with comets , it kicks up planetary dust .
Scientists believe the ice and dust particles that make up the ring stems from those collisions .
The ring may also help explain an age - old mystery surrounding another of Saturn 's moons : Iapetus .
Astronomer Giovanni Cassini , who first spotted Iapetus in 1671 , deduced the moon has a white and dark side -- akin to a yin -yang symbol .
But scientists did not know why .
The new ring orbits in the opposite direction to Iapetus .
And , say researchers , it 's possible that the moon 's dark coloring is a result of the ring 's dust particles splattering against Iapetus like bugs on a windshield .
" Astronomers have long suspected that there is a connection between Saturn 's outer moon Phoebe and the dark material on Iapetus , " said Douglas Hamilton of the University of Maryland in College Park -- one of the three authors reporting on the findings in the journal Nature .
" This new ring provided convincing evidence of that relationship . "

Fitness can be intimidating .
Even small , mom-and - pop gyms are usually full of weird - looking machines , equipment you do n't know how to use , and unapproachable people lugging around milk cartons full of pink water .
Most of us new to the world of weights will walk into a gym feeling immediately overwhelmed .
There 's so much going on it's difficult to even know where to begin !
That 's when the non-scary elliptical calls your name .
Your friendly neighborhood cardio machines have never failed you , so you jump on one and start swooshing .
And that 's where you stay , silently watching other people go about their awesome - looking workouts .
When you finally muster the courage to try some resistance training , you 'll likely head over to the machines .
You 'll choose an open one , read the directions , and then try to copy whatever the model is doing in the pictures .
" WTF am I doing ? " you may ask yourself as you go through the motions .
" Is this even right ?
I swear those directions do n't make any sense .
Good God , I hope no one is watching me ! "
After your bout with the machines , you think about making your way to the dumbbell rack , but it 's overrun with huge , muscle - bound guys doing their best to out - bro each other .

Training : Weight Training For A Better Body
Many women worry that weight training will somehow transform them into Hulk - ettes , so they spend hours doing cardio in order to maintain their " feminine " figure .
The truth is , women just do n't have the hormonal support to gain muscle mass like men .
The hormone testosterone is responsible for large increases in muscle mass .
Women 's testosterone levels are a fraction of men's .
That means you can bench press without concerning yourself about how much chest hair you might grow .
There are women , typically professional bodybuilders , who look masculine .
It takes many , many years of dedication and a particular lifestyle to achieve this sort of muscularity .
Unless you have goals of becoming the next star in female bodybuilding , you do n't ever need to worry about looking too masculine .
You 're right about one thing , though : training with weights will increase your lean muscle mass .
That 's a good thing !
The more muscle you have , the more calories your body will burn .
The more calories you burn , the leaner you 'll get .
Increased muscle mass will also add shape to your arms , take inches from your tummy , and even add some roundness to your booty !
When women 's magazines talk about " tone , " they 're really talking about strong muscles .

Curve Appeal : Your 12 - Week Weight Training Program
This program is meant to improve your strength , muscle size , and conditioning simultaneously .
Each four - week block will build upon the strength and skill you learn from the previous four weeks .
The general format for every workout is as follows :
1. Warm-up
Each of your workouts should include a warm - up that will activate your muscles , prepare your central nervous system for the workout , and increase your blood flow to your muscles .
It 's also a great idea to do foam rolling before each workout .
For leg workouts , roll the quads , hamstrings , IT band , piriformis , and calves .
For upper - body workouts , roll the shoulder , chest , triceps , and biceps .
2. Activation Movement for Speed and Mobility
This movement is done for 20 reps .
You do n't have to do all 20 reps in one set .
Choose a set and rep scheme which will allow you to perform all 20 reps without feeling fatigued .
3. Prime Movement for Muscle Strength
Each workout will include a prime , compound movement .
You will perform these compound movements for 5 sets of 5 reps .
Be sure to challenge yourself with weight .
Prime movements should be heavier than assistance movements .
Rest 1 - 2 minutes between sets .
4. Assistance Work for Muscle Shape
These exercises will help add shape to your musculature .
Perform them for 8 - 12 reps .
There 's no need to go ultra heavy while you perform these movements .
Rest on all assistance movements should be as short as possible , but not so short that you must reduce the weight .
5. Conditioning for Cardiovascular Health and Fat Loss
Your cardio will come in a couple different forms .
On each day you train with weights , you 'll do 20 minutes of high - intensity intervals .
Choose an interval scheme that 's challenging , but not impossible .
Thirty seconds of all - out work , followed by 1 minute of recovery is usually a good place to start .
One day per week , you 'll do 30 - 45 minutes of low - intensity cardio .
On these days , you can jump on your favorite cardio machine for some extra fat - burning .

Must - Haves For Building Your Own Program
If you 're a DIY kind of girl , you might want to build your own program .
If that 's the case , here 's what every weightlifting regimen needs :
Compound Lifts
Compound lifts are lifts that take more than one muscle group to perform .
If you want to add some strength - building aspects to your program , be sure to include one or two of these compound lifts in every workout you do .
Along with helping you build lean muscle , these movements are important for increasing your athleticism , strength , mobility , and cardiovascular fitness .
Because you use more than one muscle group to do these lifts , you need more energy ( calories ) to perform them .
Squats , for example , will give you more bang for your workout buck than leg press because you have to use more of your muscles and , therefore more energy , to do them .
Example Compound Lifts
Accessory Lifts
Accessory or isolation lifts are used as partners to compound lifts .
Depending on the volume of your compound lift , you can add 2 - 4 accessory lifts per day .
Bodybuilding programs are often built on isolation movements .
Isolation movements are single - joint exercises .
These are used to increase the shape and size of a body part — if you want to improve your aesthetics , isolation lifts are perfect .
For example , if you 'd like to isolate your biceps , then you 'd do biceps curls .
To isolate your calves , you 'd do exercises like calf raises which exclusively target your calf muscles .
For more exercises and how to perform them properly , check out our Exercise Database !
Example Accessory / Isolation Lifts
Choosing Sets and Reps
The bodybuilder standby for sets and reps is usually 3 - 4 sets of 8 - 12 reps .
That 's usually the right rep range for muscle growth ( hypertrophy ) .
If you 're a beginner , make sure your first rep looks just like your last rep .
If you fail on the 8th rep , use lighter weight .
If you 're unfamiliar with many of the movements , stick with lighter weight until you have a great foundation and feel comfortable challenging yourself ; this will help you avoid injury .
Shape is great for your muscles , but strength is also important .
To work on your strength , do heavier compound movements in the 4 - 6 rep range .
Traditionally , compound lifts are done with fewer reps and isolation / accessory movements are done with lighter weight for more reps .
Rest
The less time you rest between sets , the more difficult and intense your workout will be .
Short rest periods ( 30 - 45 seconds ) will tax your muscles and your cardiovascular system .
Longer rest periods ( 1 - 2 minutes ) will give you more time to recover before you hit your next set .
Progression
Progression is the secret ingredient for every successful training program .
It 's the reason your body changes over time .
You can't do the exact same movements using the exact same weight for weeks and weeks and weeks and expect new results .
You have to constantly push yourself .
Once you develop a solid base , increase the weights , increase the reps , or decrease the rest periods .
Cardio
Your cardio regimen should depend entirely on your goals , likes , and dislikes .
Here are some options :
High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT )
HIIT cardio is the most effective for fat - burning , and it 's actually really easy to do .
Choose a cardio machine , a piece of equipment like a Kettlebell , or just use your bodyweight .
The point is to do intervals of movement as intensely as you can .
At first , go for something like 30 seconds of work followed by one minute of rest .
Do these intervals for 20 minutes .
As you get better , you can increase the work time and decrease the rest time .
Weight Training
If you loathe cardio and do n't want to go anywhere near a treadmill , you can still burn fat effectively .
Decrease your rest periods during weight training .
If you generally rest 90 seconds between sets , start resting just 60 seconds .
The minimal rest will keep your heart rate up and help your body use more energy .
Low Intensity Steady State ( LISS )
This is probably the most popular form of cardio for most women .
Who has n't spent 30 minutes on the elliptical ?
However , LISS may not be the most effective way to burn fat .
LISS is often utilized by bodybuilders or other competitors on extremely low - carb diets who just do n't have the energy to do 20 minutes of high - intensity cardio .
Endurance Training
If you want and like to run , then you 'll definitely want some long - duration rides or runs in your program .
If you 're training for a marathon , half marathon , or even a 5 k , do your long runs on days that you 're not lifting .
That way , you 'll have maximum energy to put into your training .
Nutrition : Food For A Better Body
Most people dread the word " diet " because it dredges up images of celery stick buffets and long lists of no - no foods .
While it's hard to shake this negative association , it 's important to learn that " diet " is n't a bad word .
Before the media beat its true definition to a bloody pulp , a diet was simply any and all foods consumed by a person .
Your diet , or the food you eat , is a crucial aspect to supporting your fitness goals .
The nutrition section of most weight training guides will try to shove a boilerplate nutrition plan in your face , but that 's not how we roll .
We want to instill the idea that — metabolically and physiologically — your body is unique .
What works for someone else may not work for you .
Understanding how your own body works and discovering your dietary needs are important concepts to remember as you form your own nutritional strategy .
All About Calories
Calories are essentially food energy that your body uses to power its daily functions like breathing , regulating your heartbeat , digestion , and so on .
The number of calories a food provides depends on its makeup .
Every food is made of a combination of carbohydrates , protein , and fat .
Collectively , these are called " macronutrients . "
Everybody requires a minimum number of calories to , well , live .
This minimum number is called the basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) and can be influenced by the amount of lean muscle mass a person has .
The overall number of calories your body uses on a daily basis is the sum of your BMR and additional calories you use walking , standing , sleeping , exercising , driving , and even laughing .
Altogether they comprise the total energy expenditure ( TEE ) , or your daily caloric needs .
Everybody 's TEE is a little different , so a diet which works for your BFF may not work for you .
Generally , men have a higher TEE than women because they have more muscle mass .
Macronutrients , Baby !
The three macronutrients are : protein , carbs , and fat .
Together they make up all the calories , or food energy , in the food you eat .
They 're important to distinguish because each has a different role in the body .
Protein
Protein is a key component to building lean muscle and transforming your body .
No , eating more protein wo n't suddenly make your muscles huge .
Building lean muscle though , is essential to that " toned " look everybody 's going for .
Protein is made up of amino acids , which are the body 's building blocks for a number of functions , including making muscle protein .
Lifting weights causes stress and damage within muscle fibers , which then need to be repaired .
This see -saw of muscle breakdown ( catabolism ) during exercise and repair ( anabolism ) during rest help you become stronger and fitter overtime .
The general guideline for an active individual 's intake of protein is about one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight .
If you weigh 135 pounds , you would aim to eat approximately 135 grams of protein .
Since it 's difficult to consume that much protein in two or three meals , people tend to spread it out over multiple meals and ensure that some form of protein accompanies every meal .
Each gram of protein provides 4 calories .
Good Sources of Protein :
Lean meats
Eggs
Milk
Greek yogurt
Quinoa
Nuts
Beans
Soy
Fat
Poor fat : so misunderstood and neglected .
Dietary fats got a bad rap due to a major landmark study from the 80s that — very erroneously — concluded dietary fats promote incidences of heart attacks and other illnesses .
As a result of this , the government promoted eating as little fat as possible and corporations rolled out their fat - free and reduced fat foods to save everyone from their exploding hearts .
In reality , fats demand a rightful spot on your plate ; they are integral to maintaining optimal health .
After all , they are a macronutrient that your body needs to function .
Essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) like omega - 6 and omega - 3s help keep you feeling full , cushion vital organs , assist with absorbing fat - soluble vitamins , maintain proper brain cognition and development , and are responsible for a slew other benefits .
The only fat you should avoid is trans fat , which the food industry adds to food to extend shelf life .
Check food labels for any form of " hydrogenated oils ; " this immediately marks a food product as something you should n't eat .
Keep dietary fats in ; throw trans fats out !
Moreover , fat does not make you fat .
The notion that ingested fat quickly buries itself into your tissues has long been debunked .
Gaining weight is normally attributed to eating too many calories , more than what your body knows to do with .
Each gram of fat provides 9 calories .
Good Sources of Fat :
Avocados
Olive oil
Coconut oil
Grassfed butter / Ghee
Nuts
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are another macronutrient which shares fat 's bad reputation .
Despite what many people would have you believe , carbs are not evil .
Carbohydrates constitute all sugars , including single - molecule simple sugars and double compound sugars .
When three or more sugar molecules are strung together , they form complex carbohydrates in foods like potatoes , oatmeal , broccoli , and myriad vegetables .
The majority of your carbohydrates should come from these complex carbs because they take a little longer to digest , making you feel fuller for longer , and do n't raise blood sugar as quickly as simple sugars .
The added bonus is that complex carbs pack a whole lot of nutritional love in the form of vitamins , minerals , and fiber .
Both simple and complex carbs have a place in your diet , but long - term success in managing blood sugar levels and weight can depend on limiting your intake of simple sugars .
Each gram of carbohydrates provides 4 calories .
Good Sources of Carbs :
Oatmeal
Vegetables like broccoli , spinach , potatoes
Bananas
Berries
Brown rice
Yogurt
Low - fat milk
Should I go low carb to lose weight ?
One popular recommendation for weight loss is going " low carb . "
The range for what exactly constitutes low - carb varies among different individuals , but in general the target range runs between eating fewer than 50 - 150 grams of carbs per day .
Fifty grams of carbs is equal to about one cup of raisin bran cereal or two slices of bread .
It 's not difficult to hit that target in one meal , or even a snack .
To replace your carb - noshing habits , you 'd have to include higher amounts of good fats and protein in your diet .
While many people advocate eating a low - carb diet for weight loss , it 's not always ideal .
Weight loss may come easily at first , but chronically low amounts of carbohydrates could have negative downstream effects in the long run .
A woman 's delicately balanced hormone system can be disrupted by low carb availability , which could bring about unwanted side effects like loss of bone density and chronic sleep deprivation .
On a low - carb diet , some women may experience stopped or irregular periods because the body perceives chronically low energy levels as starvation and stress .
That said , some women can thrive on a low - carb diet .
If you want to experiment with low carbohydrates , it 's important to monitor your body 's response closely .
Your Body Type and Your Nutrition
The ratio of how many calories you get from proteins , carbs , and fats is important to your body composition .
The general macronutrient composition split is 40 percent carbs , 30 percent fat , and 30 percent protein , but that ratio does n't work for everybody .
For a more accurate and personal macronutrient ratio , it 's a good idea to figure out your body type .
An individual 's body type is more than just physique ; it provides crucial information on how your body responds to and processes the macronutrients .
Body types are classified into three categories :
Ectomorph
In general , ectomorphs are lean with smaller bone structures and limbs , have a high metabolism , and can tolerate higher amounts of carbohydrates .
They look like : long - distance runners
Recommended macronutrients ratio : 50 % carbohydrates , 30 % protein , 20 % fat
Mesomorph
Mesomorphs tend to marry the best of both worlds , offering balanced abilities to gain muscle and stay lean relatively easily .
They are of medium sized bone structure and look athletic .
They look like : bodybuilders , gymnasts
Recommended macronutrients ratio : 40 % carbohydrates , 30 % protein , 30 % fat
Endomorph
Endormorphs are built to be larger and more powerful .
They tend to have larger bone structures for strength .
Because of their size , they do better on a higher fat and a lower carbohydrate intake .
They look like : powerlifters
Recommended macronutrients ratio : 25 % carbohydrates , 35 % protein , 40 % fat
Rarely do people fit perfectly in these boxes .
People often display mixed characteristics .
Portion Control
Calorie counting is a popular technique to keep track of portion sizes and the amount of calories in them .
This meticulous record - keeping of daily food intake certainly has its benefits , but who wants to maintain spreadsheets of their food for the rest of their lives ?
Calorie counting should not be a life - long endeavor .
It just does n't effectively work in the long term .
Studies show that calorie counting is prone to inaccuracy by upward of 25 percent — even if you triple - check your calculations and sources !
The discrepancy arises from measurement errors on food labels , serving sizes and measurements which are impossible to reproduce consistently , different food quality , and a whole lot of guesswork .
A more manageable way to track your eating habits is to identify reasonable portion sizes .
Most restaurants in America shove heaping piles of food in your face to appeal to your economical compass .
More food means more value for your money , right ?
Getting more Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp for your buck merely means you pay for it elsewhere , like your waistline .
And it 's not just at restaurants .
People pile their plates high with Grandma 's spaghetti even when they 're at home .
Studies have shown that when given enormous food portions , people will override their internal satiety systems and gobble up every last morsel long after they " feel " full — and not really realize they 're doing it .
Get a Handle on Portion Control
Eating until you feel " full " is not always the best way to determine your portion sizes .
Instead , we recommend using the most convenient and personalized measurement tool at your disposal : your hands
Use your palm to determine your protein intake
Use your balled fist to determine your vegetables
Use your cupped hand to determine your carbs
Use your thumb to determine your fat
Assuming you eat approximately four meals per day , here 's the portion recommendation at each meal :
For Ectomorphs
2 cupped hands of carbs
1 palm of protein
1 balled fist of veggies
1/2 thumb of fat
For Mesomorphs
1 cupped hand of carbs
1 palm of protein
1 balled fist of vegetables
1 thumb of fat
For Endomorphs
1/2 cupped hand of carbs
1 palm of protein
1 balled fist of vegetables
2 thumbs of fat
These are good general guidelines because your hands are proportional to your body size .
Be flexible and adjust your portions according to how you feel and the way you look .
For example , if you 've been gaining unwanted weight , try reducing your carbs to half of your cupped hands per meal and your fat to half of your thumb .
Meal Frequency
Whether you eat many small meals throughout the day or wolf down all your food in two meals , meal frequency should revolve around your schedule and what 's comfortable for you .
As long as you get in the right foods in the right amounts any way you can , when you eat is simply a matter of preference .
Example : One - Day Meal Plan for a 125 - pound Female Mesomorph
Breakfast Egg Whites 5 Oatmeal 1/2 cup

Supplements : For A Better Body
Primarily , your diet should consist of whole foods .
Sometimes , though , you can't get all the necessary nutrients from eating whole foods — even if you think your diet is perfect .
That 's where supplements swoop in .
Supplements should complement your diet of whole foods ; they should never be a replacement for something you intentionally leave out of your diet .
The Basics
We know !
The list of available supplements is long and confusing !
Here are the three most basic products that every healthy woman should take , no matter her fitness level :
Multivitamin
A basic multivitamin offers the full gamut of nutrients your body needs .
The dosage amount for each nutrient can vary greatly from brand to brand .
It 's worth exploring the multivitamins made specifically for women ; we tend to have a greater deficiency in nutrients like folate , vitamin B12 , and iron .
Fish Oil
Fish oil supplementation is generally safe for everyone .
Study after study has promoted the benefits of having high Omega - 3 fatty acids in our diet .
More importantly , fish oil supplements provide us with EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) and DHA ( docosahexanoic acid ) fatty acids , which are star players in cognitive health and development .
Research suggests that DHA and EPA have positive effects on lowering the risk of various cancers , help prevent neural degenerative diseases like Alzheimer 's , keep chronic , harmful inflammation at bay , and may even improve insulin sensitivity .
Really , there 's no reason not to take fish oil supplements .
Protein Supplement
The protein demands of a heavily worked body can be hard to stomach — literally .
A sizeable five - ounce portion of chicken breast contains approximately 30 grams of protein .
For a 130 - pound woman , getting enough protein means eating the equivalent of more than a pound of chicken each day !
Instead of wolfing down chicken after chicken , a protein shake which offers 25 grams of protein per serving really comes in handy .
Shakes offer convenience , they taste great , and can be used in a variety of smoothie and baking recipes for an added oomph of protein .
Advanced Supplements
Once you think you 've established a regular pattern of healthy eating and supplementation , you might want to consider graduating to these more advanced performance supplements to support your fitness goals .
Branched Chain Amino Acids
Just as protein forms the building block of muscle , branched chain amino acids ( BCAAs , for short ) are essential building blocks of protein .
The three BCAAs are leucine , isoleucine , and valine .
These three amino acids help provide the basis for protein synthesis , and research shows that consuming BCAAs before a workout can increase protein uptake into muscle tissue and improve post - workout recovery .
BCAAs are also a low - calorie , low - carb option instead of sports drinks .
Adding five grams of BCAAs in and around your training can help reduce muscle breakdown and support muscle recovery and repair .
Probiotics
Each one of us is flush with billions of bacteria in our digestive tract .
Yay for bacteria !
Good bacteria helps your body digest your food and absorb nutrients much more effectively .
With probiotics , you usher in healthy , beneficial flora .
You may find these good bacteria labeled as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on the labels of yogurt , kefir , fermented foods , and on high - quality probiotic capsules .
Make sure the supplement is from a reputable brand !
Vitamin D
While your body naturally produces vitamin D when you 're under the sun , you 're likely vitamin D deficient , especially if you have an office job or live in a region in which sunshine is a rare luxury .
This deficiency affects overall health , and some studies suggest it may even hamper athletic performance and recovery from exercise .
If you can't get enough vitamin D from the sun or from your diet , taking a supplement would be the next best thing .

Mitchell Johnson capped a tumultuous year by becoming the sixth winner of the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy , after being named as the ICC World Player of the Year at cricket 's annual awards ceremony in Johannesburg .
Johnson , who shot to prominence during Australia 's memorable series win in South Africa in February and March , claimed the title ahead of his fellow nominees , Gautam Gambhir , Andrew Strauss and MS Dhoni .
Johnson was a surprise choice for the title , not least because of the massive and very public crisis of confidence he suffered during Australia 's Ashes defeat in England , particularly in the pivotal second Test at Lord 's which England went on to win after Johnson 's first - day figures of 2 for 107 in 19 overs .
But when he got his game right he was nigh on unplayable , as his sensational performances against South Africa demonstrated .
With 80 wickets in 17 matches , he was the most prolific strike bowler of the year , and he also recorded his maiden Test century and an unbeaten 96 against South Africa .
" I 'm really blown away , " said Johnson .
" I am just surprised to be up here .
It has been a great 12 months for our side .
We have lost some wonderful players in recent years and we have been rebuilding with some young guys in the team and we have played together well . "
India 's star opener , Gambhir , was named as Test Player of the Year , after an impressive haul of 1269 runs at 84.60 in the eight Tests during the qualification period .
" It 's been a dream run for me .
I never thought it could be like this but life has changed for me and I am very happy , " said Gambhir .
" As a unit we have played very well and I am just glad to contribute to the overall success of the team . "
Dhoni retained his title of ODI Player of the Year , seeing off competition from his team - mates , Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag , as well as West Indies ' Shivnarine Chanderpaul .
Dhoni played 24 ODIs during the voting period , scoring 967 runs at an average of 60.43 and strike - rate of 86.63 , and also claimed 26 dismissals as he led India to 17 victories including a 5 - 0 demolition of England .
Tillakaratne Dilshan was a worthy winner of the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year award , after capping a sensational World Twenty20 tournament in England in June with a show - stealing 96 off 57 balls against West Indies in the semi-final .
His performance at The Oval , in which no other Sri Lanka batsman managed more than 24 , included two sixes and 12 fours , and though Sri Lanka went on to lose the final to Pakistan , Dilshan was nevertheless named as the Man of the Tournament , with a total of 317 runs at 52.83 .
Dilshan is perhaps most notable for his signature " Dilscoop " shot - a flick - shot over his , and the keeper 's , heads - and as he accepted his award he was equally proud to have coined a new term in cricket 's lexicon .
" I 'm really proud of myself for having a new shot named after me , " he said .
" That shot has given me confidence .
If I am under pressure I can play that shot and put the pressure back on the bowlers . "
Australia 's fast bowler , Peter Siddle , was named as the Emerging Player of the Year , after claiming 49 wickets at 28.93 in the 12 matches since his debut at Mohali in October 2008 , including five - wicket hauls against South Africa at Sydney and England at Headingley , both of which led to memorable victories .
Siddle beat his fellow Australia seamer , Ben Hilfenhaus , to the award , as well as England 's Graham Onions and New Zealand 's Jesse Ryder .
New Zealand 's cricketers were considered to have conducted themselves better on the field than any other nation in 2008 - 09 , as they claimed the Spirit of Cricket award for the second time , having also won during the inaugural Awards ceremony at Alexandra Palace in London in 2004 .
The judgement was made by the ICC 's umpires and match referees , in conjunction with the ten full - member captains , and Daniel Vettori accepted the accolade on behalf of his colleagues , only 48 hours after reversing a run-out appeal against Paul Collingwood in their must - win group match against England .
" I think most teams within world cricket aspire to the intangible notion of the Spirit of Cricket , " said Vettori .
" It 's not easy to define but I think when you get out on the field of play most guys know where that line is and most play the game in the right way .
If we can couple the Spirit of Cricket award with the ICC Champions Trophy then we will be very happy indeed . "

Pakistan 's Aleem Dar ended Simon Taufel 's monopoly to claim the Umpire of the Year award .
It was the first time that anyone other than Taufel had picked up the accolade in the six years that the ceremony has taken place .
South Africa 's spearhead , Dale Steyn , is the only player to retain his place in the World Test Team of the Year , with last year 's captain , Graeme Smith , missing the cut to accommodate World Player of the Year nominees Gambhir and Strauss at the top of the order .
Dhoni takes over as captain ; AB de Villiers , Sachin Tendulkar and Thilan Samaraweera make up the middle - order , while Bangladesh 's impressive allrounder , Shakib al Hasan , is chosen as the spin option alongside three quicks in Johnson , Steyn and Stuart Broad .
Six countries were also represented in the World ODI team , and just as with the Test side , there 's only one survivor from the XI named 12 months ago .
Dhoni was last year 's wicketkeeper , and now he is captain as well , having been picked alongside his team - mates Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh .
Three Sri Lankans - Dilshan , Ajantha Mendis and Nuwan Kulasekara - also feature , as well as two Englishmen , Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen , neither of whom have played a part in the side 's remarkable revival during the Champions Trophy .
West Indies ' Chris Gayle , Pakistan 's death - overs specialist Umar Gul , and New Zealand 's surprise package , Martin Guptill , make up the numbers .
England 's women - World Champions in 50 - over and 20 - over cricket this year , were rewarded for their dominance when their star player , Clare Taylor , was named as the Women 's Player of the Year .
Taylor , 33 , scored 565 runs in 18 ODIs an average of 70.62 , and 230 runs at a lofty 115.00 in England 's six - match World Twenty20 campaign .
Ireland 's captain , Will Porterfield , was named as the Associate Player of the Year , after leading his side to nine ODI victories in 11 fixtures in a memorable season that also included qualification for the Super Eights stage of the World Twenty20 .
World Test Team of the Year : Gautam Gambhir ( India ) , Andrew Strauss ( England ) , AB de Villiers ( South Africa ) , Sachin Tendulkar ( India ) , Thilan Samaraweera ( Sri Lanka ) , Michael Clarke ( Australia ) , MS Dhoni ( India , capt & wk ) , Shakib Al Hasan ( Bangladesh ) , Mitchell Johnson ( Australia ) , Stuart Broad ( England ) , Dale Steyn ( South Africa ) , Harbhajan Singh ( India , 12th man )

We set the Motorola Droid against almost every other smartphone we can find in a battle for mobile supremacy .
The is the hottest smartphone in America right now , but how does it measure up against the competition ?
We put the Droid in the ring against three levels of opponents : first , all the other Android phones available ; then , the other top smartphones on Verizon , and finally , the reigning champ , the .
Who 'll come out on top ?
Round 1 : Androids Fight !
First the Droid must dispatch its siblings .
The process is pretty quick .
The Droid 's Cortex - A8 processor makes mincemeat of the , the , the and even the 800 Mhz .
On benchmark and network tests , the Droid was able to land two punches for every other phone 's one .
That leaves them all dazed and staggering around the ring .
The Hero and CLIQ are the only two even vaguely able to put up a fight , thanks to HTC's Sense UI and Motorola 's MOTOBLUR , both of which bring powerful software features that the Droid lacks .
MOTOBLUR 's ability to bring all of your Facebook , MySpace , and Twitter contacts into its cheering section keeps it especially lively .
The Droid can't do that .
The Droid unleashes the power of its 854 - by - 480 screen , enhanced Web browser and Google Maps Navigation to deliver the final blow .
Android is the Google OS , designed for the Web .
The Droid does the Web better and has more Google services than any of its siblings .
We do n't even know when any of them will be upgradeable to the Droid 's Android 2.0 OS .
That makes the Droid the ultimate killer robot for now .
Winner : Motorola Droid
In this round :
$ 129.99
Last year , the T - Mobile G1 was a groundbreaking smartphone as the first Android phone on the market .
Now , it just looks like a beta product .
$ 149.99
The T - Mobile MyTouch 3G looks a bit pointless considering what 's come out since , except as a budget pick .
It 's a stock Android 1.5 phone without either the speed of the Moment and Droid , or the customization of the CLIQ and Hero .
$ 179.99
The HTC Hero's Sense UI helps make Android 1.5 much more people - friendly and coherent , but our model was buggy and had a poor - quality camera .
It 's also much slower than the Droid .
$ 199.99
Motorola 's first Android phone is a coherent , powerful communications device that brilliantly integrates social networking systems .
Oh , and the CLIQ is a great smartphone , too .
$ 179.99
The Samsung Moment is fast and has a bright screen , but its geek cred was just eradicated by the faster , more advanced Motorola Droid .
$ 199.99
Verizon 's new flagship smartphone , the Motorola Droid is the first Android 2.0 phone and it 's the future of Verizon Wireless .
Round 2 : Battle for Verizon
So the Droid totally wiped out the rest of the Android army .
Now it faces tougher competitors : the top two smartphones on Verizon Wireless , the and the .
Before you dismiss the Storm2 , remember that BlackBerrys have an awesome enterprise management system .
The Storm2's touch keyboard is second to none , thanks to its localized haptic feedback .
The average quality of apps in BlackBerry App World looks to be higher than the average quality of Android apps .
And the Storm syncs with iTunes , which the Droid can't do .
The Droid 's 10,000 apps may be of varying quality , but there are five times as many as in BlackBerry App World .
The Droid 's camera , and especially the video camera , crush the Storm2 .
But most of all , the Droid 's Web browser eradicates the Storm with a single haymaker blow .
Then the Imagio steps up .
The Imagio is the talented scion of a long smartphone lineage , and it pounds on the Droid with better Microsoft Exchange support , a great browser in Opera Mobile , better call quality , a better still camera , and even mobile TV .
On points , you could see the Imagio winning here .
Let the fight go on long enough , though , and the Droid begins to outlast the Imagio .
This is n't just about battery life .
Microsoft 's Windows Mobile operating system is looking old and creaky , even with its new version 6.5 facelift .
Android is just getting started , and Verizon has committed to this OS in a big way in the long haul .
For now , it looks like Android has more potential going forward for exciting new applications .
Winner : Motorola Droid , barely .
In this round :
$ 199.99
The Storm2 fixes all of the problems with the original Storm , using a radical new haptic touch - screen technology that actually makes it feel like you 're pressing buttons .
But although this is an excellent device , the Storm 's Web browsing still lags behind .
$ 199.99
The premiere Windows Mobile smartphone has a customized UI , mobile TV , and an excellent Web browser .
It 's also a very good phone .
$ 199.99
Verizon 's new flagship smartphone , the Motorola Droid is the first Android 2.0 phone and it 's the future of Verizon Wireless .
Round 3 : The Droid vs. the iPhone
And now we get to the final battle , the war for true smartphone supremacy .
In this corner : the , the 5 - megapixel , multitasking champion of the Verizon Wireless network .
In this corner : the , which redefined mobile computing .
Let 's play this by categories .
Phone
Sometimes it 's fun to watch two bruisers flail hopelessly around the ring .
Neither the Droid nor the iPhone is a particularly good voice phone .
They both have pretty average reception and mediocre voice quality .
But Verizon 's award - winning network backs the Droid up .
While the iPhone is on its knees trying to pick up dropped calls , the Droid calls in The Network to slam it into the floor .
Points go to Verizon , but not necessarily to the Droid here .
Still , it 's a win .
Winner : Droid ( because of Verizon 's network )
Web
Both the iPhone and the Droid have WebKit - based Web browsers that show most of the Web .
Both browsers have multiple windows .
But the Droid has two tricks up its sleeve that make it superior .
For one thing , it shows more of the Web at once thanks to its 854 - by - 480 Web browser .
For another , it has Flash on the way in early 2010 , which is going to fill in major gaps in the Web experience .
That means more Web on the Droid than on the iPhone .
That means the Droid wins .
Winner : Droid
OS / UI
Ever see two competitors battle using completely different styles of martial arts ?
That 's the problem with comparing Android OS 2.0 to iPhone OS 3.1 ; they have so little in common .
On the surface , the iPhone enforces conformity .
You do n't get home - screen widgets here , all apps have to behave in similar ways , and only Apple apps get to multi-task .
But deeper down , the iPhone has a rich API which lets third - party programmers access many native features of the device .
Android looks like a much looser system on the surface .
Apps and widgets scatter themselves across the home screen willy - nilly .
You have to take more initiative to set up your interface the way you want , and sometimes apps misbehave .
There seems to be more user freedom .
But Android programs are written in Java , and all the developers I 've spoken to hate Java compared to toolkits like the iPhone's .
Similarly , developers seem to dislike Android Market 's commerce system , whereas iTunes is a much smoother money - minting machine .
There 's an order vs. chaos issue with some of the built - in apps , as well .
Apple unifies all e-mail and calendars under one client .
Android still can't get its mailboxes and calendars together .
But Android allows third parties to integrate things like Facebook into the built - in contacts app ; that 's strictly verboten at Apple .
Average users who want a simple , consistent , and stable system with rich third - party apps are going to still prefer the iPhone .
Power users who want more freedom to set up their own experience will want Android .
The two have totally different styles of martial arts .
Winner : Tie
Media
It 's like a replay of the " phone " battle , but reversed .
Both the iPhone and the Droid are excellent media players .
Both have standard 3.5 mm headphone jacks and Bluetooth stereo support .
Both have still and video cameras the Droid 's is a little bit better .
Both stream and download media over the Internet .
But when the iPhone drags a PC into the ring , it 's all over for the Droid .
The iPhone syncs beautifully with iTunes and other apps , back and forth .
It 's easy to transfer your photos , music , and videos to and from the various libraries on a PC or Mac .
The Droid offers absolutely nothing for media syncing .
Sure , you can get some third - party solutions , but Apple 's iTunes totally crushes Google 's mysterious lack of attention to your main media library .
Winner : iPhone
Apps
The Droid has about 10,000 apps .
That seems pretty gooduntil you see what 's missing .
Where are the 3D games , for instance ?
Way too many of the apps in the Android Market seem to be quickie jobs done by individual programmers rather than polished , professional work .
The iPhone 's 100,000 apps fill all desires and demands .
Whether it 's fart apps , hobbyist apps , enterprise apps , or high - quality 3D games , the iPhone has it all .
The Droid puts on a good show and maybe this story will be different next year but the iPhone 's relentless pummeling brings the Droid down .
Winner : iPhone
Overall
The iPhone won two rounds .
The Droid won two rounds .
They tied a round .
Are these two platforms truly tied ?
As the fighters retire to their corners , bruised by unbowed , let 's remember that a title - holder should get to keep his title unless he 's eliminated .
The iPhone is proven .
The iPhone is experienced .
The iPhone has had time to show , and solve , its bugs .
We know the iPhone .
The Droid is still , by and large , a mystery .
Will its top half shear off in two weeks ?
Will it show bizarre bugs after a month ?
Only time will tell and that means the iPhone , for now , keeps its title .
Overall winner : iPhone - but barely .
In this round :
$ 199.99
The iPhone 3GS was the simplest , most powerful handheld computer on the market ... until now .
But its smooth performance , proven abilities , and excellent iTunes syncing still make it one of the best buys on the market .
$ 199.99
Verizon 's new flagship smartphone , the Motorola Droid is the first Android 2.0 phone and it 's the future of Verizon Wireless .
Dear Cecil : Enclosed for your enjoyment is a bottle of " Doctor Bronner 's 18 - in - 1 Pure Castile Soap , " which you can get at any health food store .
The soap is great , but you 'll note the label is crammed with weird religious ravings .
What 's the poop , Scoop ?
Is Doctor B. really a " master chemist and Essene rabbi " ?
What 's the story behind his company , All - One - God - Faith , Inc . ?
And — this one is urgent , Cece — how about the unusual birth control method Dr. B. recommends ?
Should I throw out my diaphragm and stock up on lemons and Vaseline ?
Sourpuss , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Not unless you like gooey lemonade .
As you can probably tell from the copy ( can you imagine a slogan like , “ Eternal Father , Eternal One !
Exceptions eternally ?
Absolute none ! ” on the side of a Tide box ? ) , “ Dr. ” Emanuel H. Bronner is inhabiting a different plane of being from the rest of us .
So do n’t take anything he says too literally .
Bronner is an 85 - year old ( as of 1993 ) German immigrant who hangs out in Escondido , California .
( Update : Emanuel Bronner died March 7 , 1997 in Escondido at age 89 . )
He ’s not an MD or strictly speaking a rabbi , but claims he ’s got the equivalent of a PhD in chemistry , which I guess makes him a master chemist .
He ’s also not your average soap maker .
Whereas Messrs .
Procter and Gamble dream ( well , dreamt ) of enzymes and long - chain fatty acids , Bronner dreams of world peace .
Bronner wants to convince mankind of the virtues of the “ All - One - God - Faith , ” which , together with the “ Moral ABC , ” his answer to the Ten Commandments , will unite the human race .
The details of this can be a bit hard to follow .
For example : “ Replace half - true Socialist - fluoride poison & tax - slavery with full - truth , work - speech - press & profitsharing Socialaction !
All - One !
So , help build 4 billion Hannibal wind - power plants , charging 96 billion battery - banks , powering every car - factory - farm - home - monorail & pump , watering Babylon - roof - gardens & 800 billion Israel - Milorganite fruit trees , guarded by Swiss 6000 year Universal Military Training , ” etc .
Talking to the doc on the phone is the audio equivalent of reading one of his labels .
He can be pretty linear when he wants to be , but eventually always veers off into a rap about the Essene rabbis and whatnot , delivered in a nutty - professor German accent .
Believe me , it ’s an experience .
Bronner has had an eventful life .
The son of a Jewish German soap maker , he emigrated to the U.S. and pleaded with his father to do the same when the Nazis came to power .
The old man refused .
One day Bronner got a postcard with the words , “ You were right . —
Your loving father . ”
He never heard from his parents again .
Initially settling in the midwest , Bronner married the illegitimate daughter of a nun , who eventually became suicidal and died in a mental hospital .
( He says she was tortured by the hospital guards . )
He also began devising his plan for world peace .
Fittingly , he took to the soapbox to promote it .
One of his listeners , Fred Walcher , was so inspired that in 1945 he had himself crucified in Chicago in order to publicize the plan .
( He survived . )
Later Bronner was arrested while trying to promote his plan at the University of Chicago and was committed to a mental hospital .
He escaped three times , finally fleeing to California in 1947 .
He ’s been there cranking out soap and soap labels ever since .
Despite his eccentricities , Dr. Bronner has built his soap company into a prosperous concern , mostly by sheer force of personality .
In the early days he would set up a table at health food conventions .
If a dealer strayed within ten feet , Bronner would pounce and not let go until he ’d gotten an order .
But things did n’t really take off until he was discovered by the counterculture during the 60s .
With the aid of his sons Jim and Ralph , who handle production and sales , he currently sells some 400,000 gallons of liquid soap and 600,000 pounds of bar soap a year .
He says he ’s now worth $ 6 million — not bad , he notes drily , for somebody who ’s supposedly nuts .
Bronner ’s birth control method involves using lemon juice and Vaseline as a spermicide .
While it ’s true the high acidity in lemon juice will kill sperm , doctors say it could also cause your insides to become irritated or burned .
Besides , Vaseline is n’t water soluble .
You ’d be clogging up your insides and wreaking God knows what kind of havoc .
With all respect to Bronner , I ’d advise sticking to diaphragms .

Some Palestinians only get 20 litres of water a day , Amnesty says Israel is denying Palestinians access to even the basic minimum of clean , safe water , Amnesty International says .
In a report , the human rights group says Israeli water restrictions discriminate against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank .
It says that in Gaza , Israel 's blockade has pushed the already ailing water and sewage system to " crisis point " .
Israel says the report is flawed and the Palestinians get more water than was agreed under the 1990s peace deal .
' Basic need '
In the 112 - page report , Amnesty says that on average Palestinian daily water consumption reaches 70 litres a day , compared with 300 litres for the Israelis .
Israel must end its discriminatory policies , immediately lift all the restrictions it imposes on Palestinians ' access to water
Donatella Rovera
Amnesty International
Gaza thirsts as sewage crisis mounts
Water shortages plague West Bank
It says that some Palestinians barely get 20 litres a day - the minimum recommended even in humanitarian emergencies .
While Israeli settlers in the West Bank enjoy lush gardens and swimming pools , Amnesty describes a series of Israeli measures it says are discriminating against Palestinians : Israel has " entirely appropriated the Palestinians ' share of the Jordan river " and uses 80 % of a key shared aquifer
West Bank Palestinians are not allowed to drill wells without Israeli permits , which are " often impossible " to obtain
Rainwater harvesting cisterns are " often destroyed by the Israeli army "
Recommended for short - term survival : 20 litres
For the medium term : 70 litres Recommended for the long term : 100 litres ( Source : WHO ) Israeli soldiers confiscated a water tanker from villagers who were trying to remain in land Israel had declared a " closed military area "
An unnamed Israeli soldier says rooftop Palestinian household water tanks are " good for target practice " Much of the land cut off by the West Bank barrier is land with good access to a major aquifer Israeli military operations have damaged Palestinian water infrastructure , including $ 6 m worth during the Cast Lead operation in Gaza last winter The Israeli - Egyptian blockade of Gaza has " exacerbated what was already a dire situation " by denying many building materials needed for water and sewage projects .
The report also noted that the Palestinian water authorities have been criticised for bad management , quoting one audit that described the sector as in " total chaos " .
" Water is a basic need and a right , but for many Palestinians obtaining even poor - quality , subsistence - level quantities of water has become a luxury that they can barely afford , " Amnesty 's Donatella Rovera said .
" Israel must end its discriminatory policies , immediately lift all the restrictions it imposes on Palestinians ' access to water . "
' Fair share '
Ms Rovera also urged Israel to " take responsibility for addressing the problems it created by allowing Palestinians a fair share of the shared water resources " .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said " the idea that we 're taking water away from someone else is simply preposterous " .
He argued that Israeli fresh water use per capita had gone down since 1967 due to efficiency and new technologies , while the Palestinians ' use had increased and more than a third of their water was wasted .

If there were allegations of military wrongdoing , those would be investigated , he said .
He also rejected the claim that Israel was preventing Palestinians from drilling for water , saying Israel had approved 82 such projects but the Palestinians had only implemented 26 of them .
" They have received billions of dollars in international aid over the last decade and a half , why have they not invested that in their own water infrastructure ? " he asked .
The report also criticised the Oslo Accords , which the Palestinians agreed to in 1993 .
It said that under them , the Palestinians gained the responsibility for managing an " insufficient " water supply and maintaining " long neglected " water infrastructure .
Also , the deal left the Palestinians paying Israel for half of the domestic water used in the West Bank , despite the fact it is extracted from the shared aquifer .
Mr Regev said Israel provides the Palestinians with more water than it was required to under the accord .

It ’s not uncommon to see credible sources claim that the phrase “ business as usual ” was coined by Winston Churchill .
For example , a glossary of World War I words and phrases on the BBC website says : “ B usiness as Usual : Phrase coined by Churchill to suggest how British society should react to the wartime situation . ”
Even some history books , such as A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century by J.A.S. Grenville , make that claim .
The truth is , Churchill helped popularize the phrase but he did n’t coin it .
It began appearing in newspapers and books as far back as the mid-1700s ( as shown by this search using Google Ngram , a research tool that shows the appearance of words or phrases in thousands of digitized books ) .
The original use was literal .
When a store reopened after some unusual event , like a fire , the owner would put up a sign saying “ Open for business as usual . ”
Or , on some unofficial holiday , newspapers might report that banks would be open for business as usual .
Churchill ’s use came early in World War I .
On August 4 , 1914 , Great Britain officially that bloody fray by declaring war on Germany .
At the time , Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty , a top position in the British Navy .
He and other British military leaders , politicians and businessmen initially assumed that Germany could be defeated quickly with Britain ’s existing naval and army forces .
Thus , they felt there was no need for a mass recruitment of volunteers or other actions that would disrupt the country ’s labor force and economy .
Indeed , they argued against any such government “ interference ” on the home front .
On the day war was declared , British Cabinet Minister David Lloyd George met with a group of bankers and assured them that the policy of the British government was “ to enable the traders of this country to carry on business as usual . ”
Many prominent businessmen heartily endorsed that policy and began repeating “ business as usual ” as a slogan .
For example , Henry E. Morgan , who worked as both an executive for the W.H. Smith publishing company and as an advertising consultant to retail store magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge , used it in a letter to the editor published in the Daily Chronicle on August 11 , 1914 .
Some sources have wrongly credited Morgan with coining the phrase .
Around that time , Selfridge adopted “ business as usual ” as his catchphrase and he is often credited with coining it .
Meanwhile , Harrods department store chain also began using the phrase in newspaper advertisements , leading some sources to credit Harrods with launching the phrase .
Soon , other stores and shops began displaying “ Business As Usual ” signs to show their support for the government ’s “ non-interference ” policy .
Winston Churchill further popularized the phrase by using it a speech he gave on November 9 , 1914 .
As noted by many books of quotations , Churchill said in that speech :
“ The British people have taken for themselves this motto – ‘ Business carried on as usual during alterations on the map of Europe . ’ ”
This “ non-interference ” policy was fully embraced by the British government under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith , as David Lloyd George told the bankers in August .
Unfortunately , it turned out to be far too optimistic .
By 1915 , the UK was forced to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers and in 1916 imposed a draft on single men aged 18 to 41 .
This soon led to serious labor shortages and other disruptions of the economy .
Churchill ’s use of “ business as usual ” during World War I was remembered and repurposed during World War II , when he served as Prime Minister and lead Great Britain in it ’s fight against Nazi Germany .
The famed speeches Churchill made during those years are known for their combination of defiance and hope .
In the early 1940s , when German planes were making devastating nightly bombing raids on London , store owners put up homemade notices and signs on their bombed shops that said “ Business As Usual . ”
Like the speeches Churchill gave during World War II , they were a message of both defiance and hope .
In the decades following World War II , the phrase has been used to mean maintaining the status quo , sometimes in a matter of fact way but often with a negative connotation .
For example , in 1962 , the famed “ Port Huron Statement ” adopted by the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) condemned the typical college campus as “ a place of commitment to business - as - usual . ”
The following year , the phrase was used in a similar negative way by civil rights leader , Martin Luther King .
In his moving “ I Have a Dream ” speech on August 28 , 1963 in Washington D.C. , King said of the race riots that had recently swept America ’s urban areas :
“ Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual . ”
Today , “ business as usual ” continues to be used in both a positive and negative sense and as sarcasm , making it an unusually flexible idiomatic expression .

We can only hope that world leaders will do nothing more than enjoy a pleasant bicycle ride around the charming streets of Copenhagen come December .
For if they actually manage to wring out an agreement based on the current draft text of the Copenhagen climate - change treaty , the world is in for some nasty surprises .
Draft text , you say ?
If you have n't heard about it , that 's because none of our otherwise talkative political leaders have bothered to tell us what the drafters have already cobbled together for leaders to consider .
And neither have the media .

Gary McKinnon faces 60 years in a US jail if convicted Computer hacker Gary McKinnon has been refused permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court against his extradition to the US .
The High Court ruled the case was not of " general public importance " to go to the UK 's highest court .
Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon , 43 , of Wood Green , London , is accused of breaking into the US 's military computer system .
Mr McKinnon , who has Asperger 's syndrome , insists he was just seeking evidence of UFOs .
In July he lost a High Court bid to avoid extradition .
The Home Office said no further comment would be made while Mr McKinnon continued to pursue the legal avenues available to him .
A spokesman said : " We note today 's judgment .
The case remains before the courts .
Therefore , we do not propose to comment further at this stage . "
' Disastrous consequences ' Mr McKinnon faces 60 years in prison if convicted in the US .
His lawyers have said they may now take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
They argue that extradition of their client would have " disastrous consequences " for his health , including possible psychosis and suicide .
FROM BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC Radio 5 live Mr McKinnon had challenged the refusal of Keir Starmer QC , the Director of Public Prosecutions , to put him on trial in the UK on charges of computer misuse - which would have allowed him to avoid extradition .
Giving the court 's decision on Friday , Lord Justice Stanley Burnton , who heard Mr McKinnon 's latest appeal earlier this year with Mr Justice Wilkie , said extradition was " a lawful and proportionate response " to his alleged offending .
There was no real prospect of him succeeding with his claim under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights that extradition would breach his right to a private and family life .
Nor did the court think , on the evidence it had seen , that he had an arguable case that extradition to the US would result in a breach of his Article 3 right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
' Devoid of humanity '
Reacting after the latest ruling , his mother Janis Sharp said no other country would offer its citizens to the US so readily " as sacrificial lambs " just to safeguard the special political relationship .
She said : " To use my desperately vulnerable son in this way is despicable , immoral and devoid of humanity . "
It is long past time that this travesty of justice was put right
David Davis MP
Clegg urges PM to act over hacker Mr McKinnon 's solicitor , Karen Todner , said the effect the proceedings and impending extradition were having on her client were " devastating " .
" Why is our government so inhumane as to allow this to happen to someone , particularly someone with Aspergers , a form of autism ? " she said .
" This is the wholesale destruction and bullying of a small individual by the United States and now our own government .
" Our extradition treaty with the US is unfair and prejudicial to UK citizens and should be repealed or amended immediately . "
Sabina Frediani , campaigns co-ordinator for Liberty , which supported Mr McKinnon 's case , said : " Never were justice and the law so out of sync as in the case of Britain 's rotten extradition arrangements . "
The Tories also criticised the UK's extradition arrangements with the US .
Backbench MP David Davis said : " The reason this decision has been arrived at is because the British government created a set of laws and agreements which , masquerading as anti-terror laws , actually disadvantaged a whole range of British citizens .
" This is why the courts find themselves having to dispatch this young man to America , when he should face a proper trial in British courts .
It is long past time that this travesty of justice was put right . "

Our society tends to take the Nostradamus - type forecasters with a grain of salt , but Trends Research Institute founder Gerald Celente ’s record of predictions is nearly flawless .
His accurate forecasts include the 1987 stock market crash , the collapse of the Soviet Union , the 1997 Asian currency crash , the sub - prime mortgage scandal and the latest economic downturn caused by the breakdown of major corporate giants .
Dubbed as the world ’s greatest trends forecaster by CNN , USA Today and CNBC , Celente insists that despite the latest market bounce , and increase in consumer confidence , the economy ’s fundamentals are broken .
Crisis Preparedness Ha ... Spigarelli , Jack A. Best Price : $ 1.93 Buy New $ 10.50 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
" This is a sucker ’s flame , " Celente said from his office in Kingston , N.Y .
" It ’s a false - flag recovery .
The stimulus , bailout and buyout packages being forced on the nation , by an administration that misread how bad the economy was , will only lead to Obamageddon : The Fall of Empire America . "

Celente cites the global financial system as terminally ill because it has been built on endless supplies of cheap money , rampant speculation , fraud , greed and delusion .
He sees a collapse coming , and predicts that by 2012 everyone will face the truth , and we will be in the midst of the Greatest Depression of them all .
" Washington is inflating the biggest bubble ever : the bailout bubble , " Celente said .
" This is much bigger than the dot - com and real estate bubbles .
When the bailout bubble bursts , it should be understood that a major war could follow . "

Oral diseases increase in prevalence with age and are often complicated by co-morbidities , including chronic systemic diseases , and medications .
An oral–systemic disease connection has been reported in the literature .
Furthermore , periodontal diseases have been associated with cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , and respiratory infection , which may be more commonly seen in the older adult .
In any population , including the elderly , tooth loss and dental caries are used as measures of oral health status .
Additionally , other oral diseases that are evaluated are periodontal diseases , xerostomia , orofacial pain , and oral and pharyngeal cancer .
The elderly have experienced varying levels of oral health care .
In many cases , oral health care may be unobtainable due to low economic status , social isolation , and residence in a long - term care institution , transportation limitations , or complex medical conditions .
Many issues are involved in the oral health of older adults , including identification and control of risk factors , recognition and treatment of the manifestations of oral diseases , use of dental care services , and involvement of pharmacists in oral health education and management .
Use of Dental Services among Older Patients
Obtaining dental care is different for elders who live independently and who are not institutionalized than it is for those who are homebound .
In some communities , mobile dentists are available to visit homes and nursing homes to provide dental care .
This has increased the number of elderly individuals who use dental services .
Routine visits to a dentist allow for an assessment of the teeth , gums , and soft tissues , which is important in the detection , prevention , and treatment of oral health conditions .
Even older patients who are edentulous ( no teeth ) must have routine dental visits to evaluate soft tissues and proper fitting of dentures .
If there are no acute conditions that need to be closely monitored , annual visits are considered to be an appropriate time interval .
Although a certain portion of the elderly population does not regularly visit the dentist , either because of personal choice or the inability to be transported , about 60 % who are dentate ( with teeth ) actually have routine dental care , compared with 65 % of younger individuals .
On the other hand , only about 15 % of elderly persons with missing teeth make annual visits to the dentist .
The Aging Dentition
It is estimated that by 2050 , the number of Americans age 65 and older will increase to about 48 million .
With more people living longer , there will also be an increase in the prevalence of systemic and oral diseases .
There is controversy over whether the physiologic and pathologic changes that occur with aging are due to the aging process itself or to diseases , medications , or environmental changes .
Risk Factors for Poor Oral Health
Risk factors for poor oral health in the elderly include race , socioeconomic status , systemic illness , dentition status , medications , oral cancer , periodontal diseases , and dental caries .
Some risk factors , such as smoking , can be modified , while others , such as genetics , cannot .
The availability of dental insurance has been found to be a significant predictor of dental care utilization .
Many older people are retired and live on a fixed income without private dental insurance , which may prohibit the use of dental services ; most elders lose their dental insurance when they retire .
Medicare does not cover routine dental services , and Medicaid provides only limited coverage in certain states .
In addition , many elderly persons who are confined to their home because they are disabled or do not have a means of transportation are not able to visit a dentist .
Only about 5 % of the population who are older than 65 live in long - term care facilities , and about 5 % to 10 % are homebound .
6
In many communities , bus transportation or mobile dentists who make house calls are available for these individuals .
Xerostomia ( dry mouth ) , which is a risk factor for dental decay ( caries ) and periodontal disease , is due to lack of saliva either from disease , age , or use of medications such as antidepressants , antipsychotics , urinary antispasmodics , diuretics , beta - blockers , bronchodilators , gastrointestinal agents , anticholinergics , and anti-Parkinson ’s disease agents .
The pharmacist ( Https://www.allo-pharmacie-garde.fr ) or dentist should communicate with the individual ’s physician about either switching the medication to a similar drug with a different classification that has less xerostomic side effects or lowering the dosage .
Oral health problems including ill - fitting dentures , number of teeth present , deep caries , periodontal disease , or other oral infections may cause extreme pain and discomfort and interfere with proper eating .
Elders with fewer posterior teeth demonstrate a lower dietary intake .
Manifestation of Oral Diseases
In the recent past , it has been established that the two primary oral conditions–caries and periodontal diseases are worldwide oral infections with potentially serious consequences , especially in the elderly .
Periodontal Disease : Periodontal disease ( gingivitis , periodontitis ) is an infectious disease characterized by bacterial accumulation in the gingivae ( gums ) .
As the bacteria mature , they release substances , including toxins and enzymes that cause direct destruction of the periodontal tissues ( gingivae and bone ) , and stimulate the host to activate a local inflammatory response , which attempts to eliminate the infection but can also cause more destruction .
Thus , the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is both inflammatory and immunologic .
Although age may be associated with some moderate loss of bone and soft tissue attachment , it is suggested that the progression of disease experienced in older adults may be due to time rather than aging .
The primary risk factors for periodontal diseases are poor oral hygiene and smoking .
There has been an increase in public awareness of a connection between certain systemic conditions and periodontal disease .
Older individuals who have periodontal disease also have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease , pneumonia , diabetes , and emphysema .
It is important for physicians , dentists , and pharmacists to be aware of this oral–systemic disease connection .
Increased levels of plasma C- reactive protein ( CRP ) , a marker for inflammation , are present in patients with periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease .
Bacteria enter the blood when diseased tissues are more fragile during mastication , tooth brushing , or dental procedures .
This bacteremia may result in systemic cardiovascular effects .
Periodontal treatment can reduce levels of CRP .
A relationship between periodontal disease and the development of diabetes has been well established .
Furthermore , having diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of periodontal disease .
Therefore , treatment of periodontal disease is of the utmost importance , since it can help reduce the development of diabetes ; and conversely , controlling diabetes can help reduce the development of periodontal disease .
Evidence exists to support an association between poor oral health , oral microflora , and bacterial pneumonia .
Controlling or reducing oral biofilms may reduce the incidence of bacterial pneumonia .
Dental Caries / Root Caries : Nearly one third of persons older than 65 have untreated dental caries .
Untreated tooth decay may result in pain that interferes with proper oral and general health and even tooth loss .
Root caries occur when the gingiva has receded , exposing the root surface to the oral environment .
Receded gingivae may also contribute to dentinal hypersensitivity ( i.e. , increased cold sensitivity in the tooth ) .
Orofacial Pain : Orofacial pain that occurs around the mouth and face can be severely debilitating , affecting a patient ’s ability to chew and swallow , as well as his or her dental care .
Certain conditions that can cause orofacial pain include trigeminal neuralgia , postherpetic neuralgia , headache , and arteritis .
Oral and pharyngeal cancer is most prevalent in people age 65 and older , especially if they smoke and / or drink .
Survival improves when the cancer is diagnosed in the early stages .
For the severely compromised and homebound or institutionalized elder , periodontal prevention and supportive therapies may be effective and appropriate when delivered by a dental professional and followed by adequate personal care by the patient or caregiver .
Toothbrushes are more effective in daily oral care than the foam tooth cleaners that are often found in nursing homes or institutions .
Older individuals should be counseled on proper toothbrush selection and care .
Soft - bristled toothbrushes are recommended rather than medium - or hard - bristled brushes , because they are less abrasive on the gingival and tooth structure .
Electric toothbrushes are just as effective as manual brushes and are recommended if the patient has difficulty with hand coordination .
It is recommended to use fluoride toothpaste to help prevent dental decay .
Because dental floss may be difficult for many elders to manipulate , electric interdental cleaners are available .
In addition , adjunctive fluoride rinses or gels are recommended in older patients who are prone to caries .
Mouth rinses with alcohol should not be recommended in elders with xerostomia or a history of oral cancer ; most products contain varying percentages of alcohol that can dry the oral mucosa .
Antigingivitis / anti­ plaque oral rinses can be used as an adjunct to flossing and brushing in elders who have difficulty manipulating floss and toothbrushes .
Special toothbrushes and products for cleaning dentures are available .
Elders should be instructed not to sleep with dentures ; dentures should be soaked in water or a cleaning solution overnight .
If the denture is not fitted properly , or if there are red areas underneath the denture , the patient should visit a dentist .
Programs : Emphasis is being placed on effective oral health care prevention programs .
The CDC is supporting state - based programs to promote oral health and has Web - based information systems such as the National Oral Health Surveillance System .
For many women , a $ 1,000 dress is something they admire in the pages of a glossy magazine or see draped on the frame of a celebrity  not an item hanging in their closet .
But a nascent Web site called Rent the Runway is hoping to make high - end fashions much more accessible and almost as easy as renting a movie from Netflix .
The mail - order service , which finishes the testing phase on Monday , allows women to rent dresses from notable fashion designers like Diane Von Furstenberg , Hervé Léger and Proenza Schouler for roughly one - tenth of what they would cost to buy in a retail store .
The rentals run $ 50 to $ 200 for a four - night loan and are shipped directly to the customer ’s doorstep .
After wearing the dress , she puts it into a prepaid envelope and drops it in the mail .
Dry cleaning is included in the price , but damage insurance costs $ 5 , and in the case of outright destruction of the dress , the renter is responsible for the full retail price .
Qualche numero essenziale , per capirci meglio .
Nella campagna elettorale per le elezioni europee , secondo uno studio del Censis ( 9 giugno 2009 ) , il 69,3 per cento degli elettori si è informato e ha scelto chi votare attraverso le notizie e i commenti dei telegiornali .
I tiggì sono il principale mezzo per orientare il voto soprattutto tra i meno istruiti ( in questo caso , siamo al 76 per cento ) , i pensionati ( 78,7 per cento ) e le casalinghe ( 74,1 per cento ) .
È necessario cominciare allora da questa scena .
Più o meno sette italiani su dieci - che diventano otto su dieci tra chi è avanti con gli anni , è meno istruito o è donna che lavora in casa e per la famiglia - scrutano la vita , la realtà e il mondo dalla finestra aperta dai telegiornali - tra cui il Tg1 e il Tg5 - da soli - raccolgono e concentrano oltre il 60 per cento del pubblico .
Nella cornice di questa finestra buona parte degli italiani matura emozioni , percezioni , paure , insicurezza , fiducia , ottimismo , consapevolezze , orienta o rafforza le sue opinioni .
Che cosa vedono , o meglio che cosa gli mostra quella finestra ?
Nello spazio stretto , quasi indefinito , tra la realtà e la sua rappresentazione mediatica si possono fare molti giochetti sporchi .
Per esempio , spaventare tutti con il fantasma di un'inarrestabile criminalità che ci minaccia sulla soglia di casa o eliminare ogni incubo cancellando ogni traccia di sangue e di crimine .
Nel secondo semestre del 2007 ( governa Romano Prodi ) , i sei tiggì maggiori dedicano a fatti criminali 3.500 cronache .
Nel primo semestre di quest ' anno ( Berlusconi regnante ) 2.000 ( fonte , Osservatorio di Pavia , report " Sicurezza e Media " , curato da Antonio Nozzoli ) .
Stupefacente il tracollo di storie nere nel Tg5 .
Con Prodi a Palazzo Chigi , le cronache criminali sono 900 ( secondo semestre 2007 ) .
Diventano con Berlusconi 400 ( primo semestre 2009 ) .
Il Tg1 Rai non giunge a tanto .
Le dimezza : da 600 a 300 .
È un gioco sporco , facile anche da fare : ometti , sopprimi , trucchi la scena secondo le istruzioni politiche del momento .
Più o meno , un gioco delle tre carte .
Carta vince , carta perde .
Il crimine c'è e ora non c'è più perché il governo lo ha sconfitto o ridimensionato .
Se fosse necessaria una nuova stagione di paura e di odio , riapparirebbe nelle mani del sapiente cartaro .
In questa tecnica di governo non è necessaria l'azione , l'agire , mettere in campo politiche pubbliche contro il crimine , di sostegno alle imprese e alla famiglie , di protezione sociale per chi perde il lavoro , per fare qualche esempio .
È sufficiente comunicare che lo si sta facendo , che lo si è fatto , e magari gridare al " miracolo " .
Come per il terremoto dell ' Aquila .
Ogni settimana , il capo del governo si autocompiace per l'evento incredibile , prodigioso che ha realizzato .
Ma è autentico " il miracolo di efficienza " ?
Se si stila una classifica dei tempi di assegnazione di " moduli abitativi provvisori " si scopre che a San Giuliano di Puglia , i primi 30 moduli furono consegnati a 82 giorni dal sisma , in Umbria a 98 giorni , finanche in Irpinia ( dove ci furono 3000 morti e 300 mila sfollati ) in 105 giorni mentre in Abruzzo i primi moduli sono stati attribuiti a Onna dopo 116 giorni .
Non basta dunque il racconto di un fatto in sé per comprenderlo .
Il fatto in sé diventa trasparente soltanto se si rendono accessibili e trasparenti i nessi , le relazioni , i conflitti che vi sono contenuti .
Privato della sua trama , delle sue relazioni con il passato e con il futuro , il fatto deteriora a immagine , a spettacolo e dunque è vero perché il fatto è lì sotto i nostri occhi ; al contempo , è falso perché è stato manipolato , ma in realtà è finto perché l'immaginazione vi gioca un ruolo essenziale e parlare di " miracolo " - non c'è dubbio - aiuta la fantasia .
Il capolavoro di questa tecnica di comunicazione che diventa disinformazione lo raggiunge , come si racconta a pagina 13 , il Tg1 di Augusto Minzolini quando dà conto delle disavventure di Silvio Berlusconi alle prese con gli esiti di una vita disordinata che gli consiglia di candidare a responsabilità pubbliche le falene che ne allietano le notti .
Il caso nasce politico : così si rinnovano le élites ?
Se ne accentua la politicità con l'intervento di Veronica Lario che rivela le debolezze e la vulnerabilità del premier .
Berlusconi avverte che in ballo c'è la sua credibilità di presidente del Consiglio .
Va in televisione a Porta a porta per spiegarsi .
Gioca male la partita .
Mente , si contraddice .
Gliene si chiede conto .
Farfuglia .
Tace .
Decide di rivolgersi a un giudice per vietare che gli si facciano anche delle domande .
È l'ordito di un " caso " che diventa ( a ragione ) internazionale .
Il Tg1 lo spoglia di ogni riferimento .
Dà conto soltanto degli strepiti del Capo : " complotto " , " trama eversiva " .
Si lascia galleggiare quest ' accusa .
Contro chi ?
Perché ?
Che cosa è accaduto ?
Non lo si dice .
Appare la D'Addario .
Ha trascorso una notte con il capo del governo , è stata candidata alle elezioni .
È la conferma dell ' interesse pubblico dell ' affare , è la prova della ricattabilità di Berlusconi .
Minzolini fa finta di niente .
Cancella i rilievi dei vescovi ; della figlia di Berlusconi , Barbara ; l'attenzione della stampa internazionale .
Spinge in un altro segmento del notiziario il destino del direttore dell '
Avvenire , accoppato per vendetta dal giornale del Capo ; i traffici di Gianpaolo Tarantini , il ruffiano di Palazzo Grazioli .
Senza contesto e riferimenti , che cosa può comprendere quel 69,3 per cento di italiani che si informa soltanto attraverso le notizie del Tg? Nulla .
Non comprenderà nulla e potrà bere come acqua di fonte che si tratta soltanto , come dice il direttore del Tg1 , " dell 'ultimo gossip " .
( I sondaggisti non sembrano curarsi di che cosa sappiano davvero dell ' affare gli spettatori disinformati che interrogano ) .
Non siamo soltanto alle prese con una cattiva informazione o con un giornalismo di burocrati obbedienti .
Abbiamo dinanzi un dispositivo di potere con una sua funzione psicologica determinante .
Siamo assediati dal crimine o no ?
Devo avere paura o fiducia ?
All ' Aquila c'è davvero un " miracolo " che presto toglierà dai guai tutti coloro che ne hanno bisogno ?
C'è " un complotto " che minaccia il premier o il premier ha combinato qualcosa che dovremmo sapere e che lui dovrebbe spiegare ?
Se - tra soppressioni , omissioni , menzogne - si abituano le persone a questa confusione inducendole a credere che nulla sia vero in se stesso e che ogni cosa può diventare vera o falsa per decisione dell ' autorità e con l'obbedienza dei tiggì , si nientifica la realtà ; si distrugge l'opinione pubblica ; si sterilizza la coscienza delle cose ; va a ramengo ogni spirito critico .
È quel che accade oggi in Italia dove un unico soggetto pretende di detenere - con il potere - la verità , il diritto all ' autocelebrazione , al racconto unidimensionale , ogni leva delle nostre emozioni e delle nostre esperienze .
Oggi che si discute di che cosa deve essere il servizio pubblico , vale la pena ricordare che la libertà dell ' informazione non è fine a se stessa , ma è solo un mezzo per proteggere un bene ancora più prezioso della libertà del giornalista : il diritto dei cittadini a essere informati .
HOUSTON  Just before he was executed in 2004 for setting a fire that killed his three children , Cameron T. Willingham declared , “ I am an innocent man convicted of a crime I did not commit . ”
Now his words seem to be echoing in the race for governor of Texas .
In what some opponents say looks like a political move and Gov. Rick Perry says was “ business as usual , ” the governor replaced the head of the Texas Forensic Science Commission and two other members on Wednesday , just 48 hours before the commission was to hear testimony from an arson expert who believes that Mr. Willingham was convicted on faulty testimony , a conclusion that has been supported by other experts in the field .
Mr. Perry ’s decision to shake up the commission and put one of his political allies in charge has , at the least , delayed the inquiry into the Willingham case .
While Mr. Perry says he has no political motive for the move , his opponents have called for the commission to finish its inquiry .
More make - up ( and hair dye ) than his 40 virgin bodyguards , but Libyan leader Gaddafi is still a murderous menace
Rome has had its fair share of triumphant parades by bizarre tyrants in its long history .
And the ageing Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi 's arrival on Monday ranked alongside any grotesque ceremony staged by Caligula or Nero .
It is easy to see why Italy 's Left - wing opposition denounced the dictator 's reception by Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi as a ' rock star welcome ' .
Dictator 's reception : Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi welcomes Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ( far right ) with his ' all - female , all - virgin ' bodyguard ( middle ) who must wear lipstick , nail varnish and be masters of combat
Gaddafi's arrived in Rome with a 300 - strong retinue on three Airbuses .
As ever , he brought with him a giant Bedouin tent , which was erected in a park in the centre of the city and where he was to stay and conduct business .
There was no immediate sign of the camel he took on a visit to Paris in 2007 when he pitched his tent in the grounds of a five - star hotel .
With gelled and carefully dyed hair , the Colonel was made up to look like a cross between Michael Jackson and the deranged music mogul murderer Phil Spector .
Pinned to his chest was a large photograph of a Libyan resistance leader being hanged by Italian colonialists in 1931 .
Although with his peaked cap , red flashes , gold braid epaulettes and an array of military decorations that resembled a Dulux colour chart , he turned out in a uniform that Italy 's last tyrant , fascist leader Benito Mussolini , would have killed for .
But it was the gun-toting female bodyguards in their khaki uniforms and red berets in the 67 - year old dictator 's entourage , girls who wear Kalashnikovs like Gucci fashion accessories , who stole the show .
Gaddafi is one of the maddest dictators on Earth and he does n't like being upstaged - unless it's by this 40 - strong troupe of well - equipped , allvirgin minders .
Controversial : Gaddafi , in Rome this week , where his reception has been denounced by Italy 's Left - wing opposition as a ' rock star welcome '
He may have conducted his 1969 military coup against Lybia 's last monarch , King Idris , under an Islamic revolutionary banner .
He may have proclaimed himself a pioneer of ' Islamic socialism ' .
But Gaddafi 's female security detail do n't hide their charms under a burqa .
Bizarrely , he claims them to be a symbol of his belief in female emancipation .
' Women should be trained for combat , so that they do not become easy prey for their enemies , ' he says .
All of his girls are said to swear an oath that they will give their lives for him and it is claimed they never leave his side , night or day , and he insists they remain virgins .
There is no shortage of volunteers for what is seen as a prestigious job .
Prestigious job : Gaddafi in Egypt , accompanied by one of his ' virgin ' bodyguards , who some say he demands their sexual favours
A special training college puts recruits through a tough physical programme and girls who do n't drop out emerge as trained killers , experts in firearms and martial arts .
Gaddafi makes the final selection and , despite his insistence that his guards are chaste , rumours abound that he demands their sexual favours .
The girls wear lipstick , jewellery , polished nails , even high heels - but their armed combat training has been tested more than once .
In 1998 one of them was killed and seven others wounded when Islamic fundamentalists in Libya ambushed the Colonel 's motorcade .
The dead girl , Aisha , rumoured to be his favourite , threw herself across Gaddafi 's body to stop the bullets .
But how is it that Gaddafi , once regarded by the West as the father of terrorism and the man behind the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 , is now welcomed in Rome with open arms by Berlusconi - a leader famously equally bewitched by female charms ?
The truth is that , despite his often ludicrous appearance and behaviour , Gaddafi is one of the great survivors , a despot who has led his country for 40 years despite worldwide vilification - brutal in crushing domestic dissent and who changes his tune on the world stage as it suits him .
Like other monstrous leaders , he has written works of literature to enlighten mankind - his Green Book which , over three rambling volumes , sets out his views on political and social theories .
But another offering - Escape To Hell And Other Stories - predicts a German Fourth Reich lording it over Britain and America , and which tells you of his loathing for cities , Margaret Thatcher and humidity .
( He loves the countryside and artichokes . )
When he seized power in 1969 under a Marxist banner , few thought his regime would last .
But he had a ruthless cunning and an instinct for when to strike his rivals .
In the 1970s , Gaddafi personally ordered public executions .
In 1977 , he was present at hangings of students who had protested against his regime .
He spat defiance against the West , proclaiming his belief in Arab nationalism - yet he loathed Islamic fundamentalism .
So while he happily tortured fundamentalists at home , he became the No 1 state sponsor of terrorism against the West .
Bizzare :
The picture on Gaddafi 's chest is of a Libyan resistance fighter , Omar al - Mukhtar , hanged by the Italian colonialists in 1931 .
Gaddafi even bought along the man 's elderly son
In 1980 , a Libyan journalist from the BBC's Arabic Service , Mohammed Ramadan , was shot outside the Regent 's Park mosque .
It was four years later that Britain and the world was stunned with horror by the cold - blooded murder of unarmed WPC Yvonne Fletcher in London , gunned gunned down outside Libya 's Embassy by a member of its staff .
Gaddafi's oil wealth funded the IRA as well as Palestinian guerillas .
This was one reason why Margaret Thatcher 's government gave permission for U.S. bombers to use British airfields in April , 1986 , to launch a surprise attack on his home in Tripoli .
They missed Gaddafi but killed his infant daughter , Hannah .
Gaddafi has always been able to parade this loss as proof that he is a victim of ' U.S. terrorism ' .
But despite sounding defiant , that U.S. raid marked a shift in Gaddafi 's behaviour .
Although he remained vocally as radical as ever , he began to drop support for foreign terrorists - although , as the downing of Pan - Am flight 303 over Lockerbie with the loss of 270 lives in showed , Gaddafi 's secret service could still be deadly .
Now Gaddafi has put up billions of dollars in compensation for the relatives of his victims .
But it is his loathing of Muslim fundamentalists that has brought him into alliance with the West .
After all , back in the 1970s , Gadaffi was hanging members of the fundamentalist Hizb - ut Tahrir organisation , since banned in many European countries .
So he had no difficulty backing the Bush - Blair war against Al Qaeda types threatening his regime .
Ever since , relations have thawed .
In 2004 , Tony Blair lifted the West 's fatwa on him for sponsoring outrages .
Then , as oil prices soared after the George W Bush 's invasion of Iraq , Gaddafi 's untold billions of energy reserves in the Libyan desert gave his regime an ace card .
Years of UN sanctions for his regime 's sponsorship of terrorism mean that Gaddafi 's oil and gas had not been exploited nearly as much as other Mid-East states .
Libya 's old colonial master , Italy , sits across the Mediterranean without any energy resources of its own .
Which is why Silvio Berlusconi has been more than happy to deal with Gaddafi .
Anyone thinking that Colonel Gaddafi is becoming a cosy ally should think again .
Only a few weeks ago , Gaddafi stormed out of an Arab League conference , calling the King of Saudi Arabia a ' liar ' and a ' British product and American ally ' .
Gaddafi remains mercurial , menacing and murderous .
Getting wobbly on his pins and wearing almost more makeup and hair dye than his 40 virgin bodyguards put together , Colonel Gaddafi looks set to carry on wrong - footing friend and foe alike .
Mellow with age he wo n't .
The author of a book calling for the prosecution of former President George W. Bush for murder has produced a documentary based on the book that will debut in February 2010 .
The documentary draws on interviews with Vincent Bugliosi , whose best - selling The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder has sparked controversy and renewed discussion of recourse from Bush ’s critics .
ADVERTISEMENT
The film ’s producers posted a nine - minute clip on YouTube late last week .
Bugliosi is a career prosecutor turned author , known for his prosecution of the Manson murders .
The trailer highlights his success at trial , having secured numerous murder convictions .
“ I would not be doing what I ’m doing unless I ’m very confident that under the law he ’s guilty of murder and should be prosecuted , ” Bugliosi says in the documentary trailer .
“ Unless this nation is about to be attacked , you do n’t go to war without telling the people whose sons and daughters are going to die in a foreign land why you ’re doing to do it . ”
His voice raised , Bugliosi shouts , “ The American government believed that the guy responsible for 3,000 murders is at Tora Bora .
Do you know how many soldiers George Bush sent them ?
“ Not one , ” he continues .
“ How do you justify not sending one single soldier after the person responsible for 3,000 murders .
Not one soldier , but send 150,000 against someone who was as involved in 9/11 as you and I . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Strangely enough , the trailer includes praise from Alan Dershowitz , a Harvard University law professor who ’s previously said torture could be justified .
“ There ’s no prosecutor I would want to have if I were innocent more than Vince , and there ’s no prosecutor I would fear more if I were guilty , ” Dershowitz says .
“ He will get at the truth . ”
Bugliosi has drawn praise for his objective and aggressive style .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Before I read this book , I believed that prosecuting and convicting a U.S. President , regardless of the extent or heinousness of his crimes , would do more harm to the United States than good , ” penned one Amazon reviewer .
“ Now that I have read the book , my thinking has changed .
Here we have a man who is personally responsible for putting tens of thousands of innocent people into harm ’s way for no other reason than his own , personal desire to wage war — laughing and talking about how much fun he is having while all this is going on . ”
But even some Bugliosi fans were unimpressed by his latest work .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I was thoroughly disappointed , ” one Amazon reviewer wrote . ” I was expecting a professional document ( although I knew it would n’t be impartial ; how could it be ? ) , but it was anything but .
Bugliosi resorts to name calling not only Bush and his aides , but his readers as well .
How can he expect anyone to take him seriously when he calls the rest of us stupid ?…
A huge part of the book seemed to be an inflation of his own ego . ”
The man 's got a following , that 's for sure .
Tuesday it was announced that Texas Republican Ron Paul , who wowed the Libertarian crowd during the 2008 election with his call for limited government , is set to deliver an address at the University of South Carolina on Nov. 9 about the “ future of individual liberty and the importance of the U.S. Constitution . ”
As if that were not enough , the following week he 's scheduled to speak in Iowa , that pivotal early caucus state , with stops in Ames and Des Moines .
By this morning speculation was rife that South Carolina , which holds one of the early primaries in the presidential calendar , could be the launching pad for a new Ron Paul bid .
As CNN 's Political Ticker put it , " Will Ron Paul give it another go in 2012 ? "
If so , the 74 - year - old congressman and doctor is n't saying .
Lately he 's been busy waging war against the federal government 's response to the H1N1 virus , decrying the vaccination program as an attempt by the federal government to corral more power .
He even tweaked President Obama for not having his daughters inoculated .
“ It ’s interesting to note that the president ’s children have not gotten their shots and the explanation for this is it has n’t been available to them – now that ’s a little bit hard to buy when you think that probably anything the president wants can be available for their children , ” said Paul , adding , “ So in a way he ’s made his decision not to give his children these inoculations – so if he has freedom of choice on this , I would like to make sure that all the American people have the same amount of freedom of choice . ”
Yesterday , Malia and Sasha got their shots .

3:AM Press would like to introduce you to the second title of its list for 2010 , the memoir Autofellatio by James Maker .
Critic and co-conspirator Mark Simpson describes the author as the “ former lead singer with cult 80s Indie band Raymonde and 90s drag metal sensation RPLA , and one of Morrissey ’s longest - serving friends ” and the book itself as “ A very English rock and roll memoir , with nary a wasted or ill - chosen word : Ronald Firbank meets the New York Dolls , has a sweet sherry or three and causes a scene on the night bus home . ”
First posted : Monday , October 5th , 2009 .
Last week the U.S. government initiated the final steps required to lift long - standing travel and immigration restrictions imposed on HIV - positive foreigners .
Under the current ban HIV - positive foreigners , whether they 're tourists or business travelers , can't enter the U.S. , though in exceptional cases a waiver can be granted .
The policy , which has been in place for more than 15 years , also prevents immigrants with HIV from becoming legal permanent residents .
This is because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) includes HIV as one of the “ communicable diseases of public health significance ” that bar people from entering the U.S.
But last week the HHS issued proposed regulations that would remove HIV from this communicable diseases list .
Many activists and bloggers are applauding the move , since it kicks off the process to repeal the ban .
For instance , Erin , blogging on an aspiring midwife , says :
“ It took until 2009 , but the government finally overturned one of the most blatantly discriminate laws legislated in the past twenty years . ”
The first step to lift the ban was actually taken last July , when President George W. Bush signed a bill into law containing an amendment that would strike down the ban .
But the prohibition stayed in place because HIV was still on the communicable disease list , allowing the U.S. government to stop those with HIV from entering the country .
Last month , for example , HIV - positive British activist Paul Thorn was denied a visa when he tried to participate in a conference taking place in Seattle .
This video provides more background of the ban .
While various countries around the world have some travel or immigration restrictions on those with HIV , the U.S. is one of a few countries with such a restrictive policy on simply entering the country .
The blog DYM SUM elaborates :
“ An interesting side note : only a dozen countries in the world , besides the United States , still have an HIV travel ban in place .
They are Iraq , China , Saudi Arabia , Libya , Sudan , Qatar , Brunei , Oman , Moldova , Russia , Armenia , and South Korea .
If you need to , read that list a second time , and think about what ’s wrong there . ”
In response to the news , bloggers have been sharing their experiences of trying to get into the U.S. or strategies they 've heard can circumvent the travel ban .
For example , The Evolution of Jeremiah , a blog from Canada , says :
“ I never had a problem getting into the United States .
Nobody asked me , and nobody needed to know .
This will be good news to travelers world wide .
Hopefully this will come into effect sooner than later . ”
Bobito , commenting on a blog post on Queerty , explains other strategies that those with HIV have used :
“ From what I 've been told , if they [ U.S. customs ] find the antiviral medications in a traveler 's luggage , they do not let the person leave the airport .
There are ways to avoid this situation , such as mailing one 's meds to a friend in America before you fly , and I think there are some HIV support organizations that provide some help in this , too .
I also read that , if they do a random luggage search and find antiviral meds , then they stamp HIV + into the traveller 's passport , making all future attempts to travel into countries that ban HIV + visitors impossible , but I do n't remember where I read . ”
A report released in June by Human Rights Watch describes how these policies can have health consequences on HIV - positive migrants .
The blog Empowerment for HIV Positive Migrants and Spouses , based in Malaysia , also discusses how these restrictions can be detrimental to those with HIV .
It states :
“ Misconception and prejudice on HIV due to lack of information still caused stigmatisation on PLHIV [ People Living with HIV ] .
There is a trend for PLHIV who travels to countries with restrictions to stop their treatment [ ART ] to avoid entry ban .
This step caused resistance to the treatment …
… All countries have to remember that all UN member states were signed on to the International Health Regulations which does not single out any diseases , including HIV .
This regulation must be the baseline of advocacy for treatment provision in the country .
Influential countries such as USA and China should take on the leadership on this regard and be a good role model for other countries when they actually eliminate the restrictions . ”
Now that the HHS has posted their proposed regulations , there will be a 45 day public comment period that ends on August 17 .
If the regulations are adopted after the comment period , they will then need to be implemented .
The final timeline for implementation is n't currently known , but some activists hope for something by the end of the year .
The blog DYM SUM says everyone will benefit if the ban is repealed and the new regulations implemented .
“ This has been a lesser issue of contention in some parts of the GLBTQ [ gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender , queer and questioning ] community , but – without question – is equally important to other matters that need to be addressed .
Of course , it goes without saying that lifting the HIV travel ban affects not only the GLBTQ community , but the entire world as well . ”

Project Daedalus
Project Daedalus was one of the first detailed design studies of an interstellar spacecraft .
1
Conducted between 1973 and 1977 by a group of a 11 scientists and engineers belonging to the British Interplanetary Society , led by former Rolls Royce rocket engineer Alan Bond , it demonstrated that rapid , unmanned travel to the stars is a practical possibility .
Certain guidelines were adopted : the Daedalus spacecraft had to use current or near - future technology , be able to reach its destination within a human lifetime , and be flexible enough in its design that it could be sent to any of a number of target stars .
These guidelines ensured that the spacecraft would be practical , that those who worked on the project might live to see it achieve its goals , and that several stars could be investigated using the same type of vehicle .
The selected target was Barnard 's Star , a red dwarf lying 5.9 light - years from the Sun .
Although the Alpha Centauri system is closer , evidence available at the time ( now considered unreliable ) suggested that Barnard 's Star might be orbited by at least one planet .
To reach Barnard 's Star in 50 years ( the flight time allotted in the study ) , a spacecraft would need to cruise at about 12 % of the speed of light , or 36,000 km /s .
This being far beyond the scope of a chemical rocket , the Daedalus team had to consider less conventional alternatives .
The design they chose was a form of nuclear - pulse rocket , a propulsion system that had already been investigated during Project Orion .
However , whereas Orion would have employed nuclear fission , the Daedalus engineers opted to power their starship by nuclear fusion – in particular , by a highly - efficient technique known as internal confinement fusion .
Small pellets , containing a mixture of deuterium and helium - 3 , would be bombarded , one at a time , in the spacecraft 's combustion chamber by electron beams and thereby caused to explode like miniature thermonuclear bombs .
A powerful magnetic field would both confine the explosions and channel the resulting high - speed plasma out of the rear of the spacecraft to provide thrust .
By detonating 250 pellets a second , and utilizing a two - stage approach , the desired cruising speed could be reached during an acceleration phase lasting four years .
Daedalus would be constructed in Earth orbit and have an initial mass of 54,000 tons , including 50,000 tons of fuel and 500 tons of scientific payload .
The first stage ( shown left ) would be fired for two years , taking the spacecraft to 7.1 % of light speed , before being shut down and jettisoned .
Then the second stage would fire for 1.8 years before being shut down to begin the 46 - year cruise to Barnard 's Star .
Since the design made no provision for deceleration upon arrival , Daedalus would carry 18 autonomous probes , equipped with artificial intelligence , to investigate the star and its environs .
The 40 - m diameter engine of the second stage would double as a communications dish .
On top of the second stage would be a payload bay containing the probes , two 5 - m optical telescopes , and two 20 -m radio telescopes .
Robot wardens ( shown below ) would be able to make in - flight repairs .
A 50 - ton disk of beryllium , 7 mm thick , would protect the payload bay from collisions with dust and meteoroids on the interstellar phase during the flight , while an artificially - generated cloud of particles some 200 km ahead of the vehicle would help disperse larger particles as the probe plunged into the planetary system of the target star .
En route , Daedalus would make measurements of the interstellar medium .
Some 25 years after launch , its onboard telescopes would begin examining the area around Barnard 's Star to learn more about any accompanying planets .
The information thus gathered would be fed to the computers of the probes , which would be deployed between 7.2 and 1.8 years before the main craft entered the target system .
Powered by nuclear - ion drives and carrying cameras , spectrometers , and other sensory equipment , the probes would fly quickly past any planets looking especially for any signs of life or conditions favorable for biology .

An artist 's interpretation of NASA 's LCROSS spacecraft observing the first impact of its rocket booster 's upper stage before heading in for its ' own crash into the Moon 's South Pole .
Get ready for a uniquecosmic collision !
Early this coming Friday morning ( Oct. 9 ) , NASA 's LunarCrater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) will end its mission with abang ?
literally .?
Currently carrying with itthe upper stage of the rocket that launched it on its way to the moon on June18 , the game plan is to send that spent rocket motor on a course to smashinto the lunar surface . ?
But just not anywhere onthe lunar surface , but to a thoroughly scrutinized crater called Cabeus thatlies near the moon 's south pole and is enveloped in perpetual darkness .
Thehoped - for resultant effects will be to find hidden water ice frozen inside thecrater .?
And for seasoned skywatchershere on Earth , it should also produce a visible cloud of ejected material .
However , only knowledgeable amateur astronomers with the right equipment willbe a able to detect the event .
Others can watch the event live on NASA TV .
Smackdown !
The general belief among astronomers is that over the lastfew billion years , the moon has been bombarded by countless numbers of comets .
The water from most of these comets completely sublimated away but if anysettled at the bottom of a crater near the moon 's poles , these permanentlyshadowed regions can keep the water from disappearing , remainingas ice for a very long time .???
Cabeus is a relatively flat crater about 60 miles indiameter on the moon 's south pole that scientists believe may be one of thosespecial cases that might hold water ice in its perpetually shadowed top soil .
NASAinitially selecteda different target for LCROSS , the nearby crater of Cabeus A , but switchedto the larger Cabeus because data suggested it had a higher likelihood ofcontaining hidden water ice .
The impact is scheduled to occur this Friday , Oct. 9 at 11:30 UT .
That 's 7:30 a.m. EDT ; 4:30 a.m. PDT .
To convertUniversal
Time to your local time , go here .
Impact will happen less than 10 hours after the spent LCROSSCentaur rocket motor is released and its Shepherding Spacecraft maneuvers intoposition to trail the Centaur en route to the lunar surface .
The 5,000 - poundCentaur , is expected to slam into Cabeus at a sharp angle at a speed of 5,600 mph ( 9,010 kph ) .
If all goes according to schedule , the Shepherding vehicle , carrying nine science payloads , will follow the Centaur 's plunge into the moon , beaming back data live to the Earth .
Like a bullet hitting sand , the Centaur ' sexplosive collision is expected to create a crater roughly 60 or 70 feet wideand perhaps as much as 16 feet deep , in the process dredging up approximately 385tons of lunar dust and soil ?
enough to fill nearly 18 school buses .
Inaddition to recording the collision , the Shepherding Satellite will fly throughthe regolith plume thrown up by the collision , just before it too slams intothe lunar surface some four minutes later , kicking up its own smaller plume ofdebris .
But before it 's sacrificed in the cause of science , the 1,500 - pound Shepherding Spacecraft will utilize its specialized sensors andwill look for water 's telltale chemical signature within the larger debrisplume created by the Centaur , possibly in the form of ice , hydrocarbons orhydrated materials .?
How to watch
NASA wants the amateur astronomer community to join in a" citizen scientist " program .
Jennifer Heldmann heads the LCROSSobserving campaign .
" We would like to have as many eyes and instrumentswatching the impact as possible because this is the way we 'll get the most dataand the most information as possible . "
Those who live to the west of Mississippi River will havethe best opportunity because the sky will still be dark .
Those living east ofthe Mississippi will still have the moon in the sky , but either dawn twilightor ?
in the case of those living along the Atlantic Seaboard ?
sunrise willhave occurred , making for a much brighter sky background .
A dark backdrop willbe an important prerequisite , since it 's estimated that when the debris plumeforms on it will be no brighter than a sixth - magnitude star ( the threshold ofnaked - eye visibility ) , and quite likely even fainter .?
If you want to attempt to see the impact yourself , here are someimportant points to be aware of : ?
First , you 're going to need a moderately large telescope , somewhere on the order of at least 10 to 12 inches of aperture .
Smallertelescopes will probably not be able to do the job and you will definitely notsee anything using binoculars .
You 'll likely need to use magnifications in the250 to 500 - power range to have a legitimate chance of getting a glimpse of thedim impact plume .?
Keep in mind that high power dilutes the brightness of animage , as well as aggravates any unsteadiness of detail .
As a general rule ofthumb that the maximum amount of magnification for any telescope is 50 - powerper inch of aperture .?
? But wait a minute , ? you may protest , ? my telescope comeswith a special Barlow lens , that the manufacturer promises will double or eventriple the magnification of my eyepiece . "
True enough .
In fact , that aforementioned 500 - power islikely achieved by pushing the scope ?s highest power eyepiece with that verysame Barlow lens , which ultimately will result in a dim , impossibly fuzzyimage .
If you ?re a beginner , you need to understand that that using a Barlowlens is similar to enlarging a photograph .
The negative ?
like a telescope ?
simage ?
contains only so much detail , which can be blown up only so far beforeall you can see is fuzz !?
So , if you have a 3 - inch department store telescope ? even if it is blessed with perfect optics ?
the claim of 500 - power is more thanthree times the limit of the most practical magnification that it canprovide .
The impact will take place at the lunar south pole , or onthe lower limb of the moon along the dark portion immediately adjacent to theterminator ( the line that separates the illuminatedday side and the dark night side of the Moon ) .
Try to keep the very brightsunlit portion of the moon out of the field of view as much as possible .
The plume is expected to be in the shape of a " V" but it will be exceedingly small in size relative to the moon itself .
Accordingto NASA 's Brian H. Day , the dusty material is only expected to rise about 6 miles ( 10 km ) above the lunar surface .
From Earth , that would be equal to aboutone - quarter of 1 percent of the moon 's apparent size or about 5.2 arc seconds .
To try and get an idea of just how large this is , point yourtelescope toward Jupiter which conveniently shines in the southern part of ourcurrent evening sky .
Jupiter 's disk currently measures 45 - arc seconds indiameter ; so the dust plume from LCROSS would appear only about 1/9 as large asthat !
And the plume ?
if and when it 's visible ?
will not lastvery long .
The best guesstimates are that it will last no more than 2 minutes .
You can get more detailed viewing tips from NASA here .
Observatories expected to participate in the study includethe newly refurbished Hubble Space Telescope , Hawaii's Keck and Geminitelescopes , the Magdelena Ridge and Apache Ridge observatories in New Mexico , the MMT Observatory in Arizona and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) nowcircling the moon .
Lastly , you can watch the event live here on NASA TV , beginningat 6:30 a.m. EDT / 3:30 a.m. PDT .?

Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York 's Hayden Planetarium .
He writes about astronomy for The New York Times and otherpublications , and he is also an on -camera meteorologist for News 12 Westchester , New York .
J. David Smith , Ph.D. , a comparative psychologist at the University at Buffalo who has conducted extensive studies in animal cognition , says there is growing evidence that animals share functional parallels with human conscious metacognition -- that is , they may share humans ' ability to reflect upon , monitor or regulate their states of mind .
Smith makes this conclusion in an article published the September issue of the journal Trends in Cognitive Science ( Volume 13 , Issue 9 ) .
He reviews this new and rapidly developing area of comparative inquiry , describing its milestones and its prospects for continued progress .
He says " comparative psychologists have studied the question of whether or not non-human animals have knowledge of their own cognitive states by testing a dolphin , pigeons , rats , monkeys and apes using perception , memory and food - concealment paradigms .
" The field offers growing evidence that some animals have functional parallels to humans ' consciousness and to humans ' cognitive self - awareness , " he says .
Among these species are dolphins and macaque monkeys ( an Old World monkey species ) .
Smith recounts the original animal - metacognition experiment with Natua the dolphin .
" When uncertain , the dolphin clearly hesitated and wavered between his two possible responses , " he says , " but when certain , he swam toward his chosen response so fast that his bow wave would soak the researchers ' electronic switches .
" In sharp contrast , " he says , " pigeons in several studies have so far not expressed any capacity for metacognition .
In addition , several converging studies now show that capuchin monkeys barely express a capacity for metacognition .
advertisement
" This last result , " Smith says , " raises important questions about the emergence of reflective or extended mind in the primate order .
" This research area opens a new window on reflective mind in animals , illuminating its phylogenetic emergence and allowing researchers to trace the antecedents of human consciousness . "
Smith , a professor in the UB Department of Psychology and Center for Cognitive Sciences , is recognized for his research and publications in the field of animal cognition .
He and his colleagues pioneered the study of metacognition in nonhuman animals , and they have contributed some of the principal results in this area , including many results that involve the participation of Old World and New World monkeys who have been trained to use joysticks to participate in computer tasks .
Their research is supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Development and the National Science Foundation .
Smith explains that metacognition is a sophisticated human capacity linked to hierarchical structure in the mind ( because the metacognitive executive control processes oversee lower - level cognition ) , to self - awareness ( because uncertainty and doubt feel so personal and subjective ) and to declarative consciousness ( because humans are conscious of their states of knowing and can declare them to others ) .
Therefore , Smith says , " it is a crucial goal of comparative psychology to establish firmly whether animals share humans ' metacognitive capacity .
If they do , it could bear on their consciousness and self - awareness , too . "
In fact , he concludes , " Metacognition rivals language and tool use in its potential to establish important continuities or discontinuities between human and animal minds . "

Frank DiPascali Jr. , a central figure in the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff , will remain in jail until his sentencing next spring , despite efforts by federal prosecutors to win his temporary release so that he can more easily assist their continuing investigation .
At a hearing Wednesday , Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied Mr. DiPascali ’s second bail request .
He has been in jail since Aug. 11 , when he admitted helping Mr. Madoff conduct his enormous fraud and pleaded guilty to charges that carry a possible prison term of 125 years .
At that time , prosecutors disclosed that Mr. DiPascali , who oversaw the creation of an elaborate phony paper trail that concealed the fraud for decades , had agreed to cooperate with their investigation in exchange for possible leniency , and they asked that he remain free on bail to facilitate that effort .
Judge Sullivan denied that first request , concluding that the length of Mr. DiPascali ’s potential sentence might tempt him to flee before his sentencing hearing next spring .

Microsoft has officially launched its war against the iPod touch , announcing that the new Zune HD is available for pre-order online at various sites .
Microsoft 's new Zune HD ( click image to enlarge )
The Zune HD will hit the shelves Sept. 15 , Microsoft said .
Like the iPod touch , it is available in 16 - and 32 - GB models .
It has WiFi , a touchscreen , HD Radio and high - definition video .
With all that , will it be able to take on the iPod touch , still the clear market leader ?
The Coming of the Zune
As of Friday , consumers will be able to pre-order the Zune HD at the Microsoft store as well as at the Amazon.com , Best Buy , and Wal - Mart Web sites .
The 16 GB model will be available for pre-order in black ; the 32 GB model can be pre-ordered in platinum .
From Sept. 15 , both versions will be able in five colors .
Consumers will be able to customize their purchases with one of 10 engravings designed by guest artists .
Tech Specs
The Zune HD has a 3.3 - inch glass OLED touchscreen with a resolution of 480 by 272 pixels .
It uses a custom version of the Internet Explorer browser optimized for its multitouch screen .
The device supports high - def video playback through an HDMI audio / visual docking station that can be connected directly to an HDTV at 720 p resolution .
The docking station is sold separately .
It charges and syncs the device while playing HD videos .
The Zune HD also has a built - in HD Radio receiver .
The technology allows listeners to hear songs in higher quality on local stations that broadcast using HD Radio equipment .
Some stations broadcast multiple channels .
Users can play HD Radio and listen to music and podcasts while driving using the Zune Premium Car Pack .
Zune capabilities will come preinstalled in at least 27 GM vehicles by next hear , and Hyundai and Kia will add them in 2011 , according to a blog post by Brian Seitz , Zune 's group marketing manager , at ZuneInsider .
Nvidia 's Tegra Chip
The Zune HD uses Nvidia 's Tegra APX 2600 chip , which Nvidia says enables " a compelling user interface and high - definition video playback . "
Based on the ARM11 MPCore , the chip offers enhanced NAND Flash support and features low power consumption .
Tegra processors offer always - on operation for instant Internet access , and Nvidia claims they offer up to five times the battery life of current netbooks .
The Tegra processor consists of separate processor units , each designed for a different task -- one for running HTML and Java ; an HD video processor ; an ultra low - power Nvidia GPU for handling the user interface and Flash acceleration .
These can be used independently or together .
Nvidia 's Tegra APX 2600 consists of a processor and memory subsystem ; an HD audio / video processor ; a ULP ( ultra low power ) Nvidia GPU ; imaging ; and a display subsystem .
" There will be other Tegra - based devices in the second half of 2009 , " Nvidia spokesperson Hector Marinez told TechNewsWorld .
Those other devices will include smartphones , mobile Internet devices and smartbooks .
Reach Out and Touch an iPod
In many respects , the Zune HD mimics the iPod , and that makes it a difficult sell .
" Let 's see -- it 's got 16 - and 32 - GB versions like the iPod ; it 's available in different colors like the iPod ; it 's got WiFi like the iPod ; and it can store and play back music ... , " said Laura DiDio , principal at ITIC .
" What makes you want to pick it over the iPod ? "
The iPod has about 72 percent of the market , DiDio told TechNewsWorld .
Over and above that , it 's from Apple , with all that implies in terms of brand recognition , cachet and ancillary products .
" Apple sold 10.2 million iPods in the last quarter , down 800,000 from the 11 million they sold in the previous quarter , but that 's partly the result of some cannibalization by the iPhone 3GS , " DiDio said .
" iPod touch unit sales grew 130 percent year over year . "
While the Zune HD is a good device , it just does n't have the chops to be a serious threat to the iPod , DiDio said .
" Zune 's competitive , but it 's a me - too product , and I do n't see a differentiator or a distinct advantage . "
One advantage the Zune does have over the iPod is its price -- a 16 - GB Zune HD has an estimated retail price of US $ 219.99 , and a 32 - GB one goes for $ 289.99 .
Comparable models of the iPod touch retail at $ 299 and $ 399 , respectively .
Apple lists an 8 GB iPod touch at $ 229 .
However , that advantage may be short - lived -- DiDio expects Apple to match the Zune 's prices .
何でもいいから英語の単語に「痴」を付けてGoogleで検索してみる。例えば「he痴」でもいい。うまく見つからなければ，例えば
Shakespeare 痴 Got A
Gun を見てみる。英語のサイトなのに何でこう「痴」が多いのか（うまく「痴」に見えないなら，ブラウザのデフォルトのエンコーディングをシフトJISにしてみてください）。
答え ：Windows - 1252（CP1252）のアポストロフィは 0x92 であり，これにs（0x73）が付くと 92 73 となり，これはシフトJISで「痴」になる。つまり，「
He's 」 が「 He痴」に化けるページはアポストロフィ をWindows -1252でエンコーディングし，エンコーディング指定をしていないのでシフトJISで表示してしまったのである。書いた本人はLatin-1（ISO
8859-1）のつもりかもしれない。
アポストロフィ は '（0x27）でいいのではないか。でも
'（0x27）は左右対称にデザインされていることが多く（typewriter apostrophe），数字の９のようなおたまじゃくしの形の正しいアポストロフィ（typographic apostrophe）にするために工夫したつもりなのだ。
正しいアポストロフィの話は Presentation Zen : Apostrophes and quotation marks に載っている。アポストロフィだけを扱うサイト Apostrophe Abuse もある。技術的な話 はWikipediaの Apostrophe の項目に詳しい 。
Wordなどで英文を書く際には，ややこしいことを考えなくてもオートコレクト機能で正しいアポストロフィに変換してくれる。
問題 はWebページの作成である。UTF-8のページでどうすれば正しいアポストロフィを表示することができるだろうか。Unicodeでは '（ U+0027 ）がAPOSTROPHEという名前になっているが，実際には
’（ U+2019 ，RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK ）を使わないと正しいアポストロフィにならない。最新のUnicode Standardは持っていないが，3.0 のChapter 6（p.149）には次のように書かれている：
The preferred character for apostrophe is U+2019 , but U+0027 is commonly present on keyboards .
In modern software , it is therefore common to substitute U+0027 by the appropriate character in input .
In these systems , a U+0027 in the data stream is always represented as a straight vertical line and can never represent a curly apostrophe or a right quotation mark .
しかし，日本語のフォントがデフォルトになっていると，’（U+2019）が「全角」になってしまって，間延びしてしまうことがある。これを避けるためには，CSS（またはfontタグ！）で欧文フォントを指定すればいいのだろうが，環境に依存しない一般的な方法はないものだろうか。同じことが“ダブルクォーテーションマーク”についてもいえる。
[ 追記 ] シングルクォート・ダブルクォートの類の文字幅の問題は東アジアの文字幅（East Asian Width） のAmbiguousの問題というらしい。解決法として，例えば < span lang = " en " >
He’s</ span > のようなことをして効くだろうか。
Letters to the Editor
Potty Mouth
DEAR ELLEN FORNEY :
My students have recently completed their letters to you .
As a class , we strongly believe in the core principles of the freedoms of speech and press .
The sixth - grade students in room 9 at Bow Lake Elementary value those freedoms .
At the same time , we also value productive freedom of press and speech .
We ask our children to steer away from things like drugs , alcohol , and other choices that lead to negative experiences .
So why , then , do adults write articles [ " How D'ya Smoke Pot and Stay Out of Jail ? ? " comic by Ellen Forney , Sept 27 ] informing people how to use drugs without getting caught ?
My students and I just could n't figure out why someone would write an article supporting the use of illegal drugs .
We all know that many are already addicted to alcohol , prescription medications , and illegal drugs .
Plenty of others are fighting other addictions , to alcohol and other drugs .
So why encourage the use of pot , Ellen ?
We just did n't think it was a productive use of free speech and press .
We think it 's not responsible to write articles encouraging folks to use pot and get away with it .
Jason J. Dodge , teacher of the wonderful kids in room 9 at Bow Lake Elementary School , SeaTac
[ Ed. note :
We were unable to print all of the students ' letters due to space constraints . ]
DEAR ELLEN FORNEY :
What is your purpose ?
Are you trying to make people get addicted to smoking so that they can get addicted and later on " die " !
I think that you should stop writing such nonsense .
I do n't think you would want to ruin the next generation 's kids .
If you wrote this in a different country , you would get your hands cut off and be sent to jail forever .
A Concerned Sixth - Grader
IF YOU KEEP writing this article lots of people will get addicted to drugs .
Lots of kids like looking at comics and if you keep writing this article kids will use drugs too .
If you do n't stop we will have to write to you again .
Ken , a Sixth - Grader
MY TEACHER HAS brought in a newspaper a couple weeks ago .
I do n't think it is appropriate to help people who smoke pot to get away with it .
If you keep writing articles like that the people who smoke pot will start to increase just by your unacceptable article .
I do n't think you should do this again .
Krystelle
WHY IN THE FIRST place are you writing an article " How to Smoke Pot and Get Away With It . "
That is so stupid .
I 'm not trying to be rude .
Tierre
WHAT WERE YOU thinking ?
I mean , it 's bad enough that so many people do drugs in America but you are encouraging it !
You know that kids love to read comics and I do n't think that you should have the right to freedom of the press you should have the right to remain silent in this instance .
No offense .
Artem
I FELT VERY worried .
When I saw your article on how to smoke pot and get away with it .
Like when you smoke it in the backyard and leave the door closed .
When the house reek of pot .
I am a sixth grader and I do not want to grow up and smoke pot .
PJ
IF KIDS START reading this and think drugs are cool they 'll start doing drugs and get into a lot of trouble and it 'll be all your fault .
You do n't even care about peoples futures .
You 're just a cruel person .
Just stop writing this stuff please .
That 's all I 'm asking for .
Marjot KharbandaP.S.
My last name is an Indian name .
DEAR EDITOR OF THE STRANGER : Not trying to be mean , but writing that article was a big mistake and kids might read that and smoke pot .
Well here 's a idea why do n't [ you ] write a different nice interesting article and when they read it they forget all about smoking pot .
Joshua
IT'S BAD ENOUGH that people in the world already smoke drugs , and now a lot of people will start doing drugs now that they can get away with it .
I mean if you had a child in 6th grade , and you send him / her to get a newspaper and finds the article you wrote .
Do n't you think it would change his opinion on drugs .
You know what would have been better than writing how to smoke drugs and get away with it .
Would be , if you wrote how to tell if your friends , families , etc. were doing drugs .
I 'm not trying to be rude , but maybe you could write something to tell people that they should n't listen to your article .
You do n't have to if you do n't want to it 's just a suggestion .
And I 'm not saying your a bad writer or that you do n't care about anyone but yourself , it 's just what you wrote .
Sammy
YOU SEEM TO be a creative person , but you should put your creativeness for better use than one for people encouraging them to do drugs .
I hope that it will make [ you ] think about what your writing about , if not you will hear from me again .
The Next Generation , Esayas
DO YOU KNOW that drugs can take away 20 or 30 years of your life .
Also they can kill you or can become high and drive and kill other people , and they can become addicted .
I hope that you did n't give that to a young teenager because I see kids that are only in middle school and they are smoking .
I am not going to write any more because I 'm so disgusted .
What were you thinking ?
NicoleP.S.
We are way smarter then you think we are .
DEAR ELLEN : I am going to break it down to you right quick , and tell you what I think .
I think it is a poor use of your god given talent to write .
Yesterday , I saw a paper that said that Whitney Houston was dying because of drug use .
Her husband Bobby Brown is messed up too .
Jason Williams for the Vancouver Grizzlies ( NBA ) got kicked out of college for possession of Marijuana .
Now your add is shattering young generations dreams of becoming a football , basketball , soccer , rugby , secretary , poet , actor / actress , singer , dancer , or even " the president of the United States , " but they started to use drugs and they got messed and now we can see them on the streets smoking pot , but they could of made something of themself , but they got messed up .
Future Football Star
YOUR MESSAGE WAS unclear because I was concerned .
Your message was fuzzy and I think it was n't nice .
You see , other people probably are concerned , I hope , about your article .
I hope others write to you that they are concerned about your writing .
A Concerned StudentWHAT IS YOUR purpose of writing this ?
I think about this article that is bad because it is helping people how to pot smoke but I think it 's bad to pot smoke .
When you read this letter I hope you stop writing articles that we do n't have to read to that helps you get away and did you ever think that some kids like to look around the newspaper or read articles like comics or something else .
I 'm think that you know parents care for their children but you just wanted to write something good but it was n't good .
So when you read this I hope you stop writing bad article that can help people to get away from something .
Josh , a Sixth - Grader
YOU HAVE FREEDOM of press but this article went too far .
We both know at least 26 people who do n't think that this article is funny .
In fact we bet that only a small percentage of people think the article is even funny .
Another fact is that we despise this article .
Basically we want to know why you let this article get printed in the first place .
Please write back ?
Amy
ELLEN FORNEY RESPONDS : KIDS -- Thanks for your letters .
I agree .
Marijuana is not for kids .
JASON -- What were you thinking , bringing my comic into your classroom ?
It was intended for adults , and published in a paper for adults .
Millions of tax - paying , flag - waving citizens enjoy a joint now and then , many find pot 's medicinal qualities invaluable , and many fight hard for its legalization .
www.NORML.org has plenty of information on their site ; check it out .
Best ,

In our November 8 issue , the photo for " Domestic Front " by Amy Jenniges was taken by Fel Pajimula .

We regret both photo credit errors .
As everyone else has been cheering the revival of the housing bubble , one person has been busy offloading a significant portion of his exposure to housing : Bill Gross .
And the direct sponsor of billions of dollars hitting Mr. Gross ' Wells Fargo banking account , why , the US taxpayer of course , courtesy of the Fed 's printing press which continues keeping prices artificially high .
With the Fed en route to purchase nearly one and a half trillion in Agency and MBS paper ( for now ) , it has found eager sellers in the face of PIMCO .
MarketWatch reports that PIMCO sold $ 30 billion in agency paper in September alone , and has sold over $ 80 billion year to date .
Total Return Fund 's holdings of mortgage - related securities fell from 38 % of the portfolio on Aug. 31 to 22 % on Sept. 30 , the latest date for which figures are available .
On July 31 , 47 % of the fund was in mortgages -- the fund 's largest category holding at that time .
The fund 's assets under management on July 31 , Aug. 31 and Sept. 30 were $ 169 billion , $ 177.5 billion and $ 185.7 billion , respectively .
The last time Total Return Fund had less allocated to mortgages was Feb. 28 , 2005 , when the level was 19 % .
The fund 's assets under management at that time were $ 75.8 billion .
PIMCO is not shy in disclosing it is more than happy to take US taxpayers for the proverbial ride :
" Pimco 's significant overweight to high - quality , agency mortgage - backed securities has recently been strongly positive for returns .
With MBS valuations having richened substantially , and the Federal Reserve 's mortgage - purchase program slated to end in March of next year , Pimco plans on moving to an underweight in an effort to benefit from an expected cheapening of agency MBS . "
PIMCO 's Total Return Fund had about $ 120 billion in MBS , or 86 % of total holdings , on February 28 .
The number has declined to a meager $ 40 billion at September 30 .
A Price / Yield for an indicative Fannie 30 Year 5 % MBS , indicates that on average the price for comparable securities has risen by about 200 bps , ignoring the current yield .
Therefore , PIMCO has likely made well over $ 1 billion in profit on the $ 80 billion in mortgage - related securities it has sold off .
The invoice to the US taxpayer is already in the mail and is expected to be paid for at some point in the next decade when demand for US securities drops off a cliff once the Fed stops monetizing .
As to whether the market is aware of Gross ' stealthy offloading of MBS , and how it may react to this action :
[ Deutsche Bank analyst William ]
Chepolis said he believed that Wall Street banks were likely big buyers of Pimco 's sell - off .
" Banks like the zero credit rating .
...
No one knew Pimco was selling until they announced it , " which suggests that it had lined up deals with a few banks .
Finally , Chepolis pointed out that he's in agreement with Pimco 's new approach .
" I would be in favor in scaling back a little -- maybe not everything , but certainly taking profit off the table . "
As always , PIMCO , which itself is a key participant of virtually every Fed and Treasury program as an agent , manages to eek out a decent living , while stuffing Uncle Sam with the worthless refuse , whose true worth will only become evident once ( if ever ) the printing presses are shut .
The Sgt. Pepper 's Album Although most of the next two weeks would be taken up by recording the two songs for their next single , Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane , recording for Sgt.
Pepper 's started on December 8 , 1966 with take one of When I'm Sixty - Four .
The last track recorded was violins and cellos for Within You Without You on April 3 , 1967 , and mixing was completed April 20 .
Almost as an afterthought , the sounds for the Sgt.
Pepper 's ending groove were recorded the next day .
The original working title of A Day In The Life was " In The Life Of . .. "
A rare session outside of Abbey Road occurred during the time of the Sgt. Pepper sessions at Regent Sound Studio in London for part of Fixing A Hole on February 9 , 1967 .
Also during this period , the long - lost avante - garde Beatles recording called Carnival of Light was recorded on January 5 , 1967 .
Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band was officially released in both mono and stereo on June 1 , 1967 , although it was rush released in the UK on May 26 .
It was actually played on the radio in Britain on the BBC show Where It 's At , the week before on May 20 , except for A Day In The Life , which had been banned by the BBC the day earlier , on the grounds that it could encourage a permissive attitude towards drugs .

Missing
In Action Several people who were intended to be included on the cover never made it , including Elvis , Hitler and Jesus .
In addition , two people who were included were later removed by photographic retouching .
In these pics from alternate shots of the cover photo , you can still see Leo Gorcey , who was removed because he requested a fee , next to his fellow Bowery Boy pal Huntz Hal , and Ghandi , who was removed because EMI felt his inclusion might offend record buyers in India .
Album Variations
Because of the way 8 - Tracks cartridges worked , they had to contain 4 segments of similar length .
When they were released on 8 - Tracks , most LPs had to have their song order scrambled so that the songs fit properly on four programs .
However , when Capitol made the 8 - Track of Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , not only did they change the track order , but they actually edited a song to be longer so that it would fill up one program .

For those of you who have n't heard this since you sold your ' 66 Chevy , or for those of you who were n't even born when 8 - Tracks were popular , here is a soundclip of the edited version copied from an actual Capitol Sgt. Pepper 's 8 - Track .

( Edited Capitol 8 - Track Version )
Silly Censorship
In another Sgt. Pepper 's related oddity , the official version of the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP made by EMI in South East Asia / Malaysia / Hong Kong was censored of three songs that apparently could have possibly been interpreted as being " drug related " .
The songs that were removed were With A Little Help From My Friends , Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and A Day In The Life .
They were replaced on the album with three songs from the Magical Mystery Tour album ; The Fool On The Hill , Baby You 're A Rich Man and I'm The Walrus ( sic ) .
In addition , making this record a double oddity , the reverse cover of this album , seen above , did not contain the lyrics to the songs normally found on the back of the Sgt.
Pepper 's album ( probably because it was n't possible for them to redo all the lyrics including the new songs and without the removed songs ) .
Instead it features the same picture as the normal reverse cover , but without lyrics printed over it , probably the only place this picture was ever seen this way .
In 1977 , Korea issued its own strange version of Sgt. Pepper 's , the front cover of which is shown below , having been removed of all of the famous people that graced the original cover .
Like the Malaysian version , this release also was censored of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and A Day In The Life .
The blank space in the last column of its rear cover , shown below , and the different picture of the beatles required by the resetting of the type on top of them , are the byproducts of the missing songs .
The Sincerest Form of Flattery
The very distinctive Sgt. Pepper 's cover has been copied several times .
In 1968 , Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention released an album called We 're Only In It For The Money , a comment on the pretensions of the late sixties hippie movement .
This first parody of the Sgt. Pepper 's cover ran into legal trouble , however , and these takeoffs on Sgt.
Pepper 's front and back cover were included in Zappa 's album as the inside of the foldout cover instead .
Japanese artist Jun Fukamachi released a now very rare electronic version of Sgt. Pepper 's in 1977 on Japan 's EMI Toshiba label .
The cover is a reproduction of the original Sgt. Pepper 's photo , except everyone is facing backwards , and the writing is mirror - image .
The Warner Bros. LP of the music from the much beloved Beatles parody The Rutles came with a booklet that included a wonderful parody of many of the Beatles covers , including as shown below , the cover of Sgt.
Pepper's , or as it was known in the Rutles ' story , Sgt. Rutter 's Only Darts Club Band .
Over the years , the very popular animated TV show The Simpsons has included many references to the Beatles .
The title sequence of every episode of The Simpsons ends slightly differently , these are called " the couch gags " because the Simpson family ends up sitting down on the couch in front of the TV in a different way .
However , one special " couch gag " did n't end on a couch at all , instead they all gathered in a recreation of the Sgt.
Pepper cover to a sustained chord reminiscent of the end of A Day In The Life .
Also , the cover of The Yellow Album , the second collection of music from The Simpsons , released on Geffen records , is another homage to the Sgt. Pepper 's cover .
In both of these Simpsons Sgt. Pepper 's parodies , all of the people in the background are the residents of the Simpsons ' town , Springfield .

Apple told The Little App Factory to change the name of their popular app iPodRip , as it had the word iPod in it .
The CEO sent a passionate letter to Steve Jobs , and he got a response .
Here 's the letter he sent :
Dear Mr. Jobs ,
My name is John Devor and I 'm the co-owner of a small Mac shareware company named The Little App Factory and a long - term Apple customer and shareholder .
I doubt you 're aware but we recently received a letter from a law firm working on Apple 's behalf instructing us that we had violated several of Apple 's trademarks in our application iPodRip and asking us to cease using the name and Apple trademarks in our icons .
We have been distributing iPodRip since 2003 with the aim of providing a method to recover music , movies and photos from iPods and iPhones in the event of a serious hardware failure on their Mac which leads to data loss .
Our goal has been to provide the highest quality product coupled with the highest quality service in a bid to resolve some of the angst that is generated by such an ordeal ; service befitting of an Apple product .
In this department we think we have succeeded as we have approximately 6 million customers , many Apple employees , music artists and other notable people in society .
In fact I 'd argue that our customer service is the best of all competing applications in our niche as many of them are scams and frauds that leave Apple customers with a terrible taste in their collective mouths .
We fear very much that tens of thousands of Apple customers looking to recover their own music and having heard of our product via word - of - mouth or otherwise , will instead find a product produced by one of our competitors , and will wind up the victim of a scam ( one closely - named competitor charges a hidden monthly fee , for instance ) .
It is quite obvious that we mean Apple no harm with the use of the name iPodRip , or of the inclusion of trademarked items in our icons , and in fact I believe that we have been providing an excellent secondary service to Apple customers that has potentially caused you many repeat clients .
In fact , we are quite aware that Apple support and store staff have recommended our software on numerous occasions as far back as 2004 so we have felt that we were doing something right !
With this in mind , we are in desperate need of some assistance and we beseech you to help us to protect our product and our shareware company , both of which we have put thousands upon thousands of hours of work into .
Our company goal is to create Mac software of the highest quality with the best user experience possible .
I myself dropped out of school recently to pursue a path in the Mac software industry , and you yourself have been a consistent inspiration for me .
If there is anything at all you can do with regards to this matter , we would be most grateful .
Best ,
John Devor
I do n’t know if you ’ve encountered an electric car when it ’s moving but the motor is off , but if you have , you probably were startled by the silence .
That ’s because if the gas engine has n’t been turned on , you do n’t hear a thing while it ’s moving .
It ’s quite weird .
In fact , the silence has been a problem for both pedestrians and cyclists .
So in a bid to increase safety , Nissan has announced their new Leaf electric car will emit a “ beautiful and futuristic ” noise similar to the sound of the spinners ( the flying cars ) in director Ridley Scott ’s “ Blade Runner ” .
More after the jump :
According to Toshiyuki Tabata ( via Bloomberg ) , Nissan ’s noise and vibration expert , “ We decided that if we ’re going to do this , if we have to make sound , then we ’re going to make it beautiful and futuristic .
We wanted something a bit different , something closer to the world of art . ”
The plan is for the sound system to turn on automatically when the car reaches 12 mph .
While I do n’t know if the sound is exactly like the spinner ’s from “ Blade Runner ” or it ’s just influenced by the movie ….
but either way it ’s very cool .
I know as a fan of the movie , if I hear car ’s in real life making the noise I ’ll always smile as it drives past me .
If you are n’t familiar with the sound of the spinner ’s , here ’s the beginning of “ Blade Runner ” .
The spinner ’s fly towards the end of the clip .

The classic computer space - trading game Elite has celebrated its 25th anniversary .
Elite was released on 20 September 1984 for the BBC Microcomputer and was one of the first games to use 3D graphics .
Many developers regard the title as the forerunner of many modern games and have described it as a " milestone " .
David Braben , who co-developed Elite , confirmed that his company , Frontier Developments , were working on a sequel to the game .
" We 'd be mad not to go back to the world of Elite and I 'm very excited about it , " he told BBC News .
However , he would not be drawn on a possible release date saying it would happen " when its ready " .
The first version of Elite was published on a cassette tape
The original game was co-developed by Mr Braben and Ian Bell and was an overnight hit , selling hundreds of thousands of copies and influencing game development for years .
Elite was one of the first open - ended games , spanning eight vast universes , where the only real goal was to increase a player 's reputation rating from " Harmless " to " Elite " .
Mr Braben said that they never set out to write a commercial game , but wrote something that they themselves would want to play .
" This was a game we wrote many years ago for an ancient computer called the BBC Micro .
" We did this while we were at university and never expected it to be popular , let alone such a life - changing event , " he added .
Ian Livingstone , creative director at games firm Eidos , said Elite was a " milestone in gaming history " .
" This was one of the premier British titles that put UK development on the map and was very influential in inspiring people to get into gaming , " he told BBC News .
Compact code However , Mr Braben said that the pair originally had some difficulty finding a publisher , despite the game being popular with their friends .
He said that the game was so different from traditional coin- operated games , not least because Elite did not actually have a score , that most publishers rejected it .
BBC MICRO
Released in late 1981 8 bit microprocessor 6502 CPU at 2 MHz 640*256 screen resolution Cost £ 375 at launch 1.5 million sold " They just did n't get it , they wanted a high score and they wanted players to have three lives , " he said .
The game was eventually published by Acornsoft , the software arm of Acorn computers , which produced and manufactured the BBC Microcomputer .
It is estimated that Acorn eventually sold more copies of Elite than its Microcomputer .
Elite did many things differently from other titles of that era .
It was player , rather than story driven , lacked a final end point ( other than getting your player an Elite rating ) and required gamers to use their imagination .
" We did n't want a menu , such as you would find in a role - playing game , to determine what sort of person you were , " said Mr Braben .
" In Elite , you can do lots of different roles , but it is driven by your actions within the game , he said .
Mass market computers were still in their infancy in 1984 , with computers capable of four - channel sound , sixteen colours and little in the way of storage or memory .
" The BBC Micro only had 32 k of memory , but out of that came the screen and machine use , so Elite had to fit into 22 k which is less than most emails these days , " said Mr Braben " We crafted every single byte and would work for hours just to free up three or four bytes so we could put in a new feature or ability .
" That level of concentration on things have been lost today when you have things that are many megabytes or even gigabytes in size , " he added .
Mr Livingstone said Elite was as influential on videogame development as Monopoly was on board game development .
" These classics only come along every now and again and you never forget them ; they help define the genre , " he said .

Gecko's tail an energy powerhouse
It may help them escape , but when geckos drop their tail to flee a predator it appears they are also dumping the fuel that gives them energy to run away .
The finding by an international team is published in this week 's Physiological and Biochemical Zoology .
Co-author Dr Trish Fleming , of the School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences atMurdoch University , says caudal autotomy , or the ability to shed the tail in response to attack , is a major predator escape mechanism in species within 13 of the 20 lizard families .
The loss of the tail allows the lizard to break away from a predator that has seized it by the tail .
The tail may then also act as a distraction through spontaneous writhing or wriggling movements , engaging the predator 's attention while the lizard flees , Fleming says .
Ahead of the study , Fleming and her colleagues predicted South Africa 's Cape dwarf gecko Lygodactylus capensis would become faster after loss of its tail as a result of reduced friction with the ground or reduced body mass .
However , " contrary to our expectations , tailless geckos overall expended less effort in escape running , moving both slower and for a shorter distance , compared with when they were intact " , she says .
Fleming says she suspects the results will translate across lizard species .
Speed measured
For the study the tiny geckos , which are just a few centimetres long and weigh less than one gram on average , were made to run along a one metre glass tube with a wax floor while their carbon dioxide production , speed and distance travelled were measured .
Each gecko was trialled with its tail intact .
The researchers then induced the lizards to lose their tail by holding it with a pair of tweezers .
Two days later the geckos were put through the running trial again .
Fleming says initially the tailless geckos were slightly faster , but not by a statistically significant amount .
However over a distance of about 10 metres the tailless geckos were both slower and the distance covered was reduced , although the time they ran for remained the same .
" We found a 19 % reduction in the distance ran for our tailless geckos compared with when intact , " says Fleming .
She believes the results show the geckos use the fat stored in their tails , which make up about 8.7 % of body mass , as " fuel for running " .
Energy loss
Fleming says without the tails the geckos may have less fatty acids in the bloodstream to sustain locomotion .
She says reduced stamina suggests that lack of energy reserves stored in the tail ( eg fat ) may play a signiﬁcant role in the locomotory energetics of these animals .
However Fleming believes more work needs to be done on understanding the biochemistry of the gecko to support this hypothesis .
A follow - up study , which is yet to be published , shows the geckos ' behaviour also changes post tail loss .
She says field trials looked at how quickly tailless geckos would run away from a perceived predator and how long it would take them to re-emerge .
The tailless geckos were much more wary , says Fleming .
" They recognise their altered state and vulnerability and are altering how they behave . "

The New York Times of October 4 , 1918 , reports : " A train of empty cars southbound on the elevated extension of the subway halted not far from Brook Avenue , the Bronx , to allow for switching about 5 o'clock yesterday morning .
The passenger - filled train following stopped behind it at the Jackson Avenue station .
While the two trains were stopped a local train which left 180th Street at 4:50 o'clock bound for South Ferry , ran by the signal at the north end of the Jackson Avenue station and crashed into the train ahead .
Two persons were killed and about twenty - eight were injured .
Many of the passengers were thrown from their seats and showered with broken glass .
... Charles Bulkleu Hubbell , Chairman of the Public Service Commission , went to the scene ...
This is what Chairman Hubbell found :
' It seems that the front the train was a five - car train standing at the south end of the station where it would normally stop .
The " trip " stop at the north end of the station " tripped " the rear train and would have stopped it before collision if the motorman had been reducing his speed sufficiently to make his required stop at this station .
Back of the trip signal at the north end of the station was a caution signal set against the train .
The cause of the accident , of course , lay with the motorman of the rear train who had stopped at Prospect Avenue and took on and discharged passengers at that point .
The schedule time from that stop to the Jackson Avenue station is only a minute and a half . '
Mayor Hylan wrote Mr Hubbell a letter in which he advocated a rearrangement of the automatic stops so that if a train attempts to enter a station , at high speed or in disregard of signals it will be stopped befire it has a chance to collide with any train that happens to be in the station .
To this Chairman Hubbell replied giving the Mayor the cause of te accident as the commission found it .
' Your suggestion as to the relocation of the automatic signal will be given careful consideration ' he wrote and to this he added this information : ' I have ascertained that the motorman , who was killed , had been on duty about five hours , as he had gone on duty at 12 o' clock midnight after sixteen hours off duty ' " .

WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Top earners at financial and auto companies bailed out by the U.S. government will see their pay slashed under an Obama administration plan aimed at addressing public outrage over eye - popping paychecks , two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday .

The plan calls for halving overall compensation , and cutting cash salary payouts by an average of 90 percent , said the sources , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter .
The sweeping cuts , being negotiated by U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg , would mark a bold move for an administration that has railed against excessively high pay on Wall Street .
White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers told the Reuters Washington Summit on Wednesday that he believed Feinberg ’s review would “ produce an outcome where they will be very substantially reduced . ”
White House spokesman Bill Burton , traveling with President Barack Obama in New Jersey , told reporters , “ The president put Ken Feinberg in place in order to be an advocate for taxpayers and it appears that Mr. Feinberg is doing what the president put him in place to do . ”
Otherwise , Burton said , he would not comment ahead of the report , due October 30 .
The companies affected are : AIG , Bank of America , Citigroup , General Motors , Chrysler , GMAC and Chrysler Financial .
They all declined to comment .
A Treasury Department spokesman also declined to comment .
Blockbuster earnings and bonuses at Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other companies that received taxpayer assistance have stoked public anger over compensation as the United States grapples with a 9.8 percent unemployment level and little assistance for homeowners struggling to pay mortgages .
Feinberg , whose actions only impact companies that received “ exceptional assistance ” from the government , said on Tuesday that he may publicly disclose his rulings before the October 30 deadline .
He could not be reached for comment on Wednesday .
The Wall Street Journal reported that he also planned to demand broader corporate governance changes , including splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive officer .
AIG UNIT EYED
The sources said the top earners at AIG ’s financial products unit , largely blamed for risky bets that threatened the stability of the insurer , would not receive more than $ 200,000 in total individual pay .
That unit became the illustration of Wall Street insensitivity when it was revealed that its employees were receiving $ 165 million in retention bonuses , after taxpayers had pledged up to $ 180 billion to keep the company afloat .
In an interview with Reuters in August , Robert Benmosche , who became AIG ’s chief executive this summer , railed against efforts to regulate pay and criticism leveled at his employees , arguing , “ You still need to pay people competitively . ”
Feinberg told a group of corporate directors on Tuesday that the bailed out companies have delivered to him a “ consistent message ” that they need to keep their pay competitive .
“ You hear a great deal about the need for these companies to remain competitive , ” he said .
“ You hear that quite a bit . ”
Feinberg ’s review looked to be popular with organized labor and other groups , some of which have accused the administration of being cozy with Wall Street .
“ I think he is right on the money and he is going after them as aggressively as he can , ” said Richard Ferlauto , director of corporate governance and pension investments for the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees .
But , Robert Profusek , a corporate governance lawyer with Jones Day in New York , called Feinberg ’s review “ very discouraging . ”
“ I do n’t understand why it is in the taxpayers ’ best interests for us to be punitive in regard to TARP recipients , ” said Profusek , who advises banks and other corporate clients on executive compensation issues .
“ Taxpayers have a big stake in them .
Do n’t we want them to be nourished rather than seeking retribution , which is what this seems to be . ”
Feinberg is charged with approving or renegotiating pay contracts for the top 25 earners at the seven companies that have received “ exceptional ” taxpayer assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
He said on Tuesday that he has spent the past four months working closely with the companies “ to try to come up with actual dollars that can be endorsed by these seven TARP recipients . ”
He said he believes he has “ basically succeeded ” in renegotiating pay , even for contracts over which he did not have explicit authority .
But Feinberg ’s decisions will not necessarily touch the Wall Street companies that have repaid TARP funds , some of whose bonuses are already returning to pre-crisis levels .
The administration has proposed a broad crackdown on pay , including giving shareholders more say on compensation packages and forcing companies to disclose more about their pay practices .
Most fans can remember that one of the biggest debates around JJ Abrams Star Trek movie was about if it would ( or should ) include William Shatner .
The film makers spoke of how they tried to find a way , but in the end felt it would n’t work .
However , JJ Abrams revealed that Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman did write a scene for Shatner , and today we have that scene for you to read .
Putting Shatner into Star Trek ( 2009 )
TrekMovie received the scene below from one of our trusted sources and it has been verified to be the scene written for Shatner ( but never shown to Shatner ) .
The “ Alternate Scene B ” actually creates alternative versions two scenes from the end of the movie : the moment between Spock Prime ( Nimoy ) and Spock ( Quinto ) in the hangar , plus the award ceremony with Kirk ( Pine ) , Pike ( Greenwood ) and the Commandant ( Tyler Perry ) .
Including Shatner would have made alternatives to these ending scenes
Shatner would have played Kirk , but would have appeared as a recording .
The timing of the recording is not stated , but would have have been before Star Trek Generations and therefore not violate the canon that Kirk was killed in Generations .
JJ Abrams has often noted that dealing with Kirk ’s death was one of the hindrances of including him in the new Star Trek .
Shatner in " Star Trek Generations " ( 1994 ) , his last time in the chair
The Scene
Here it is …
— — — — — —— ——
ALTERNATE SCENE B
SPOCK PRIME
Then I ask that you do yourself a
favor … put away logic , and do what
feels right .
The world you ’ve inherited
lives in the shadow of incalculable
devastation … but there ’s no reason you
must face it alone .
And from around his neck , he removes the PENDANT that
until now , we ’ve only caught glimpses of .
Places it on
the table beside his younger self .
The feeling in his
eyes is profound …
SPOCK PRIME ( CONT’D )
This was a gift to me .
Representing …
a dream .
One we were unable to fulfill .
( softly )
The way you can now .
And moves to the door .
Stops .
Offers the VULCAN SALUTE :
SPOCK PRIME ( CONT’D )
As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving , I will simply say …
good luck .
Their eyes hold .
Spock turns , disappearing into the
corridor .
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a
beat , his mind a jumble of thoughts .
Looks to the
pendant … and realizes it ’s a HOLO - EMITTER .
After
considering a beat , he hits an activation button and a
MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him :
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK .
WILLIAM SHATNER .
As always ,
brash , wry , confident — and SINGING :
KIRK / SHATNER
Happy birthday to you , happy birthday to
you …
( stops , grins )
I know I know , it ’s illogical to
celebrate something you had nothing to do
with , but I have n’t had the chance to
congratulate you on your appointment to
the ambassadorship so I thought I ’d seize
the occasion … Bravo , Spock — they tell
me your first mission may take you away
for awhile , so I ’ll be the first to wish
you luck … and to say …
( beat , emotional )
I miss you , old friend .
… and we ’re PUSHING IN on Young Spock , taking in the
image of Kirk ’s future self , the message , but above all —
the clear , unquestionable friendship these two men had …
INT .
CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS
As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor , he passes
right by a man conferring with a nurse — the man pauses ,
turns … it ’s SAREK .
Suddenly overcome by a feeling that
the stranger who ’s just passed him is … oddly familiar .
KIRK / SHATNER ( V.O. )
I suppose I ’d always imagined us …
outgrowing Starfleet together .
Watching
life swing us into our Emeritus years …
INT .
STARBASE ONE – HANGAR – ETERNAL NIGHT
MUSIC BUILDING — glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at
dock , UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it , repairing .
Standing at attention in rows , THE ENTERPRISE CREW —
over four hundred of them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS — TRACK
DOWN the faces , all proud :
KIRK / SHATNER ( V.O. )
I look around at the new cadets now and
ca n’t help thinking … has it really been
so long ?
Was n’t it only yesterday we
stepped onto the Enterprise as boys ?
That I had to prove to the crew I
deserved command … and their respect ?
And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK .
Composed , focused , proud .
A
man .
And to every fan ’s delight , finally wearing his
YELLOW SHIRT .
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a
podium :
COMMANDANT
This assembly calls Captain James
Tiberius Kirk …
Kirk breaks from formation , pivots , marches down the
hangar — past UHURA … SULU … CHEKOV … SCOTTY .
All
Beaming .
Notably absent , is Spock .
Kirk ascends the
stairs , snaps to attention :
COMMANDANT ( CONT’D )
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades are in
keeping with the highest traditions of
service and reflect utmost credit to
yourself , your crew , and the Federation .
By Starfleet Order 28455 , you are hereby
directed to report to Commanding Officer ,
USS Enterprise , for duty as his relief .
Kirk turns .
Walks to … PIKE .
In a wheelchair now ,
wearing an ADMIRAL’S UNIFORM .
Overnight , his hair ’s
turned totally grey — but despite his trauma , his
pride ’s overwhelming .
They SALUTE each other :
KIRK
I relieve you , Sir .
PIKE
… I am relieved .
He opens a BOX in his lap — glorious in repose , a MEDAL :
PIKE ( CONT’D )
And as Fleet Admiral , for your … unique
solution to the Kobayashi Maru , it ’s my
honor to award you with a commendation
for original thinking .
Pike containing a smirk , pins the medal to Kirk’s
chest …
PIKE ( CONT’D )
( a touch choked )
Congratulations , Captain .
KIRK
Thank you , Sir .
Kirk turns to the crowd .
Eyes shining .
WILD APPLAUSE .
OUR MUSIC SOARS .
Bones leans in to Sulu , rolling his
eyes :
BONES
… Same ship , different day .
As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations , we
go to the BACK of the hangar …
SPOCK PRIME .
Watching .
Moved beyond words .
He turns and leaves them to it … as
he goes …
KIRK / SHATNER ( V.O. )
I know what you ’d say —
‘ It ’s their turn
now , Jim … ’
And of course you ’re
right … but it got me thinking :
INT .
STARFLEET HOSPITAL – EARTH – DAY
Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk’s
transmission :
KIRK / SHATNER
Who ’s to say we ca n’t go one more round ?
By the last tally , only twenty five
percent of the galaxy ’s been chartered …
I ’d call that negligent .
Criminal even —
an invitation .
You once said being a
starship captain was my first , best
destiny … if that ’s true , then yours is
to be by my side .
If there ’s any true
logic to the universe … we ’ll end up on
that bridge again someday .
Stops , grins .
Because this is the part he needs to say
most …
KIRK / SHATNER
Admit it , Spock .
For people like us , the
journey itself … is home .
Young Spock ’s face .
Lost in feelings that flood through
him .
— — — — — —— ——
But would Bill have done it ?
Even if the Abrams team had decided to go ahead with this scene , there is no guarantee that Shatner would have done it .
He had stated he “ does not do cameos ” and the above scene appears to fall into the cameo category .
Abrams had also stated that this “ no cameos ” position of Shatner ’s was part of their decision process not to include him in the film .
Now that the scene is public , maybe Bill will make another one of his video blogs about it .
One thing is for sure , this is not the last word on Shatner and the new Star Trek … there is still the sequel .

Letters to the Editor
Mother Teresa Did Not Deserve Her Peace Prize , Either
The list of Nobel Peace Prize laureates includes some amazing forces for good , but as Justin Cannon correctly pointed out in an letter on Friday , some awards have been far more dubious .
I am displeased to see Mother Teresa go without mention in Cannon ’s summary of less - than - deserving winners .
Her “ work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress ” ( to quote the Nobel committee ’s justification for her award ) is largely misunderstood .
She did not help cure the poor .
She did not help the sick of India .
All she did was provide rudimentary beds for the dying .
She believed that , regardless of her victims ’ religion , suffering would bring them closer to Jesus .
There was so much wrong with the “ care ” she and her ilk provided that there is hardly room to go into detail here — reusing needles , withholding pain medication , etc .
Her “ hospitals ” existed only to maximize suffering and convert people to Christianity .
As the poor died in her arms , she would baptize them if they were not already Christians .
From where in this mess of suffering and proselytizing did even the notion of a nomination for the Peace Prize arise ?
Her clinics were not health care facilities .
She operated in blatant violation of the Hippocratic Oath .
Her death houses were simply centers of agony and last - minute forced conversions .
Come to think of it , it ’s no wonder that she has been beatified .
Still , the Nobel Prize committee should know better than the Catholic Church , and it is unfortunate that the public eye still views her as a force for good .
Obama ’s Carbon Footprint
How many tons of carbon did Air Force One and all of the other massive jets that were used to bring Obama and his entourage , limos and SUVs for the secret service and motorcades , pump into the atmosphere in order for him to give his speech about how we have to change our ways and how we are destroying the earth ?
What a hypocrite .
Why did n’t he take the train ?
The majority of Internet filter trial participants report no slowdowns or accidental blockings despite ISP filtering
More than half of the Internet service providers ( ISPs ) taking part in the Federal Government ’s ISP filtering trial have reported minimal speed disruptions or technology problems .
Of the nine participating ISPs , iPrimus , Netforce , Webshield , Nelson Bay Online and OMNIconnect told ARN they had seen no slowdowns in Internet speeds or problems with the filtering solutions in place .
Of the remaining four ISPs , Tech2U and Highway1 were unable to respond by time of publication while Unwired and Optus refused to comment .
i Primus Australia CEO , Ravi Bhatia , said his company ’s ISP filtering trial , which must be opted into by its customers , had “ probably involved a few thousand users ” .
“ The users have not experienced any problems , they have n’t experienced any service degradation so it ’s been a pretty good experience , ” he said .
The results would be finalised by next week , Bhatia said .
Webshield managing director , Anthony Pillion , said his entire customer base of a few thousand end - users experienced no slow - down in Internet speeds whatsoever .
“ From a technical perspective we ’re more than confident that if the government decided to roll out a mandatory Internet filter based on or around an Australian Communications and Media Authority [ ACMA ] blacklist or subset thereof , then it can be done without any impact whatsoever to the speed of the Internet , ” he said .
Although OMNIconnect ’s managing director , Peter Hutton , received no complaints about slowed speeds or technical problems after the filtering hardware was in place , he said the blacklist provided by ACMA had banned legitimate websites and caused customer dissatisfaction .
“ Some of the customers complained because the block list really had n’t been moderated well enough , ” OMNIconnect chief technician , Graeme Lee , said .
“ One in particular was a site called Redtube.com .
The whole site had been blocked and it was just a standard pornography site , ” Hutton said .
“ Relating to that particular site we did have complaints that people could n’t get through to it .
They opted out of the trial straight away .
It was a very embarrassing experience . ”
ACMA refused to confirm or deny the website 's legality or if it was currently on the blacklist and advised users to read its guidelines for rating internet content .
One common issue with most of the ISPs was the lack of voluntary participants , especially with companies using an opt - in system .
Managing director of Nelson Bay Online , Patrick Sayer , said only 1 per cent of his entire customer base decided to opt - into the system , resulting in just 15 users .
When asked if he believed the trials provided a fair representative study , Hutton ’s answer was an unequivocal “ no ” .
“ That ’s why we ’ve asked for an extension to continue the trial till the end of this month and I understand a number of other ISPs have done the same thing , ” he said .
The results come on the back of earlier comments from the Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy , Senator Stephen Conroy that the current trial ’s success or failure would help form much of the government ’s opinions on mandatory nation - wide ISP filtering .
“ We 'll be guided by that trial .
We 've always said , consistently , we 'll be guided by the trial , ” the Minister said on the ABC ’s Q&A program .

Modern Warfare 2 is like a shock and awe campaign against your brain .
Whether it ’s trying to say something poignant or rewarding another crazy kill it ’s constantly overwhelming you with information .
This is at once pulse - pounding , rewarding , thought - provoking , and a little exhausting .
Some of the game ’s ideas get lost in all the noise , but when so much good content is thrown at you , most of it is sure to stick .
The cacophony of gunfire , explosions , and radio chatter begins with the single - player campaign .
Similar in presentation to the previous Modern Warfare , this direct sequel jumps between characters , telling a story of global terrorism and the men that stop it .
Peppered throughout are shocking moments not unlike the first - person execution and nuclear bomb scenes in the first game .
One scene will have you questioning every pull of the trigger , if you can even stomach to pull the trigger at all .
Conceptually , the encounter has some issues : towards the end it ’s impossible to avoid confrontation , and the game never questions your actions .
But it ’s a step in the right direction towards presenting challenging content in a video game .
That scene also doubles as a catalyst for the major conflicts in the game .
Modern Warfare 2 jumps between apocalyptic warfare through the eyes of US Marines , and the globe - trotting counter - terrorism adventures of “ Soap ” MacTavish and his ex-SAS crew .
Apocalypse might be an understatement though , especially for any middle - class suburbanites playing the game .
Most war stories focus on a known quantity ; WWII or a war - torn third world country , but MW2 takes one of the safest places in the world and turns it upside down .
The results are both frightening and reflective , questioning much of what we hold so dear .
When it is n’t challenging your morals or way of life , Modern Warfare 2 plays out like the most intense summer action movie of all time .
The plot is n’t too different from any number of war games set in modern times .
As much as it questions war it also glorifies it – Generation Kill - inspired jargon , weapon caches that feel like gun porn , and a “ hoo - rah ” - ing cast of testosterone - fueled heroes ( including the wonderful Keith David ) , remind you that this is still pretty much an interactive Bruckheimer movie .
The back end even devolves into personal vendettas and melodrama , much like an episode of 24 or a Metal Gear Solid game .
The insane plot is still tense and entertaining , but it feels at odds with the more powerful moments of the game .
The actual combat is more refined than ever , offering the only FPS controls that give Halo a run for its money .
The difference is how fast - paced it is .
Whatever mode you ’re in , enemies dart out from cover in every direction .
Reaction time is key , and the aiming controls are up to the task – they ’re as quick as your own reflexes , and they never feel automatic .
The AI enemies swarm from all corners in massive , but finite numbers .
MW2 finally addresses one of the biggest complaints of the series – no longer do endless waves of enemies pour out of closets like clowns from a Volkswagen .
They ’ll bound along rooftops and sprint down alleyways to get to you , always arriving to catch bullets in a logical fashion .
The level design is a high watermark for the genre , crafted with equal care across all of its modes .
The attention to detail is most obvious in the campaign , where you ’ll find shanty towns and villages that dance between strict linearity and maze - like complexity .
You ’re always funneled down an obvious path , but there ’s also plenty of options for both you and your enemies .
The more finely crafted areas are re-used for Spec - Ops .
Intended for two - players , this mode has one goal : variety .
One moment you ’ll be racing in snow mobiles , and the next you ’ll be defending a convenience store with your life .
The best missions split the two players between ground warfare and air support .
The contrasting viewpoints force teamwork more than most online games , including MW2 ’s own 18 - player multiplayer .
But that multiplayer mode is what most people will buy the game for , and with good reason ; long after the campaign and Spec - Ops modes run their course , Modern Warfare 2 will hold its crown as the most approachable online FPS out there .
Sure , there are legions of hardcore experts jumping at the chance to pick you off and insult your corpse , but that ’s not nearly the hindrance it is in most online games .
For better or worse , MW2 is extremely low - impact – death comes and goes , objectives are clearly spelled out , and the game moves so quickly it ’s nearly impossible to coordinate with other players .
That ’s not to say there is n’t teamwork , but it ’s all so simplified and communicated through the game that it ’s not important to strategize .
This leaves you open to chat with friends or even skip the headset altogether .
In fact , this is the most rewarding online shooter out there for lone wolves – even if they want to jump into team games .
It ’s all about the carrot on a stick , as the game blankets you in tangible rewards as you play .
Half the appeal is doing well enough to level up and unlock that next ability , weapon , or game mode .
It ’s the same idea as the original Modern Warfare , but refined and expanded upon to astounding effect .
With so many options at your disposal , you can create truly unique warriors .
From suicidal flag - runners spraying uzi rounds in every direction , to ghillie - suited snipers lying in wait , the game offers an incredible range of possibilities .
Say what you will about the hype Modern Warfare 2 generates , but understand that few games can even come close to the monsoon of polished gameplay this title offers .
Sure , it can be a bit low - brow , but it ’s still furthering the medium in significant ways .
There ’s something for almost everyone , and a game that brings so much of the community together is worth all the accolades it ’ll surely earn .

Timo Glock will miss the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi , his Toyota team confirmed on Tuesday , and will again be replaced by Kamui Kobayashi .
The German driver has been forced to miss the last two races in Japan and Brazil after he cracked a vertebra in an accident during qualifying at Suzuka .
Although Toyota was hopeful Glock would be fit to compete in the final race of the season , the Japanese squad said on Tuesday that it did not want to take risks and so Kobayashi will race again .
" We feel genuinely sorry for Timo that his season , which has included two impressive podium finishes , is ending in this way , " said team president John Howett .
" Having discussed the medical advice with Timo and his management , the team has decided to take no risk and to put Kamui in the car .
Kamui performed well in Brazil in difficult circumstances so we are happy to ask him to once again deputise . "
Twenty - three year - old Kobayashi had a promising debut at Interlagos , finishing in 11th position .
THE number of Americans denouncing their president 's plans for health - care reform as unvarnished socialism would presumably rise dramatically if Barack Obama decided to institute price controls for drugs .
Yet a study published this week in Health Affairs , an industry journal , suggests he should do exactly that .
Governments around the world are struggling to cope with the rising cost of health care , and of drugs in particular ( see chart ) .
Many rich countries have resorted to price controls , and some on the American left advocate them noisily .
But drug firms maintain that America , where they are free to price patented pills largely as they please , is the engine of global pharmaceutical innovation , while price - controlling Europeans are free riders .
That , says PhRMA , the industry 's lobby based in Washington , DC , is because price regulations seen in other rich countries “ chill innovation , impede patients ' access to the newest cutting - edge medicines , and trigger innovators to relocate to countries with more progressive public policy . ”
The new study , written by Donald Light , a visiting professor at Stanford University , claims that European drug firms are more innovative than American ones , in spite of price controls .
That flies in the face of an influential paper published in the same journal in 2006 , which examined the geographic origins of drugs registered between 1982 and 2003 and concluded that favourable public policies had helped propel America to the top of the list .
PhRMA has rushed to denounce Mr Light 's study , insisting it gives a “ distorted picture ” and understates the impact of “ home - grown innovation ” .
( One of the authors of the earlier paper , Henry Grabowski of Duke University , has also taken issue with Mr Light 's findings . )
The tiff exposes two fallacies that come from looking at a globalised industry through national spectacles .
Both sides attribute new drugs to a specific country of origin ( based on the location of the headquarters of the firm that first launches them ) .
But Patricia Danzon of the Wharton Business School argues that this makes little sense when most big drug firms have laboratories in several countries and often acquire drugs under development from biotechnology firms located elsewhere .
By the same token , firms develop drugs for the global market , observes Alan Garber of Stanford , not just for the local one .
So the imposition of price caps in a given country will not necessarily quash innovation there , thanks to the lure of exports .
The exception to this rule , of course , is the United States , which alone accounts for over 40 % of global sales .
So what would happen if America 's Congress imposes price regulations ?
If the cuts are swingeing , then the prize for inventors everywhere will be reduced .
But short of such a radical scenario , pricing reform would not kill off innovation , according to Sanford Bernstein , a financial - research firm .
It has analysed the likely impact of a cut of 20 % in the prices Medicare , the government health scheme for the elderly , pays for its drugs .
It concluded that the earnings per share of big pharmaceutical firms would drop by 3 - 8 % .
There is even reason to think that pricing reforms may boost innovation .
Britain and Germany are pioneering comparative reviews of drugs ' effectiveness and cost - benefit analyses aimed at reimbursing firms for new drugs based on how well they perform .
Some firms have embraced this idea : Janssen - Cilag ( owned by Johnson & Johnson , an American conglomerate ) persuaded Britain 's health service to accept Velcade , its expensive cancer drug , by offering a money - back guarantee if it did not work as well as promised .
The American pharmaceutical lobby is violently opposed to making such an approach compulsory .
Some suspect that its opposition stems from the fear that many expensive and profitable pills would be found to be of dubious value .
But as Ms Danzon points out , “ Comparative - effectiveness reviews are an indirect form of price control — but one that is consistent with encouraging innovation . ”
This article on the continued troubles in credit markets was informative .
But it raised a puzzle .
Call me naive , but why does
Fed policy seem to assume that the only way to repair credit markets is to return to the status quo ante , circa January 2007 ?
Here ’s how I think about what has happened these past 2 + years .
I think in terms of a sort of flow chart , showing ways that savers can connect with borrowers :
Traditionally — i.e. , before the 1980s — the public put its money in banks , and banks made loans to borrowers : thus the diagonal arrow from banks to borrowers represents traditional banking .
By 2007 , however , much of this traditional channel had been supplanted by shadow banking : debt was securitized , and the securities sold to the public — the straight arrow across the bottom of the figure .
Then the crisis came .
The public rushed for safety , which basically meant guaranteed deposits .
One rough indicator is holdings of MZM — money of zero maturity — which is the sum of bank deposits and money - market deposits :
In effect , the public rushed back into the banks .
But the banks were n’t willing to lend out these excess funds .
Instead , they accumulated deposits at the Fed :
To prevent a complete collapse of credit , the Fed in effect recycled these deposits back into private credit via the TALF and other securities - purchase programs .
So funds now flow all around the first figure , getting to the public via “ Bernanke banking ” ( my term . )
Everyone agrees that this is a stopgap , and we want to get the Fed out of the business of private lending over time .
But here ’s my question : why does it have to be a return to shadow banking ?
The banks do n’t need to sell securitized debt to make loans — they could start lending out of all those excess reserves they currently hold .
Or to put it differently , by the numbers there ’s no obvious reason we should n’t be seeking a return to traditional banking , with banks making and holding loans , as the way to restart credit markets .
Yet the assumption at the Fed seems to be that this is n’t an option — that the only way to go is back to the securitized debt market of the years just before the crisis .
Why ?
Are we still convinced that securitization is a far superior system to conventional banking , and if so why ?
Inquiring minds want to know .
In the retail business , it is never too early to think about Christmas .
So a lot of people are thinking about it , and taking surveys to test the mood of the American consumer , and deciding that this Christmas will be as bad as last  which is to say , one of the worst on record .
Retailers are relieved to hear that prediction .
Flat sales this holiday season would at least mean that things had stopped getting worse .
“ It ’s reflective of this ‘ new normal ’ we ’re in , ” said James Russo , vice president for global consumer insights at the Nielsen Company .
“ Flat is good . ”
Over all , the retailing industry posted a sales decline of about 2 percent last Christmas season , the weakest performance since the late 1960s , when the Commerce Department began tracking holiday sales figures .
Results for stores that sell clothing and luxury goods were far worse , typically declining by double digits .
By contrast , several reports published in the last few days , including surveys by Nielsen and Deloitte , forecast no change in holiday sales from last year to this year .
With Microsoft 's highly - anticipated Windows 7 less than a month away from its much - publicized release , it 's not all that surprising that company CEO Steve Ballmer has begun to tout the new operating system as the " best ... [ they ] have ever built . "
What is surprising , however , are the decisions by Ford Motor Company and Continental Airlines to make the leap to Win7 almost immediately .
New Standard for Operating Systems
In a note released to the media early yesterday , Microsoft CEO Ballmer bragged that " Windows 7 is the best PC operating system we have ever built . "
In naming the reasons why , Ballmer pointed out its unmatched security , management options , and energy efficiency abilities .
In fact , according to Ballmer , Windows 7 will usher in an era that will be considered " the new normal " for operating systems -- in other words , Microsoft 's top public figure believes Windows 7 will revolutionize operating systems and set a new standard for all those coming afterwards .
Win7 Streamlined , Less Annoying
" I believe the new normal requires a kind of efficiency built on technology innovations that enable businesses and organizations to simultaneously drive cost savings , improve productivity , and speed innovation , " Ballmer added .
( Source : informationweek.com )
Some of those advances in efficiency could come through what Ballmer characterizes as a more streamlined interface that tosses out many of the annoying security measures that only alerted ( and created ) critics .
For those who never made the switch from XP , we 're talking about the annoying UAC ( User Account Control ) " Are you sure ? " security messages in Vista prompted by the execution of just about any program .
Win7 Efficient , Cost Saving
Ballmer promises Windows 7 will makes businesses more money thanks to that upgrade in efficiency , saying " This could return the equivalent of one - half of one percent of the company 's current gross annual revenue to the bottom line . "
Although it remains to be seen whether this kind of rah-rah cheerleading will convince everyday home consumers , it seems several of the United States ' larger corporations are ready to make the leap .
Bloomberg recently reported the decision of Ford Motor Co. , Starwood Hotels & Resorts , Intel Corp. , and Continental Airlines Inc. to use Windows 7 on company computers .
1/4 of Companies to Migrate Within 18 Months
To date , 24 per cent of companies asked by Goldman Sachs said they would make the upgrade to Windows 7 within 18 months , while another 67 per cent said they 'd make the jump eventually .
That 's a higher rate than Vista achieved , says Bloomberg .

There are more than 350 online shopping carts .
And each week we feature one , interviewing both the cart ’s developer and a customer .
“ Cart of the Week ” is not a review or an evaluation , but rather an opportunity to learn about a shopping cart from the people who build it and use it .
This week , we ’ll hear from Temi Odurinde , general manager of Velnet UK , Ltd. , the developers of Boss Cart , an ecommerce platform based in London , England .
According to Odurinde , the cart ’s user base includes roughly 10,000 merchants .
We ’ll also hear from a Boss Cart user , Kevin Blake , the director and owner of Camping Online .
PeC : Please provide some general background on the cart .
Temi Odurinde : “ We actually started by developing a software called bespoke ecommerce solutions for small businesses .
Solutions were being developed specifically for each customer , meaning he or she would bear the full development cost , and the charges for patches and updates .
“ We received quite a few inquiries for ready - made shopping carts , and we used to refer such inquiries to other vendors .
But about two or three years ago , we decided to create our own , off - the - shelf solution ; Boss Cart . ”
PeC : Is the cart hosted or licensed ?
Odurinde : “ Boss Cart is licensed with partially open source code .
We have no plans for hosted solutions at the moment .
Users have the freedom to host their shop with the hosting company of their choice . ”
PeC : How much does Boss Cart cost ?
Odurinde : “ Boss Cart out - of - the box costs a one - time fee of £ 199 [ $ 330 USD ) .
This includes updates , patches and unlimited support via our support desk . ”
PeC : What are the cart ’s biggest strengths ?
Odurinde : “ Customer feedback about what they like most about Boss Cart includes its versatility and the fact that all the components you need to run an online shop–the various marketing modules , the SEO friendly features , integration with various payment gateways –comes as part of the package , and you do not need to pay separately for any add - ons .
“ Basically , if enough users ask for a feature that does not currently exist in Boss Cart , we just add it at no additional charge . ”
ListenListen to Temi Odurinde discuss his background and how he came to develop Boss Cart .
PeC : What are some of its weaknesses ?
Odurinde : “ Some customers would like us to integrate our reporting tools with their back - end applications , such as Sage [ a popular accounting software in the UK ] and other proprietary back - end software .
We have that on our to - do list .
“ Another thing is , we keep getting requests for integration with some obscure payment gateways we have never heard of , particularly from India and Pakistan , so we feel we are too Europe - and North America - centric at the moment , and we need to improve on that .
“ We also think we should translate Boss Cart to some of the popular languages , such as Spanish , Portuguese and German . ”
PeC : What plans do you have for future cart development ?
Odurinde : “ We plan to expand the number of payment gateways we support .
We are also working on improving our digital goods module to better support merchants selling downloadable goods . ”
PeC : How would your cart help an ecommerce merchant , versus the cart he or she is using now ?
Odurinde : “ It really depends on the cart the merchant is using at the moment .
Merchants using carts that are inferior to Boss Cart will benefit tremendously from its versatility , user friendliness , search engine friendliness and the various advanced catalog management tools . ”
PeC :
Any other thoughts for our readers , who are mainly ecommerce merchants ?
Odurinde : “ Invest in third party security certification .
There are quite a few shoppers out there who are still skeptical about buying online , and certification goes a long way to boosting a shopper ’s confidence in online shops . ”
A Customer ’s View
Boss Cart user , Kevin Blake , is the director and owner of Camping Online , an ecommerce store based in Derbyshire , England .
The store sells camping and caravan equipment and accessories , grossing approximately £ 1 million GBP [ $ 1,658,106 USD ] in annual revenue .
PeC : How long has your company been using the cart ?
Kevin Blake : “ We ’ve been using Boss Cart for approximately one year .
We were using a different version last year , and it was custom made , but we changed to Boss Cart as we wanted an up - to - date version that would help us move forward with the times . ”
PeC : What are the cart ’s biggest strengths ?
Blake : “ It has a very simple dashboard to use .
It is easy to alter prices when there are price increases , and it is very simple and quick to upload new products and images . ”
PeC : How could the cart improve ?
Blake :
“ Whenever there is anything that needs improvement , we use the Boss Cart support and they usually update or change things to suit our needs within 24 hours .
But , at present , nothing needs to improve .
It ’s running just the way I like it . ”
PeC : How would Boss Cart improve another merchant ’s business ?
Blake :
“ What is good about this cart is you can have quite a few payment methods , like PayPal , Sage Pay [ a UK payment processing service ] and more if you require , which would encourage the customer to spend with you . ”
PeC : Do you plan on continuing to use the cart ?
Blake : “ Yes , for many years . ”
PeC : Any other thoughts for our readers concerning the cart ?
Blake : “ I would highly recommend this cart as it ’s simple and easy to use , and would be ideal for a novice or a professional . ”

Over the weekend someone stumbled onto a Chrome browser build for Chrome OS on Google 's servers .
We 've seen several false - alarm looks at Chrome OS , and while it is only the browser , it provides a glimpse into the direction Google 's going .

( Click the image above for a closer look . )
Note :
We were n't able to download and verify this build before Google restricted access to the folder , but we did verify that the files in question were there .
Looks like we were just a couple of minutes late with the downloading .
All of these images come courtesy of an adventurous blogger over at weblog Living in a Google World .

Namely , the Chromium browser build for Chrome OS ( assuming the now forbidden folder on the Chromium.org servers was accurately named ) looks like it 's integrating the tab bar with what would normally be the taskbar / menubar of the operating system .
As you can see in the screenshot above , the browser embeds a clock in the top right of the browser window , along with " a network connection dialog ( non-functional here ) , and a battery meter ( also non-functional ) . "
That would mean , as we 've suspected , that the Chrome browser would likely be the main , basic windowing system for Chrome OS .

On the other end of the browser window , we 've got something else to pick apart :
In the top - left , you have what appears to be the new logo ( so far I have been unable to find a larger version of that image ) .
Clicking on it opens this Google Short Links window , which does n't really allow you to do anything unless you have a google .com email address , which I assume is restricted to Google employees only .

It 's still clearly a major work in progress , and now Google has entirely forbidden access to the folder containing Chromium builds specifically for Chrome OS , but it 's good to get a glimpse at where they 're headed .
What do you think ?
Like the idea of a true netbook where your web browser is the beginning and end of your operating system ?

13 Impf - Mythen
Geschrieben von Michael Hohner am 14 .
November 2009 , 12:10:48 Uhr :
Zur Zeit ist die H1N1 - Influenza ein großes
Thema , und was man darüber und über Impfungen allgemein teilweise im Netz und in der Sensationspresse lesen muss lässt einem den Kopf schmerzen .
Die schiere Masse von Fehl - und Desinformation ist erschreckend .
Deshalb hier 13 weit verbreitete Mythen zu Impfungen :
Influenza ( echte Grippe )
„ Die H1N1 - Impfung ist neu und ungetestet ”
Das wesentliche neue am H1N1 - Impfstoff Pandemrix sind die Antigene des neuen Influenzastammes .
Ansonsten wird er auf die gleiche Art und Weise hergestellt wie seit Jahrzehnten der Impfstoff gegen die saisonale Grippe .
Auch die meisten Zusatzstoffe sind gleich .
Das vieldiskutierte Adjuvans wurde vom bereits vorher zugelassenen Musterimpfstoff mit H5N1 - Antigenen übernommen .
Es unterscheidet sich kaum vom Vorgängeradjuvans , das schon viele Jahre auch in anderen Impfungen verwendet wurde .
Desweiteren wurde der neue H1N1 - Impfstoff selbst getestet , ohne besondere Auffälligkeiten .
Die Wirkungen und Nebenwirkungen der Zusatzstoffe sind bekannt , denn sie wurden nicht nur in klinischen Studien geprüft , sondern es sind auch Langzeitdaten durch die millionenfachen Impfungen gegen die saisonale Grippe bekannt . [ 1 ]
„ Von der Grippeimpfung kann man an Grippe erkranken ”
Diese Behauptung ist schlicht und einfach falsch .
Die zur Zeit in Deutschland verwendeten und zugelassenen Influenzaimpfstoffe enthalten keine „ lebenden ” Viren , die den Impfempfänger infizieren könnten .
Diese
These wird vermutlich durch die folgenden Fakten genährt :
Beim Aufbau der Immunität können in wenigen Fällen Nebenwirkungen auftreten , die den Grippesymptomen ähneln , z. B. leichtes Fieber .
Dies ist nur eine etwas zu starke Reaktion des Immunsystems auf die Antigene des Impfstoffes .
Dies stellt jedoch keine Grippeinfektion dar , und die Symptome sind allgemein schwächer und kurzzeitig .
Keine Impfung ist 100 % wirksam .
Bei der aktuellen H1N1 - Impfung wird z. B. nur bei 94,3 % [ 1 ] der Geimpften ein ausreichender Immunschutz aufgebaut , was zudem mehrere Wochen dauern kann .
Es ist also möglich , dass ein Geimpfter trotzdem an dem Erreger erkranken kann , gegen den er eigentlich geimpft wurde .
Der Erreger stammt dabei jedoch nicht aus der Impfung , sondern wurde von anderen Infizierten übertragen .
der Geimpften ein ausreichender Immunschutz aufgebaut , was zudem mehrere Wochen dauern kann .
Es ist also möglich , dass ein Geimpfter trotzdem an dem Erreger erkranken kann , gegen den er eigentlich geimpft wurde .
Der Erreger stammt dabei jedoch nicht aus der Impfung , sondern wurde von anderen Infizierten übertragen .
Eine Influenza - Impfung enthält nur eine begrenzte Menge der möglichen Influenzastämme .
Die Hersteller beschließen vor der Grippesaison , welche Stämme in den saisonalen Impfstoff aufgenommen werden .
Man kann also trotz Impfung an einem Stamm erkranken , der nicht in dieser Auswahl enthalten ist .
„ Influenza ist harmlos ”
Diese Meinung ist leider weit verbreitet .
Die Zahlen sprechen jedoch dagegen .
Weltweit erkranken jährlich ca. 3 bis 5 Millionen Menschen schwer an der Influenza , und etwa 250000 bis 500000 sterben an den Komplikationen .
Die Influenza ist damit eine der unterschätzten Infektionskrankheiten . [ 2 ]
„ Ich gehöre nicht zu den Risikogruppen , ich brauche die Impfung nicht ”
Dies ist eine riskante Strategie .
Gerade die neue Grippe A / H1N1 zeigt bei jungen , gesunden Menschen schwere Verläufe , und alle bisherigen Todesfälle waren , anders als bei der saisonalen Grippe , eher jung .
[ 1 ]
Die Risikogruppen der A / H1N1 sind also nicht die gleichen wie bei der saisonalen Grippe .
Desweiteren mag man vielleicht nicht chronisch krank sein , jedoch ausgerechnet zum Zeitpunkt der Infektion auch akut an einer anderen Krankheit erkrankt sein .
So kann schnell ein höheres Risiko entstehen , als man zunächst angenommen hat .
Zum dritten sind nicht geimpfte Personen auch Überträger der Grippe .
Selbst wenn der eigene Krankheitsverlauf harmlos ist , gefährdet man eventuell sein Umfeld .
Hier wäre etwas Verantwortungsbewusstsein für seine Mitmenschen angebracht .
Allgemein
„ Impfungen sind nutzlos .
Allgemeine Hygiene ist besser . ”
Hygienemaßnahmen und sauberes Wasser helfen , viele Infektionskrankheiten zu vermeiden .
Dies sind vor allem bakterielle Infektionen wie Cholera [ 3 ] , Typhus [ 4 ] , Diphtherie [ 5 ] und andere mit ähnlichen Infektionswegen ( Schmierinfektion ) .
Dennoch bleibt ein Restrisiko , das durch Hygiene nicht beseitigt werden kann und sich nur mit einer Impfung weiter reduziert lässt .
So ist z.B. die Anzahl der Fälle von Polio [ 6 ] ( eine Viruserkrankung , jedoch auch durch Schmierinfektion übertragen ) bis vor Einführung der Impfung kaum noch zurückgegangen .
Erst mit dem Start der Impfung in den 1960 ern ging die Fallzahl wieder stark zurück , so dass Europa schließlich 2002 als „ poliofrei ” erklärt werden konnte .
In den Jahren zuvor beschränkten sich signifikante Ausbrüche in der westlichen Welt auf manche religiöse Gemeinschaften , die Impfungen strikt ablehnen . [ 7 ]
Bei viralen Infektionskrankheiten , insbesondere bei denen , die durch die Luft oder direkt von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden , haben Hygienemaßnahmen nur eine sehr begrenzte Wirkung .
Für Influenza , Hepatitis , Masern , Mumps , Röteln , etc. sind nur Impfungen eine Präventionsmaßnahmen mit signifikanter Wirksamkeit .
„ Impfungen enthalten giftiges Quecksilber ”
Impfstoffe enthalten kein metallisches Quecksilber .
Manche Impfstoffe enthalten in manchen Verpackungseinheiten das Konservierungsmittel Thimerosal , das zu Ethylquecksilber abgebaut und dann ausgeschieden wird .
Ethylquecksilber reichert sich nicht im Körper an .
Die Halbwertszeit ist wenige Tage , d. h. die Hälfte der Menge wird innerhalb von Tagen wieder ausgeschieden . [ 8 ]
Methylquecksilber , mit dem Ethylquecksilber gerne verwechselt wird , hat eine Halbwertszeit von etwa 1 ½ Monaten , ist aber in Impfstoffen nicht enthalten .
Wie immer macht auch bei Ethylquecksilber die Dosis das Gift .
In einer Impfdosis z . B. des neuen A / H1N1 - Impfstoffs Pandemrix ® sind 5 µg Thimerosal enthalten , das 2,5 µg Quecksilber gebunden hat .
[ 1 ]
Es sind keine negativen Auswirkungen einer Aufnahme einer so kleinen Menge bekannt .
Sehr deutlich wird die Harmlosigkeit von Thimerosal auch durch den Vergleich mit anderen Wegen , Quecksilber aufzunehmen .
Die empfohlene maximale wöchentliche Aufnahme ist 89 µg . [ 1 ]
Eine Impfdosis enthält also nur 1/36 des Quecksilbers , das man wöchentlich ( ! ) unbedenklich aufnehmen könnte .
Im Vergleich dazu findet man in Seefisch um die 80 µg Quecksilber pro kg Fischfleisch ( maximal sogar bis zum 10 - fachen ! ) , meist in Form des deutlich belastenderen Methylquecksilbers .
Eine Impfdosis enthält also gerade so viel Quecksilber wie ca. 32 g Seefisch . [ 9 ]
In der Regel enthalten überhaupt nur Mehrfachdosen Timerosal , nicht jedoch Einzeldosen .
Letztere sind auch ohne Konservierungsstoffe haltbar .
Dies ist auch bei den Impfstoffen gegen A / H1N1 der Fall .
Es gibt keine respektable Studie , die eine Schadwirkung einer Dosis nachgewiesen hat , die in Impfungen enthalten ist .
„ Impfungen enthalten giftige Frostschutzmittel ”
Das ist falsch .
Frostschutzmittel ist Ethylenglykol , in Impfstoffen ist jedoch Polyethylenglykol enthalten .
Klingt so ähnlich , ist aber ein ganz anderer Stoff .
Weitere Dinge , die Polyethylenglykol enthalten : [ 10 ]
Salbengrundlage
Kosmetika aller Art
Waschmittel
Medikamente gegen Verstopfung
Augentropfen
Es gibt keine respektable Studie , die eine Schadwirkung einer Dosis nachgewiesen hat , die in Impfungen enthalten ist .
„ Impfungen enthalten krebserregendes Formaldehy d ”
Dies ist zwar grundsätzlich richtig , aber in dieser Form irreführend .
Das Formaldehyd stammt aus der Herstellung und wird dazu verwendet , die Viren im Impfstoff abzutöten .
In dem fertigen Impfstoff verbleiben nur Spuren .
Und hier sind die Fakten , die die Aussage irreführend machen : Der menschliche Körper produziert selbst ebenfalls Formaldehyd .
Diese Substanz ist ein Produkt unseres Stoffwechsels , und ein Mensch produziert selbst täglich etwa 50 g davon . [ 11 ]
Auch viele Lebensmittel enthalten natürlich entstandenes Formaldehyd .
Eine Impfdosis erhöht die im Körper natürlich enthaltene Menge Formaldehyd praktisch nicht messbar .
Auch hier macht die Dosis das Gift , und die Menge , die im Impfstoff enthalten ist , ist völlig harmlos .
Es gibt keine respektable Studie , die eine Schadwirkung einer Dosis nachgewiesen hat , die in Impfungen enthalten ist .
„ Squalen verursacht das Golfkriegssyndrom ”
Squalen ist ein Wirkverstärker und ist in manchen Impfstoffen enthalten .
Er sorgt dafür , dass das Immunsystem auch auf eine kleinere Menge des Antigens ausreichend reagiert .
Squalen wird aus den Lebern von Haifischen gewonnen oder synthetisch hergestellt .
Tatsächlich kommt Squalen auch im menschlichen Körper als Stoffwechselprodukt natürlicherweise vor und ist in vielen Lebensmitteln enthalten .
Squalen kann als Verursacher des sogenannten Golfkriegssyndroms ausgeschlossen werden , da dieser Stoff gar nicht in den Impfstoffen enthalten war , die den Soldaten damals verabreicht wurden .
Es wurden Antikörper gegen Squalen bei einigen Soldaten gefunden , jedoch in gleicher Menge auch bei Soldaten , die die betreffende Impfung nicht erhalten haben , sowie bei Menschen , die nie eine Impfung mit Squalen erhalten haben . [ 12 ]
Das Golfkriegssyndrom ein Sammelbegriff für eine ganze Reihe verschiedener Erkrankungen mit verschiedenen Ursachen .
Diese sind noch nicht endgültig geklärt .
„ Impfungen kosten mehr als sie nutzen ”
Diese
These wird gerade bei der aktuellen H1N1 - Impfung aufgestellt .
Hier eine Überprüfung mit Hilfe einer überschlagsmäßigen Kostenrechnung :
Bevölkerung : 81,8 Millionen , davon ca. die Hälfte Erwerbstätige
50 Millionen Impfdosen
Kosten der Impfung : 700 Millionen € [ 13 ]
Durchschnittsverdienst : 58 €/ Arbeitstag [ 14 ] ( umgerechnet auf die Gesamtbevölkerung )
( umgerechnet auf die Gesamtbevölkerung ) Immunisierungsrate durch die Impfung : 95 % [ 1 ]
Infektionsrate der nicht Immunisierten : 30 % ( über die gesamte Saison ) [ 1 ]
Arbeitsausfall eines Infizierten : 5 Tage ( bei 7 Tagen Krankheit )
Hospitalisierung : 5 Tage
Nebenwirkungen der Impfung mit 1 Tag Ausfall : 2 % [ 1 ]
Hospitalisierungsrate : 0,6 % ( der Gesamtbevölkerung ) [ 1 ]
Krankenhauskosten : 200 €/ Tag
In einem Szenario mit Impfung entstehen Kosten von ca. 3,9 Milliarden €.
In einem Szenario ohne Impfung entstehen Kosten von ca. 7,6 Milliarden €.
Diese Rechnung enthält nur den Arbeitsausfall und die Krankenhauskosten .
Es sind noch nichtmal die schwersten Fälle von Erkrankungen oder gar Todesfälle eingerechnet ( wieviel ist ein Menschenleben wert ? ) , ebenso keine weiteren Behandlungskosten im Krankenhaus oder danach .
Dies würde die Rechnung noch weiter zugunsten des Szenarios mit Impfung verschieben .
Die Infektionsrate müsste auf ca. 3,5 % sinken , damit die Kosten in beiden Fällen etwa gleich sind .
Auch die Kassen wissen , dass sich Impfungen langfristig rechnen .
Deshalb wird bei den gesetzlichen Kassen auch die Praxisgebühr erlassen , wenn ein Patient zur Impfung erscheint und sonst keine weitere Behandlung benötigt .
Die Patienten sollen so zu Impfungen zusätzlich motiviert werden .
Kinderkrankheiten
„ Impfungen gegen Kinderkrankheiten sind nutzlos .
Man sollte Kinder lieber normal erkranken lassen , um den Immunschutz aufzubauen . ”
Wenn man als Kind eine der typischen Kinderkrankheiten überstanden hat , dann hat man eine Immunität gegen die entsprechenden Erreger aufgebaut .
Manche Eltern denken deshalb , dass man die Kinder gegen diese Krankheiten nicht zu impfen braucht , weil das Ergebnis das gleiche ist .
Es werden dann sogar „ Masernparties ” veranstaltet , wo Kinder sich vorsätzlich gegenseitig anstecken sollen ( was meiner Meinung nach an Körperverletzung grenzt ) .
Diese Ansichten sind ein Spiel mit dem Feuer .
Nicht nur sind die durchschnittlichen Verläufe der Krankheiten schwerer als eventuelle Impfkomplikationen .
Es ist auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit von dauerhaften , schweren Schäden dieser Krankheiten tausendfach höher als bei den Impfungen .
Beispielsweise gibt es bei einer Masern - Erkrankung die folgenden Komplikationen : [ 15 ]
Exanthem : 98 %
Fieber : 98 %
Abfall der Blutplättchen : 1 von 3000
Enzephalitis : 1 von 1000
Tod : 1 von 1000 bis 1 von 20000
Im Vergleich dazu die Risiken der MMR - Impfung :
Exanthem : 5 % , schwach
Fieber : 3 bis 15 %
Abfall der Blutplättchen : 1 von 30000 bis 1 von 50000
Enzephalitis : 1 von 1 Million
Tod : keine
Wer heutzutage seinen Kindern diese Impfungen vorenthält handelt meiner Meinung nach unverantwortlich .
„ Impfungen gegen Kinderkrankheiten verursachen Autismus ”
Diese Behauptung wurde insbesondere von Andrew Wakefield aufgestellt . [ 16 ]
Er stellte darin einen Zusammenhang zwischen der MMR - Impfung , Darmerkrankungen bei Kindern und Autismus her .
Als Ursache hatte Wakefield zunächst Thimerosal ausgemacht , später , nachdem Thimerosal aus der MMR - Impfung entfernt wurde , die MMR - Impfung also solche .
Das Problem von Wakefields Studie war jedoch , dass die Ergebnisse nicht von anderen Medizinern reproduziert werden konnten .
Desweiteren fanden epidemiologische Untersuchungen keinen Zusammenhang :
Nach der Entfernung von Thimerosal aus der MMR - Impfung stiegen die Diagnosezahlen von Autismus weiter an .
Der vorhergesagte Abfall blieb aus .
Mehrere Studien verglichen die Fallzahlen von geimpften Kindern mit denen von Kindern , die aus verschiedenen Gründen keine Impfung erhalten haben .
In beiden Gruppen gab es einen gleich großen Anteil von Autismus . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Desweiteren gibt es gegenteilige Nachweise :
Es gibt starke Hinweise , dass Autismus hautpsächlich genetische Ursachen hat . [ 20 ]
Der wissenschaftliche Konsens ist , dass die steigenden Fallzahlen von Autismus dadurch verursacht werden , dass die Definition von Autimus und autismusähnlichen Krankheiten über die Jahre erweitert wurde , und dass dem Thema Autismus erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet wird .
Die tatsächliche Anzahl der Erkrankungen dagegen scheint konstant , es fallen lediglich mehr dieser Erkrankungen in die Kategorie „ Autismus ” . [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
Inzwischen hat sich herausgestellt [ 22 ] , dass die Studie von Wakefield nicht nur mit Verfahrensfehlern gespickt war , sondern dass Wakefield offenbar bewusst gegenteilige Nachweise in seiner Studie unterschlagen hat .
Zudem hat er ein finanzielles Interesse an dem beschriebenen Ergebnis verschwiegen :
Er hielt ein Patent für einen konkurrierenden , „ sicheren ” Impfstoff inne , und er wurde von einem Anwalt bezahlt , um als unabhängiger Experte vor Gericht den MMR - Impfstoff zu unterminieren .
Wakefields Co-Autoren haben sich inzwischen von der Studie distanziert , und Wakefield selbst muss sich vor dem britischen General Medical Council verantworten .
Aus wissenschaftlicher Sicht hat sich dieses Thema im Grunde in Luft aufgelöst .
Dennoch agitieren prominente Impfgegner wie Jenny McCarthy weiter gegen Thimerosal , die MMR - Impfung und Impfungen im Allgemeinen .
Sie gefährden damit die Gesundheit und das Leben von Kindern und der Bevölkerung im Allgemeinen .
Viren
„ Viruserkrankungen kann man auch mit Antibiotika behandeln ”
Antibiotika sind nur gegen Bakterien wirksam , nicht gegen Viren .
Es kann jedoch sein , dass man sich , geschwächt durch eine Virusinfektion , eine sekundäre bakterielle Infektion zugezogen hat .
In diesem Fall kann der Arzt auch Antibiotika verschreiben , trotz Virusinfektion .
Wie immer gilt auch hier : Glauben Sie nicht dem Hörensagen , glauben
Sie nicht alles , was in der Sensationspresse steht , glauben Sie nicht mir .
Informieren Sie sich aus respektablen Quellen ( viele sind unten verlinkt ) und fragen Sie ihren Arzt zu einer individuellen Risiko - Nutzen - Abwägung .

[ digg - reddit - me ] I should have made a bit more clear in my post yesterday that Andrew Sullivan was well aware of the contradictions within the right wing response to Obama – and had articulated a coherent response to them from his conservative , Oakshottian perspective earlier yesterday in a post I had printed out to read .
He did reach a bit too far in seeing that particular silver lining to this movement though .
The main problem is that this right wing movement is still somewhat amorphous .
Lydia DePillis of The New Republic had this dispatch from the D.C. protest this past weekend explaining the core complaint of the movement :
Their complaint ?
Hard to say , really .
Some , like the contingent of coal miners in hard hats with anti-cap - and - trade signs , had a concrete beef with the administration .
But for most , there was both an incredible specificity to their protestations –all those czars , and ACORN , and Obama ’s missing birth certificate–and a fuzzy vagueness .
“ We ’re losing America , ” said Kris , from Maryland .
“ Government is trying to take over everything . ”
It ’s one thing I have noticed as well – both the specificity of what they are outraged over and the sense that the tawdry specifics do n’t explain the rising crescendo of outrage .
Matt Welch – editor in chief of Reason magazine – tried to defend the protestors against liberals attempts to write them off – and to defend them against charges of racism .
He does so by misrepresenting two liberal responses to the protests and then knocking down the strawmen he creates – which is about par for the course in terms of New York Post op - eds , but I expect more of Welch whose work I often enjoy .
Welch would have done better to explain what he found most of the protestors stood for , but I suspect he would have had the same difficulty DePillis did .
So , instead , he writes that “ popular left blogger Josh Marshall reported from his armchair ” that this was a “ Small protest . ”
Welch declines to link to Marshall ’s post saying such – probably because if he had , readers might have found that this was one in a series of posts by Marshall and others at the TalkingPoints Memo covering the size of the crowd , and that Marshall had concluded his post with the D.C. Fire Department ’s estimate of 60,000 to 70,000 saying the protest was “ smallish by big DC protest / event standards but definitely respectable . ”
Welch then goes on to say that the Center for American Progress claimed that the protest was marred by “ racist , radical portrayals of Obama . ”
Welch has this to say about the evidence presented by Think Progress :
Among the dozen or so pieces of evidence ?
A placard claiming , “ Ayn Rand is right , ” and one of President Obama with the caption , “ When his lips move . . . he ’s lying . ”
Once again – an extremely misleading selection by Welch given the main signs focused on by the piece , including this one :
Welch could have made the argument that focusing on these people was misrepresenting the crowd – but instead he choose to made a much less defensible point .
Nothing Welch says challenges the point I made yesterday – that right wingers are fans of big government run by christianist right wingers , but wary of any type of government run by liberals , such that even pragmatic , incremental , modest Obamaism is seem as a radical assault on their children :
The protests are n’t about the size of government or its role ; they are a viceral response to the fact that a liberal now runs the government .
That frustration is rooted in cultural and social issues , rather than economic ones .
There are libertarians who legitimately object to big governmen ( Ron Paul and Matt Welch himself come to mind ) , and I can respect their views even if I disagree – but they do n’t seem to be well - represented in the Tea Party movement , in the Republican Party , in the bulk of the emotional resistance to Obama .

All Developers Should Know How They Learn Best _ The Secret Of Being A Great Mentor _( this post ) __ The Secret Of Being A Great Apprentice Become A Better Developer By Indexing Your Brain Learn More – Faster By Using The World - Wide Community What Playing Cards Can Teach Us About Ramping - Up And Transferring Knowledge
Mentoring in software development is unlike your regular corporate mentoring program , or at least it should be .
It is not about having a coffee together every 3 months or some general advice about ‘ improving your career ’ , it is about genuinely sharing your knowledge and experience and helping a younger developer become a better craftsman .
There are two types of mentoring relationships you can find yourself in :
informal – you find yourself working with a more junior developer and ‘ take them under your wing ’ , you did not formally discuss it with each other , but you decide to look out for them , help them our and teach them some of what you know .
They may not even be aware you ’re mentoring them , infact you may not even be consciously aware of it either .
– you find yourself working with a more junior developer and ‘ take them under your wing ’ , you did not formally discuss it with each other , but you decide to look out for them , help them our and teach them some of what you know .
They may not even be aware you ’re mentoring them , infact .
formal – this does n’t necessarily mean company sponsored ( although it can be ) , what it does mean is that you both sat down and discussed it and have agreed that you will become a mentor to your more junior colleague for a period of time .
You will once again help , teach and look out for them , but you ’re both fully aware of the fact .
Regardless of whether your mentoring is formal or not you want to make sure your mentee ( or apprentice if you prefer ) gets the most benefit from the relationship .
There is no one thing you can do to be a great mentor , rather it is a matter of doing a lot of little things and doing them consistently and well .
Being A Great Mentor
The first thing to remember when it comes to being a mentor is the fact that you ’re in it for the long haul .
In software development ( like most other professions I would imagine ) , it takes time for knowledge , skills and experience to stick .
So , it would be tough for you to be a great mentor if you only decide to do it for a couple of weeks .
You would be better of erring on the side of ‘ too long ’ rather than ‘ too short ’ , as a guideline , especially in a formal mentoring relationship , you want to commit for at least a few months ( 12 or more if possible ) , the longer the better for you mentee .
At this point it becomes a matter of following a set of guidelines ( mentoring patterns if you like ) , to make sure your mentee gets maximum benefit from your relationship ( making you a great mentor in the process :) ) .
Reduce the feedback cycle – just like in projects , it is important to take stock of where your mentee is as often as you can , so that you can adjust the course if necessary , this is why it is important to meet and discuss you mentee ’s progress as often as possible .
You do n’t steer a ship by setting course and going to sleep , you watch where you ’re heading and make small adjustments as you go .

Set expectations early – make sure you set the expectations for the relationship early , obviously this only applies in the formal case .
Your mentee might only want help with their technical skills , or they might want help with everything in general .
Talk it over and stick to the expectations once you ’ve agreed on them , you do n’t want to steer your mentee somewhere they do n’t want to go .

Do n’t assume knowledge – more experienced people often make this mistake , they assume a lot more knowledge than the mentee actually has .
This often comes from an attempt not to condescend , which is admirable , but if you end up talking right over the head of your mentee it leads nowhere .
The simplest thing to do is to ask if the mentee has some familiarity when you ’re exploring a new area .
After the first couple of times you do this , it will become a natural part of the relationship and neither of you will notice this any more .
The benefit is that your mentee will not end up with major glaring holes in their knowledge that could have been easily corrected .

Do n’t lord your knowledge and experience over your mentee – the other side of assuming knowledge is lording your skills over your mentee .
You may be understandably proud of your knowledge and experience , but do n’t throw it in the face of your mentee .
Treat your knowledge as a natural extension of you , it is just there , no need to get into it too much .
If your mentee is impressed with your experience that ’s fine , take the compliment and move on with what you were doing .

Share freely – this one is the third side ( i love 3 sided coins : ) ) .
Do n’t hoard your knowledge or make it needlessly complicated for your mentee to understand it .
Share and explain as simply as you ’re able , few people are able and fewer are willing to do this , your mentee will appreciate it .

Do n’t tell you mentee to do things , your job is to explain , help and guide , let your mentee make their own choices and use the knowledge and skills that they gain in whatever way they see fit .

Set goals and lay a path to achieving them – this is related to setting expectations , which is the long term goal of the relationship .
You will also need to set some milestones on the way to achieving the expectations .
These will be shorter term goals for you and your mentee to work on .
This will keep the mentoring relationship from just drifting and marking time .

Be proactive – your mentee does n’t necessarily know where they need to go next ( they may be too junior , and anyway this is why you ’re there in the first place ) .
Do n’t wait for your mentee to tell you what they want to learn next , be proactive in suggesting where they may wish to go .
Once again do n’t force them down a particular road , but do give a list of options .

Do n’t seek direct benefit – mentoring a more junior colleague is your way of giving something back to the software development industry and doing something for the community .

You will gain plenty of indirect benefits such as not having to work with half trained people , improving your teaching and interpersonal skills as well as making a significant positive impact on someone ’s life , that should be more than enough .

Give the benefit of your experience – sometimes it is not just about gaining new skills or learning new technologies , war stories can be really helpful .
Remember that you ’ve been there and done that while your mentee has not , share some of these stories ( situations and how you dealt with them and how you could have dealt with them better , when it is appropriate to use certain technologies and when it is not etc . ) .

Keep pointing them in the right direction – you will not always be there to guide and teach , your mentee will want to ( and will need to ) learn on their own .
It is your job to point them in the direction of what they should be learning so that they do n’t waste their time .
Once again remember to guide rather than direct .

Allow them to borrow your authority and trust if necessary – you probably have a large network and some good relationships while your mentee does not , help them remedy that .
Share some of your network and your relationships with them .
Introduce them to some people you know , help them to build up their own network .
You mentee will probably appreciate this above anything else you can do for them and if you truly think well of your mentee ( why would you be mentoring them otherwise ) you should be happy to connect them with other people you like .

Push them forward if you can – it is not about fast tracking your mentee ’s career ( to CEO and beyond ) this is not the kind of mentoring we are talking about .
But if both of you want to do that and you ’re in a position to facilitate then by all means try and push your mentee ’s career forward .

Confidentiality is the order of the day – always treat what your mentee tells you in strictest confidence ( this should go without saying ) .

It is not just about technology – there is more to mentoring than just technology ( unless you agreed to keep it strictly in technology land ) .
You can also mentor them in people skills , interpersonal skills , conflict resolution , professional morals / ethics etc .
Chance are , if the mentoring relationship is truly successful you will come to share a common ethical / moral framework when it comes to your profession .

Give them the benefit of working with you directly – this is easy if you ’re already working together but even if you ’re not there are ways to make this happen .
Perhaps you might try to collaborate on an open source project or simply get together for a coding session once in a while .
The best way for them to learn is to see you do your stuff and have you there while they try to do theirs .

Provide positive reinforcement – so many people forget to do this .
It is really tough to gauge your own progress and your mentee may get discouraged once in a while ( we all do ) , you can really help by providing some positive reinforcement and really putting their progress in perspective for them .

Do n’t commit to mentoring more than 1 - 2 people at the same time – it is basically impossible to keep this up and still provide the level of quality support that a mentoring relationship should have .

Get them to the point where you no longer need to push knowledge – once you find you no longer need to point your mentee in the right direction and they tend to pull knowledge from you rather than you having to push knowledge to them , you know you mentee is at a point where they have gained pretty much all they can from a direct mentoring relationship .
Surefire Ways To Fail
Just like there are patterns that can help you be a great mentor , there are also mentoring anti-patterns that can help ensure you ’re a great failure as a mentor .
There are n’t many of these , but unlike the mentoring patterns where following even some can make you a really good mentor , any one of the anti-patterns can destroy a mentoring relationship .
Neglect the relationship – if you do n’t keep in contact with your mentee regularly and help them adjust their course , then you ’re not really being a mentor and they will not think of you as such .
You mentee will try to forge their own path and you will only be a mentor ‘ on paper ’ .

Not keeping confidence – as you would expect this is the fastest way to stop a mentoring relationship in it ’s tracks .
If you do n’t keep confidence , your mentee will not be able to trust you and therefore everything you say is suspect ( as far as they are concerned ) , there is nowhere for a mentoring relationship to go from there .

Not sharing common moral / ethical grounding – it is really tough to mentor someone when they think completely differently from you regarding issues you consider important .
For example if they feel it is ok to step on people on your way to the top while you consider that reprehensible .
If you find that you and your mentee are fundamentally different in that regard ( morals / ethics ) it is best to terminate the mentoring relationship .

Being too overwhelming and controlling – do n’t try to impose your will on your mentee .
You ’re not trying to build a carbon copy of yourself nor should you try to live vicariously through your mentee .
Always remember your job is to help and guide not direct and control .
I hope that this post has helped you gain more of an appreciation for what a mentoring relationship should be like .
If you have any other patterns for being a great mentor , do share them with everyone .
In the meantime I wish you luck in your own mentoring endeavors .

I put on shows in weird , underground spaces .
I ca n’t offer bands fancy sound equipment , but I give them freedom , which is more elusive .
All this stuff that people think is necessary for a performance space , like lighting rigs or fog machines , is bullshit .
None of it is important .
A venue should n’t be just a conveyor belt for acts , but that ’s the way the bar and music industry is set up .
It ’s also considered justifiable not to let young people into shows , which is really sad .
But put a band anywhere , and all sorts of surprising things happen .
I ’ve done shows in concrete basements , Mexican restaurants , pool halls , coffee shops , rooftops , and a tortilla factory .
Recently , I ’ve been doing a series on subway cars — the J , A , and 7 — centered around this band called the Eskalators .
The fifteen of them spread out through the whole car .
You ’re just dancing next to the flute player , the violin player , or the trumpet player ; people are crowd - surfing and having a total blast .
The train ’s also full of normal people , who I would think are also having a blast .
One guy on the 7 train asked a player for his trumpet .
He did a solo during the song and then got off at the next stop .
There are good shows , and then there are shows that suck for whatever reason .
Even with just a concrete room , there is so much shit that can go wrong .
Everything in my life is partly broken , so that ’s one thing .
In fact , it ’s always a surprise when shows do n’t totally fall apart .
One of the first shows I did was on a rooftop in Crown Heights .
It had been pouring rain as we were building the stage , and it was still pouring when all the bands started showing up .
We had an awesome metal afro-Indian fusion band , and a band dressed as lifeguards , and an indie - rock - pop thing called Medics .
I talked to my friend Phil about whether or not to go through with the show , and we were like , we got this far , let ’s just do it and see what happens .
The rain stopped right when the doors opened , which was fucking amazing .
But then the giant plastic tarp we built blew over five minutes before the show started , so we started taking out keys and punching air holes .
Then , in the middle of a song in the Medics set , the power went out .
No one knew what was going on .
I ran through the crowd and crawled under the stage to check the plugs .
The drummer was doing this drumroll thing right over my head , and I was the one who put the wood together , so I knew that this was n’t the best part of the stage to be under .
I was freaking out that he might fall through the stage and I would die and no one would even know I was under there .
I found the thing that was unplugged and plugged it in .
The great thing about electrical disasters at shows is that there ’s always this moment when you plug back in and every - thing makes this crazy feedback noise , all at the same time .
The sound went on and the lights went on and they all started playing again .
Best moment ever .

California : Your IOU Is In The Mail
By Gilbert Mercier , NEWS JUNKIE POST
Yesterday , once again , the California legislature failed to address its budget disaster .
California is officially insolvent , and the State Treasury announced that they will have to issue IOUs to creditors .
This is the first time since the Great Depression that the Golden State was forced to such a desperate measure .
This dire situation will affect all Californians , needless to say , but also the rest of the nation .
One out of 8 Americans live in the Golden State , and if California was an independent State in would rank as the 8th largest economy worldwide .
The nation , at large , also relies on California ’s agriculture for crops such as fruits & vegetables .
If and when you get your California ’s IOU in the mail , let ’s say for your State tax refund , you will not be able to cash it until October .
Needless , to say it will only compound problems for most Californians , especially for the ones struggling to keep a roof above their heads .
The unemployment rate in California is even higher than in the rest of the country , and currently looms at around 12 % .
Democrats & Republicans in the California legislature deserve full blame for their failure to address a catastrophic situation .
Democrats for not understanding that spending cuts are necessary , and Republicans for their unwillingness to raise taxes .
The blame also rests on the shoulders of Governor Schwarzenegger for his lack of vision and leadership in the matter .
It should be easy to understand that the only way out of this quagmire is a dual approach :
Cut spending & raise taxes .
The job losses in California will only increase because of the gridlock .
It is something that California voters should keep in mind in the next election .
It would not be surprising if a lot of elected officials get a pink slip as opposed to the IOUs we have coming in the mail .
Have your say ...
Amateur spies and armchair sleuths using Google Earth have discovered a suspicious development in the Burmese jungle thought to be linked to the pariah state 's clandestine nuclear program .
The main facility , which measures 82 by 84 metres , can been seen on satellite images published on both Google Earth and Google Maps ( see embedded map below ) .
It features a pitched , blue corrugated roof , which , at first glance , makes it look like an over - sized swimming pool .
The large industrial complex is located in a rural area of central Burma , east of Mandalay near the town of Pin Oo Lwin .
Investing and Money Rules of Thumb
If you have been reading finance and investing blogs than you have come across some financial and investment rules of thumb .
These are often referred to and used as guidelines and not as set in stone laws , some are useful while other ’s are … well not so useful .
We have discussed some investing rules in our Investing Tips article , but the following is a comprehensive list of investing and financial rules , if we left any out feel free to add them in the comments .
Reduce Debt .
If you have debt , saving / investing will become harder .
First order of business reduce your debt load .
Save and Invest 10 % of Your Pre-Tax Income .
“ How much should I save ? ”
The most common question I see on blogs and forums .
Before you start spending your hard earned money Pay Yourself First !
10 % is often used as a guideline , I like 10 % but you should aim for 20 % !
Do n’t Time The Market .
Unless you have years of experience and education along with a lot of free time , do n’t time the markets !
Market timing is not a sound investment strategy , buy and hold -> invest for the long term and ignore short - term fluctuations .
Rule of 72 .
The Rule of 72 states that you can divide the number 72 by whatever yield you are getting to see how long it would take for your investment to double .
You can also switch the formula and divide 72 by the number of years you want your money doubled to see what yield you need .
100 Minus Your Age Rule .
This rule is used for asset allocation , the rule of thumb is to take your age and subtract it from 100 .
That is your percentage of stock allocation .
I am not a big fan of this rule as man other factors also contribute to your asset allocation .
3 - 6 Months Emergency Fund .
Emergency fund ’s are sometimes the most overlooked items in financial planning , yet they are vital .
The general rule is to save 3 - 6 months worth of expenses in a highly liquid savings account to ensure it is available during an emergency .
Asset Allocation - Efficient Frontier .
Diversification is a basic investing concept , diversify among different asset classes to ensure best returns , asset allocation .
According to the Efficient Frontier we get the best results when we have a mix of fixed income securities and equities .
10 , 5 , 3 Rule .
This is a neat little rule that states that you can expect return of 10 % from equities , 5 % return from bonds and 3 % return on highly liquid cash and cash - like accounts .
Of course this is over the long term , currently you ’d be like if you can earn 2 % on your savings account .
Financial Highway has more on 10 - 5 - 3 Rule .
4 % Withdrawal Rule .
How much should I withdraw during retirement ?
We often use the 4 % rule to protect the principle and determine how much one can take from the retirement savings .
Four Pillars offers an excellent explanation of how the 4 % rule works .

Earlier this week , 1.5 million people filled the streets of Berlin , Germany to watch a several - day performance by France 's Royal de Luxe street theatre company titled " The Berlin Reunion " .
Part of the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , the Reunion show featured two massive marionettes , the Big Giant , a deep - sea diver , and his niece , the Little Giantess .
The storyline of the performance has the two separated by a wall , thrown up by " land and sea monsters " .
The Big Giant has just returned from a long and difficult - but successful - expedition to destroy the wall , and now the two are walking the streets of Berlin , seeking each other after many years apart .

Why You Don't Want a Fairy Tale Ending
I like it when things look Grimm .
PS : My sister took the stunning picture on which this comic is based .
NSFW Legendary underground comic artist Robert Crumb has caused a bit of a stir with his illustrated Book of Genesis - complete with biblical rumpy - pumpy and " gratuitous " violence , as the Telegraph puts it .
The book prompted Mike Judge of God botherers ' " think - tank " the Christian Institute to opine : " It is turning the Bible into titillation .
It seems wholly inappropriate for what is essentially God 's rescue plan for mankind . "
He warned : " If you are going to publish your own version of the Bible it must be done with a great deal of sensitivity .
The Bible is a very important text to many many people and should be treated with the respect it deserves .
" Representing it in your own way is all very well and good but it must be remembered that it is a matter of people 's faith , their religion .
Faith is such an important part of people 's lives that one must remember to tread very carefully . "
A spokesman for the Church of England offered : " I have n't seen the book but I think trying to sell something by emphasising the sexual nature of some of the scenes does n't seem to be a good way to pass on the message of the bible . "
Refreshingly , though , other Christians are less concerned .
A spokeswoman for the Bible Society also admitted she had n't seen the book , but conceded that reviews * indicated Crumb had " really engaged " with the subject matter .
She said : " It may surprise people but the bible does contain nudity , sex and violence .
That 's because it contains real stories about real people .
If by reading the book people are encouraged to re-engage with the Bible then that can only be a good thing . "
The Bishop of Croydon , the Rt Rev Nick Baines , weighed in with : " I did n't think it was satire .
He set out to say ' this is important , fundamental myth ' , and it seems to me he 's done a good job . "
Regarding Crumb's own beliefs , the Telegraph notes that the creator of Fritz the Cat and Mr Natural has gone on the record as saying he " does not believe that the Bible is the word of God " .
Crumb elaborated : " I take it all for myth from start to finish , with probably some faint relation to historical reality .
They 're great stories .
But for people to take texts as something sacred , handed down from God ... that 's pretty backward , I think . "
The Book of Genesis illustrated by R Crumb is currently available in the US only for 24 bucks .
The cartoonist 's website says fans will shortly be able to buy one of 250 " special , signed , limited edition books " at $ 500 a pop . ®

* Here 's one from Bookforum.com , which describes the book as " a fitting capstone to a great career " .
A Florida billionaire who was a top beneficiary of Bernard Madoff's $ 65 bn ( £ 40 bn ) Ponzi scheme has died , apparently by drowning in the swimming pool of his mansion in the exclusive seaside enclave of Palm Beach .
Jeffry Picower , 67 , was found by his wife and housekeeper shortly after midday on Sunday .
Emergency services were unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead at the Good Samaritan medical centre .
An accountant turned wealthy investor , Picower was a friend of Madoff 's and was named in court papers as the biggest beneficiary of returns from the Wall Street fraudster 's corrupt investment empire .
Although Picower insisted he was unaware of any wrongdoing , bankruptcy trustees for Madoff 's firm sued him for $ 7.2 bn earlier this year , claiming that he " knew or should have known " that his phenomenal payouts were fraudulent and that , at a minimum , he had " failed to exercise reasonable due diligence " .
A suit filed by lawyers for the trustee Irving Picard claimed that Picower was receiving even greater returns than other investors , topping 100 % some years , and that the money ought to be refunded for distribution to the fraudster 's victims .
Picower 's abrupt death is yet another tragic twist to the saga surrounding Madoff 's record - breaking fraud , which has been blamed for at least two suicides among victims .
Palm Beach police said Picower 's wife , Barbara , told emergency dispatchers she had " just found her husband at the bottom of their swimming pool " .
Don Taylor , acting battalion chief for Palm Beach 's fire service , told the Palm Beach Post emergency workers had been unable to revive him .
" We had no pulse and he was not breathing on his own , " said Taylor .
" We worked on him to try to stabilise him as best we could . "
Picower 's wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine at $ 1bn , putting him among the 400 wealthiest people in the US .
He used to head a charitable foundation that gave money to educational and health - related causes , although this shut down after losing its endowment in Madoff 's fraud .
A lawyer for Picower 's family , William Zabel , said the billionaire had suffered from Parkinson 's disease and " heart - related issues " .
Picower consistently said his charity and his own personal finances had suffered from Madoff 's crimes .
But his withdrawals from Madoff 's fund were viewed with suspicion after the fraudster 's unmasking .
The bankruptcy trustee sifting through the remnants of Madoff 's firm has taken an aggressive approach towards " clawback " from those to whom Madoff paid out gains .
In August , Picower described efforts to force him to hand back money as a " paradigm of excess " , and his lawyers have said he was " in no way complicit " in corruption .
Madoff , considered the biggest fraudster in Wall Street history , is serving a 150 - year sentence for theft , fraud and money laundering at Butner prison in North Carolina .

Since finding fragments of the older hominid in 1992 , an international team of scientists has been searching for more specimens and on Thursday presented a fairly complete skeleton and their first full analysis .
By replacing Lucy as the earliest known skeleton from the human branch of the primate family tree , the scientists said , Ardi opened a window to “ the early evolutionary steps that our ancestors took after we diverged from our common ancestor with chimpanzees . ”
The older hominid was already so different from chimps that it suggested “ no modern ape is a realistic proxy for characterizing early hominid evolution , ” they wrote .
The Ardipithecus specimen , an adult female , probably stood four feet tall and weighed about 120 pounds , almost a foot taller and twice the weight of Lucy .
Its brain was no larger than a modern chimp’s .
It retained an agility for tree - climbing but already walked upright on two legs , a transforming innovation in hominids , though not as efficiently as Lucy ’s kin .
Fashion models ' after - lives can take them to unexpected places , as Liskula Cohen found out .
She made headlines in August after she sued Google for the email address of an anonymous author who slagged her off as " # 1 skanky superstar " and " a psychotic , lying , whoring ... skank " on a Google - hosted blog .
By ruling in the 37 - year - old Cohen 's favour , Manhattan federal justices have set new guidelines : no longer will bloggers be able to lob insults from the safety of assured anonymity .
The unmasked blogger turned out to be a faint acquaintance from the Manhattan nightlife scene – namely 29 - year - old Rosemary Port , a fashion student who had created the Skanks in NYC site .
Though she apologised , Port until recently maintained her privacy was violated and threatened a $ 15 m counter - suit against Google for giving her up .

The case has helped to clarify which terms of insult are libellous , such as " ho " , which are merely wounding , like " skank " , and along the way offered New York tabloids front - page news of two attractive women in cat fight .
" Secret Grudge of NY Skankies " blazed the New York Post .
While it 's tempting to view the case as a girlfight that spilled out of a nightclub and into a courtroom , it 's illuminated genuine privacy issues and given Cohen , a Vogue model , a voice fashion alone never offered .
She 's joined a growing chorus of commentators who say the internet , or specifically blogs , are an increasingly unreliable place to find information and used for cyberbullying .
But the justice presiding in the case rejected the blogger 's defence claim that individuals cannot be libelled online because blogs " serve as a modern - day forum for conveying personal opinions , including invective and ranting " , and should not be treated as factual assertions .
The court sided with Cohen , citing defamation " concerning her appearance , hygiene and sexual conduct " .
Last month , in her new role as cyberbullying spokesperson , Cohen participated in a panel at the University of Tennessee on internet privacy that featured John Seigenthaler , the journalist and former Robert Kennedy aide who was subject to a false Wikipedia entry claiming he was a suspect in the assassination of John F Kennedy , a representative from AP and a bloggers ' rights advocate .
In the increasingly busy area of internet rights , cyber policy pundits fret that censorship efforts , privacy mandates and regulations threaten the original cyberspace " presumption of liberty " .
A competing concern is how to limit the dissemination of poor or incorrect information and to curb bad or even threatening behaviour .
Clearly , Cohen has hit an issue of gathering importance .
The insight Cohen has been granted through her experience and actions has placed her now at the forefront of the cyber - bullying issue .
She says she had no doubts she should take up the cause after she received a message of support from the mother of Meghan Meier , a 13 - year - old girl who killed herself in 2006 after being cyberbullied by a friend 's mother posing as an online boyfriend .
" We do have the freedom of speech but we do n't have the freedom to defame , " reasons Cohen .
" If the internet is just supposed to be the Wild West , a do - what - you - want , say - what - you - want place and no longer a reliable source of information – which is what I think it was intended for – then I want no part of it .
" It 's been very frustrating for me .
Now , I find myself limiting my internet use to just going to reputable sites , " she continues .
" I used to surf all over the place and make the assumption that what I read was truthful .
Now it 's a case of , well , who knows ? "
In one sense , Cohen is becoming part of a growing movement of internet users who now find the medium too chaotic .
Information moves so fast , with distortions added at each rewrite , that a counter reaction may be growing that will bring surfers back to more reliable sources and perhaps place a premium value on good information .
Liskula Cohen 's online ordeal began when a client on a modelling job drew her attention to a " horrible " posting about her .
The blog featured pictures of Cohen simulating sex with a black DJ friend and said that she was performing oral sex " again and again " .
Cohen detected an undertow of racism .
" It was one of the things I found most hurtful .
To sue someone over being called a " ho " alone would be ridiculous .
I do n't have a think skin – I 've been a model for 20 years so I 've dealt with rejection . "
But when her case came to court , Port 's lawyer cited a picture Cohen herself had posted on the internet .
The lawyer counter - claimed that the drama was due to Cohen 's love of the spotlight and said she had brought this notoriety on herself .
Cohen 's tale suggests – at a minimum – the life of models in New York nightclubs is fairly toxic environment , the darker side of Sex and the City if you will , and features dependent relationships of promoters and louche types , models and dealers , bouncers , DJs , second - tier royalty and middle - aged playboys .
Not surprisingly , the experience has soured the Manhattan demi-monde for Cohen , a Canadian .
" There are very few places I 'll go now , " she says .
" I wo n't just go anywhere .
I need to know there are friends there , otherwise I get freaked . "
And as for the internet , Cohen believes there should be some form of control .
It 's a view Wikipedia recently adopted when it instituted a layer of editorial oversight of biographies of living people .
" If you 're using your computer to do positive things , more power to you , " Cohen says .
" If I can use my voice for positive change then I will .
But if you 're on your computer to spread bullshit , get a life . "
Web of evil :
What is cyberbullying ?
Sexting
" Sexting " might sound like naughty teenage fun – the term refers to teens taking nude or semi-nude photos of themselves and sending them to others via mobile phone .
But out of their hands , pictures can easily be uploaded to social networking sites , or forwarded to other mobiles .
And if an underage teen gets caught sending explicit images , they run the risk of being convicted as a sex offender .
Jessica Logan , an 18 - year - old from Cincinnati , Ohio , sent a naked picture of herself to her boyfriend , which wound up being seen by hundreds of teens who then taunted Jessica online , calling her a " slut " and a " whore " on her Facebook and MySpace pages .
After several months of abuse , in June 2008 , Jessica hanged herself .
In Greensburgh , Pennsylvania , six teens ended up in court , facing charges of child pornography , after three underage girls shared sexual images of themselves with male classmates via their phones .
Anti-social networking
Social networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo , which have tens of millions of users worldwide , have revealed a dark side as potential tools for cyberbullying .
Several suicides cited online bullying as a contributing factor , and teens are even facing criminal charges for conducting web - based hate campaigns .
Keeley Houghton of Malvern , Worcestershire became the first Briton jailed for online bullying in August , after the 18 - year - old posted death threats on the Facebook page of a schoolmate , Emily Moore .
In July this year Megan Gillan , 15 , of Macclesfield , Lancashire , died from an overdose of painkillers after poisonous messages were posted by fellow students on her Bebo page , and 13 - year - old Sam Leeson hanged himself at his parents '
Gloucestershire home in June 2008 after being mocked online for his musical taste .
Happy slapping
Violent attacks can be easily captured on mobile phones , providing a record of the event that promises kudos for gang - members .
Filming such attacks is a prosecutable offence .
In a landmark case in February 2008 , a 17 - year - old girl was found guilty of aiding and abetting the death of Gavin Waterhouse in Keithley , West Yorkshire , after she filmed her friend delivering the fatal beating .
Twitter imposter
Politicians may embrace social networking site Twitter as a chance to broadcast their opinions via the ultimate soundbite : the 140 - character tweet .
But a surge of imposter tweeters have been causing trouble , and quotes from fraudster politicians , celebrities and even the Dalai Lama have been quoted by a credulous media .
Conservative blogger Donal Blaney is attempting to take his Twitter imposter , @blaneysblarney , to court over the issue .
Last week , in response to a petition filed by Blaney , the High Court sent the first ever injunction via Twitter , as a message directing @blaneysblarney to a web page commanding they desist from posting misleading tweets .

FALLS CHURCH , Virginia ( CNN ) -- Michelle Mack has turned medical thinking upside down .
The right side of Michelle Mack 's brain rewired itself to take over functions controlled by the left .
Born with only half a brain , Mack can speak normally , graduated from high school and has an uncanny knack for dates .
At 27 , doctors determined that the right side of her brain had essentially rewired itself to make up for function that was likely lost during a pre-birth stroke .
But her childhood and young adult years were fraught with frustration .
" It was very hard for me , " Mack said .
" It was very hard for me growing up .
No one knew the truth about my brain . "
Mack 's parents , Carol and Wally , realized shortly after her birth that something was wrong .
" There was n't a group to turn to , " said Carol Mack .
" Michelle did n't have cerebral palsy , I knew that .
She did n't have Down 's syndrome , I knew that .
I had no place to turn . "
Ten years ago , Dr. Jordan Grafman , chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section at the National Institutes of Health , finally diagnosed the problem .
Watch how Mack 's brain healed itself »
An MRI scan revealed she was missing nearly all the left side of her brain .
While it was clear Mack has some problems , Grafman said he and the family were shocked by the extent of the damage .
Brains that change
What if you could rewire your brain ?
Is it science ?
Or something else ?
Do n’t miss this " Campbell Brown " special .
Tonight , 8 ET see full schedule »
" We were surprised to see the extent of the lesion in her brain , which basically took away the left side of her brain , " said Grafman .
" There 's some very deep structures remaining , but the surface of her brain , the cortex is 95 percent gone and some of the deeper structures , structures that control movement , are missing .
These are all structures that are important for movement , behavior , cognition . "
The only answer , Grafman said , was that Mack 's brain has rewired itself .
The remaining half took over some of the essential functions that are normally done by the left , such as speaking and reading .
That rewiring , however , came at a cost .
" Michelle has fairly normal language abilities , certainly basic language abilities , she can construct a sentence , she can understand instructions , she can find words when she 's talking , but actually she has some trouble in some aspects of visual - spatial processing , " said Grafman .
" It 's quite possible that in her learning , in her development , when the right hemisphere either took over or developed some of the language abilities that it cost her in some of the skills that are normally mediated by the right side of the brain , " added Grafman .
In the 10 years since Grafman first diagnosed Mack , she has seen some intellectual functions improve , the doctor said .
Recovery has not been perfect , however .
Mack still struggles with abstract concepts and becomes easily lost in unfamiliar surroundings .
The diagnosis explained why Mack had experienced a lifetime of difficulty controlling her emotions .
" He 's helped us understand the reason why I tend to throw fits , temper tantrums , " she said .
" It was because I was missing half my brain . "
Mack will always have some problems , but dad Wally Mack said that Grafman 's diagnosis and treatment answered a lot of questions and gave him hope .
" Dr. Grafman explained that the right hemisphere is taking over , and it might take her a little while longer to get there with all the rewiring that has to take place , " he said .
" But that told us all these bad days are behind us and there are nothing but good days ahead . "
Michelle Mack is now 37 and lives with her mother and father .
She works from home doing data entry for her church .
She is fairly independent , pays rent and can do most household chores .
She realizes she 'll need help for the rest of her life but wanted to tell her story to make it clear that she is not helpless .
" I wanted to do this so people like producers , photographers and security guards and police officers learn about people like me , " she said , " that I 'm normal but have special needs , and that there are a lot people like me , so that they could be more understanding . "
CNN 's Campbell Brown contributed to this report .

Amputee Fights for Coverage of Prosthetics " GMA " helps woman get prosthetic legs after her insurance company denied her .
Jan. 14 , 2009  -- Susan Bailey was a happy 23 - year - old wife and mother of two energetic young boys until about 18 months ago .
In July 2007 , Bailey became infected with E. coli bacteria .
Doctors said she might have picked it up from something she ate .
She became so sick she spent two weeks in a coma .
During that time , the infection spread to her legs .
With her life at stake , her husband gave doctors permission to amputate Bailey 's legs above the knee .
When Bailey emerged from her coma , she did n't realize at first that her legs were gone .
" My husband had to tell me several times that I did n't have any feet or ankles or knees , " she said .
" And that was very hard for him to tell me , and it was hard for me to hear : "
Bailey survived and slowly began the difficult road to recovery .
But , along the way , she ran into an unexpected roadblock with her health insurance company , Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield .
Anthem agreed to pay for Bailey to get a set of prosthetic legs .
But because of the unusual nature of her condition , amputation above the knees , the devices they gave her made walking difficult and painful .
" Those stubby prosthetic legs do n't bend , " she said .
" They 're straight .
So I do n't have a knee to bend to help me physically walk up the stairs .
So physically right now ... it takes my breath away to walk . "
Bailey said the prosthetic legs , called stubbies , caused her to fall down frequently .
Basic tasks , such as making lunch for her kids or taking them to the school bus , became a big struggle .
Then she learned about Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics Inc. , a Bethesda , Md. , company that makes legs specifically for people like Bailey , whose legs have been amputated above the knee .
They are called C - Legs , because they have a built in computer chip that automatically makes adjustments to make walking easier .
Brooks Rainey , who creates prosthetics for Hanger and wears a C - Leg , said that when he met Bailey a year ago he thought she was a perfect candidate for a C - Leg .
" This is what is going to allow her to do the things that she needs to do in her everyday life , and there was really no other option in my mind , " Rainey said .
Insurers Refuse to Pay
But Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield refused to pay for the more expensive C - Legs , because they were experimental and not medically necessary .
More than 25,000 C - Legs have been used by amputees .
" Sometimes a treatment will be thought of as mainstream for a particular patient population , but it will be thought of as experimental for a different population , " said Susan Pisano , a spokeswoman for the insurance lobbying group America 's Health Insurance Plans in Washington , D.C .
Bailey said she fought with Anthem for 10 months , filing two appeals , which the company denied .
" It was tearing me up inside that I had just been told no for something that I really , really need , " she said .
" To live my happy life in the same way that I was living it in June 2007 . "
There are nearly 2 million amputees in the United States , and most health insurance policies do a poor job of covering prosthetics for them , said Patty Rosbach of the Knoxville , Tenn . - based Amputee Coalition of America , an advocacy group that works on behalf of people who 've lost limbs .
" I think that everyone assumes that if they are going to have a leg amputated or an arm amputated that it would be automatically covered by their insurance for them to get a replacement prosthesis , and I think they are absolutely astounded to find in a significant number of cases -- getting more every day -- that this is not , in fact , true , " Rosbach said .
Poor Prosthetics Coverage
Rosbach said that because people do n't expect to need a prosthetic limb , they do n't notice the fine print on their polices limiting their coverage
" I think that you have to look at the very , very small print , and I do n't think the majority of people , when they look at their policies , actually look at it word for word , " Rosbach said .
Pisano of America 's Health Insurance Plans said , " There are instances where employers are not purchasing the benefit to the degree that they might like . "
Insurance lobbyists also argue that paying for claims like Bailey 's will raise rates for everyone .
At $ 100,000 a pair , the C - Legs are expensive .
The Amputee Coalition of America claims that insurance companies not only balk at paying for the more expensive C - Legs but also for basic prosthetic legs , which can cost as little as $ 12,000 .
Meanwhile , Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield refused do an on - camera interview but issued a statement saying its " medical policies are intended to reflect the current scientific data and critical thinking . "
Bailey Gets Her C- Legs
The Virginia Bureau of Insurance , which regulates insurers in Bailey 's home state , reviewed her case after receiving a call from " Good Morning America . "
Within a few weeks , the state overruled Anthem and ordered them to pay for her new legs .
Bailey is now spending her time learning how to use her C-legs .
She 's confident that she will soon be keeping up with her boys again .

The government has welcomed a new campaign launched on 5 October by NGO Save the Children to help reduce child mortality in Yemen , which has the highest rate in the Middle East and one of the highest in the world outside Africa .
“ This is a good move to save the lives of children in Yemen ; a poor country where 74 in every 1,000 children die before they reach one year of age and 104 in every 1,000 die before age five , ” said Fahd al - Sabri , a reproductive health expert at the government ’s National Population Council .
Yemen was ranked 48th worst in the world for child mortality in 2009 by a UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) report .
However , it appears progress is being made as Yemen was ranked 73rd in 2007 and 147th in 1990 .
Al - Sabri told IRIN that diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections were the primary causes of under - five deaths .
“ Thirteen percent of under - fives in the country suffer anaemia and are underweight , which means their lives are at high risk if no effective interventions are undertaken . ”
The initiative in Yemen is part of Save the Children ’s global Survive to 5 campaign first announced on 6 September in New York .

Silvio Berlusconi is accustomed to allegations about his predilections being excitedly received abroad .
France 's Nouvel Observateur recently published a story titled " Sex , Power and Lies " and the Spanish newspaper El Pais showed photographs of naked guests at the Italian Prime Minister 's retreat in Sardinia .
( He announced his intention to sue both for libel . )
Back home , though , the priapic 72 - year - old ’s influence over the media is such that the slew of claims over his private life usually receives a muted reception – perhaps because they come as little surprise .
So when Italy ’s state television channel refused to show a film trailer which blamed Berlusconi for creating a frivolous media culture filled with “ half - naked women ” and chauvinistic images ( he owns three commercial Italian TV channels ) , the movie ’s director interpreted it as straight censorship .

But the ban by the network RAI on screening the clip for Videocracy – showing today at the Venice Film Festival – has backfired and led to a surprising uptake in interest in the documentary .
Videocracy is among the most contentious films to be shown at the two - week event .
RAI wrote to the director , Erik Gandini , stating that the film was “ offensive ” to Berlusconi ’s reputation .
The advert showed scantily - attired women and statistics claiming that Italy had a low press freedom rating .
Mr Berlusconi ’s company , Mediaset , which runs Italy ’s private TV stations , also declined to screen the trailer .
Since then , requests from cinemas in Italy to obtain a print of the film have shot up from 35 to 70 venues , leading to many hundreds more screenings .
“ The ban indicated the level of tension in Italy regarding everything that goes on TV , ” Gandini said in an interview with The Independent yesterday .
“ He [ Berlusconi ] runs three commercial channels in the country .
In Italy , what does not exist on TV does not exist . ”
“ I was scared by the ban , and by RAI ’s Orwellian - style letter , but the day after , there was a huge explosion of interest on the internet .
The print numbers have doubled and people were spreading the trailer through Facebook . ”
Gandini , who made the documentary Gitmo – The New Rules of War , about Guantanamo Bay , interviewed staff who worked on Berlusconi ’s channels and filmed near his Sardinia summer resort .
“ For the last 30 years , Italy has been subjected very strongly to Berlusconi TV , which has a lot of semi-naked women and triviality .
These things present themselves as harmless but it ’s a dangerous culture .
Italian TV is very superficial and very male chauvinistic .
It ’s based on the idea of total hedonism , ” he said .
“ I portray the idea that Berlusconi ’s own personality is mirrored on his channels .
I ’m not saying he is singly responsible for the culture of Italian TV ... but what we see on his TV is very close to what he is . ”
He added : “ I interviewed someone who worked on his channel and he said Berlusconi hates the colour green , therefore they never had green as the colour of the backdrop . ”
Videocracy is distributed by the independent company Fandango , which was behind the acclaimed 2008 Naples gangster film Gomorrah .
Severe interrogation techniques like waterboarding , sleep deprivation , stress positions and the exploitation of phobias are n't just morally reprehensible , they 're based on bad science , destroying the very memories they 're supposed to recover .
" There is a vast literature on the effects of extreme stress on motivation , mood and memory , using both animals and humans , " writes Shane O'Mara , a stress researcher at Ireland 's Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience .
" These techniques cause severe , repeated and prolonged stress , which compromises brain tissue supporting memory and executive function . "
So -called " enhanced interrogation " was used on suspected terrorists during the Bush administration , and sparked a bitter argument over the nature of torture and its use by the United States .
Enhanced interrogation was officially banned by President Obama , but almost certainly continues as part of Obama 's ongoing rendition program , which sends suspects to torture - practicing countries .
Some intelligence officials , from former Vice President Dick Cheney to current intelligence chief Dennis Blair , defend enhanced interrogation as an useful tool in pulling information from terrorists who refuse to talk .
But many intelligence officers say that such information has little value , because people being tortured will say anything to make it stop .
A report published by the Intelligence Science Board in 2007 found that no research existed to support the use of enhanced interrogation .
And O'Mara 's review , published Monday in Trends in Cognitive Science , describes a wealth of science that supports ending the practice .
O'Mara derides the belief that extreme stress produces reliable memory as " folk neurobiology " that " is utterly unsupported by scientific evidence . "
The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — the brain 's centers of memory processing , storage and retrieval — are profoundly altered by stress hormones .
Keep the stress up long enough , and it will " result in compromised cognitive function and even tissue loss , " warping the minds that interrogators want to read .
What 's more , tortured suspects might not even realize when they 're lying .
Frontal lobe damage can produce false memories :
As torture is maintained for weeks or months or years , suspects may incorporate their captors ' allegations into their own version of reality .
The " ticking time bomb " argument has been used to justify torture in situations where the information it retrieves could immediately save lives .
But it will be " difficult or impossible to determine during interrogation whether the information a suspect reveals is true , " writes O'Mara — and the bomb will continue to tick .

The firefighters report only isolated pockets of fire , so where was the all - consuming inferno ?
Also of note is the fact that these transmissions were made seconds before WTC 2's collapse .
There were supposedly massive structural failings occurring in this section of the building at this time ...
Video showing the WTC collapse as proposed by the " truss theory " .
348 kB wmv download ... yet no mention is made of this .
The firefighters should have been broadcasting warnings of a fiery hell which was causing structural failures , instead they are calmly preparing to move up to the 79th floor .
A final point to note is New York 's Office of Emergency Management issued a collapse warning five minutes before WTC 2 came down .
How did the OEM know something that the firefighters did n't ?
Why were n't warnings broadcast to firefighters over the radio ?
Hump day over .

Finally after five years of planning and three trial attempts at a frame , The Arcturus CamperCycle is ready to be built .
The new version will be a three wheeled vehicle with two wheels up front and one in the back so that it can take on a teardrop shape with maximum aerodynamics .
Being a trike also makes it legal as an electric assisted bicycle so there will be no problem driving it on the street .
Make no mistake , this is a full sized motor home , not a coffin on wheels , so it will sleep two or more people comfortably and have the same size interior and amenities that any small motor home would have .
Before I dig into the technical details , have a look at this huge pile of notebooks from the past few years that have included many of the design incantations of Arcturus .
Original concepts had a side by side tandem tadpole trike pulling a large trailer unit , and I went as far as building the actual trike before realizing that the weight of the trailer would require a more robust and electric assisted trike to pull it .
The truck and trailer idea was scrapped is it just did not seem as cool as an all in one motor home style unit that you could just pedal onto a campground and park .
Another version was tried by extending the frame of our KyotoCruiser sociable delta trike by 10 feet in order to build a camper area in the back .
Although the base vehicle did work very well , it became clear that suspension was needed on all wheels and something more robust than bicycle wheels would be needed in order to carry the entire weight plus deliver the powerful electric assist to the road .
Another version of the delta frame was built using 2 inch square tubing and was designed to use 16 inch trailer wheels and brakes .
Again , the design become complex because of steering and transmission issues between the human input and electric power , so a completely new design was needed .
Bored one night , I dug through five years of notes to realize that a very early concept was probably the best all around – one that used a Jeep front differential of all things .
You might think a Jeep differential would be overkill for a human / electric hybrid vehicle , but the design is actually perfect .
A “ Dana - 30 ” differential only weighs about 150 pounds and includes a front wheel drive system with included Ackerman and center point steering , disc brakes on both sides , and a perfect gear reduction system to connect directly to the PMG - 132 electric motor I plan to use .
By adapting the battery pack directly to the differential , it also carries 75 % of the vehicle weight on wheels that were designed for the task , so in reality , the rest of the camper can be made of lightweight high tech composites .
The Jeep differential , motor , controller , and all batteries will be a single “ power unit ” ready to drive , brake , and steer the entire vehicle .
As for human input , I plan to have each rider pedal a single home built axial flux generator so that power will be fed directly into the drive bank with very little loss .
When parked , the human powered generator can be used to “ top up ” the battery banks for all night LED lighting when power is scarce .
Roof mounted solar cells will also aid in charging the banks when the camper is parked .
With the PMG - 132 motor running from one of two onboard 48 volt packs , the range of the vehicle will be about 100 kilometers at speeds legal for an electric assist bicycle .
Having two battery banks makes more sense as the efficiency of the motor is almost 95 % at 48 volts , and a large shunt switch can swap banks to keep them from running too low .
Since all of the transmission and drive system is all self contained at the front with the differential , a simple motorcycle swing arm and suspension will be used at the rear of the vehicle .
That ’s all for now .
As soon as the snow melts and I can source a Jeep Dana - 30 differential , I will begin working on Arcturus and documenting every single step .
I think a full sized human / electric motor home with a range of 100 kilometers is just what the world needs as gas prices skyrocket out of control and waist lines bulge !
I also look forward to hearing from the many talented garage hackers out there as this project progresses , so please drop in and say hello !
The press ’s love affair with President Obama ( such as it is ) may be due to hit a rough patch if Obama is successful in preventing new legislation from passing that aims to keep reporters who refuse to disclose confidential sources from going to prison .
Yes , that ’s correct , Obama is against journalists being allowed to keep their sources confidential .
Not all sources , mind you , just the ones leaking info about national security .
From the New York Times :
The Obama administration has told lawmakers that it opposes legislation that could protect reporters from being imprisoned if they refuse to disclose confidential sources who leak material about national security , according to several people involved with the negotiations .
The administration this week sent to Congress sweeping revisions to a “ media shield ” bill that would significantly weaken its protections against forcing reporters to testify .
Here ’s what the legislation , sponsored by Charles Schumer and Arlen Specter , is looking to put in place :
The bill includes safeguards that would require prosecutors to exhaust other methods for finding the source of the information before subpoenaing a reporter , and would balance investigators ’ interests with “ the public interest in gathering news and maintaining the free flow of information . ”
The administration , however , is not so hot on that idea and wants to make it so that “ such procedures would not apply to leaks of a matter deemed to cause ‘ significant ’ harm to national security .
Moreover , judges would be instructed to be deferential to executive branch assertions about whether a leak caused or was likely to cause such harm , according to officials familiar with the proposal . ”
This is tricky stuff .
Reporters being able to protect their sources is obviously the key to a lot of important investigative reporting on the national and international level as much as anywhere else .
On the one hand , the knowledge that they might be more easily revealed could easily prevent some highly placed sources from leaking information that is in the public ’s best interest to know about .
Think Watergate .
On the other hand , the knowledge that they could be more easily revealed could prevent highly placed sources from leaking damaging information a la the Valerie Plame affair , which eventually landed Vice President Cheney ’s chief of staff Scooter Libby in jail ( but not before Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper were put through the ringer ! ) .
So yes , tricky stuff .
That being said , perhaps always better to land on the side of more freedom of the press than less .
Obama officials meanwhile argue that they are merely trying to strike some middle ground so that highly placed insiders ( perhaps acting on their own agenda ) ca n’t just run willy - nilly to reporters with super - secret intelligence with no fear of retribution .
Needless to say reporter advocate groups are not happy .
Time will tell whether the bill gets passed with or without the revisions .
In the meantime , as a fun little exercise , try rereading the Times article except replace the phrase Obama administration with Bush administration , and then see how you feel about it .
Have a tip we should know ?

Denial of the islands as bases to potential enemies began with the visit of HMS
Queen of Bermuda
to Deception Island , on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula , in March 1941 to destroy stocks of coal and to puncture fuel tanks .
Argentina had placed marks of sovereignty on Deception Island in 1942 .
They were obliterated in January 1943 by HMS
Carnarvon Castle
, which hoisted the Union Flag there ( Sullivan 1957 ) .
In 194 3 , Gre at Bri tai n be ga n pla nni ng to occ upy the ter rit ory .
A sec ret mil ita ry ex erc ise , cod e nam ed Operation Tabarin , was mounted by the Royal Navy to establish bases on the peninsula and in the islands to the west ( Fuchs 1982 : 22–54 ; Mills 2003 : 489 ) .
According to these authors , British wartime interests did not extend to Dronnin g Maud Land , 1000 km to the east across the Weddell Sea .
The ne xt wel l-d ocu men ted ev ent bea rin g on the subject of this paper occurred early on 10 July 1945 , two months after the German surrender , when a German U- boat ,
U- 530
, entered the Argentine naval base at Mar del Plata ( NARA 1985 ; Blair 1998 ) .
Leutnant Otto Wermuth , the Captain of
U- 530
, appears to have believed that he woul d be well receiv ed by the Argentin es .
His arri val cre ate d muc h spe cul ati on .
Dis reg ard ing the ne ws of Hitler ’s suicide on 30 April , many believed that
U- 530
had som eho w spi rit ed Hit ler , Ev a Bra un , Ma rti n Bor man n and others out of Germany and had landed them either on the coast of Patagonia or at a ‘ New Berchtesgaden ’ in Antarctica .
On 16 July , a detailed account of Hitler ’s sup pos ed ﬂig ht and hid ing pla ce in Dro nni ng Mau d Lan d , Antar ctica , was published in the Arge ntine newspa per
La Critica
, by Ladislas Szabo , a Hungarian exile living in Argentina ( Szabo 1947 : 8 ) .
It was repeated in major newspapers worldwide , for example under the headline ‘ Hitler ’s on Ice in Antarctic ’ in Toronto (
Toronto Daily Star
18 July 1945 ) .
Speculation increased when
U-977
, under the comma nd of Ober leutn ant Hein z Scha effe r , appeared at Mar del Plata on 17 August ( Schaeffer 1952 ; NARA 1985 ; Blair 1998 ) .
As Argentina was a combatant power at the end of the war , Wermuth and Schaeffer and their crews became prisoners of war and were interrogated by the Argentine Na vy , the US Na vy , and the Ro yal Na vy ( Sc hae ff er 195 2 ) .
Inter rogat ion focus sed on wheth er Hitle r and / or other high - ranking Nazis had , in fact , escaped from Germany by submarine .
Eventually , the interrogators were satisﬁed th at th e la te ar ri v al of th e su bm ar in es in th e So ut h At la nt ic was entirely innoc uous .

In hi s 19 47 bo ok
Hitler is alive
, Szabo claimed that both submarines were part of a submarine convoy that had taken Hitler and other senior ﬁgures from the Third Reich to Antarctica , where ‘ New Berchtesgaden ’ had been set up in 1938 – 39 by
Schwabenland
, on the orders of Admiral D ¨ onitz .
Despite Schaeffer ’s denials ( Schaeffer 1952 ) , the rumour continued to spread ( see Mattern and Friedrich 1975 : 68 ; Landig 1980 ) .
Buechner and Bernhart ( 1989 : 216 ) provided a dif- ferent version , claiming that Hitler had indeed died in his bunker in Berlin , but that
U-977
had then transported his ashes to Antarctica , in convoy with other submarines ,
en route
to Mar del Plata .
According to these authors , the ashes were deposited along with other Nazi treasures pac ked in six bro nze , lea d-l ine d box es tha t had bee n landed in Dronning Maud Land by
U- 530
, and placed in a ‘ very special natural ice cave in the M¨ uhlig - Hofmann Mountains ’ ( Buechner and Bernhart 1989 : 188 ) .
To lend an a ir of au thent icity to this tale , Bern hart claim ed t o hav e been one of the crew of
U- 530
, although his name is not on the
U- 530
manifest provided by the Argentine Navy ( Szabo 1947 : 13 – 14 ) .
‘ New Berchtesgaden ’ appears , like the phantom con- vo y , to be the brain chi ld of Sza bo ( 19 47 : 155 ) , and has bee n a fa vo uri te ele men t of Naz i myt hol ogy ev er since ( Goodrick - Clarke 2002 ) .
Several writers accept the ex ist enc e of the suppo sed base , and that the re wa s a conspiracy to suppress information about it ( for example Mat ter n and Fri edr ich 197 5 ; Fri edr ich 197 9 ; Ste ve ns 1997 , 2003 ; Choron date unkno wn ; Farrell 2005 ; and Robert 2005 a 2005b , 2005c ) .
Expanding on Szabo ( 1947 : 200 –202 ) , and each of them building on the one before , they go on to suggest that US forces attacked the German base during Operation Highjump in the southern summer of 194 6 – 1 947 , tha t tho se for ces were rep uls ed by the secret weapons of the German defenders , and that as a result the US forces had to leave the area sooner than planned .
The tale has become more elaborate with the passage of time .
A different version of these events has recently been published by Robert ( 2005a , 2005 b , 2005c ) in a trilogy entitled
Britain ’s secret war in Antarctica
.
Robert claims not only tha t the re wa s ind eed a sec ret Germa n bas e in Dronning Maud Land during World War II , but also that the British spied on it from their own secret base in Dro nni ng Mau d Lan d .
He cla ims that the Britis h Arm y’ s SASattac kedand tri ed to des tro y the Germa n bas e aroun d Chris tmas 1945 .
According to Robe rt ( 2005 c ) , that attempt was ineffective , as were the subsequent attempts by the USA ’s Operation Highjump , and the German base was ﬁnally destroyed by secretly exploding three atomic bombs above it in 1958 as part of the activities of the IGY .
Robert ( 2005 c ) claims that the truth about the German base and the attacks on it by Britain and the United States have been deliberately suppressed by the US and British governments .
This supposed suppression he describes as ‘ A travesty of history ’ .
If they were true , the propositions of Szabo , Robert and others listed above would be fascinating for history and for science .
Indeed , there is an element of truth in all of these tales .

This is Thanksgiving week … the week some of us are very thankful that we do n’t live in the same city as our relatives .
So I ’m calling in the experts .
My friend , Elisha Goldstein , who writes the “ Mindfulness and Psychotherapy ” blog on Psych Central , offers readers like myself , who are having difficulty with a formal meditation practice , several quick tips for mindful living that can be implemented throughout the day .
He writes in his post , “ Hectic Life ? Quick Tips for Mindful Living ” that “ even without the time and place in life to set up some formal practice , from the minute you get up in the day to the moment you lay your head on the pillow there is opportunity to engage mindfulness as a way of life , opening you up to greater focus , calm , and peace . ”
That means , in between the turkey / mash potatoes / cranberry sauce plate and the pumpkin / pecan pie plate , you can squeeze in a little sanity break , and ask yourself if it ’s really going to benefit you to comment on your brother ’s fourth glass of Merlot ( plus the sedatives he ’s stashing in his trousers , of course ) .
For this week ’s “ Mindful Monday , ” I thought I ’d list some of the easy mindfulness practices Elisha offers in his blog :
1. RAIN .
In his blog “ Difficult Emotions : One Approach You ’ll Want to Try , ” Dr. Goldstein writes :
In the mindfulness circles the acronym R.A.I.N has floated around to support people in dealing with difficult emotions .
It has been found in Tara Brach ’s book Radical Acceptance , Jack Kornfield has said it , and you will find it the upcoming Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction Workbook that I have co-authored with Bob Stahl , Ph.D ( February , 2010 ) .
Here is a sneak peek : “ R ” is to recognize when a strong emotion is present .
“ A ” is to allow or acknowledge that it is indeed there .
“ I ” is to investigate and bring self - inquiry to the body , feelings , and mind , and “ N ” is to non-identify with what ’s there .
This non-identification is very useful in that it helps to deflate the story and cultivates wise understanding in the recognition that the emotion is just another passing mind state and not a definition of who you are .
Just like seeing a movie , standing back and watching the actors play out their dramas , by non-identifying with your story and seeing it as impermanent , this will help assist in loosening your own tight grip of identification .
Utilizing R.A.I. N. as a practice can help you bring space to be with things as they are and grow in deeper understanding of what drives , underlies or fuels our fears , anger , and sadness .
Turning into our emotions can feel a bit foreign since most of us live in such a pain denying culture .
Is n’t it time to begin acknowledging stress , anxiety or pain rather than suppressing , repressing , or all - too - quickly medicating it ?
Can we learn to view these challenges as a rite of passage instead of running away from them ?
2. STOP .
Another tip to weave mindfulness into your daily schedule : before work , during lunch , before you walk into your home in the evening , or after you get the kids to bed at night .
Writes Goldstein in his post “ Stress Got You Down ? ” :
Creating space to come down from the worried mind and back into the present moment has been shown to be enormously helpful to people .
When we are present we have a firmer grasp of all our options and resources which often make us feel better .
Next time you find your mind racing with stress , try the acronym S.T.O.P. : S – Stop what you are doing , put things down for a minute .
T – Take a breath .
Breathe normally and naturally and follow your breath coming in and of your nose .
You can even say to yourself “ in ” as you ’re breathing in and “ out ” as you ’re breathing out if that helps with concentration .
O – Observe your thoughts , feelings , and emotions .
You can reflect about what is on your mind and also notice that thoughts are not facts and they are not permanent .
If the thought arises that you are inadequate , just notice the thought , let it be , and continue on .
Notice any emotions that are there and just name them .
Recent research out of UCLA says that just naming your emotions can have a calming effect .
Then notice your body .
Are you standing or sitting ?
How is your posture ?
Any aches and pains .
P – Proceed with something that will support you in the moment .
Whether that is talking to a friend or just rubbing your shoulders .
3. Walk .
Walking is an easy way to incorporate mindfulness into your day .
Heck , even walking to the frig to grab some milk provides 60 seconds of reflection time .
So why not squeeze out the mindfulness potential ?
In his post , “ 4 Ways to Walk ( Mindfully ) into Mental Health , ” Dr. Goldstein lists four ways we can apply the simple act of walking to mindfulness .
Appreciation –
If you are fortunate enough to have the ability to walk , try and remember , it took you over a year to learn how to walk and these legs are often the unsung heroes that take you to and fro day in and day out .
Thank your legs for all their efforts .
Grounding – Bring your attention to the sensations of your feet and legs as the heel touches the ground , then the base of the foot , then the toes , and then they lift .
You can actually say to yourself , “ heel , foot , toes , lift . ”
This is a way to connect to the action of walking in the present moment .
Open Awareness – Walk slightly slower and begin to open your awareness to all your senses one by one .
Sight , sound , taste , feeling , smell .
See what is around you , listen to the sounds , taste the air or whatever is in your mouth , feel the warmth , coolness , or breeze on your cheeks , smell the air .
Then stop for a moment and see if you can take in all of the senses .
Mantra –
As I mentioned in an earlier blog , you can also recite some sayings while taking a few steps .
For example , take a few steps and during an in breath say to yourself , “ breathing in , I have arrived , breathing out , I am home ” or “ breathing in , I calm my body , breathing out , I relax ” .
Or make up your own sayings .
4. Shower .
I actually use this one a lot .
Because when the kids were young , my time in the shower was , honest to God , the only time I had to myself .
So I was not so green and blasted the hot water for a good five to minutes , pretending I was under a tropical waterfall in Hawaii .
In his post , “ Turn on the Shower and Reduce Your Stress Today , ” Dr. Goldstein writes :
What would happen if instead of thinking about all the plans you had to catch up on while you were in the shower , you took a pause , and then brought your nose to the smell of the soap … and again , just exploring the scent of it with your nose …
What would happen if you then brought your attention to just feeling the sensation of the warm water against your skin and the feeling of goose bumps that might be there from the contrast of coming in from the cold ?
Oh … then the mind drifts back again about who you need to call at work , why are you doing this stupid practice , the upcoming meetings , when you need to pick up your kids , what you need to buy for dinner , as you begin to speed up and the tension mounts .
What would happen if you noticed this , said to yourself “ there goes my mind again ” , and then brought your attention back into the shower where you were right now .
How might your experience be different ?
How might your mood be different when getting out of the shower ?
Would you be more or less reactive with your family , roommates , or whoever you came in contact with next ?
4 Quick Mindfulness Techniques
A group identifying themselves as " anti-fascist hackers " broke into the website and e-mail account of controversial British historian and accused Holocaust - denier David Irving and obtained his private communications as well as attendee lists for his current U.S. speaking tour .
The hackers posted Irving 's e-mail correspondence online , as well as the user name and password for his website account and AOL e-mail account , which shared the same password .
The hackers also posted the e-mail addresses and other personal information – such as names , phone numbers and shipping and credit card billing addresses – of people who made donations through his websites , purchased his books or bought tickets for his appearances .
Irving 's username and password for his Authorize .
net account , which handles the credit card transactions on his website , were also exposed .
The data was posted on whistle - blowing site WikiLeaks on Friday evening in advance of Irving 's Saturday speaking engagement at the Catholic Kolping Society of America in New York City .
The organization reportedly canceled the event on Friday after someone contacted it .
The organization said its facility had been booked a few days ago by someone using the name " Michael Singer , " who said he wanted to hold a book reading .
The organization canceled the engagement after learning that the event was scheduled for Irving .
The location of Irving 's engagements are generally kept secret and announced to attendees only at the last minute to prevent protesters from appearing at the venues or pressuring facilities to cancel Irving 's reservations .
Irving was once a popular historian specializing in World War II but has been a lightning rod for controversy over opinions he 's expressed in the past about the Holocaust and the Nazi regime .
Although he asserts he 's not a Holocaust denier , he was convicted in Austria in 2006 of denying the Holocaust and sentenced to three years in prison , and was called a racist and anti-Semite by a British judge in a libel case that Irving lost .
He has underplayed the extent of the extermination of Jews , saying the number killed was much fewer than 6 million .
He also claimed in 1989 that Auschwitz was not an extermination camp – though he has since recanted .
" History is a constantly growing tree – the more you know , the more documents become available , the more you learn , and I have learned a lot since 1989 , " the BBC reported him saying .
The Anti-Defamation League considers him one of the world 's most effective purveyors of Holocaust denial and has carefully monitored his activities .
The e-mails published on Friday exposed discussions that occurred between Irving and others about booking his speaking engagements under pseudonyms to thwart protesters .
" The venue is reserved under my name . . . , my phone number and wonderfully disguised . . . as a book signing , not yours or some group so just in case some nasty is poking around they will come up with nothing , " wrote one supporter in the U.S. who had booked an engagement for Irving in Richmond , Virginia .
The e-mails include other personal correspondence about the East Coast speaking tour Irving is currently conducting in the U.S. , security issues – such as an incident involving weapons that someone brought to one of his recent speaking engagements in Florida – and a tense exchange between Irving and his assistant about his poor treatment of her and her threats to quit .
The data also includes the bank account number of Irving 's landlord in the United Kingdom and instructions to Irving 's bank in Florida to wire money to the account , as well as personal exchanges with supporters .
One supporter writes to Irving : " You should continually blame the Jews who controlled Churchill with causing their own disaster .
Also blame the Jews for the loss of your empire and the immigration invasion caused by it .
As Reichminister Goebbles , of Blessed Memory , loved to say , ' The Jews are to blame . ' "
Among the published data is a list of people who bought tickets for Irving 's speaking engagements through his website .
The word " Achtung " has been appended to some ticket orders that appear to come from Jewish attendees .
The published e-mails discuss playing tricks on attendees believed to be Jewish , such as giving them a false address for speaking events .
Irving 's website was inaccessible Friday evening and calls to cell phones belonging to Irving and his assistant went unanswered .
But Michael Santomauro , whose correspondence with Irving was among those posted online , confirmed that the e-mails were authentic and that Irving had been hacked .
Santomauro identified himself as the " Michael Singer " who had booked Irving 's New York speaking engagement .
He told Threat Level that around 7 p .m .
Friday evening an e-mail was sent out by the hackers from Irving 's AOL account shortly before Irving was scheduled to give a talk in New Jersey .
The e-mail was sent to a list of Irving supporters with the subject line reading : " ADVISORY : Anti-Fascist Hackers Destroy Holocaust Denier David Irving 's Website and Release Private Emails , Attendee Lists . "
The e-mail contained all of the information that was posted on the WikiLeaks website and indicated that the hackers destroyed all the files , including backup files and databases , on Irving 's web sites irvingbooks.com and fpp.co.uk .
In the e-mail , the hackers wrote : " We did this to expose this Nazi - sympathizer for who he is and to shut down / disrupt any possibility of Irving rearing his fascist head in public during his tour .
To David Irving and all aspiring white - power , anti-immigrant , queer - bashing , racist pigs – give it up !
We will fight you on the streets and on the internet until you are swept into the dustbin of history . "
Santomauro said there was an inkling that something was wrong about half an hour before the hacker 's e-mail arrived when Irving contacted him to tell him the New York event had been canceled and asked how his detractors could have learned the location .
The two had only discussed it among themselves by e-mail and by phone .
" Apparently [ the hackers ] have been monitoring his AOL for a certain amount of time , " Santomauro said .
He told Threat Level he suspected the Jewish Defense Organization was behind the hack .
He says he 's been targeted himself by protesters from this group and others who have harassed him outside his apartment building and hacked the account for a Yahoo study group he runs .
But , he says , the harassment against Irving is much worse .
" I do n't agree with everything Irving has to say , but he should have the freedom to express whatever views he has , " Santomauro said .
" I can agree that he 's not a very pleasant person .
But he 's not a Holocaust denier .
He could care less about it and is not very knowledgeable about it .
. . .
He does n't talk about it in his speaking tours . "
The Jewish Defense Organization denied responsibility for the hack .
" We applaud the act , but we have no idea who did it , " said spokesman Jeff Klein .
" This is the first we 've heard of it . "
UPDATE : Irving 's assistant , Jaenelle Antas , forwarded a statement from Irving saying that it would be several days before he could assess the damage from the hack , since his web provider had apparently scheduled repairs to begin on Friday – the day of the hack – and last for seven days , making it difficult for him to access his account .
" We have a complete back - up , in any case , " he wrote .
" Half the files [ the hackers ] posted were already publicly available on the website , like the Radical 's Diary .
Other items they appear to have invented .
We shall be apologising to the many people who may find themselves inconvenienced by these juvenile cyber-nasties .
We are puzzled that they are so frightened by historical debate . "
Antas did not respond to a follow - up question asking which items the hackers posted were invented .
This post was updated with a response from the Jewish Defense Organization .
President Obama 's efforts to revive the Middle East peace process are bound to fail because of the unbridgeable divide separating Israel 's and Palestine 's political goals .
The minor problems are Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's unwillingness to partition Jerusalem and enable the Palestinians to constitute the eastern half of the city as their capital , and his reluctance to freeze the settlement enterprise in the West Bank .
The major problem is that the two - headed Palestinian national movement is averse to sharing Palestine with the Jews and endorsing a solution based on two states for two peoples .
Hamas , which won the Palestinian national elections in 2006 , says so bluntly .
Its charter of 1988 explicitly calls for Israel 's destruction and assures the believers that " Islam will destroy Israel " .
It repeatedly compares Israel to the medieval crusader kingdoms and states that its end will be identical .
( This comparison , incidentally , has been a constant in Arab discourse on Zionism .
In September 1947 , the Arab League 's secretary general , Abdul Rahman Azzam , told Zionist emissaries : " Centuries ago , the crusaders established themselves in our midst against our will , and in 200 years we ejected them . " )
Fatah too has a constitution , never revised since the 1960s , which advocates Israel 's destruction .
During the 1990s , Fatah – then the leading component of the Palestinian national movement – agreed in negotiations with Israel to produce a revised Palestinian National Charter that deleted the clauses calling for Israel 's destruction .
No such revised charter was ever produced , though these clauses were ostensibly revoked by a gathering of Palestinian notables in Gaza in 1998 .
Fatah 's head , the president of the Palestine National Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , in effect continues to promote the same rejectionist message .
He publicly hails , to propitiate Washington , " the two - state solution " , but when pressed declines to endorse it .
Yes , one state for Palestinian Arabs and another for whoever lives in Israel , but not a " Jewish state " .
He seems to be hoping that Israel 's 20 % Arab minority , with birth rates double those of the Jews , will overtake the Jews demographically ; or that Israel will accede to Palestinian demands to allow the return of refugees .
There are around five million refugees ( nine - tenths are the descendants of the 1948 refugees ) .
Israel has 5.5 million Jewish citizens .
A mass repatriation coupled with the incumbent Arabs would turn Israel instantly into an Arab - majority state .
Hence Abbas 's unwillingness to recognise Israel as a " Jewish state " .
The Jewish national movement , Zionism , and the Palestinian Arabs ' national movement enjoyed common starting points but , over time , followed radically different trajectories .
Both initially sought to establish a state of their own over all Palestine .
This was the Zionists ' aim from the movement 's inception in the early 1880s until the late 1930s .
All of Palestine , the ancient land of Israel , rightfully would be theirs .
But the Arab revolt of 1936 - 39 and the resurgence of antisemitism in Europe persuaded the Zionist leaders that they would have to make do with only part of Palestine .
They accepted , in principle , the 1937 Peel commission partition proposal and , a decade later , the UN General Assembly partition resolution ; thus , since the 1990s , they have reaffirmed the principle of two states for two peoples .
But from the beginning , the Palestinian national movement saw the struggle as a zero - sum game .
As Palestinian notables told the King - Crane commission in 1919 , " We will push the Zionists into the sea , or they will send us back into the desert " ; there could be no partition .
This was to be the stance of the Palestinian national movement 's first major leader , Haj Amin al - Husseini , and of its second , Yasser Arafat .
( His only concession to the realities of power was that Israel would have to be destroyed not in one fell swoop but in stages . )
And this remains the goal to this day .
The rejection of Israel as " a Jewish state " and the unwavering insistence on the refugee " right of return " are the " tells " .
Obama will press Netanyahu on settlements and achieve some sort of freeze .
But once the negotiations begin , the issue of Jerusalem will loudly surface .
And then the refugees .
And Israel will insist that Abbas – who does not represent Hamas and perhaps only a minority of Palestinians – accept the Clinton - Barak formulation of an " end to the conflict " and an " end to all claims " .
And Abbas will demand Israeli acceptance of the " right of return " – the demographic battering ram designed to subvert Israel 's Jewish character and existence .
And the talks will founder , possibly followed by a new round of violence .
I fear that history is against Obama .
From a prohibition - based perspective , marijuana is illegal in the United States primarily for these seven reasons .
Under the Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 , marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug on the basis that is has " a high potential for abuse . "
What does this mean ?
It means that the perception is that people get on marijuana , they become addicted , and it begins to dominate their lives .
This unquestionably happens in some cases .
But it also happens in the case of alcohol , and alcohol is perfectly legal .
In order to fight this argument for prohibition , legalization advocates need to make the argument that marijuana is not as addictive as government sources claim .
Marijuana seems to yield considerable medical benefits for many Americans with ailments ranging from glaucoma to cancer , but these benefits have not been accepted well enough , on a national level .
Medical use of marijuana remains a serious national controversy .
In order to fight the argument that marijuana has no medical use , legalization advocates need to highlight the effects it has had on the lives of people who have used the drug for medical reasons .
The first piece of federal legislation to formally regulate marijuana was the Narcotics Act of 1914 , which regulated heroin , cocaine , and marijuana .
The only trouble is that cocaine and marijuana are not technically narcotics ; the word " narcotic , " when used in English , has historically referred to opium derivatives such as heroin and morphine .
But the association stuck , and there is a vast gulf in the American consciousness between " normal " recreational drugs , such as alcohol , caffeine , and nicotine , and " abnormal " recreational drugs , such as heroin , cocaine , and methamphetamine .
Marijuana is generally associated with the latter category , which is why it can be convincingly portrayed as a " gateway drug . "
Marijuana is often thought of as a drug for hippies and others that society looked down upon .
Since it 's hard to feel enthusiastic about the prospects of enabling people to become what society found unacceptable , imposing criminal sanctions for marijuana possession functions as a form of communal " tough love .
"
The intense anti-marijuana movement of the 1930s dovetailed nicely with the intense anti-Chicano movement of the 1930s .
Marijuana was associated with Mexican Americans , and a ban on marijuana was seen as a way of discouraging Mexican - American subcultures from developing .
Today , thanks in large part to the very public popularity of marijuana among White Americans during the 1960s and 1970s , marijuana is no longer seen as what one might call an ethnic drug , but the groundwork for the anti-marijuana movement was laid down at a time when marijuana was seen as an encroachment on America 's
White majority culture .
If something has been banned for only a short period of time , then the ban is seen as unstable .
If something has been banned for a long time , however , then the ban , no matter how ill - conceived it is , tends to go unenforced long before it is actually taken off the books .
Take the ban on sodomy , for example .
It has n't really been enforced in any serious way since the 18th century , but most states technically banned same - sex sexual intercourse until the Supreme Court ruled such bans unconstitutional in Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) .
People tend to be comfortable with the status quo .
The status quo , for nearly a century , has been a literal or de factofederal ban on marijuana .
To hear some advocates of marijuana legalization say it , the drug cures diseases while it promotes creativity , open - mindedness , moral progression , and a closer relationship with God and / or the cosmos .
That sounds unbelievable , particularly when the public image of a marijuana user is , again , that of someone undesirable who risks arrest and imprisonment so that he or she can artificially invoke an endorphin release .
A much better argument for marijuana legalization , from my vantage point , would go more like this : " It makes some people happy , and it does n't seem to be any more dangerous than alcohol .
Do we really want to go around putting people in prison and destroying their lives over this ? "
It is illegal because the government can't profit of marijuana .

Synthetics such as plastics , cellophane , celluloid , methanol , nylon , rayon , Dacron , etc. , could now be made from oil .
Natural hemp industrialization would have ruined over 80 % of DuPont 's business .
Andrew Mellon became Hoover 's Secretary of the Treasury and Dupont 's primary investor .
He appointed his future nephew - in - law , Harry J. Anslinger , to head the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs .
Secret meetings were held by these financial tycoons .
Hemp was declared dangerous and a threat to their billion dollar enterprises .
For their dynasties to remain intact , hemp had to go .
These men took an obscure Mexican slang word : ' marihuana ' and pushed it into the consciousness of America .
A media blitz of ' yellow journalism ' raged in the late 1920s and 1930s .
Hearst 's newspapers ran stories emphasizing the " horrors of marihuana . "
The menace of marijuana made headlines .
Readers learned that it was responsible for everything from car accidents to loose morality .
Films like ' Reefer Madness ' ( 1936 ) , ' Marihuana : Assassin of Youth ' ( 1935 ) and ' Marihua4na : The Devil 's Weed ' ( 1936 ) were propaganda designed by these industrialists to create an enemy .
Their purpose was to gain public support so that anti-marijuana laws could be passed .
Examine the following quotes from ' The Burning Question ' aka REEFER MADNESS :
a violent narcotic .
acts of shocking violence .
incurable insanity .
soul - destroying effects .
under the influence of the drug he killed his entire family with an ax .
more vicious , more deadly even than these soul - destroying drugs ( heroin , cocaine ) is the menace of marihuana !
In the 1930s , people were very naive ; even to the point of ignorance .
The masses were like sheep waiting to be led by the few in power .
They did not challenge authority .
If the news was in print or on the radio , they believed it had to be true .
They told their children and their children grew up to be the parents of the baby - boomers .
On April 14 , 1937 , the Prohibitive Marihuana Tax Law or the bill that outlawed hemp was directly brought to the House Ways and Means Committee .
This committee is the only one that can introduce a bill to the House floor without it being debated by other committees .
The Chairman of the Ways and Means , Robert Doughton , was a Dupont supporter .
He insured that the bill would pass Congress .
Dr. James Woodward , a physician and attorney , testified too late on behalf of the American Medical Association .
He told the committee that the reason the AMA had not denounced the Marijuana Tax Law sooner was that the Association had just discovered that marijuana was hemp .
Few people , at the time , realized that the deadly menace they had been reading about on Hearst 's front pages was in fact hemp .
The AMA understood cannabis to be a medicine found in numerous healing products sold over the last hundred years .
In September of 1937 , hemp became illegal .
The most useful crop known became a drug and our planet has been suffering ever since .
Congress banned hemp because it was said to be the most violence - causing drug known .
Anslinger , head of the Drug Commission for 31 years , promoted the idea that marijuana made users act extremely violent .
In the 1950s , under the Communist threat of McCarthyism , Anslinger now said the exact opposite .
Marijuana will pacify you so much that soldiers would not want to fight .
Today , our planet is in desperate trouble .
Earth is suffocating as large tracts of rain forests disappear .
Pollution , poisons and chemicals are killing people .
These great problems could be reversed if we industrialized hemp .
Natural biomass could provide all of the planet 's energy needs that are currently supplied by fossil fuels .
We have consumed 80 % of our oil and gas reserves .
We need a renewable resource .
Hemp could be the solution to soaring fuel prices .
It is illegal because in 1954 there was to be a tax on it ( like cigarettes ) but no one wanted a tax on it , so it became a drug .
If there is ever another vote on it , there is a huge chance that weed can be as common as beer or cigarettes .
There are many sites which explain all the politics of it , but hemp ( cannabis ) used to be a huge cash crop in the US , and supplied the raw material for fiber , bioplastics , diesel fuel , bird seed , and paper .
But it was really difficult to harvest .
In 1936 a thresher was patented that made harvesting much easier .
But that put hemp in direct competition with the large paper mills ( owned by Hearst ) ; and DuPont chemicals , which had developed a process for producing plastics from petroleum .
All this pretty much coincided with the repeal of alcohol prohibition in 1933 .
Federal agents who had been merrily busting moonshiners and bootleggers who operated illegal stills , now were out of a job .
Harry Anslinger , head of those operations wanted to keep his boys employed , so together with Hearst , DuPont , and a cadre of racists , started a campaign to demonize cannabis .
They renamed it as marijuana , said that minority members who smoked it were corrupting
White youth , and turning everyone who used it into crazed killers .
Congress , clueless as ever , agreed to but a ban on " marijuana " .
Unfortunately , they did n't realize it was the same thing as hemp .
So a lot of farmers were ticked off .
Also , a bunch of doctors were upset because cannabis had been used for a century in many medications including children 's cough syrup , and sleeping liquid .
But money talks , and it spoke loudly then , as now .
Hearst , of the wood pulp and paper interests , used his many newspapers to print propaganda , and push the prohibition through .
Briefly , during World War II , access to imported hemp was cut off , and the the US Govt .
realized it had shot itself in the foot , and actually had to make propaganda films encouraging farmers to grow hemp again ( used in ropes , sales , parachutes , etc . )
In the 1960 's cannabis smoking became popular again , and was a part of the " mind- expansion movement . "
Then in the early 1970's , President Richard Nixon , of Watergate fame , was upset at all the cannabis smoking hippies who also happened to be demonstrating against the Vietnam war .
He wanted to crack down on them , so he commissioned a congressional committee to research cannabis so he could say how " horrible " it was .
Unfortunately for Nixon , the Shafer Commission said they thought cannabis should be legalized .
Nixon tore up the study , and launched the " War On Drugs ! "
Since then the lies , idiocy , and brainwashing persist .
Prisons are making money on the 730,000 folks arrested each year for simple cannabis possession .
Minority members , as usual , bear the brunt of these asinine policies , which to a large measure exist to oppress them .
Since mainstream media supports corporate interests which have no stake in making cannabis legal again , it is very hard to find out the truth , or even have a sensible discussion about it .
Actually , everyone should be very angry about these policies .
Because of this prohibition , promising medical studies were put on hold .
A 1974 study done at the University of Virginia discovered that cannabinoids ( in cannabis ) cause tumors to shrink and cancer cells to die ( while leaving healthy cells alone ) .
The study was not followed up on .
In fact , the Ford , Regan and Bush Administrations stopped all research on cannabis , expect for research meant to prove harm .
For those of you who say " legalizing cannabis sends the wrong message to children " , it can be argued that it is a cop-out .
The truly wrong message is that it is okay for the government to lie !
Concerning any damage to the children of cannabis users , there was a study done in Jamaica in the 1980's that determined that babies born to cannabis users tested better on evaluations at 30 days of age than babies born to non-cannabis users .
When a five year follow - up showed that these cannabis exposed children were doing just a well as children unexposed to cannabis , NIDA defunded the study .
You should also know , that very ill people who use cannabis as medicine are being arrested each day , or live in fear of being arrested .
This is what is truly criminal .
The first marijuana law was a city ordinance in El Paso in 1905 .
The first state law came in California in 1913 , followed by a Utah law in 1914 , followed by about thirty other states by about 1930 .
In California , the law was promoted by the pharmaceutical industry that saw marijuana as competition .
It received little notice .
In Utah , the law was the result of a Mormon religious prohibition .
In the other states , there were two major explanations .
The first was racial prejudice against the Mexican immigrants who used it .
The second was the fear that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana -- exactly the opposite of the modern marijuana gateway myth .
When it was outlawed at the national level in 1937 , it was falsely alleged that marijuana caused insanity , criminality , and death -- particularly within minority groups .
Only two doctors testified before Congress .
One of them was the representative of the American Medical Association .
He said there was no evidence that marijuana was a dangerous drug and , therefore , no reason to make it illegal .
The committee basically told him that if he was n't going to cooperate , he should be quiet and leave .
The only other doctor who testified was Dr. James C. Munch of Temple University .
Dr. Munch 's sole claim to fame was that he had injected some extract of cannabis into the brains of 300 dogs and two of them had died .
When they asked him what he concluded from this , he said he did n't know .
However , he was the only doctor in the US who thought that cannabis should be illegal , so he became the US Official Expert on Marijuana .
He later testified in court , under oath , that marijuana would make your fangs grow six inches long and drip with blood and , when he tried it , it turned him into a bat .
In 1951 , the reasons for the laws changed .
Harry Anslinger , the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , was up before Congress asking for more money to enforce the marijuana laws .
Unfortunately for him , just before he spoke , the head of the Federal addiction research program testified that they knew for certain that all of the reasons given to outlaw marijuana in 1937 were completely wrong .
Anslinger , left with no justification for his request , made up the story that marijuana is the certain stepping stone to heroin .
It has been the official basis of US marijuana policy ever since .
Another explanation is that prohibition has built its own government bureaucracies and industries that support them .
From prisons to sophisticated radar balloons , a huge variety of industries benefit from marijuana prohibition .
It has its own micro-economy supporting it .
Another explanation is the one given by President Nixon 's US National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse , in 1973 .
They said that the real problem is the ignorance of our public officials who have never bothered to read the most basic research .
Another explanation is the holdover effect of Reefer Madness .
The US Government has had a dedicated and deliberate campaign of Reefer Madness since 1930 .
Harry Anslinger once noted that , after the Marihuana Tax Act was passed in 1937 , he went out on a bridge on the Potomac and saw before him a field of cannabis that stretched as far as the eye could see .
He knew that the law would be completely unenforceable on his meager million - dollar budget .
Therefore , he reasoned that the only solution was a campaign of propaganda so horrible that it would scare people away from using it .
The truth was completely irrelevant , and he even made extensive efforts to stomp out opposing opinions .
Unfortunately , that propaganda campaign worked on a lot of people and there are still many people today who believe the tall tales .
More comments :
Also , marijuana will likely never be completely legal because it is easily produced and the government can't tax it properly and make money .
You'd be surprised what people make money off of , such as sick people .
Do n't believe what they tell you , the doctors are paid off by these lobbyists to sell you their drugs , some of which people do n't need , just to make the dollar .
Because most states can make more money annually fining users rather than selling it to them .
Some states , however , like California and Colorado produce it as a cash crop and make more money selling it , which cuts down the " crime " rate .
It depends on the state , but it will always be a federal crime .
Hemp , however , is legal .
Federal law trumps all state law .
The federal govt can enact any laws if the authority derives from the US Constitution .
The US Constitution gives the federal govt the right to control Interstate Commerce .
Based on this clause in the Constitution , the federal government has passed laws regulating drugs .
Marijuana is classified as a drug , and falls under the express regulations of the federal govt .
It is unlawful to possess or distribute marijuana , except in very limited circumstances .
State laws that attempted to ' legalize ' marijuana have been held to be unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court , and are not valid .
Marijuana is illegal since it is perceived addictive and is associated with unfashionable lifestyles .
It is legal to use it as a medicine in some states .

It 's easy to find a list of horror movies to watch for Halloween .
They run the gamut from good to bad to so - bad - it 's - good to funny .
But for parents of pre-teens , it can be hard to find something to watch that 's in the proper Halloween spirit , but wo n't induce a month of nightmares .
There 's always the great Peanuts special It 's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown , which became an annual classic on its first airing 43 years ago .
After you 're done saying " I got a rock " along with the TV , though , you 've still got hours of Halloween night left — and on a Saturday , yet .
So , what to watch if your kids are n't ready for , say , Army of Darkness ?
Here , then , are our top ten movie suggestions to show to younger kids , that we think will be fun for grownups , too .
Many thanks to all those who offered suggestions on Twitter and Facebook !
10 . * Ghostbusters *-
It may seem a bit inappropriate for really little kids , with lines like " Yes , it 's true :
This man has no d–k . "
But older tweens could probably handle it just fine , especially since it has only a few scary moments , and of those the worst is likely when the arms come out of Dana 's chair .
Besides , what kid would n't like seeing people hit with molten marshmallow ?
__9 . The Monster Squad __-
Best described as a family B - movie , it 'll never be considered a great cinematic achievement , but it is a heck of a lot of fun .
It 's also probably a good way to introduce kids to the classic movie monsters : vampires , werewolves , mummies , and even Frankenstein 's monster .
For a 22 - year - old movie , the special effects look remarkably good , and the plot even has some occasional poignant moments amid the jokes .
8. Beetlejuice - Another one possibly more suited to older tweens , but if your younger kids are n't overly squeamish it might be worth a try .
Until the very end , it 's not very scary , and it 's so much fun it 's easy to ignore the occasional rise in the gross - out factor .
7. Cinderella - Yes , Cinderella .
It 's an unconventional choice , but think about it : A fairy , a costume ( nobody recognizes Cinderella at the ball , after all ) and a pumpkin all figure heavily in the film .
You could even make it into a game , seeing who could spot the most Halloween -y things in the movie .
6. E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial -
It 's easy to forget , especially if you have n't seen it in a decade or two , that yes , Halloween is very important in this film * .*
Remember Mike and Elliott dressing E.T. up as a ghost so they could take him out ( they hope ) unnoticed ?
Why not put E.T. on the TV and hand out small bags of Reese 's Pieces to trick - or - treaters ?
5. Corpse Bride -
Not as brilliant as most hoped it would be , coming as it did from the dark , twisted mind of Tim Burton .
But it 's still well worth seeing , with a great voice cast and a terrific Danny Elfman score ( with several songs ) .
And , dealing as it does with a man who accidentally marries a dead woman , it could hardly be better suited to Halloween .
4. The Addams Family - A great , delightfully bizarre movie , and one with jokes aimed at all ages .
It 's ideal for Halloween not just because of the spookily bizarre family , but also because the holiday itself plays a big part in the movie .
" I 'm a homicidal maniac — they look just like everyone else . "
3. Wallace & Gromit : The Curse of the Were - Rabbit - If you have n't yet exposed your kids to the wonderful claymation products of Aardman Studios , there 's no time like Halloween .
This 85 - minute film has terrific voice performances , a very funny story , and , of course , a were - rabbit .
You really can't go wrong .
2. Daffy Duck's Quackbusters -
The old Warner Brothers cartoons had a lot of great stories with monsters ( some wearing tennis shoes ) , witches , vampires , and such .
It can be a bit time - consuming to put together a good compilation yourself , but Quackbusters does a pretty good job of it , tying a bunch of good old stories with two new ( in 1988 , that is ) ones .
These two , " Night of the Living Duck " and " The Duxorcist , " were the last Warner Brothers cartoons voiced by the late , great Mel Blanc , and are very funny , too .
1. The Nightmare Before Christmas - ( You knew it was coming . )
Really , there is no Halloween movie that can come close to this one .
It has a great story , great songs , wonderfully strange visuals , and Prince Humperdinck as the voice of Jack Skellington .
Of course , it 's also a great Christmas movie — what could get a person in the Christmas spirit faster than a rousing chorus of " Kidnap the Sandy Claws ? "
Or is that weird ?
We 're sure you 've got your own favorites , and we had to cut quite a few to get the list to just ten .
Please share your ideas in the comments .
Happy Halloween !
The site ’s home page displays several attractive objects for sale with closing times fast approaching .
It is mesmerizing .
One winning strategy might seem to be this :
Bid at the last second , just before an auction is about to end .
To “ help ” you do so , the site offers an automatic bidding program called a Bid Butler that allows you to make bids in the last 10 seconds .
Alas , others can also use this automatic program , and you soon discover that just as the clock is ticking down and you ’re about to make your big score , a bunch of other Bid Butlers get busy , the price jumps by a few cents , and the clock adds more time .
Items can remain “ in their final seconds ” for days .

What makes this procedure so devilish is that while bidders are looking at what seem to be amazing bargains , the Web site is raking in the money .
Because Swoopo collects 60 cents for each penny bid , its revenue is the selling price multiplied by 60 .
This means that if a computer you covet sells for $ 100 , seemingly a bargain , Swoopo collects $ 6,000 in revenue , a very juicy profit .
Swoopo has even sold cash using this format  specifically , checks for $ 1,000 .
My colleague Emir Kamenica and I looked at 26 such auctions we found in a data set posted on the Swoopo Web site .
For each of these , the average revenue to Swoopo was $ 2,452 .
Winning bidders also did well :
Of the winners , all but two made money even after accounting for the cost of their bids , with an average profit of $ 658 .
Still , the important point to remember is that , collectively , bidders are losing money .
Only the lucky last bidder is a winner .
It ’s no surprise that Swoopo has attracted controversy .
Bloggers have called it “ evil , ” but the company says that its winners save substantially since the winning bids are always well below the retail price of the product and that everyone else gets an exciting experience , which is worth the price of admission .
Frank Han , the North America general manager of Entertainment Shopping , Swoopo ’s parent company in Germany , said , “ The thrill of winning one of the auctions that ends at a very low price is what keeps customers coming back . ”
BIRMINGHAM , Ala . -- Tennessee Volunteers coach Lane Kiffin has been reprimanded by the Southeastern Conference for criticizing officials who worked the Volunteers ' game against Alabama .
For Kiffin , it was the second time this year he has been reprimanded by the league .
SEC commissioner Mike Slive said Kiffin could be suspended if he violates conference rules again .
Kiffin complained Sunday that officials failed to penalize Alabama 's Terrence Cody for unsportsmanlike conduct when the defensive lineman removed and threw his helmet after blocking a field goal on the last play of Alabama 's 12 - 10 victory Saturday .
Kiffin also said he decided to let the clock run down instead of trying to run another play before the kick because he was concerned about the officiating .
" You run another play and you throw an interception or they throw another flag on us -- I was n't going to let the refs lose the game for us there and some magical flag appear , " Kiffin said .
Mississippi State 's Dan Mullen was also reprimanded Monday by the SEC , raising the number of coaches to be scolded by the league for knocking game officiating to three in the past week .
Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson also weighed in on the officiating Monday after he had some questions about calls made in his game against South Carolina last weekend .
Johnson said he'd like to speak with SEC coordinator of officials Rogers Redding .
" I think I 'd have to get in line , " Johnson said .
All this came a week after one SEC crew was suspended after it called penalties that the league said were not support by video evidence in the LSU - Georgia game on Oct. 3 and the Arkansas - Florida game on Oct. 17 .
The day after the suspension was announced by the SEC , Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino was reprimanded for making critical statements about officiating in the Razorbacks ' 23 - 20 loss at Florida .
Kiffin said he expected to be hearing from the SEC about his comments .
" I 'm sure we 'll get one of those letters that really means nothing as Bobby got last week , but Florida and Alabama live on , " he said Sunday .
This reprimand came with a warning from Slive to Kiffin , who was penalized by the league earlier this season after he accused Florida coach Urban Meyer of violating NCAA recruiting rules .
" This is the second reprimand for Coach Kiffin in this calendar year , " Slive said in a statement .
" Coach Kiffin is on notice that for any further violations of SEC policies will subject him to additional penalties including suspension . "
Tennessee spokesman Bud Ford said Kiffin would not comment on the reprimand .
Mullen said Sunday the replay official who worked Mississippi State 's 29 - 19 victory against Florida in Starkville , Miss. , should be disciplined for not overturning an interception return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter by Gators linebacker Dustin Doe , who might have fumbled before reaching the goal line .
" I do n't even know why we have replay right now in the Southeastern Conference if they 're not going to utilize it , " Mullen said .
The replay official listed for the game in Starkville on Saturday night was Dan Dembinski .
" I hope he 's severely punished if he ever works another SEC game again , because I think it 's completely unacceptable , " Mullen said .
The league 's response to the Bulldogs ' request to review the play was to refer to Rule 12 - 1 - 2 in the NCAA football rulebook , which states :
" The instant replay process operates under the fundamental assumption that the ruling on the field is correct .
The replay official may reverse a ruling if and only if the video evidence convinces him beyond all doubt that the ruling was incorrect .
Without such indisputable video evidence , the replay official must allow the ruling to stand . "
The SEC said it would not comment further on the call .
Mississippi State spokesman Joe Galbraith said Mullen would have no comment on the SEC 's actions .
Also Monday , a Pac - 10 official was suspended by the conference for missing a facemask call in the Oregon State - USC game .

For as long as we can remember , Tap Tap Revenge has dominated in Apple 's iTunes App Store , with Tap Tap Revenge 3 currently toping the charts .
Its time may have come .
EA Games , maker of the popular Rock Band game for consoles , may have previously been hush - hush about an official Rock Band iPhone / iPod Touch game , but the silence is over .
EA Mobile is making a splash at CTIA today with the announcement of Rock Band for iPhone .
The application is no joke .
We 've seen it in action and can confirm that is the real deal , with gameplay almost identical to the console version including the ability to play with up to three additional players via Bluetooth .
The Real Deal
Do n't be fooled by impostors , Rock Band for iPhone is legit .
It may have taken a year to build , but the mobile version matches everything you 've come to love about the original , right down to the awesome graphics and the ability to hear mistakes .
Of course , you 're playing on your iPhone , so you 'll use your fingers to tap to the rhythms of four different instruments .
The app comes with 15 songs - familiar tracks from past and present - with 5 additional songs that you can unlock as you complete the World Tour , as well as options to buy more .
The game supports single - player game play , multi-player mode over Bluetooth , and Facebook Connect integration for inviting friends to play .
Just as is the case with the original , Rock Band for iPhone offers four different instruments that you can play : vocals , drums , bass , guitar .
Each option offers a game experience that is unique to each instrument , so you 're playing the actual drum part when you select " drums , " and so on .
Should you sync up with friends and play over Bluetooth , be prepared to be blown away .
The real - time gaming experience is incredible , as yours truly can attest to , and even goes so far as to highlight other players ' activities on your device as they happen .
Olivier Proulx , Senior Producer at EA Mobile , believes that what the Rock Band app really has to offer over competitors is an unmatchable , high - quality music experience .
He also believes the depth of the game is unique , and that it 's " easy to learn , but difficult to master . "
The application launch date is up in the air , as it's subject to Apple 's approval , but EA Mobile says it should be available in a few weeks .
Also undetermined is the price , but we 're pretty sure you can expect to pay for this bad boy .

In a stunning report on Saturday , a British newspaper claimed to have uncovered proof that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — notorious among the international community for denying the holocaust — was actually born a Jew .
According to The Telegraph , a high resolution photograph of Ahmadinejad holding up his Iranian identity card , taken just before the 2008 election , reveals that his family changed its name shortly after he was born , renouncing their Jewish faith and adopting Islam .

“ A close - up of the document reveals he was previously known as Sabourjian – a Jewish name meaning cloth weaver , ” the UK paper reported .
“ The name is even on the list of reserved names for Iranian Jews compiled by Iran ’s Ministry of the Interior , ” noted Israeli publication YNet News .
At the annual Quds Day rally in Tehran last month , the Iranian president reiterated his denial of the holocaust and blasted the Israeli government .
Ali Nourizadeh , with the Center for Arab and Iranian Studies , suggested to The Telegraph that having a Jewish background “ explains a lot ” about one of the key ruling figures of a Muslim nation .
The United States , Britain , France and Germany have all issued statements slamming Ahmadinejad ’s latest outburst dismissing the killing of some six million Jews of occupied Europe by the Nazis during World War II .

“ The very existence of this regime is an insult to the dignity of the people , ” the hardline president said of Israel .
“ They ( the Western powers ) launched the myth of the Holocaust .
They lied , they put on a show and then they support the Jews .
“ The pretext for establishing the Zionist regime is a lie… a lie which relies on an unreliable claim , a mythical claim , and the occupation of Palestine has nothing to do with the Holocaust , ” he added .
“ This claim is corrupt and the pretext is corrupt .
This ( the Israeli ) regime ’s days are numbered and it is on its way to collapse .
This regime is dying . ”
During a televised debate leading up to his disputed reelection , Ahmadinejad was forced to admit his name had been changed , but he did not address the issue further , The Telegraph noted .

Accusations of Ahmadinejad ’s Jewish history have been floating around on the Internet since Mehdi Khazali , the son of Ayatollah Khazali , called for an investigation into his family origins on a blog .
Khazali was later arrested amid protests of Ahmadinejad ’s disputed reelection .

Flying within 228 kilometers of the surface of Mercury on Sept. 29 , the Messenger spacecraft snapped portraits of a portion of the planet that had never before been imaged close up .
Messenger also examined in greater detail Mercury ’s western hemisphere , which had been imaged during a previous passage in October 2008 ( SN Online : 10/29/08 ) .
The Sept. 29 encounter was the third and last flyby and gave the craft the gravitational assistance it needs to settle in March 2011 into a yearlong orbit around Mercury , the solar system ’s innermost and least explored planet .
The first images from the latest encounter , which detail 5 percent of the planet that had n’t been examined by spacecraft before , were released on Sept. 30 and more are expected over the next few days .

My dearest Lady GaGa ,
You stole my heart when you addressed the rumors about your genitalia with a flippant comment : “ Yes I do [ have a dick ] , and it ’s much bigger than yours ! ”
You made me melt when you came out as bisexual in Rolling Stone .
If I was n’t sure of this before , I am now : I am officially in love with you .
Here ’s why :
See you there ,

The woman used the money to cover up unauthorised overdrafts
A German bank employee who secretly transferred money from rich to poor clients has been given a 22 - month suspended prison term .
The 62 - year - old woman , dubbed the ' Robin Hood Banker ' , moved more than $ 11 m ( £ 7 m ) in 117 transfers .
The court in Bonn was told that the employee , who has not been named , took no money for herself .
The bank made a loss of more than $ 1.5 m ( £ 1 m ) when poor customers were unable to pay back unauthorised overdrafts .
The employee was accused of allowing overdrafts for customers who would not normally qualify for them .
Small pension
She then used the money from richer customers to temporarily disguise the loans during the bank 's monthly audit of overdrafts .
The woman has begun reimbursing the bank for the losses , reportedly from a small retirement pension .
She could have faced a four - year prison sentence , but the court decided on leniency as she had confessed immediately and did not profit personally .
The woman was also considered to have suffered enough , through the loss of her job and the requirement that she pay back the lost funds .
It is about time that political communication caught up to medicine by applying modern standards of evidence to its practices .
The practice of medicine has been revolutionised over the last 20 years by the emergence of evidence - based diagnosis and treatment .
The idea behind evidence - based medicine is that doctors should apply the findings of scientific research to medical decision - making .
When you go to the doctor , you do n’t expect to be treated with certain drugs or diagnosed with a certain disease because the doctor thinks it will improve his public image to diagose or treat you that way .
You want the right diagnosis and treatment for your symptoms .
Why should n’t politics in Canada be held to the same standard ?
This is the Internet era .
This is the Information Age .
Canadians must demand that its politicians adopt an evidence - based approach to political communication and political decision - making .
We expect our doctors to present evidence for their diagnoses , but we allow our politicians – of every stripe – to convince us with anecdotal evidence , generalisations from the specific and a hundred other fallacies of argument .
Gerard Kennedy , Official Opposition critic for Infrastructure and MP for Parkdale - High Park and his team of staff and volunteers have been tearing up the spreadsheets coming up with evidence for how the Conservative Government is distributing infrastructure stimulus money around Canada .
His latest press release describes how infrastructure money is being spent unequally , on a per-student basis , on small , conservative institutions based in Conservative - held ridings .
Whether or not you agree with Mr. Kennedy , this is just simply good political communication .
He has taken the facts – the data – and parsed them so that they make sense .
He has used evidence and simple statistics to start a critical discussion about what the Government is doing .
The beauty of Mr. Kennedy ’s evidence is that you * can disagree * with him in an intelligent way .
You can challenge his evidence .
You can produce evidence of your own .
It is no coincidence that Mr. Kennedy has been scooping up news stories and front - pages across Canada with his evidence - based criticism .
He is setting a new bar for political communication – away from anecdotal allusions and personal attacks toward evidence , facts and argument .
This can only be good for Canadian democracy .
The challenge for the other Opposition MPs , Liberal , Bloc and NDP , is to meet and exceed his example .
The challenge for the Conservative Government is to respond with transparency – to show Canadians the evidence for their infrastructure program .
Here is the Government ’s first evidence - based attempt .
Mr. Kennedy is forcing this Government to get away from rhetoric and present Canadians with the evidence .
If medical doctors must use evidence to justify why they have chosen one diagnosis for you instead of another , Canada ’s Government must use evidence to justify how its infrastructure stimulus investment is equitable and good for all Canadians – not just those who live in Conservative - held ridings .

Another unusual animal love story shocks the world .
An 18 - months - old dog and an 8 - weeks - old wolf cub become best friends .
Ulrok , a fully grown Rottweiler was more than happy to become the father figure in young Beldaran ’s life , after the poor baby was rejected by her natural mother .
Kahlani , the wolf who gave birth to this little furry treasure , was too young herself and her maternal instincts did n’t kick in .
Caretakers at the Krisma Preserve , in Mt. Desert , Maine , tried to find another surogate parent for Beldaran , but Ulrok was the only one who accepted the young cub , when she was just four days old .
Now they spend all their time together , playing in the sun , howling at the full moon and even sleeping together .
It ’s nice to see them getting along so well and , no matter how down you are , just one look at them will put a big smile on your face .
But , once Beldaran is old enough to take care of herself , she will be introduced to a pack of wolves , to make sure she grows up to be a wolf and not something else .

Part 1 of analysis
The recent Temple Mount riots and Mahmoud Abbas ’ renewed request for a UN discussion of the Goldstone Report again point to the deep structural failure inherent in the Palestinian political culture .
The Palestinians are proving yet again that even the responsible elements among them cannot act in a constructive manner in order to build society and promote stability , welfare , and an agreement with Israel .
They cannot do it because , as it turned out again , at the moment of truth we see the irresponsible , violent , and demagogical radicals who incite and fan the flames gain the upper hand .
In Agreement Mashaal : Abbas leading us to doom Ali Waked Parallel to Palestinian president 's speech in Ramallah , in which he defended deferral of vote on Goldstone Report , Hamas head in Damascus Khaled Mashaal accuses Abbas of lying , ' taking bribes from the Americans ' Mashaal : Abbas leading us to doom
The decisions are indeed taken by the leaders , but the factors that shape their room for maneuver and forces even the most level - headed among them to adopt irresponsible conduct is a politically immature society .
This society becomes addicted time and again to “ victimization excuses ” regarding its failures , instead of enlisting to the cause of successfully promoting its national enterprise .
For the first time in generations , the Palestinians have seen the rise of leaders who understand , even if partially , the needs of their countrymen and are willing to enlist to the cause of extracting them from the deep distress created by the Palestinians with their own hands .
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad is attempting , for the first time , to utilize the generous foreign aid for constructive aims and build a functioning society .
President Abbas and his people realized ( belatedly ) the gravity of the terror curse and Hamas ’ existential threat .
Under their political patronage , the United States trained Palestinian security forces ( the so - called “ Dayton forces ” ) who are doing well in the fight against terrorism and its infrastructure .
This opened the door for cooperation and security coordination with Israel , allowing for a dramatic improvement in the freedom of movement , economic prosperity , and the creation of a platform for social and political stability in the West Bank .
This was followed by the initial buds of a chance to extract Israel and the Palestinians from the “ Zero- sum game ” characteristics of their relationships , where Palestinian achievements were defined by the level of harm done to Israel .
Should such chance be allowed to develop , it would remove an important obstacle for a more comprehensive agreement that both sides can accept .
Expanding and deepening stability and welfare in the West Bank , while suppressing terrorism in Gaza and isolating the terrorists there – and while disregarding the reckless demands of Arab Israeli leaders – are necessary conditions for the success of such deal .
However , this is where the self - destruction mechanism that has been thwarting the Palestinian people since it was formed almost 90 years ago came into action :
An irresponsible and belligerent minority turns to violence , radical elements promise a zealous public immediate satisfaction via “ victimization demagoguery , ” and this immediately prompts the responsible elements to assume a defensive posture and be neutralized in the political arena .
The essence here is not the violence and demagoguery of the radicals , but rather , the defeatism of the responsible elements .
The problem has to do with Palestinian society ’s political culture .
Had Fayyad and Abbas been able to rely on the support of a responsible public for their constructive policy , they could have isolated the radicals and clung to their path .
However , they give in to the radicals , because the public becomes addicted to the false message of those who brought generations of destruction , distress , and impasse upon them .
Part 2 of analysis to appear Monday night
Dr. Dan Schueftan is the director of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa
With three weeks in the books , we are starting to see some distinctive trends as to who is being targeted by their quarterbacks and who is not .
Let ’s take a look at some of the major storylines coming out of last weekend ’s games and what conclusions we can draw from them :
Steven Jackson led the Rams being targeted 8 times
It speaks volumes about the Rams passing game with Laurent Robinson injured , does n’t it ?
Donnie Avery was second on the team with seven and could emerge as the go to guy on the outside , but the truth of the matter is that Steven Jackson is the team ’s entire offense at this point .
He ’s the only Ram worth having in your starting line - up .
Terrell Owens was targeted 5 times
That put him fourth on the team and led to no catches .
He ’s not going to stay quiet long , is he ?
I ’d expect him to almost force Trent Edwards to throw him the ball in the coming weeks , meaning he could be in store for some big games .
Ray Rice was targeted 7 times
It was second most on the team , behind just Derrick Mason ( 8 ) .
It goes to show that even if he is n’t getting all of the carries ( he had 11 last week while Willis McGahee had 7 ) , he ’s going to be given a chance to contribute in the passing game as well .
That certainly helps keep him valuable , despite McGahee getting the bulk of the scoring chances in the early going .
Vernon Davis was targeted 10 times
After being buried in the Mike Singleton ’s doghouse last season , he clearly has emerged as a significant part of the 49ers offense .
He also could be on the precipice of realizing all that potential we ’ve heard about .
He had 7 catches for 96 yards and 2 TD , giving him 14 catches on the young season .
If he ’s on the waiver wire and you are using anyone outside of the top few tight ends , he ’s worth grabbing .
Randy Moss was targeted 16 times
Does it really surprise you ?
It was only a matter of time before he and Tom Brady got onto the same page .
Justin Gage was targeted 10 times
Despite it leading to just 4 catches for 47 yards , it is nice to see that he is one of the prime options for the Titans .
It ’s the second time in three weeks that he lead the Titans in targets , saying a lot on how he fits into the offense .
Brett Celek was targeted 9 times
Donovan McNabb can just stay away a little longer , right ?
With McNabb injured and Kevin Kolb manning the QB position , Celek has emerged with 16 catches , 208 yards and 1 TD in two games .
Granted , he did have 6 catches and one TD in Week 1 , but these last two weeks have been unbelievably productive .
Michael Sims - Walker was targeted 10 times
Welcome to a major role in the Jaguars offense Mr. Sims - Walker .
He led the way ( Torry Holt & Maurice Jones - Drew each had seven ) and that is something that could continue .
He ’s a must own in all formats if he ’s still sitting available for some reason .
Santana Moss was targeted 14 times
The talk of his downfall may have been slightly overblown , huh ?
He made the most of his opportunities , catching 10 passes for 178 yards and 1 TD .
Obviously , he ’s not going to continue at that type of pace each week but he has a lot more to offer then he showed in the early going .
No Bear receiver was targeted more than 6 times
Jay Cutler does n’t have one elite option , therefore he ’s likely going to continually spread the ball around .
That means any option could have a big week at any time , or could have minimal impact , making it tough to count on any of them .
Mike Wallace was targeted 8 times
That led the way for the Steelers , but with Hines Ward , Santonio Holmes and Heath Miller in the mix , I would n’t expect his big day ( 7 catches for 102 yards ) to come very often .
Eddie Royal was targeted 3 times
Not many looks and not many catches ( 1 reception for 4 yards ) .
He certainly is feeling the absence of Jay Cutler in the first few weeks , catching just 6 passes for 42 yards .
He should get a good rapport with Kyle Orton before long , so if someone is willing to sell him for pennies on the dollar , do not hesitate .
He ’s better than what he ’s shown .
What are your thoughts ?
Which player who was targeted do you think is worth stashing ?
Who do you think is going to continue to be ignored ?

AUCKLAND
The Green Party has been briefed about proposals to restructure the Auckland Council along corporate lines , and place control of Auckland ’s assets in the hands of eight companies , Green Party Local Government Spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today .
Ms Kedgley said she was alarmed at the apparent direction of the plans .
“ Under the proposals , the so - called super - Council would become a hollow shell , ” Ms Kedgley said .
“ All the decisions about key strategic issues , such as transport and water management , would be siphoned off into Council companies , and made behind closed doors by unelected and unaccountable directors .
“ Councillors would have almost no influence or say over the key problems facing Auckland .
“ The whole rationale for the super city was to have democratically elected Councillors who would be able to speak with one voice , and have the power to deal with key strategic issues like transport and water .
“ Now we learn that this was a con .
Instead of being able to speak with one voice , the Council would be fragmented into eight different corporate boards .
And instead of having the power to deal with key strategic issues , Councillors would have almost no power to deal with the major issues facing Auckland , ” Ms Kedgley said .
Ms Kedgley said she had sat on a Council - owned company in Wellington for many years , and had seen first hand how little influence democratically - elected Councillors have over commercially run boards .
“ The boards may report to the Council on a quarterly basis , but all the key decisions will be made by appointed directors on the board , not by the Council .
“ Aucklanders should not be surprised at this turn of events , given the ACT party ’s desire to corporatise and privatise as many Council services as possible and shrink local democracy .
“ Rodney Hide appears to be succeeding in his ambition to gut democracy in Auckland .
Let us hope other Councils will see the writing on the wall and avoid falling into the same trap , ” Ms Kedgley said .
Remember those heady days , circa 1997 , when if you wanted to change the world it seemed you had to be 23 ?
Apparently , they never went away .

Or the lesser known Vitor Lourenco , a 21 - year - old Sao Paulo native who ’s been the designer behind Twitter ’s wild success .

the religious world quakes .
ok , no , not really .
A theologian claims that the God of the Old Testament is just one deity who separated us from writhing , shapeless monsters .
Do n't expect his colleagues or mainstream believers to care much about his treatise .
Now , I ’m sure this will come as a shock to you , but sometimes , editorial decisions in major media outlets are made on the basis of how much controversy they could generate .
This is why the Telegraph eagerly reported theologian Ellen van Wolde ’s conclusion that a single word in the Book of Genesis was translated incorrectly and this seemingly slight oversight makes the God of the Old Testament just a deity rather than the creator of the universe .
Instead of making the heavens and the earth , he simply separated them and the first sentence of the ancient holy text is n’t the beginning of time and space , but is actually just the beginning of the narration which continues ancient storylines revolving around monsters nefariously writhing in dark , primeval waters .
Oh pity the poor deity .
Once the undisputed , omnipotent creator of the cosmos and everything it contains , he ’s being constantly challenged and demoted as of late .
I ’m not just talking about the steady rise in atheists and religious skeptics who are becoming ever more organized and vocal .
Theologians trying to counter the tough questions being asked by prominent doubters have been constantly reducing the scope of God ’s powers .
In the old days , he could intervene in human affairs on a whim , punish the heretics with plagues and disasters , and send prophets .
But his contemporary version has to rely on evolution and astrophysics , hiding behind the laws of nature .
On top of that , the book cataloguing his exploits is no longer supposed to be taken as a literal or authoritative account of ancient history .
The entire first chapter of Genesis becomes just a mangled set of metaphors for the last 13.7 billions years .
As odd as it may seem , Professor van Wolde is n’t so much questioning God ’s powers as joining the ranks of religious scholars who seem to be slowly turning him from the deist Great Architect into Mr. Deity .
And as you may expect , there ’s already an indignant reply from The Telegraph ’s religion editor , George Pitcher , based on a rather bizarre argument that raises more questions than it tries to answer
Genesis is a transcription of ancient Hebrew creation myth .
Calling it a myth does n’t mean that it ’s “ untrue ” ; it means that its truth is contained in the timeless quest to understand transcendental things like God ’s provenance over time and space , the mystery of why something exists in the universe [… ] , human responsibility for stewardship of the planet and the origins of life .
Well , following this line of logic , then we ’d have to say that calling all the myths from ancient Greece , Egypt and Sumer untrue would also be wrong since their truth lies in our ruminations on the world around us .
How does that work ?
It ’s like the Wizard of Oz asking us not to pay attention to the man behind the curtain while we keep working away on solving the big questions .
And what happens when we find answers that contradict what the creation myth says ?
What use does it have if we ’re ignoring it ?
Just to add to the confusion , Pitcher throws in a spirited but meaningless rebuke to everyone who wants to take a stance on the myth ’s value …
Sorry Creationists , it is n’t and was never intended to be a piece of reportage about the first week of the universe .
And , sorry secularists , a mistranslated Hebraic word does n’t mean there is no God.
Good .
Glad to have cleared that up .
Now for the problem of evil …
Besides mixing up atheists who think that the theistic interpretation of the universe is wrong , and secularists who simply want to prevent churches from exerting pressure on governments , he ’s further diluting the value of the very book he wants to defend .
If it ’s useless to creationists who use it as the basis for their attacks on the theory of evolution and modern cosmology , and says nothing certain about the existence of God and what role the deity plays in our lives , shielding it from scrutiny by atheists , why even have it around ?
You ca n’t make any kind of prediction from it .
You ca n’t use it to justify your position .
You ca n’t make any conclusion from it .
What ’s the point of reading it other than taking in translations of ancient religious punditry ?
What will be Pitcher ’s shot at theodicy at this rate ?
Just to say that it does n’t matter ?
by the way , Stupak ’s office is having a bad day .
any attempt to ask a question about the amendment is literally met with screams from the woman answering the phone .
i know , because it just happened to me .
She screamed at me almost as soon as the words " i have a question about the Stupak Amendment " came out of my mouth .
And then she tried to shout me down before hanging up on me , and to be honest , i had n’t even rasied my voice .
So i called back , tried to calm her down , and said that I ’d gotten conflicting information .
she refused to let me speak to a legislative aide , refused to put me through to voicemail , said she was too busy to answer ym question , and encouraged me to call back " after 5:30 ″ , which is of course when the office is closed .
just to give you an idea of what they ’re dealing with , deservedly so , in DC .
Enlarge By Nati Harnik , AP Warren Buffett , CEO of Berkshire Hathaway waves to shareholders prior to the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in May 2 , 2009 .
Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway is buying Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad .
Most investors looking for the " next big thing " seek out whiz - bang investments like alternative energy , lifesaving biotech drugs , handheld Internet devices and , for doomsayers , hard assets like gold .
Railroads , which had their heyday in another era , are rarely mentioned as a must - have investment for those looking to get rich .
So why is Warren Buffett , arguably the world 's most famous and successful investor , betting more than $ 26 billion of his spare cash to acquire all of Texas - based railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe ( BNI ) ?
On Tuesday , Buffett turned heads on Wall Street when he placed his biggest bet of his career on rails — and the battered USA economy , for that matter .
RAILROAD DEAL : Warren Buffett buys Burlington for $ 26.3B WHAT BERKSHIRE SAYS : ' All - in wager on the economic future of the United States '
In promoting the deal , the so - called Oracle of Omaha insisted that the business of moving things like food , sources of energy , autos , agricultural products and other stuff consumed by consumers and businesses will grow during the next 10 , 20 , 30 years .
In an interview with USA TODAY , Buffett stresses that the rail industry is modern indeed .
He trumpets the ability of railroads to move goods from Point A to Point B more efficiently and more environmentally friendly than the fuel - guzzling 18 - wheelers that clog the nation 's already overcrowded highways .
" The rail business is actually in tune with the future , " Buffett says .
" Trains move goods using far less fuel than alternatives . " 470 miles a gallon
In typical Buffett fashion , the shrewd investor has done his homework , and rattles off facts about railroads with the same confidence he displays when talking about price - earnings ratios or how he values businesses .
" Burlington Northern Santa
Fe last year moved , on average , a ton of goods 470 miles on a single gallon of diesel , and society has an enormous interest in using less oil to transport goods , " Buffett says .
Indeed , Buffett very much likes the green component to his rail investment , likening it to an energy - saving play .
" Each train displaces 280 trucks on the road , " Buffett says .
" When it comes to spewing pollutants there is nothing more efficient than trains .
It is very much in line with the future goals of society .
While the railroads wo n't take over the world it is something that is part of the future . "
The deal with Burlington Northern was struck in a super - quick 15 minutes early last week after a meeting with the railroad 's CEO Matthew Rose .
And while it might seem downright scary to commit tens of billions of dollars in such a short time span , Buffett stresses that he finished his research on the company a long time ago .
Prior to the deal , Berkshire Hathaway already owned a nearly 25 % stake in the railroad .
" Buying 100 shares of a stock is like buying a piece of a business , " says Buffett .
" If I do n't know enough about a company to buy the whole business , I do n't know enough to buy 100 shares . "
Winning at the finish line Like all his investments and acquisitions , Buffett says he simply had to decide " if it is a good business , with good management and something that makes good long - term sense . "
On all those points , he concluded the answer was yes .
Buffett says he believes the rail investment will deliver " steady and certain growth " over the coming decades .
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the pace and sustainability of the economic recovery , Buffett says the railroad business is one that will thrive for years once the economy gets back on track .
" We can't predict what will happen year to year , " he says .
" We have a system that works .
It does n't work every day or every week .
The great American economic engine sputters sometimes .
It sputtered at times in the 19th century , the 20th century and now the 21st century .
But when we get to the finish line we win . "
Buffett - watchers said the deal is trademark Buffett :
He bought a company that is easy to understand and that has a trusted and proven management team — and at a price that is likely to generate gains over the long - term .
Though his $ 100 - a- share offer was more than a 30 % premium to Burlington Northern 's close Monday , the stock traded at nearly $ 115 in June 2008 .
When asked what his time horizon was to reap the major benefits of this mega- deal , Buffett replies , " We will hold it ( this investment ) forever . "
Buffett acknowledges that the railroad business is something that he can get his arms around .
Many times in the past he has said that a key to successful investing is to steer clear of investments that are too complicated .
" Railroads are the kinds of things we understand , " he says .
Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker offered further insight into Buffett 's reasoning .
" We think Buffett values railroading for its bulletproof economic moat via nearly irreplaceable rights of way , a predictable business model , economic efficiency , and strong free cash flow despite heavy demand for capital investment , " Schoonmaker says .
Cheerleading the USA
In his statement Tuesday announcing the deal , Buffett said " it 's an all - in wager on the economic future of the United States . "
Back in October 2008 , when the financial implosion was ravaging investor stock portfolios , Buffett wrote an op - ed piece in The New York Times under the headline : " Buy American .
I Am . "
Similarly , in the fall of 2008 , Buffett injected $ 5 billion into banking giant Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and $ 3 billion into General Electric ( GE ) at a time when raising capital in the financial markets was both difficult and expensive .
Investors took to heart Buffett 's latest big bet on America , a cheerleading role he has increasingly played since the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression intensified last year .
" He has gradually and graciously accepted the reality that he is playing a leadership role in the national economic dialogue , " says Lawrence Cunningham , author of How to Think Like Benjamin Graham and Invest Like Warren Buffett .
" He knows that people listen to what he says and copy what he does . "
Adds Jeff Matthews , a hedge fund manager at Ram Partners and author of Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett 's Omaha : " This overshadows anything he has done before .
He is not just doing this deal for the fun of it .
He is doing it to make money in the long run .
And I think that would be reassuring to investors . "
When asked if he felt a responsibility to address the broader issues related to his level of confidence in the U.S. economy , rather than simply address what he thought were the pros of the big rail deal , Buffet responds " We are not doing it to spread a message .
But the very act itself may be a message . "
Indeed , Buffett 's willingness to make a major investment at this point of the recovery cycle could spur other reluctant investors to follow suit , says John Stoltzfus , analyst at Ticonderoga Securities .
" The provenance of Tuesday 's deal by Berkshire , along with its size and profile , " says Stoltzfus , " will also likely serve as a ' Go ' signal to others who may have been waiting in the wings for someone whose judgment they respect to ' jump in the water first . "
For years , Buffett has said he was seeking a big deal , that he was looking for " an elephant , " says Vahan Janjigian , chief investment strategist at Forbes and author of Even Buffett Is n't Perfect : What You Can — and Can't — Learn from the World 's Greatest Investor .
" This is the elephant , " says Janjigian .
" Berkshire Hathaway is so big , you can't move the needle by buying $ 100 million companies . "
Commenting on the size of the deal , his biggest ever — it tops the $ 17.8 billion acquisition of insurer General Re in June 1998 — Buffett says : " Railroads come in big pieces .
And I like sizable deals .
It is much easier to do one $ 34 billion deal than three $ 10 billion deals . "
Buffett , who still has $ 20 billion in cash , says there are other values out there .
But he would n't tip his hand about what he is eyeing .
" Sure there are values out there , but we do n't advertise them , " he says .
Despite data that point to an economic recovery , Buffett says aside from insurance , he has yet to see much improvement in the other businesses he owns , which include furniture stores , ice cream shops and other consumer - related companies .
" Business has n't bounced much , " he says .
" Business has stopped going down " but it has n't shot up either .
" Fear has disappeared , " adds Buffett .
" What we had was as close to a meltdown as you can have .
But that has passed . "
TRACKING THE RECOVERY : Index forecasts moderating growth in early 2010 Despite his reputation as an oracle , Buffett refuses to predict when the economic recovery will kick in and be sustainable .
" We will come out of it , " he says .
" I do n't know when . "

Oh , I hate that headline , do n’t you ?
SEO for dummies .
To me , ‘ dummy ’ means an idiot and I ’m not calling anyone a dummy or an idiot .
A better headline may have been Seo for Newbies .
But I did n’t and do you want to know why ?
For SEO reasons !
According to Google ( and they are only estimates … but they are getting better – see this post : Google Caffeine ) , only 3 people a day search for the term ‘ Seo for newbies ’ but over 100 a day do search for ‘ SEO for dummies ’ .
So do I want the possiblility of only 3 people seeing my blog per day or 100 ?
Most people who work on - line are aware of SEO or Search Engine Optimization or even , Search Engine OptimiSation .
But what is SEO ?
At a very high level , it is the process of optimising your website / blog for the search engines like Google , Bing and Yahoo .
So we do a Google search for ‘ desk top fans ’ for instance , and those sites that have been optimised for that particular search phrase are returned on the first page .
Even though there were over 65 m websites , we only look at the sites on the first page , do n’t we ?
So depending upon how your Google settings have been set - up , that could be just 10 sites per page .
So unless you are on that first page , you will not receive any visitors to your site via the Google search facility .
In fact , it could be if you are not in the top 3 sites , you will not receive any visitors to your site via the Google search facility .
The higher position you are in the more traffic you will receive .
These are the top 10 results inside Google , and the percentage of times that they get clicked **

What Do You Notice About The Clicks ?
It does n’t take much more than a glance to see that the closer we are to the top of the listings , the more potential customers visit our web - site .
Visitors select higher results far more often than they select results below .
So if the search engines were sending out 1,000 visitors per day for a keyword , the # 1 result would receive 421 of them .
But each time you step down that ladder , there ’s a massive drop in the amount of traffic that you get .
Here ’s where ranking matters – big time !
Position # 1 might get 421 visitors …
But position # 2 might only get 119 ( just over 1/4 of the visitors of position # 1 ) ;
Position # 3 would get just 81 visitors ( 1/5th of the visitors of position # 1 ) ;
Position # 6 would receive just 41 visitors per day ( 1/10th of the visitors of position # 1 ) ;
So to step up from position 2 , to position 1 , could result in 3 or 4 times more sales for us .
Or to step from position 6 to 1 could mean we earn TEN TIMES more sales .
So what does SEO stand for ?
Yes , I know it really stands for Search Engine Optimization but get it right and it means more traffic , more visitors and potentially more sales .
So SEO is crucial to your on - line business if you want more traffic and more sales .
And your goal ?
To be in that number one spot for several keyword phrases .
There are numerous tools around that will tell you how often a certain keyword phrase is searched for , like the Google Keyword tool .
But if you do have a little cash , invest in something like Market Samurai , it is by far the easiest and most sophisticated tool available when it comes to keyword research .
So you add the keywords to your website tags and use them in your website titles and descriptions and , of course , your blog titles .
But just as important as keywords is linking .
Google loves your site to be linked to and from other websites and blogs .
And the higher page rank the websites are that link to you , the better .
And Google also gives weight to relevancy as well .
The more relevant the website is linking to yours the better .
I am NOT saying do n’t link for non-relevant sites , it ’s just Google gives more weight to relevant sites ( or so we are to believe ) .
You can read about some of the backlinks I have in place by reading these posts :
Improve page rank with this free backlink love from Google and Digg
How to improve page rank by having a link building campaign
See what I ’ve just done ?
I ’ve linked from one of my blog posts to another .
Google likes that as well .
So when you get a chance , refer to a previous blog post , as long as it is relevant to the current blog post .
Keywords and back - linking is just the start of optimising your website / blog but they are key .
So remember SEO stands for more traffic , more visitors and potentially more sales .
That ’s it , my introduction to seo for dummies .

A Hillsborough County pastor is in legal hot water after faking his own kidnapping so that he could spend more time with his girlfriend .
According to Hillsborough Sheriff ’s deputies , Seventh Day Adventist Church of Reform pastor Wikler Moran - Mora sent his wife a text message saying that he had been kidnapped , but that she should not panic .
He later sent several more texts where he claimed that he was negotiating his release , which was when she called the police .
More than a dozen Hillsborough deputies were involved in the search for the pastor , who was eventually located by tracing his cell phone .
When deputies found him , Moran - Mora allegedly admitted that he had concocted the kidnapping story to spend time with the woman who was in his presence when he was found .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Research examining microscopic marks on the teeth of the " Lucy " species Australopithecus afarensis suggests that the ancient hominid ate a different diet than the tooth enamel , size and shape suggest , say a University of Arkansas researcher and his colleagues .
Peter Ungar , professor of anthropology , will present their findings on Oct. 20 during a presentation at the Royal Society in London , England , as part of a discussion meeting about the first 4 million years of human evolution .
“ The Lucy species is among the first hominids to show thickened enamel and flattened teeth , ” an indication that hard , or abrasive foods such as nuts , seeds and tubers , might be on the menu , Ungar said .
However , the microwear texture analysis indicates that tough objects , such as grass and leaves , dominated Lucy ’s diet .
“ This challenges long - held assumptions and leads us to questions that must be addressed using other techniques , ” Ungar said .
Researchers thought that with the development of thick enamel , robust skulls and large chewing muscles , these species had evolved to eat hard , brittle foods .
However , the microwear texture analysis shows that these individuals were not eating such foods toward the end of their lives .
The researchers used a combination of a scanning confocal microscope , and scale - sensitive fractal analysis to create a microwear texture analysis of the molars from 19 specimens of A. afarensis , the Lucy species , which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago , and three specimens from A. anamensis , which lived between 4.1 and 3.9 million years ago .
They looked at complexity and directionality of wear textures in the teeth they examined .
Since food interacts with teeth , it leaves behind telltale signs that can be measured .
Hard , brittle foods like nuts and seeds tend to lead to more complex tooth profiles , while tough foods like leaves generally lead to more parallel scratches , which corresponds with directionality .
“ The long - held assumption was that with the development of thick enamel , robust skulls and larger chewing muscles marked the beginning of a shift towards hard , brittle foods , such as nuts , seeds and tubers , ” Ungar said .
“ The Lucy species and the species that came before it did not show the predicted trajectory . ”
Next they compared the microwear profiles of these two species with microwear profiles from Paranthropus boisei , known as Nutcracker Man that lived between 2.3 and 1.2 million years ago , P. robustus , which lived between 2 million and 1.5 million years ago , and Australopithecus africanus , which lived between about 3 million and 2.3 million years ago .
They also compared the microwear profiles of the ancient hominids to those of modern - day primates that eat different types of diets .
The researchers discovered that microwear profiles of the three east African species , A. afarensis , A. anamensis and P. boisei , differed substantially from the two south African species , P. robustus and A. africanus , both of which showed evidence of diets consisting of hard and brittle food .
“ There are huge differences in size of skull and shape of teeth between the species in eastern Africa , but not in their microwear , ” Ungar said .
“ This opens a whole new set of questions . ”
Ungar ’s colleagues include Robert S. Scott , assistant professor of anthropology at Rutgers University ; Frederick E. Grine , professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University ; and Mark F. Teaford , professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University .

Big Brother Britain : £ 380 a MINUTE spent on tracking your every click online
Big Brother : Social networking visits will be logged under the massive expansion of state spying
An astonishing £ 380 a minute will be spent on surveillance in a massive expansion of the Big Brother state .
The £ 200 million - a - year sum will give officials access to details of every internet click made by every citizen - on top of the email and telephone records already available .
It is a 1,700 per cent increase on the cost of the current surveillance regime .
Last night LibDem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne described the sum as ' eye - watering ' .
' There is already enough concern at the level of Government snooping , ' he said .
' In an era of tough spending choices , it can not be a justified response to the problems we face as a country to lavish millions of pounds a year on state spying .
' The increase in money spent on tapping phones and emails is all the more baffling when Britain is still one of the few countries not to allow intercept evidence in court , even in terrorist cases . '
State bodies including councils are already making one request every minute to spy on the phone records and email accounts of members of the public .
The number of snooping missions carried out by police , town halls and other government departments has rocketed by 44 per cent in two years to a rate of 1,381 new cases every day .
Ministers say the five - year cost of the existing regime is £ 55.61 million , an average of £ 11 million a year .
This is paid to phone companies and service providers to meet the cost of keeping and providing private information about customers .
The cost of the new system emerged in a series of Parliamentary answers .
It is to cover payments to internet service providers so they can store mountains of information about every customer for a minimum of 12 months , and set up new systems to cope .
The actual content of calls and emails is not be kept - only who they were from or to , when they took place and where they were sent from .
Police , security services and other public authorities can then request access to the data as part of investigations .
Some 653 bodies are currently allowed access , including councils , the Financial Services Authority , the Ambulance Service and fire authorities and prison governors .
The new rules allowing access to internet records will be introduced by Parliament before the end of the year .
They are known as the Intercept Modernisation Programme .
Ministers had originally wanted to store the information on a massive Government - run database , but chose not to because of privacy concerns .
Yesterday Alex Deane , director of campaign group Big Brother Watch , said : ' The Government is preparing to make British people pay through the nose so that they can track our movements online . '
But a Home Office spokesman said the costs involved were entirely separate from those necessary to comply with the European Data Retention Directive , which requires the storage of phone and email records .
' Communications data is crucial to the fight against crime and keeping people safe , ' he added .
' We have made clear that there are no plans to collect and hold the content of everyone 's communications . '
There were 504,073 made last year to intercept email and telephone records under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act .
It was passed ostensibly to fight terrorism .
But it has been used to spy on people suspected of putting their bins out on the wrong day , dropping litter and attempting to cheat school catchment area rules .
I love me some movies , and I will , often at a fault , watch pretty much anything .
However , with all the movies I ’ve seen over my life time , it happens more frequently than I ’d care to admit where I end up finding something unbelievably stupid that would normally get mixed into the story and , consequently , swept under the proverbial rug .
Now , with this particular list , I ’m not going for like historical inaccuracies or misplaced items in period pieces where they did n’t belong , or even actors who could n’t pull off a decent accent for their foreign roles if their very lives depended on it .
No , these are just specific bits of the plots or narratives that , by all intents and purposes , ought to toss a huge monkey wrench into the machine .
More over , they are my opinions and in no particular order , though I have heard a time or two that they can be quite bothersome to others as well .
Read on .
10 A Night at the ‘ Did n’t Happen ’ Museum
For those of you who may have missed this rather silly ride ( and its recent sequel ) featuring Ben Stiller as Larry , a down - on - his - luck dad who desperately needs a job and ends up becoming the night watchman for the local History Museum .
Basically , after midnight , this Tablet of Akmenrah allows the entire joint to suddenly burst to life and roam freely about the grounds .
Now , there ’s no doubt that one has to suspend a certain amount of disbelief in order to fully enjoy this fun little romp , but the fact still stands tall that there is a really nasty and gaping story hole .
Within in the museum there are , as per the norm , displays of people made to LOOK like , say , soldiers , cavemen , explorers , what have you , none of which are actually constructed of any actual bits and pieces of said people .
However , once these facsimiles come to life , they take on the exact attributes and actions of those people !
NO !
Now , I can understand it with the mummy who has the tablet and all the animals , since they are constructed from bones and what not of the creatures , but none of those people were !
How could they possibly know , even after coming to life completely magically , how each of those people acted , sounded , whatever .
This , ladies and gents , bugs me good .
9 Batman ’s Poorly Guarded Villains
For this particular annoyance , I ’ll use the scene from THE DARK NIGHT .
When The Joker is in Arkham , in a specific solitary confinement , well - protected cell , he has , inexplicably , an armed and be -keyed guard .
This makes absolutely no sense to me .
If the prison staff has done their jobs by removing anything someone like The Joker might use to formulate an escape , and chucks his wacky ass into a fortified room , would there really be any need for a guard ?
Especially an armed one with a damn ring of keys swinging low !
The Joker is a manipulative madman with the innate ability to pretty much get anyone to do anything he wants them to do , even prison guards ; imagine his daily conversation to this poor schlub promising him anything just to get him to defect and create a moment for The Joker ’s fleeing .
Rather stupid for a city so chock - full of criminal masterminds and lunatics .
Apparently they ’re on Bruce Wayne ’s pay role , if you get my drift .
And I think you do .
8 King Kong ( or any representative Free- Roaming monster )
King Kong is a humongous ape .
Of this fact there is zero doubt .
Go ahead , look at him .
I ’ll wait .
OK , giant ape , good .
So , he has the requisite bulging arms , stocky legs , primate cranium , and … oh wait , no , I do n’t believe I see them .
Hmm …
No sir , NO PEE PEE !
A damn monkey that fucking enormous would have a unit the size of city bus !
There is no way to hide wedding tackle like that , not even in a thatch of ape fur .
Look at a real gorilla parading around like the macho animal that it invariably is and you can not even kind of miss his bulging hog !
It ’s right fucking there and it ’s swinging like a clock pendulum !
Now , I understand the need to remove the naughty bits back in the thirties when the Kong initially hit the screen , but for the Peter Jackson remake from a few years ago , there surely was n’t anyone shaking their collective heads at the suggestion of an anatomically correct simian .
We can have movies where people are slaughtered in any number of brutal ways , but we ca n’t get a set King Kong ’s balls ?
Weak .
7 Obi Wan is Not a Very Good Jedi
Though there was n’t a whole lot to cheer about in any one of the newest trilogy , there were several ( see : thousands ) of scenes that absolutely drove me up the damn wall .
I will , however , spare you the pages and pages of angry tirades and just focus on one little nagging bit in the third film .
This will take constraint and and willpower , but we ’ll get through it together .
Ok , so there ’s good old Obi Wan and Anakin riding an elevator up to the room in which is held the captive Emperor … whoops , I mean Senator Palpatine ( wow , how they missed that little nugget is akin to not knowing Clark Kent is Superman … but I digress ) .
Well , the lift shudders to an abrupt halt and Anakin , being the bullheaded and incredibly dumb - assed baffoon that he is , cuts a hole in the ceiling and leaps free to see what the hold up is .
Obi Wan turns around and begins a conversation with R2 D2 , naturally , and suddenly , WHAP !
Right behind Obi Wan lands Anakin .
Obi
Wan ignites his light saber and faces his FELLOW JEDI muttering , “ Oh , it ’s you . ” WHAT ?!?!
How the HELL did n’t he know it was Anakin ?
Obi
Wan is one of the galaxy ’s most prevalent Force users and Anakin , well , if he were an old beater car , he’d be leaking his Jedi force oil all over the driveway .
How did Obi Wan not know it was Anakin ?
There is no way !
Anakin had yet to fall so fully to the Dark Side that he ’d begun to hide his being from other Jedis , and even so , he never did that for any reason in the original trilogy .
In fact , that was the reason Obi Wan hid the twins so he would n’t find them with his FORCE POWER .
THIS SUCKS !
6 “ Snakes … Why Did it Have to be SNAKES ?! ”
Everyone loves good old Indy .
I really liked the new film , so there !
Anyway , The Temple of Doom is the second film made , though , chronologically , it ’s the first .
Here we find Indy , his love - interest Willy , and his little side - kick Short Round , traveling to Pankot Palace to retrieve the sacred Shankara Stones .
Once there , they are greeted and welcomed by the eventually - discovered nasties , and given a huge meal as a blessing .
This is one of those scenes where you either cringe at what ’s served , or else you giggle maniacally at the disturbing dishes .
Displayed on the table we see : giant beetles cooked to perfection , eyeball soup , chilled Monkey brains , and , the very part that drives me nutty each and every time I see it : roasted python .
Oh sure , snake is supposed to be quite tasty and healthy so , presumably , roasted would be nice .
Now , this snake is no doubt dead , so , when it ’s cut , AFTER BEING COOKED , out should spill … nothing .
LEAST OF ALL MOVING , LIVING , WRIGGLING BABY SNAKES OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SPECIES !
Yes , yes , each of these movies takes itself far less seriously than you ’d expect , but come on !
This is so obviously right there and they make a huge deal out of the baby snakes that crawl all over the place and right down the fat guy ’s gullet to boot .
So irritating .
5 The Lord of the Do Nothings
Absolutely , without a doubt , one of film history ’s greatest movie sagas , The Lord of the Rings was a massive undertaking from the get go and , since the Tolkein novels were just so stinkin ’ overloaded with pesky imagery and dense dialogue , a wicked tough task to get to the big screen in any incarnation .
Basically , from about the half - way point of Fellowship to three - fourths of the way through King , mother fuckers were WALKING .
The whole idea was for one little , tiny , insignificant Elijah Wood to get a superbly evil ring to the forging lava from whence in came and toss it into the fire .
A LOT of walking .
So , at about the three - quarter point of Fellowship we see the epic wizard duel between Gandalf and Saruman where , finally , Gandalf is soundly beaten and sent to his doom from the top of the tower .
As he regains strength , he is eventually rescued by a giant golden eagle .
Sweet .
Oh , fast - forward to the end of King just after Frodo has cast the ring to its demise , and he and Sam are rescued by , guess what , giant golden Eagles !
WHY THE FUCK DIDN ’T THEY JUST TAKE THE DAMN EAGLES IN THE FIRST PLACE !
I do n’t want to walk a billion miles if I can take a damn car , why would n’t a couple of tiny humans not opt for the ease course of a few giant birds ?
It ’d have made for a far shorter movie , that ’s for damn sure .
4 From the “ Also Did n’t Happen ” Department
Anyone who has ever seen an action film where several cars or some other sort of automobile is involved has seen the eponymous gun - shot - to - the - grill / gas - tank - equals - explosion scene .
Well , sure , it looks cool , but it ’s as stupid as it comes since it just does n’t happen .
There was an episode or two of the Discovery series , MYTHBUSTERS , where the guys prove that this just is not going to happen .
It drives me bonkers when a bunch of cars full of gun-toting loons are screaming down the road when , all of a sudden , a shot flies through the grill into the radiator and causes such a catastrophic malfunction that the car just up and explodes .
The Simpsons has parodied this a ton of times when Hans Moleman ( most often ) just taps a tree with his Buick or rolls slowly into a rock and detonates into shrapnel .
It ’s funny there , it sucks ass on screen .
3 In Outer Space , No One Can See You Explode
Someone ’s space law says that you can’t , realistically , see any geyser of jet fire or laser fire in space since it ’s a vacuum and we ’ve all fired lasers there so we know , Nyah Nyah Nyah !
Fine , sure , let ’s all take that for what it is and assume that you ’re just not going to see this kind of stuff spewing from a space ship .
Sounds good , we ’re all in agreement .
Yet , this little law gets broken each and every time a space epic is made !
Let ’s take Star Wars again , for instance .
Watch the very opening scene of A New Hope and you can clearly see rocket fuel fire plumes from both the Tantive IV and the Star Destroyer !
And it just gets worse from there : every space battle in the saga and you can see fire , lasers , erupting explosions … you name it .
Yes , this makes for a far more dramatic film that would really be lousy without it , but something that ’s supposed to be so dramatic like , say , 2010 , has not excuse .
It aint gonna happen , fools !
2 From the “ They Do n’t Live ANYWHERE Near Each Other ” Department
L. Frank Baum ’s classic children ’s book was made into one of the most beloved movies of all time in the 1930 ’s and has been a classic staple for family viewing ever sense .
We all love the timeless tale of Dorothy Gale making her way through the land of Oz as she gathers together her team of misfits to head to the Wizard who will , without a doubt , send her homesick ass home to Kansas .
Yes , this whole thing is a fantasy and is purely a tale of childlike wonderment .
Fine , we all know that .
That being said , there is no need for the chanting of the following annoying mantra : “ Lions and tigers and bears , Oh MY ! ”
Now , maybe it ’s because it ’s
Oz that all three of these creatures that normally do not exist anywhere near each other are able , a la Noah ’s Ark , to cozy up together , that this fear trilogy can even be slightly realistic .
Or , perhaps it ’s just the three nastiest animals the crew could come up with to compare to the boogey monsters they were psyching themselves to butting up with in the forest .
Whatever the case , it ’s stupid and it bugs me to no end every time .
1 Home Alone 5 : Everyone ’s Dead
The Home Alone stories based around a child being left somewhere are bad enough in the abuse category without having to toss in even more unrealistic bull shit in the mix .
In parts 1 and 2 we see Kevin McCallister left at both home and abroad ( NY ) facing two villains down ( Harry and Marv ) with an arsenal of items at his disposal designed to burn , clobber , trip , and otherwise maim his assailants .
Each and every one of these particular deadly weapons would , at any given moment , KILL ONE OF THEM !
For fuck sake , he chucks bricks , paint cans , concrete pillars , tools , you name it all on the heads of the hapless nasties and not one does more than slightly bruise or dent them !
HELL NO !
A falling presumably full pain can is heavy !
Drop that shit from a second story right into the face of a guy and that poor bastard is done for life !
Then in part 3 , the kid wallops his would - be captors with a FUCKING BARBELL loaded with at least 30 to 50 pounds of weight directly on top of two guy ’s heads …
FROM THE DAMN ROOF !
That , sir , is instant death .
As funny as these actions are and as far as they take the humor level , these kids would be facing sorrowful family members on murder charges .
I cry BULL SHIT !
In his latest report , ultra - gloomy SocGen analyst Albert Edwards warns of a trade war in 2010 , especially if his views of a synchronized global downturn comes to pass .
I think the next 18 months will see major ructions in the financial markets .
The consequences
of a double - dip back into recession next year require some lateral thinking .
If the carry trade
unwind results in a turbo - charged dollar , any collapse in the China economic bubble will be
doubly destructive to commodity prices .
A surging dollar , coupled with China moving into
sustained trade deficit through 2010 , could prompt the Chinese authorities to acquiesce to US
pressure for a more flexible exchange rate .
But why does no - one expect a yuan devaluation ?
Investors seem to have spotted that the global economic cycle may be on the wane .
The
ECRI leading indictor for US activity has now slid for five weeks in a row .
Recent data such
as the slumping October US housing starts are causing very valid jitters of what will occur
as the turbo - charged fiscal stimulus now starts to abate .
-- Having been in Asia for the last two weeks on business my thoughts turned to China .
President Obama 's recent visit there re-opened some uncomfortable issues about
increasing trade frictions in the context of a Chinese currency which most commentators
believe to be hugely undervalued and the US authorities believe to be " manipulated . "
--
If we do indeed see the sort of unexpected 2010 synchronised global downturn I
-- envisage , geo-political tensions are likely to increase sharply .
And with trade barriers
already beginning to be erected in a recovery , investors should be really concerned about
what might unfold in any renewed global recession .
Aggressive competitive devaluation and
a proliferation of trade barriers would become an increasing prospect in 2010 .
-- I show below one of my favourite charts of what world trade did in the 1930's .
Politicians
reassure us that they have learnt the lessons from that period .
Unfortunately , all I see are
more and more protectionist measures being implemented , belying the soothing rhetoric .
Edwards also makes some interesting comments about China :
Our Asian Economist Glenn Maguire has been very right on China this year .
I was chatting to
him on my recent visit to the region and he re-emphasised his call that China will be heading
into trade DEFICIT (! ) throughout 2010 .
This is a mega - call and will have major
implications for the global financial markets .
First and most obviously is that China will not
be accumulating FX reserves at anywhere near its recent pace .
This has implications not just
for US treasuries etc. , but also for the pace of Chinese growth itself , as the rise in reserves has
previously been a major stimulus to domestic monetary growth and activity ( see chart below ) .
Today , it is not difficult to find all kinds of watches with LED displays .
After [ Paul ] ’s grandfather , a master horologist and pocket watch collector , passed away , he decided to retrofit a broken watch left to him with a custom LED face .
Starting from scratch , he designed a PCB complete with 133 ( hand soldered ) LEDs , room for a temperature controlled oscillator for real time clock capabilites , a LiPo battery , and a cell phone vibrator to provide a simulated “ second hand tick ” feeling .
The whole watch is powered by a PIC 16F946 .
This is currently version 1 , and he has already begun work on version 2 .
He plans on adding a more compact , lower power TCXO , automatic NTP syncing , and a USB port for charging and reprogramming .
He has a number of detailed videos , and we have a demo video after the break .
Are you old enough to own a spoon ?
Woman asked for ID when buying teaspoons in Tesco
A shopper was asked for proof of age when she tried to buy a packet of teaspoons from a supermarket .
Emma Sheppard was forbidden to buy the cutlery unless she showed identification to a shop assistant at her local Tesco .
Till operators at the store in Evesham , Worcs , would n't sell the pack of five teaspoons on Monday night as part of their ' Think 25 ' scheme , which demands ID from people who look under 25 when buying certain goods .
Stunned : Emma Sheppard was n't carrying ID when she was challenged in Tesco as she did n't think she would need to prove her age to buy spoons
Emma , 21 , from Malvern , had spend around £ 70 on a food shop with her partner John , 20 , when the female checkout assistant asked her for identification , before holding up the offending teaspoons .
Emma , a housewife , said : ' When the assistant asked me for ID I thought John had sneakily put some booze in the trolley , but then when she held up a pack of spoons we looked at her like she was an idiot .
' We were both a bit taken aback really - what are you going to do with a packet of spoons that means you need ID to buy them ?
In this crazy world we live in , you have to be over 18 to buy teaspoons it seems .
' I'm 21 , I would have understood the need to ID me if it was alcohol , but it was n't .
It was teaspoons I need to stir my cup of coffee in the morning .
' I did n't have my ID on me as I was only doing my weekly food shop and was not buying any alcohol .
We could n't get the spoons in the end , and I rather angrily threw my shopping in the trolley , breaking my eggs .
' I felt like saying " excuse me while I go on a mad rampage around Evesham with teaspoons " ' .
Tesco sell teaspoons for as little as 57 p for their ' Value ' pack of five .
A Tesco spokesperson said : ' Some utensils , such as knifes , will carry a ' Think 25 ' alert when scanned through the checkout .
There is an element of common sense involved and this was a mistake , for which we are sorry . '

When the CDC / HHS determined that they would have to start producing a H1N1 vaccine there was a rather considerable cover - up as to the actual number of influenza infection that were breaking out , and both state and federal authorities started actually classifying the actual numbers of the confirmed cases in the name of political expediency , with no priority for public health .
At around the same time the CDC and FDA started talking about granting " authorization " for " " new and untested drugs , based on a Presidential Declaration of Emergency " .
So here we are six months after the H1N1 outbreak starts , and six months after the CDC / HHS and FDA buttered up the medical community about a new and untested vaccine that would be coming out right around now so that immunizations could begin prior to Thanksgiving .
The CDC claims that the States now have million of doses that they can deploy , but everything seems to have gotten stuck on hold as it were , until the President made the Emergency Declaration on Friday based on a classified briefing he was given on Thursday of last week .
It is good that we have a vaccine , it is just too bad that we do not have enough to go around ( hey , it sucks to be you ) .
Those people who do take the vaccine are likely to get a dose that has squalene , but the side effects ( pain and misery ) from the adjuvant are far less then actually getting deathly sick from the H1N1 virus ..
The sad thing is that the government has been lying to the public since the very first day of this infection , and very little of what they have told the public has been truthful .
The military has taken a serious thrashing over the years for their use of squalene in " classified vaccines " , so you can find out quite a bit about the use of squalene and other vaccine adjuvants in the various web - sites the military has set up to explain their position .
The use of adjuvants come from a profound lack of preparedness by the government , and most certainly from the public .
They are used when you really do not have enough of a vaccine to go around , go you add a chemical to the vaccine to trick the immune system of the person to whom you are giving the vaccine to .
Consider it to be a type of virological " Hamburger Helper " , so that they can take when they have and squeeze more doses out of a medication that is massively diluted ... possibly to the point where the vaccine is of little or no value .
All things being considered this weak response is the results of extremely poor planning on the part of the government .
They have had 8 months to prepare , and they should have had the first few million doses out and into the hands of the medical specialists by late May 2009 at the latest .
It is one thing for them to not be prepared for this situation , but it is completely unforgivable that they have been lying to the public and needlessly endangering the public for the past 6 + months .
The only reason that H1N1 infections numbers are exploding right now is simply because school is back in session , and this illness is rampantly spreading through the populations of the children and young adults right now .
I have been saying for months that the U.S. Government should have stop school restarting until after they had the vaccine , and it was widely distributed , and those of of greatest risk of getting deathly ill from it not allowed to go back to school until the vaccine had a few weeks to come up to full effectiveness in their systems ( several weeks after taking the vaccine )
The CDC has been lying to the public by at least a 25:1 ratio , so that when they say that there has been only 40,000 cases , there really was an. actual 1,000,000 + cases .
When they say that only 1000 children have died ... there really was closer to 25,000 or more .
It will be important for anybody who takes the H1N1 vaccine to get a copy of the sheet that is supposed to be given out with each shot , and to compare the writing on the vial to what is on the piece of paper you are given ( do not be surpised if they do not match ) .
Then ask the person who is giving it to you about it the vaccine has any Squalene of not , if they do not know then find someplace else to get the vaccine ( most medical people just give the medication , very few actually have any idea what the medication actually is ) .
Pay attention to the batch codes or lot numbers , and get it put into writing exactly what you were given .
I have attached a snapshot of one of the military pages where there is a whole bunch of tap dancing by the military about the use of Squalene adjuvants , along with a long list of references and sources .
Liquid chromatography , and a small group of scientists who express vaccine from the injection sites of recently immunized patients will have some interesting announcements in a few weeks after the vaccine is " available " and in wide spread use .
The interesting thing about the use of an unapproved , and untested drugs and vaccines is that if the President makes an Emergency Declaration , then the companies who sold the vaccine to the government , and the people , hospitals , and agencies who give it can never be sued or held responsible is even the slightest way , even if it kills thousand of people .
It is the ultimate " get out of jail free " card for the pharmaceutical companies .

The Facts on Squalene 1 ) Executive Summary A few people claim the Department of Defense ( DoD ) added squalene to anthrax vaccine to stretch the vaccine supply .
Four civilian panels have looked into these allegations since 1999 and repeatedly found them groundless .
Neither DoD nor anybody else added squalene to anthrax vaccine for our troops .
DoD does not conduct illegal experiments .
Details and links to independent sources of data appear below .
2 ) What is squalene ?
Squalene is a naturally occurring substance found in plants , animals , and humans .
Squalene is manufactured in the liver of every human body and circulates in our bloodstreams .
Squalene is present in the oil left by human fingerprints ( Asano et al , 2002 ) .
Humans cannot live without squalene , because we use squalene as an essential building block to make hormones and other substances in our bodies .
Squalene is also found in a variety of foods ( for example : eggs , olive oil ( 0.7 % ) , cookies , yeast , meat ) , cosmetics ( for example : eye makeup , lipstick , baby powder ) , over - the - counter medications , and health supplements .
Squalene in olive oil may contribute to the low cholesterol levels of people who consume Mediterranean - style diets ( Smith , 2000 ) .
People can purchase squalene at health food stores .
It is more commonly known as  shark liver oil . 
3 ) Does the anthrax vaccine use squalene as an adjuvant ?
No , the adjuvant in the anthrax vaccine is aluminum hydroxide .
An adjuvant is a substance to improve the bodys immune response to a vaccine ( Vogel et al , 1998 ; Burdin et al , 2004 ) .
4 ) Does the anthrax vaccine contain squalene ?
Maybe .
Some lab tests come up positive for squalene .
Because of the difficulty of removing squalene - containing fingerprint oils from laboratory glassware , it is hard to know whether the squalene is truly present in some lots of the vaccine or is introduced by the testing process itself .
DoD , the Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) , and several civilian advisory committees agree that squalene at such low levels has no adverse health consequences .
In September 2000 , DoD became aware of FDA test results finding trace amounts of squalene in three out of three US vaccines tested : tetanus , diphtheria , and anthrax .
The level of squalene identified by the FDA test is so minute that it is likely the result of squalene in the oil of a fingerprint not completely cleaned from lab glassware .
It is hard to completely remove fingerprint oils from glassware .
Before they go looking for squalene , lab workers have to use a chemical solvent such as hexane to completely remove their own fingerprint oils from lab glassware .
When lab workers intentionally tested an extract of fingerprint oil , the squalene reading went off the chart .
Before the FDA test results became known , Stanford Research International ( SRI ) , under DoD contract , looked for squalene in anthrax vaccine .
At the limit of detection of its test , 140 parts per billion , SRI found no squalene in several lots of anthrax vaccine .
The FDAs test , which was developed later , is more sensitive .
It is able to detect as little as 10 parts per billion .
The FDA found squalene at 10 to 83 parts per billion in diphtheria toxoid , tetanus toxoid , and anthrax vaccine .
The trace level of squalene found by the FDA in anthrax vaccine is less than the concentration naturally present in human blood ( 250 parts per billion ) ( Miettinen , 1982 ; Nikkila et al , 1992 ) .
After the FDA reported its results , DoD asked SRI to refine its assay .
Using an improved method that could detect as little as 1 part per billion , SRI found no squalene in 32 out of 33 lots of anthrax vaccine tested ( including lots in which FDA found low levels of squalene ) .
In one lot , they found up to 9 parts per billion .
The details appear below .
5 ) Should we be concerned about the presence of trace quantities of squalene in tetanus , diphtheria , and anthrax vaccines ?
No .
The trace level of squalene found by the FDA and SRI in diphtheria , tetanus , and anthrax vaccines is well below the concentration naturally present in human blood ( 250 parts per billion ) .
Injecting trace amounts of squalene are unlikely to have any biological effect , given that it is already present in the body .
In fact , without squalene in the body to manufacture hormones and other substances in our bodies , we would die .
In Congressional testimony on 3 October 2000 , FDA official Mark Elengold said that the trace quantities of squalene detected were both naturally occurring and safe . "
6 ) Can squalene cause harm ?
Some animal research to study arthritis used injections of tuberculosis - like bacteria ( mycobacteria ) dissolved in squalene ( e.g. , arthritis - prone rats , mice ) .
Other studies assessed 100 % squalene injected into rat tails or injected directly into joints .
( Yoshino & Yoshino , 1994 ; Lorentzen , 1999 ; Kuroda et al , 2004 )
The relevance of findings in susceptible animal species to humans is unclear ( IOM / Sox , 1999 ; Kuroda et al , 2004 ) .
Based on other research , it is clear that whether squalene causes harm or not is related to selected conditions of concentration , dose , route of application , and other factors ( Benisek et al , 2004 ) .
7 ) If you wanted to use squalene as an adjuvant , what form would it take ?
If you wanted to use squalene as an adjuvant ( to boost immune responses ) you would have to multiply the amount of squalene found by the FDA about 1 million times , as well as change it from a simple liquid ( its natural state ) to an emulsion .
An emulsion is a stable suspension of tiny droplets , like an oil - and - vinegar mixture that doesnt separate .
This double difference is like the difference between a teaspoon of oil and 2,000 pounds of mayonnaise .
[ If you emulsify oil with eggs , you get mayonnaise . ]
Squalene in the form of an emulsion ( emulsified squalene , such as an adjuvant called MF59 ) has been added as an adjuvant to some investigational vaccines in the U.S. ( Burdin et al. , 2004 ) There is no squalene adjuvant in any US - licensed vaccine .
Whatever the arguments for or against squalene as a vaccine adjuvant , the fact is that none of the anthrax vaccine administered to U.S. troops contained squalene as an adjuvant .
Based on manufacturing records , FDA can verify that no squalene was added to any vaccine formulation used during the Gulf War .
This includes the anthrax vaccine .
To date , the FDA has licensed , and US manufacturers have used , only aluminum salts ( for example , aluminum hydroxide , aluminum phosphate , aluminum potassium sulfate ) as adjuvants .
8 ) What do we know about the European influenza vaccine that uses MF59 ( an adjuvant containing squalene ) .
In 1997 , European health agencies approved emulsified squalene ( with influenza virus in the center of each droplet ) for use as an adjuvant in an influenza vaccine ( Fluad , Chiron Corporation , Marburg , Germany , and Siena , Italy , http://www.forumimpfen.de/impfnavigator/packungsbeilage/5205fluad.pdf; Sesardic & Dobbelaer , 2004 ) .
Some clinicians consider influenza vaccine with MF59 adjuvant to be better able to induce immunity in elderly people ( Banzhoff et al , 2003 ) .
To make this influenza vaccine work , researchers needed a squalene concentration of 1.95 % ( about 2 parts per hundred or 20 million parts per billion ) to boost the immune response .
This squalene had to be in the form of an emulsion ( a mixture of tiny droplets ) to be recognized by the immune system .
Squalene in its oily state is naturally present inside the human body .
Tens of millions of doses of this European influenza vaccine have been administered safely since 1997 .
9 ) What testing has been done ?
Three sets of US tests have been performed : Initial tests by SRI , tests by FDA , and improved tests by SRI .
Each is described below .
10 ) What did SRI find the first time ?
To determine whether squalene was present in anthrax vaccine , the DoD contracted with an independent civilian laboratory , Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) International of Menlo Park , California www.sri.com, to test for the presence of squalene in anthrax vaccine .
SRI developed a laboratory method to detect squalene as dilute as 140 parts per billion ( ppb ) .
At this level of detection , extraordinary measures must be taken to avoid contaminating samples , glassware , and equipment with squalene from the skin , because squalene is a natural component of the oils in our skin .
The SRI test used a technique called high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ultraviolet detection at a wavelength of 203 nanometers .
SRI tested 17 lots of anthrax vaccine : FAV008 , FAV017 , FAV019 , FAV020 , FAV024 , FAV030 , FAV031 , FAV033 , FAV034 , FAV036 , FAV037 , FAV038 , FAV041 , FAV043 , FAV044 , FAV047 , and FAV048B .
SRI reported " based on triplicate analysis , no squalene was detected in the sample .
The limit of detection is 70 nanograms per 0.5 milliliter dose ( 140 ppb ) . "

12 ) What did the FDA find ?
Using a more sensitive test , developed after the initial SRI test , the Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) found trace amounts of squalene in three out of three US vaccines tested in Jun 1999 : diphtheria toxoid , tetanus toxoid , and anthrax vaccine ( http://www.vaccines.mil/documents/library/Squalene1.pdf).
The FDA test used a technique called gas chromatography with flame - ionization detection .
The FDA method could detect squalene as dilute as 10 parts per billion ( ppb ) .
Testing five lots of anthrax vaccine and two lots each of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines , FDA concluded , " there were only trace amounts of squalene in the lots tested . "
Based on manufacturing records , FDA verified that no squalene was added to any vaccine formulation used during the Gulf War .
The amounts of squalene identified in the specific lots were : Anthrax lot FAV020 11.3 ppb Anthrax lot FAV030 10.1 ppb Anthrax lot FAV038 27.1 ppb Anthrax lot FAV043 40.0 ppb Anthrax lot FAV047 82.9 ppb Diphtheria lot 3710 22.5 ppb Tetanus lot 7271 28.7 ppb Squalene is constantly present in the human blood stream at 250 ppb ( 250 nanograms per milliliter ) , a concentration 3 to 25 times higher than the level detected in the FDA test .
The amount of squalene added as an adjuvant to a European - approved influenza vaccine is 4 grams per 100 ml ( 4 parts per hundred ) , which is about 1,000,000 times more than the concentration of squalene detected in the FDA test .
This European influenza vaccine has been administered safely to hundreds of thousands of people .
13 ) What did SRI find after it revised its test procedures ?
After the FDA released its findings in September 2000 , SRI revised its squalene test , lowering its limit of detection of 1 ppb or 0.5 nanograms per 0.5 ml .
With this more sensitive test , SRI found no squalene in 32 out of 33 lots tested .
SRI found squalene in each of three vials of lot FAV008 , at 1 , 7 , and 9 ppb .
SRI found no squalene in lots 12 , 13 , 18 , FAV001 , FAV002 , FAV003 , FAV004 , FAV005 , FAV006 , FAV007 , FAV009 , FAV012 , FAV016 , FAV017 , FAV018 , FAV019 , FAV020 , FAV022 , FAV024 , FAV030 , FAV031 , FAV032 , FAV033 , FAV034 , FAV036 , FAV037 , FAV038 , FAV041 , FAV043 , FAV044 , FAV047 , and FAV048B .
SRI also tested some non-vaccine injectable pharmaceuticals .
SRI found no squalene in human insulin regular U - 100 , human insulin isophane ( NPH ) U - 100 , lidocaine 2 % solution , sodium chloride 0.9 % solution , or potassium chloride 2 mEq / ml solution .
14 ) Did DoD mislead or lie to anybody about the squalene tests conducted by SRI ?
No .
DoD truthfully and fully reported its findings at each step since May 1999 , when SRI first developed its squalene test .
DoD did not know of FDAs findings until they were publicly released .
At the initial limit of detection of its test , 140 parts per billion , SRI found no squalene in anthrax vaccine ( Spanggord et al. , 2002 ) .
It was scientifically proper to say no squalene was found to the limit of detection of the assay ,  which DoD officials sometimes oversimplified to say  there is no squalene present .
15 ) Has anyone , anywhere found squalene added as an adjuvant to any US - licensed vaccine ?
No 16 ) Where did the squalene FDA found in its anthrax vaccine tests come from ?
The most likely source of the trace squalene in the FDA tests is the result of squalene in the oil of a fingerprint not cleaned from lab glassware .
Squalene is not added to anthrax vaccine or any US - licensed vaccine .
It is hard to completely remove fingerprint oils from glassware .
Lab workers have to use a chemical solvent such as hexane to completely remove fingerprint oils from lab glassware .
17 ) What did the U.S. Senate say about squalene ?
In its investigations of illnesses among Gulf War veterans , the Senate Special Investigations Unit ( SIU ) found no credible information indicating that vaccines used during the Gulf War contained squalene ( 1998 , page 123 ) http://veterans.senate.gov/Reports/chapt3.pdf
( chapter 3 , page 23 of 55 ) In its report , the SIU stated that according to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , squalene can be contained in a vaccine due to two different processes : 1 ) as an adjuvant , which is an agent to enhance the immune response ; or 2 ) in minute quantities in certain vaccines manufactured using eggs , since eggs are rich in squalene and cholesterol .
The FDA verified that none of the vaccines used during the Gulf War contained squalene as an adjuvant .
18 ) Did the British government test its anthrax vaccine for squalene ?
Yes ,
The United Kingdoms Ministry of Defence arranged for an independent laboratory to test 11 lots of the British anthrax vaccine manufactured at Porton Down , as well as other vaccines .
No squalene was detected in those lots of vaccine , with a limit of detection of 0.1 microgram / ml ( 100 parts per billion ) .
19 ) What are the claims about anti-squalene antibodies ?
In an effort to explain the health problems of some Gulf War veterans , a few people have theorized that a vaccine adjuvant may have caused an autoimmune disease in veterans .
A Vanity Fair article by Gary Matsumoto , " The Pentagons Toxic Secret " ( May 1999 ) , alleges that the DoD possibly used " an illicit and secret anthrax vaccine " on its own soldiers .
The writers interpretation and presentation of the facts regarding the Departments use of anthrax vaccine are speculative , inflammatory , and wrong .
His allegations and the reported " clinical evidence " are not new .
Since 1997 , reports in the Washington Times , its magazine Insight on the News , and the ( Wilmington ) Delaware News Journal , have made similar allegations regarding secret medical experiments  and the like .
Investigators cited in these articles ( Pamela Asa , Ph.D. , Memphis , TN , and Robert Garry , Ph.D. , Tulane University School of Medicine , New Orleans , LA ) report they developed in 1997 and patented a test for anti-squalene antibodies ( ASA ) .
Autoimmune Technologies , LLC , of New Orleans , has an exclusive license on the use of this test .
The investigators report that they detected anti-squalene antibodies in the blood of ill Gulf War veterans .
Their methods were published in the February 2000 and August 2002 issues of the journal Experimental and Molecular Pathology .
In the February 2000 article , the authors themselves conclude : " It is important to note that our laboratory - based investigations do not establish that squalene was added as adjuvant to any vaccine used in military or other personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War era . "
Asa and colleagues published a second article in the August 2002 issue of Experimental and Molecular Pathology , but it also provides no validation of the original assay .
As a result , the findings of the second article are also in question .
The authors ' comment that the Matyas article of Nov 2000 supports their findings is mistaken .
20 ) Have any independent panels evaluated the claims of researchers to find anti-squalene antibodies in the blood of ill Gulf War veterans ?
Yes , four independent civilian panels considered the February 2000 article by Asa and colleagues and other allegations related to squalene and anti-squalene antibodies .
When the Institute of Medicine ( part of the National Academy of Sciences ) Committee on Gulf War and Health ( the  Sox committee ) evaluated the 2000 Asa claims of anti-squalene antibodies in the blood of ill Gulf War veterans , it concluded that the paper contains shortcomings , some serious , that combine to invalidate the authors conclusions .
The report says : " The committee does not regard this study as providing evidence that the investigators have successfully measured antibodies to squalene . "
See http://www.nap.edu/books/030907178X/html, pages 311-312 .
The civilian experts on the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board ( AFEB ) said in July 2000 , " the research reported in this paper does not support this claim ; it remains unclear if the assay actually measures antibodies to squalene , as the authors assert " http://www.ha.osd.mil/afeb/reports/squalene.pdf
Regarding assertations that Service Members who received anthrax vaccination from the five lots cited in the FDA squalene tests experienced more or more severe adverse events after vaccination , the civilian physicians on the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee ( AVEC ) evaluated adverse events by lot and geographic location .
They found no meaningful differences based on lot or on geographic location .
( Sever et al .
2002 http://www.vaccines.mil/documents/library/AVEC_ms.pdf, especially pages 198-200 , and Sever et al , 2004 http://www.vaccines.mil/documents/library/SeverArticle.pdf, especially pages 13 - 15 )
Of note , the five lots cited in the FDA squalene tests were shipped to multiple DoD installations .
In addition , Dover AFB received lots other than the five lots mentioned above .
After the comprehensive review of anthrax vaccine safety by the National Academy of Sciences ( the  Strom committee ,  March 2002 , www.nap.edu/catalog/10310.html), which included hearing from personnel from Dover AFB and elsewhere concerned that they suffered adverse events after anthrax vaccination , the civilian physicians and scientists concluded that  The [ SRI ] study report , dated August 14 , 2001 , found that 1 lot of over 30 lots tested contained measurable levels of squalene .
Three samples from that lot [ FAV008 ] contained squalene at 7 , 9 , and approximately 1 parts per billion , respectively .
Use of vaccine from that lot has not been associated with elevated rates of adverse events .
Because the available data ... demonstrate that the presence of trace amounts of squalene is not associated with an increase in the rates of adverse events following vaccination with AVA , the committee concludes that further investigation of possible AVA contamination is not warranted at this time . 
21 ) Are these panels really independent ?
The IOM committee members were selected by the National Academy of Sciences to be fully independent of both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs .
The AVEC committee members were selected by the Department of Health & Human Services to be fully independent of the Department of Defense .
The DHB is appointed by the Secretary of the Army to advise the Surgeons General of the military Services .
These civilians constitute a highly accomplished and widely respected scientific advisory board .
These civilians are free to render whatever opinions they wish , and their candidness is important to ensuring that DoD is using the best possible medical information .
22 ) What did the GAO say about squalene testing and what are DoD researchers doing ?
In March 1999 , the U.S. General Accounting Office ( GAO , now the Government Accountability Office ) released a report " Gulf War Illnesses : Questions about the Presence of Squalene Antibodies in Veterans Can be Resolved " ( GAO / NSIAD - 99 - 5 ) .
The Department of Defense disagreed with the GAOs opinion that " the first step is to determine the extent to which they [ antibodies to squalene ] are present in a larger group of sick Gulf War-era veterans . "
The proper first step is to show that the test for squalene antibodies measures what it claims to measure .
Further , the medical significance and the origin of antibodies to squalene , even if their existence is corroborated , remain unknown .
Without such information , Gulf
War veterans get only speculation about the meaning of the test result and its implication for their health .
Gulf
War veterans deserve objective evidence and recommendations based on sound science .
To investigate the anti-squalene antibody theory , a scientifically proven test for squalene antibodies is needed to assess whether Gulf War veterans have antibodies to squalene .
In response to a DoD solicitation for research on illnesses among Gulf War veterans , a DoD investigator and nationally recognized expert on antibodies to cholesterol and other lipids submitted a research proposal to determine the feasibility of developing a test for antibodies to squalene .
The competitively funded research project to determine whether antibodies to squalene exist has five main objectives : 1 ) Development and validation of an enzyme - linked immunosorbant assay ( ELISA ) for antibodies against squalene .
2 ) Evaluation and potential development of other assays for antibodies to squalene .
3 ) Development of a positive control antibody to squalene .
4 ) Production of the positive control antibody to squalene for use in the assays .
5 ) Testing of normal human serum for antibodies to squalene by ELISA and other methods .
23 ) What did the competitively funded research project find regarding squalene antibodies ?
In April 2000 , the research project published its first peer - reviewed report , describing an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) that could detect antibodies to squalene induced in mice .
Use of squalene alone did not produce a significant amount of anti-squalene antibodies .
A special chemical was needed to induce the antibodies against squalene in mice .
After injecting mice with liposomes ( fat globules ) containing 71 % squalene ( 710 million parts per billion ) , plus a second chemical called lipid A , antibodies to squalene were readily induced in mice .
The validity of the method was established using positive and negative controls to preclude false positive and false - negative test results .
The investigators concluded that squalene is a weak antigen ( a weak inducer of antibodies ) .
( Matyas et al. , 2000 ) .
By September 2001 , researchers reported improving the assay and ensuring these tests were reproducible and sensitive enough to detect 80 ng / ml of anti-squalene antibody .
The test was also reproducible from experiment to experiment ( Matyas et al. , 2001 ) .
The third study from this research effort , published in 2004 , adapts the test described above so that it could detect anti-squalene antibodies if present in human serum .
Serum from three groups of people were tested : retired employees of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( average 68 years of age , 88 % of whom received anthrax vaccine , mean = 26 doses per person ) , civilian volunteers of similar age from Frederick , Maryland ( none of whom received anthrax vaccine ) , and random blood donors from Fort Knox , Kentucky ( vaccination status unknown ) ,
This next study indicates that anti-squalene antibodies are found in 7.5 % of the vaccinated USAMRIID alumni , 15 % of the unvaccinated Frederick civilians , and in 0 % of the Fort Knox blood donors .
The antibodies described in the previous sentence were a type of antibody called IgG .
Researchers found another type of anti-squalene antibody called IgM in all three groups ( 37 % , 32 % , and 19 % ) .
The researchers found that anti-squalene antibodies are more common with increasing age ( a characteristic also found in mice ) .
The presence of anti-squalene antibodies was unrelated to anthrax vaccination status .
They concluded that anti-squalene antibodies occur naturally in humans ( Matyas et al. , 2004 ) .
24 ) Has DoD ever tested squalene - adjuvanted vaccines in humans against any disease ?
Yes .
The DoD conducted several human clinical trials exploring the value of investigational vaccines containing squalene - based adjuvants to prevent malaria and HIV infection .
The squalene - containing adjuvants principally involved products known as MF59 ( licensed from Chiron Corporation ) and AS02A ( licensed from GlaxoSmithKline ) .
Each of these studies involved an FDAapproved scientific plan in human volunteers told the contents of the vaccine .
Malaria : Hoffman et al , 1994 ; Epstein et al , 2004 ; Wang et al , 2004 .
HIV : Nitayaphan et al , 2000 ; Pitisuttithum et al , 2003 .
The Department of Defense ( DoD ) has never exposed any military member or civilian to any squalene - adjuvanted investigational product without the persons informed consent , abiding by FDA regulations .
Civilian researchers , including some funded by the National Institutes of Health , have conducted clinical trials of these and other squalene - adjuvanted vaccines on human volunteers , ranging from infants to the elderly .
25 ) Could squalene concerns have anything to do with various reported clusters of illnesses among people given anthrax vaccine ?
A panel of civilian physicians selected by the Department of Health & Human Services reviewed all reports of adverse events after anthrax vaccination from 1998 to 2001 ( Sever et al , 2002 ; Sever et al , 2004 ) .
This panel was known as the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee ( AVEC ) .
To evaluate assertations that Service Members who received anthrax vaccination from the five lots cited in the FDA squalene tests experienced more or more severe adverse events after vaccination , these civilian physicians evaluated adverse events by lot and geographic location .
They found no meaningful differences based on lot or on geographic location .
Of note , the five lots cited in the FDA squalene tests were shipped to multiple DoD installations .
In addition , Dover AFB received lots seven lots other than the five test - positive lots mentioned above .
26 ) Bottom line , is there any reason for alarm here ?
No .
Squalene is not added to any US - licensed vaccine , including anthrax vaccine .
The background level of squalene found by the FDA is less than the concentration normally present in human blood .
The FDA confirms that these trace levels are " naturally occurring and safe . "
Improved tests found no squalene in the lots where FDA found it .
Nonetheless , DoD continues to compile additional knowledge about squalene and anti-squalene antibodies .

No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the

- Machiavelli , The Prince , 1521
Via Raw Story , some news that really is n't such a big deal .
Third - party administrators are already a cash cow for the insurance industry , but my guess is that this contract will have a lot of built - in cost controls :
A little - noticed tidbit in Saturday 's Washington Post is sure to raise eyebrows among liberal supporters of a gorvernment - run healthcare plan : the plan is likely to be administered by a private insurance company , the very companies that progressive activists are trying to unseat .
The public - option debate is frustrating some Democrats , who have come to believe that a government - run plan is neither as radical as its conservative critics have portrayed , nor as important as its liberal supporters contend .
Any public plan is likely to have a relatively narrow scope , as it would be offered only to people who do n't have access to coverage through an employer .
The public option would effectively be just another insurance plan offered on the open market .
It would likely be administered by a private insurance provider , charging premiums and copayments like any other policy .
In an early estimate of the House bill , the Congressional Budget Office forecast that fewer than 12 million people would buy insurance through the government plan .
The problem with insurance companies is n't the third - party administrators - they simply administer claims decisions on the basis of what the client pays for .
( Although their administration fees are so often heavily padded , and the feds will have to watch them closely . )
This is commonly done with so - called " self - insured " plans .
This is one of the reasons why it wo n't happen overnight .
Someone 's going to have to come up with the oversight structure .
MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) 
A nurse who authorities say visited suicide chat rooms on the Internet and encouraged depressed people to kill themselves is under investigation in at least two deaths and may face criminal charges that could test the limits of the First Amendment .
Investigators said the nurse , William Melchert - Dinkel , 47 , feigned compassion for those he chatted with , while offering step - by - step instructions on how to take their lives .
Legal experts said prosecuting such a case would be difficult because Mr. Melchert - Dinkel did not physically help kill anyone .
In the meantime , his nursing license has been revoked .
“ Nothing is going to come of it , ” Mr. Melchert - Dinkel told The Associated Press .
“ I ’ve moved on with my life , and that ’s it . ”
Some of the most prominent names in national Republican Party politics are lining up against the GOP nominee in a key upstate New York House special election .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Top Republicans jump ship in NY - 23
Some of the most prominent names in national Republican Party politics are lining up against the GOP nominee in a key upstate New York House special election , the latest being former Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum , who weighed in Friday .
In endorsing Conservative Party nominee Doug Hoffman in the Nov. 3 contest , Santorum joined former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann , former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson , and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes , all of whom announced their backing for the conservative third - party candidate this week .

Minnesota Gov.
Tim Pawlenty suggested Friday that he might be the next well - known Republican to break with the party establishment and support Hoffman .
When asked about the race Friday during an interview with ABC , he expressed frustration with GOP nominee Dede Scozzafava and said he will “ probably ” endorse in the race .
Scozzafava , a state assemblywoman who supports gay marriage , abortion rights and has a close relationship with leading labor officials in her region , has been the target of sustained criticism from conservatives who claim that she is so liberal that they cannot in good conscience support her candidacy .
As evidence , they point to her unofficial endorsement from the leading liberal blog Daily Kos .
While Scozzafava can point to many other prominent conservatives who support her bid — including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill — this week ’s surge of leading conservatives to Hoffman ’s camp is a troubling sign for her campaign and the national GOP establishment since several of the recent Hoffman endorsers have significant followings and represent the most energetic part of the Republican base .
“ I would prefer to not have to go up to New York to endorse and campaign for the conservative candidate .
But Republicans lost the race when they nominated Dede , ” Armey told POLITICO .
“ It ’s the first really great chance for small government conservatives to present themselves as attractive candidates in opposition to Obama , ” he said .
“ We treat this is as an important opportunity for conservatives to win the race .
We wish Republicans had picked a conservative . ”
Asked why Palin , Thompson and the others joined him this week in endorsing Hoffman , Armey responded : “ They see the need for us to make the point that policy positions of small government conservatives are what is needed for us to win this race .
They understand how important this race is and that ’s why I think they endorsed . ”
Republican strategist Mary Matalin added that Hoffman ’s endorsers “ speak for all of us who came to the party in support of the fundamental / constitutional principles it represented . ”
“ We can disagree or compromise on marginal issues , but not freedom - quashing , government - grasping ones , like tax increases , anti-democratic card check , etc .
Holding on to a seat won on those principles is worse than losing it , ” she said .
“ Conversely , losing seats to articulate , conservative Democrats has proved to be the best defensive line holding back Obama ’s expansive ambitions . ”
In her endorsement of Hoffman Thursday night , Palin sounded a clear anti-party tone , writing that Hoffman was the candidate that “ stands for the principles that all Republicans should share . ”
“ Political parties must stand for something .
When Republicans were in the wilderness in the late 1970s , Ronald Reagan knew that the doctrine of ‘ blurring the lines ’ between parties was not an appropriate way to win elections , ” Palin wrote in a statement on her Facebook page .
“ Republicans and conservatives around the country are sending an important message to the Republican establishment in their outstanding grassroots support for Doug Hoffman : no more politics as usual . ”
The conservative star power rallying behind Hoffman has done more than generate buzz for his candidacy — his campaign reported raking in more than $ 100,000 in the 24 hours since Palin ’s endorsement .
But while the conservative grassroots is thrilled by the big names that have come out in support of Hoffman , a number of top Republicans are warning that undercutting their own nominee sets a bad precedent before heading into the consequential 2010 midterm election .
In defending his endorsement of Scozzafava to the National Review , Gingrich warned conservatives that “ if you seek to be a perfect minority , you ’ll remain a minority . ”
Other well - known Republicans have sought to sidestep the intra-party fight that has developed over the Republican - held House seat left vacant by the resignation of GOP Rep.
John McHugh .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who is speaking next week to a Conservative Party dinner in Syracuse , has withheld his endorsement so far -- something the dinner ’s organizers tried to make clear in a statement .
“ The sole purpose of our dinner event is to honor the long history of public service of our five Honorees .
Governor Huckabee was gracious enough to help us celebrate the public service of these individuals , and to lend his integrity and commitment to Conservative principles to this event , ” the statement read .
“ It is reprehensible that there are people out there who would seek to politicize our event under the cloak of anonymity without our knowledge or consent , and for no purpose other than to try to impress others of their political insight . ”
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has also kept quiet on the race .
Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom told POLITICO Friday that Romney is “ following the race ” though he did not have “ any news to announce . ”
One top Republican official in Washington said that many within the party ’s establishment are worried by the support Hoffman has been able to attract , but do n’t believe it ’s indicative of any broader party fissures .
“ It is a little surprising .
[ Scozzafava is ] not the person I would have nominated , but she is still the party ’s nominee , ” said the insider .
“ It ’s kind of the perfect storm up there where you have rival parties and individual conservatives who are taking one side or the other .
It ’s really unfortunate . ”
“ This is , I think , somewhat unique to the circumstances in New York , I have difficulty seeing this happen in another state , ” the official said , pointing out that the Conservative Party has always had a strong following in that region of New York .
“ I do n’t think it is something that is likely to occur elsewhere . ”
But , the Republican added , “ people are worried about us being marginalized in New York , and we ’re doing a pretty good job of that . ”
Even as the financial system collapsed last year , and millions of investors lost billions of dollars , one unlikely investor was racking up historic profits : John Paulson , a hedge - fund manager in New York .
His firm made $ 20 billion between 2007 and early 2009 by betting against the housing market and big financial companies .
Mr. Paulson 's personal cut would amount to nearly $ 4 billion , or more than $ 10 million a day .
That was more than the 2007 earnings of J.K. Rowling , Oprah Winfrey and Tiger Woods combined .
How did he do it ?
Believing that a housing - market collapse was coming , Mr. Paulson spent over $ 1 billion in 2006 to buy insurance on what he then saw as risky mortgage investments .
When the housing market cracked and the mortgages tumbled , the value of Mr. Paulson 's insurance soared .
One of his funds rose more than 500 % that year .
Then in 2008 , he shorted financial shares , or wagered that they would fall in price , profiting again when these companies collapsed .
And are there any investing skills that average investors can learn from his success ?
Yes .
There are no guarantees , of course , but the success of Mr. Paulson and a few other underdog investors lends encouragement to individuals trying to compete with Wall Street 's pros .
Here are eight investing lessons of Mr. Paulson 's $ 20 billion gamble , the greatest trade in financial history :

Proponents of individual liberty are often confronted by the argument that proper behavior must be enforced by laws .
Whether it be calls to ban smoking in public places ( coming to a home near you ) , texting while driving , wearing your pants too low , or other nuisances , both liberals and conservatives maintain that a government has the right and obligation to punish behaviors deemed harmful to the individual , as well as those that are simply annoying or unsightly .
By making certain activities illegal , they claim , it will promote the general welfare by discouraging those activities .
Simply put , this idea is totalitarian , and not suitable for a free society .
If we do not wish to live in a totalitarian or nanny state , we must accept that in instances where we find a behavior objectionable , culture ' and not law ' should be the proper vehicle for changing those behaviors .
It is abundantly clear that both liberals and conservatives want more government regulation over the lives of individuals , and that their disagreement is simply over which actions or behaviors should be regulated .
Whether it is to promote a more moral society , a safer society , or a more diverse society , neither ideology objects to the use of law ( and therefore government force ) as a hammer to bring the rest of the country in line with their views .
But the threat of imprisonment , fines , and taxation to regulate behaviors as mundane as wearing a helmet , smoking , or drinking soda should be anathema to a free society .
Film critic and radio talk show host Michael Medved exemplifies the problem with the totalitarian view when he argues with libertarians over the ban on marijuana .
With a certain verbal gymnastics , he claims that he would not call for its banning if it were n't already illegal , but since it is illegal , he believes it should remain so because its illegality discourages its use .
In other words , Medved believes more people would use what he considers to be a harmful drug if it were legal .
The proper response to that objection , but one which I have not yet heard , is ' so what ? '
But there are other problems with his argument that expose the fallacy of appealing to the government to regulate individual choices .
First , it is not necessarily true that the legality of a thing determines its level of use .
Salvia divinorum , a psychoactive herb that is smoked like marijuana , is currently legal despite some media scare stories , yet its use is not widespread .
Marijuana , on the other hand , remains illegal but is used all over the country .
Individuals choose to smoke marijuana rather than Salvia divinorum in spite of the legal standings of the two plants , and therefore the real distinction is cultural , not legal .
Secondly , the mistake Medved makes , along with most liberals and conservatives , is in believing that cultural change can be enforced through judges , juries , and police .
In waging a culture war , both sides have hijacked our legal system to serve their own interests and enforce their values on the rest of us .
But the only change they actually achieve is in moving us away from a free society and toward a totalitarian state , one in which the government decides how we should dress , what words we can use , what we can and can't watch or read , and ultimately , what we should think .
Culture is a more powerful force governing our behavior than law , and it does n't carry with it the threat of state enforced punishment .
Culture is defined as the refining of human moral or intellectual faculties , or more broadly , as a set of values and customs that governs our behavior .
Culture can be either permissive or restrictive , but cultural norms , in a free society , are arrived at through generations of discussion and debate .
People are free to examine information and weigh the benefits and disadvantages of certain behaviors .
Historically , we can see that laws , even when most brutally enforced , do not trump culture .
Prohibition may have curtailed drinking , for example , but it did not destroy most American 's love of alcohol .
The libertarian response to arguments in favor of encroaching government control over our personal choices should be that culture , not law , is the proper vehicle for social change , and that the very notion that debate should be cut short by force of law , especially when it comes to mundane personal choices , ought to be morally repugnant .
Those in favor of liberty do not have the luxury of enforcing our opinion on others , and therefore nothing is more important than winning this debate .
The freedom of our very thoughts depends on it .
There have always been small minded people who can't see beyond their immediate self - interest , people who insist on short term gain even if it costs them more in the long run , people who insist on getting more for themselves even if it costs everyone around them .
Indeed there may be nothing but such people .
We all start small - minded .
We all get small minded sometimes .
If someone credible intervenes to give me feedback on a way I 'm behaving that they suspect will not serve me and others well in the long run , and I dismiss the feedback without considering it , even that is being small - minded .
Maturity , self - discipline and integrity are names for efforts to control our natural small - mindedness .
Some of us never want to , have to , or can learn to control it .
Some minds stay smaller than others because their emotions simply run stronger .
If your immediate ups and downs are more intensely felt , then of course you 're more likely to get small - minded so you can reap more immediate ups and avoid more immediate downs .
Most of us feel emotions intensely on one topic or another so most of us have experienced the clash of the small minded , where our immediate demands conflict with someone else 's and we do battle .
There are some people who have trouble staying out of those clashes .
Others among us learn to side - step such pettiness wherever possible .
We seek the company of people who have developed some constraints on their impulsivity , people who can do the harder thing of considering something that is immediately disappointing but might be worthy of their for the sake of the big picture .
I 'm 53 .
My dear daughter is 19 .
By the time she is my age the world , both culturally and physically is likely to have changed for the worse more than it has in millennia .
For years we 've know about the possibility of and had a sense of an avoidable disaster impending some decades off .
The news of the past decade that our small minds avoid as much as possible is that the disaster is more likely and much sooner than previously thought .
We might have worried for our children making a decision about whether to have grandchildren , but really the tough decision was our generation's .
We look lovingly into the sparkling eyes of a generation we are sending directly into intense peril .
Conservative estimates suggest that energy demand will double by 2050 .
To avoid the tipping point where climactic feedback loops cause irreversable accelerated disaster , we will need to double current energy production without any increase in carbon emissions .
And even if we avoid the tipping points , sea levels and weather patterns are bound to change .
Among the tipping points we face is the one that confronts all societies in the face of scare and scarcity .
In crisis we tend to get more small minded , causing greater scare and scarcity causing greater small mindedness .
Leaders on climate change say quite rightly that there are hardware and software solutions .
If we prioritize to the big picture and the long term we could prevent a lot of the disaster with existing and developable technologies , making the world work better for everyone .
All we need is the political will .
In other words , the limiting agent is n't hardware or software but wetware , the human mind , or more specifically the human small mind .
It used to be that you could simply walk away from someone intolerably small - minded .
Not anymore .
They -- we , when we are small - minded - - will make or break us .
That 's the wetware imperative .
What has to change is our minds and I hate that because I can't think of anything mushier or slower to change than small mindedness .
Small - mindedness is like a poorly differentiated cancer .
It ca n't be surgically removed .
And it grows like a cancer .
Watching the manipulation and trivialization of policy debates these days we see small - mindedness gaining ground .
The factions claiming falsely to represent traditional conservative values gives all signs of really being a movement by the small - minded for the small - minded .
Small - minded is not easily defined .
Actually the most prominent definition is anyone who stands in the way of my interests and long term .
That 's not going to help .
I try in these pages to figure out what small - minded really is and how to deal with it , both in myself and in us all .
I 'd welcome any suggestions .
Think big .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
If treating heroin addicts by giving them heroin seems counterintuitive , having the government fund that addiction to the tune of more than $ 22,000 per patient per year comes across as downright radical .
A heroin addict identified as Sarah says the program had an almost immediate affect on her life .
A newly released British study , however , found that daily heroin injections given to hard - to - treat addicts as part of a comprehensive program succeeded in treating those addicts and reducing crime .
The use of street heroin was reduced by three quarters and the crimes committed trying to get drugs were cut by two - thirds , the study found .
" The intensity of the program is quite striking , " said John Strang , who led the research team at Britain 's National Addiction Centre , associated with King 's College in London .
" The bond that is formed and the commitment that 's established between the patient coming in for treatment and the staff is far greater than you would ever ordinarily see . "
Taking heroin off the streets seems to be making a difference .
Researchers injected heroin in a safe , stable environment at medically supervised clinics .
They crucially paired that with intensive counseling and addiction treatment .
The researchers reported that benefits were evident just six weeks into treatment among users who had failed at other kinds of treatment .
One of those participants was " Sarah , " who said that after coping with her addiction for more than 20 years , she lost hope that anything would work .
Watch Sarah describe the program »
Sarah described how the program had an almost immediate affect on her life .
She said she was able to keep a schedule , stop buying drugs on the street and gain an appreciation of what her life could be like if she was n't so consumed by getting high .
" You 'll always be an addict basically ; it 's about managing it and leading a positive life " said Sarah , adding , " It quickly became , well , I actually do want to stop .
I do n't really want to have to stick needles in me all my life . "
Her biggest fear now is that the program will be cut or shut down if the government deems it too controversial .
Another patient , who asked to be identified as " Emma , " said , " The morality of it was taken out of the question .
I was n't being condemned for it and at last I could start taking responsibility in a rational way . "
Emma described being chaotic , confused , emaciated and always dreaming about her next fix .
By contrast , she said , the program made her feel cared for , supported and , above all , confident that she could kick the heroin habit .
" This thing that was the meaning of your life is becoming the thing that is getting in the way of your life and it becomes very unattractive , " she said .
Strang said the stubborn nature of heroin addiction is proof that getting addicts into treatment is really a shallow achievement , because many will eventually turn to drugs again .
He believes this promising approach could change the way hard - to - treat addicts are treated and convince the government that the initial high cost offers good value .
" From the cost point of view , if you actually look at the bigger picture , cheap treatment is n't always good treatment .
If cheap treatment does n't deliver any benefit then it's particularity bad value , " Strang said .
The reduction in crime found by the study mirrors results in a handful of studies in other countries .
The treatment is relatively expensive , about $ 22,000 per patient , per year .
But in Britain many are coming to terms with the fact that keeping a person in prison can cost three times that .
If the encouraging results continue , Britain could one day set up permanent clinics around the country , dispensing heroin for its most hard - to - treat addicts .

Biped robot the balances dynamically using a human - like walking motion .
It is a close relative to BigDog , sharing elements of the mechanical design and control .
From the makers of BigDog : PETMAN is an anthropomorphic robot for testing chemical protection clothing used by the US Army .
Unlike previous suit testers , which had to be supported mechanically and had a limited repertoire of motion , PETMAN will balance itself and move freely ; walking , crawling and doing a variety of suit - stressing calisthenics during exposure to chemical warfare agents .
PETMAN will also simulate human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature , humidity and sweating when necessary , all to provide realistic test conditions .
Every day and every week we hear another shocking story about how our billionaires have cooked up an even sicker scheme to shake down Americans and plunder the national wealth , as if the last scheme was too easy and boring .
They do n’t even bother hiding it anymore : take the story about the “ Death Bonds ” I wrote about last month , first reported ( however blandly ) in the New York Times : the very same Wall Street bankers who conned $ 23 trillion out of America ’s wealth is now going to use some of that play money to place bets on when we Americans will die — and the sooner we die , the more billions in E - Z profits Wall Street will earn .
It ’s as if America is some kind of despised abstraction to our ruling class : a faraway colony to plunder , a mass of humanity to use and exploit as it sees fit .
In fact , there ’s a pretty clear pattern developing of just how much they despise Americans and how little they value our lives and our humanity .
It ’s painful to admit this , but the way our 21st century American ruling class treats the rest of us is eerily reminiscent of the great Russian novel Dead Souls , about the 19th century Russian ruling class ’s beastly treatment of its serfs ( also called “ souls ” ) , back when most Russians were essentially slaves , legal property of the ruling class .
Dead Souls features one of the most grotesque shysters in any novel : he comes up with a get - rich - quick scheme that ’s eerily similar to today ’s Wall Street ’s latest schemes : the shyster goes from village to village , buying up “ dead souls ” ( or “ dead serfs ” ) who are still on the census rolls of the local landowners .
The dead serfs are of no use to their owners anymore , so the landowners are happy to make one last ruble off their dead serfs by selling ownership rights over them to the shyster .
The shyster ’s plan : to acquire so many “ dead souls ” that he can package them into valuable collateral , and take out a huge loan against his “ dead souls ” which will finally make him rich .
Wealth spun out of nothing but human misery , so that the shyster can waste huge amounts of money impressing others from the serf - owning class .
In other words : Dead Souls Loans .
Fast - forward to America in 2009 , and now we ’re the dead souls .
Top American corporations are taking out “ dead peasant insurance ” on their workers without the workers even knowing it — and cashing in hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on their employees , even though often times they do n’t even offer those same employees decent health insurance coverage to allow them to survive illnesses .
To top it off , these “ dead peasant insurance ” payouts are tax - free for the corporation that cashes in .
It was a revelation so revolting that even ABC ’s News ’ mannequins admitted they were “ stunned . ”
In fact , as I said , they should n’t be stunned .
It ’s part of an ongoing pattern for our ruling class and their view of America and Americans .
It ’s time we faced up to this grim fact .
Too many of them are against us and against this country , weakening America to the point where it threatens to be permanently crippled , much like how the communists deformed Russia for decades .
They had their bolsheviks ; we have our billionaire - bolsheviks .
The effect of these two rapacious ruling elites is the same : the state and the people serve the tiny ruling class ; and when we ’re not serving them , we can fuck off and die .
Literally .
Because that serves them too .
For practical purposes , here is a small handy list of 8 Reasons To Hate Our Billionaire Bolsheviks [ or “ The H8 8 ” ] :
1. According to Harvard Medical Researchers , 45,000 Americans die each year due to lack of health insurance .
That ’s one American dying every 12 minutes ; it also means that our fucked up health care system kills as many Americans every month as Al Qaeda managed on September 11th , with another 9,000 American dead thrown in for good measure .
Does n’t this count as corporate terrorism ?
Does n’t this mean we should go to war against our murderers , to protect ourselves ?
2 . Those hundreds of thousands of American corpses enriched a handful of American health care CEOs like William McGuire of UnitedHealth : he earned hundreds of millions in annual bonuses in the mid-2000s ( $ 125 million in 2004 , more in 2005 ) along with as much as $ 1.8 billion in stock options ( some of which was clawed back by the SEC ) , and a $ 5 million annual pension guaranteed for life ; at one point , $ 1 out of every $ 700 Americans paid in health care went directly to McGuire ’s obscene billion - dollar payout .
3. “ Dead Peasants Insurance ” : Companies paid out $ 8 billion in premiums on millions of their employees , and expect to earn $ 9 billion in the next 5 years when these employees die .
To make sure that the life insurance companies can pay out the winnings on our deaths , $ 22 billion in TARP money–our money – was set aside this spring for insurance companies .
4. Herbert Perone , spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers , told the San Francisco Chronicle : “ Nobody gets upset when a company insures its plant or its fleet of cars or land or any other business asset .
To think that your labor force is not a business asset is extremely shortsighted . ”
5 . The gap between wealthiest 10 percent and the rest of America is worse than at any time on record .
Two - thirds of all income gains from 2002 - 7 went to the top 1 percent .
The Walton family alone is worth more than the bottom 100 million Americans combined .
Wal - Mart is a major player in the “ dead peasants insurance ” game ; it ’s alleged that dead peasant insurance payouts are used for executive bonuses .
6. Bank of America chief Ken Lewis will earn a $ 125 million retirement package after soaking US taxpayers for $ 45 billion in bailout funds and $ 118 billion in guarnatees .
Meanwhile , banks like BofA earned $ 24 billion in overdraft fees in 2008 , charging some 51 million Americans an average of $ 470 each in highly dubious circumstances .
It ’s thought that banks will pocket even more this year .
7. Mortgages : financial institutions get taxpayers to subsidize losses via $ 700 billion TARP program , $ 1.25 trillion mortgage - backed securities buyback program , hundreds of billions in “ toxic assets ” guarantees , at least $ 400 billion shoring up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , $ 30 billion for PPIP , etc .
8. Mortgages : homeowners .
Two headlines tell the story : “ Mortgage - relief program helps relatively few troubled homeowner ” [ McClatchy , Sept 10 . ] and “ Firms are getting billions , but homeowners still in trouble ” [ McClatchy , Oct 4 . ]
The latter article details how even the meager funds earmarked for homeowner relief winds up getting looted by the mortgage servicers who created the problems in the first place .
And on , and on …
It ’s one of the more grotesque yet inevitable examples of just how badly the super - wealthy have warped America so that it ’s become little more than a rigged game in which we the people always lose , just like Mr. Lebowski said we would .
In 1965 , Ronald Reagan said in a speech : “ A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government .
It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse out of the public treasury .
From that moment on the majority … always vote[s ] for the candidate promising the most benefits from the treasury with the result that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy , always to be followed by dictatorship . ”
[ Quoted in David Cay Johnston ’s book Free Lunch . ]
The great irony of course is that it was n’t the voters who plundered the public treasury , but rather , the super - wealthy who plundered the public and subverted democracy .
But this is worse than mere irony ; Reagan was the billionaire ’s Trojan Horse to power .
They rode on his drooling senile smile into power , on the worst assumptions about the American people and how we ’d use our democratic power to take their wealth ; so the minute they got the reigns , they plundered us first , before we could get to them .
This is what I mean by America ’s billionaire class as an alien , colonial overlord class : they hate us , quite simply , and the more they plunder America , the more they both loathe us and fear us , or what we might do to them–or should do .
As for the dictatorship that Reagan speaks of , it ’s already here , thanks in no small part to Reagan himself .
But it ’s not the crude , old - fashioned dictatorship , the kind with cool uniforms and parades .
That would n’t last a week , because we ’ve all been trained to look out for it and spot the crude old saber - toothed dictators .
Instead , today we have a kind of highly - evolved dictatorship concealing itself as a functioning democracy .
But in all the important issues , where billions or trillions are at stake , where their yachts and private jets are pitted against Americans ’ lives or the national interest , you can spot the dictatorship ’s horrific Predator - beast head rising from the swamp … such as when the vote on the public option was put to the Democratic supermajority - run Senate committee , and it got crushed by the same margin as if the Senate was split , or run by a Republican supermajority .
Which brings me back to Dead Souls : despite the title , the book is actually one of the greatest comic novels of all time , a kind of comic poem , “ laughter through tears ” as the author , Gogol , put it .
But I ’m not sure Gogol would find our 2009 version of Dead Souls very comical .
And Hollywood would never buy it .
There ’s nothing redeeming , no characters an audience can possibly identify with .
Our American Dead Souls is just too … depressing .

A BRAVE Victorian country cat shot 13 times in the head with a pea rifle has survived the brazen attack .
Smokey , the nine - year - old moggie , was shot 13 times by a .22 calibre rifle yesterday , with most of the pellets since removed and the cat remaining in the care of a vet .
RSPCA Victorian president Dr Hugh Wirth described the act as " utterly disgraceful " .
He said the cat was expected to recover .
" This is typical of a whole range of attacks on animals , whether it's the city or the country , " Dr Wirth said .
Bow - and - arrow attacks on cats and shootings of larger birds like swans were on the rise , he said .
He said there was a " well - established link " between cruelty to animals by young people and harm to other adults later in life .
Dr Wirth urged parents to teach young children to respect life .

Parents have long complained that loud rock music is torture ; plenty of hipsters would say the same about Barney the Dinosaur and Christina Aguilera .
But now some of the musicians are banding together with the National Campaign to Close Guantanamo to protest the use of their songs as torture mechanisms .
Some of those musicians — Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine — say their music has been played at ear - splitting level to torment terror suspects and coerce confessions at the detention facility .
Other petitioners want to know whether their works have been used in such capacity , including R.E.M. , Pearl Jam , Jackson Browne and Billy Bragg .
“ The fact that music I helped create was used in crimes against humanity sickens me , ” said Tom Morello , former lead guitarist for Rage Against the Machine , an industrial rock band whose song “ March of the Pigs ” has been linked to torture tactics at the detention facility at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
“ We need to end torture and close Guantanamo now , ” Mr. Morello said .
Based on interviews and declassified documents , a spokeswoman with the National Security Archives says acts whose music is known to have been used covers the musical gamut — from AC / DC to the Barney theme song , Marilyn Manson to Neil Diamond , Tupac Shakur to Sesame Street , Limp Bizkit to Christina Aguilera .
And the Bee Gees .
The National Security Archive , a research division of George Washington University , filed Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests Thursday on behalf of the musicians , asking the federal government to declassify documents that explain how specific music is chosen , and what role it plays in interrogation techniques .
“ There ’s been a lot of outrage and bewilderment on how this could be and what went on , ” said Kate Doyle , archive senior analyst .
“ The musicians are using the FOIAs to express their outrage and objection to the military using these songs and abusing their creativity in this way . ”
The archive said it has already found 20 declassified documents that reference loud music used to “ create futility ” with uncooperative detainees .
“ We have spent the past 30 years supporting causes related to peace and justice , ” R.E.M. said in a statement .
“ To now learn that some of our friends ’ music may have been used as part of the torture tactics without their consent or knowledge is horrific .
It ’s anti-American , period . ”
But Debra Burlingame , a director with the national security policy group Keep America Safe , called the musicians ’ effort “ pathetic . ”
“ This is a preview of what the Gitmo defense attorneys are going to do with these hard - core terrorists in federal court .
This torture narrative will completely eclipse justice for the 3,000 victims , ” said Mrs. Burlingame , whose brother was a pilot killed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
One prisoner , Mohammad al - Sliha , was exposed to “ Let the Bodies Hit the Floor ” by Drowning Pool .
Another prisoner , Asif Iqbal , was shackled in a chair while a dance version of Eminem music was played repeatedly .
“ The various bands involved want to know why was their music used without authorization or consultation , how was their creativity used in a way that was repellant to them , ” Ms. Doyle said .
The National Campaign to Close Guantanamo , lead by retired Gens . Robert Gard and John Johns , said the base has been al Qaeda ’s biggest recruitment tool and will remain such until it is shut down .
Enhanced interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , were suspended at Guantanamo in 2003 .
President Obama has pledged to close the camp .
“ The torture that went on there is disgraceful and puts our troops at risk every day , ” Mr. Gard said .
“ I sympathize for the musicians whose music was used without their knowledge as part of the Bush administration ’s misguided policies . ”
Others were n’t so sympathetic .
“ It ’s almost laughable to think that heavy metal bands like Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine have a moral authority on national security issues , ” Mrs. Burlingame said .
“ They ’re worried about torture of hard - core terrorists ?
This is really something I would expect to read in the Onion . ”

During the very first Colbert Report show on October 17 , 2005 , the witty faux Conservative media pundit Stephen Colbert unleashed the word truthiness on the world . (
Click here to see the video on the Colbert Nation website .
)
He introduced it like this :
“ On this show your voice will be heard ... in the form of my voice .
‘ Cause you ’re looking at a straight - shooter , America .
I tell it like it is .
I calls ‘em like I sees ‘ em .
I will speak to you in plain simple English .
And that brings us to tonight 's word : Truthiness .
Now I ’m sure some of the Word Police , the wordanistas over at Webster ’s , are gonna say , ‘ Hey , that ’s not a word . ’
Well , anybody who knows me knows that I ’m no fan of dictionaries or reference books .
They ’re elitist .
Constantly telling us what is or is n’t true , or what did or did n’t happen .
Who ’s Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914 ?
If I wanna say it happened in 1941 , that ’s my right .
I do n't trust books .
They ’re all fact , no heart . ”
In that brilliant bit , Colbert captured the nature of much of today ’s political rhetoric and punditry .
Nowadays , it does n’t matter what “ the truth ” is .
Whatever is consistent with what you believe to be true is “ the truth . ”
For example , as a huge fan of Stephen Colbert , I believe he coined the word truthiness .
Oh sure , there are some elitist egghead language experts who have noted that the word truthiness already existed before Colbert uttered it and that uses of the word date back to the early 1800s .
Indeed , there ’s a series of posts about this on the Language Log , a popular hangout for snooty linguists .
The so - called “ facts ” in those posts supposedly “ prove ” Stephen Colbert may have popularized the word truthiness but did n’t actually coin it .
The wordanista who started pushing this absurd claim appears to be Ben Zimmer , producer of the Visual Thesaurus and Vocabulary.com , language columnist for The Boston Globe and former “ On Language ” columnist for The New York Times .
As Colbert might say [ loudly , while shaking his fist ] , “ Damn you , Zimmer ! ”
Your nonsensical facts will never shake my belief in the truthiness of my belief that Stephen Colbert coined the word truthiness !

YARMOUTH , Mass .  Dave Lamoureux ’s kayak , named Fortitude , must be the only one in Massachusetts registered as a motor vessel .
That ’s because a powerboat registration is required to get a permit to fish for tuna here .
Apparently , it never occurred to the authorities that someone might be crazy enough to want to catch a bluefin while sitting in what amounts to a floating plastic chair and enjoying what Melville called a “ Nantucket sleigh ride . ”
Since the end of July , Lamoureux has caught three bluefins this way , paddling a couple of miles off Race Point , at the tip of Provincetown , hooking a tuna and holding on , the rod clipped to a harness on his chest , while being towed at speeds up to 15 miles an hour before the fish exhausts itself .
His most recent catch , on Nov. 5 , was a 157 - pound bluefin , a record tuna for an unassisted kayak fisherman , and a near record over all , topped only by a 183 - pound halibut caught by Howard McKim , an Alaskan , in 2004 .
Reeling in a halibut , though , has been likened to hauling in a load of plywood , and some of Lamoureux ’s admirers consider landing a bluefin , known for its power and ferocity , the greater feat .
He is a hero at bait shops up and down Cape Cod .
On fishing blogs , a few grumblers call him a dangerous idiot .

Citigroup may have to write down about $ 10 billion in deferred tax assets in the fourth - quarter , according to CLSA banking analyst Michael Mayo .
The report sent shares down over 5 percent .
Citigroup says it has no idea how any analyst , including Mayo , may have gotten to this estimate .
Mayo disclosed his expectation that more writedowns were ahead in a conference call Friday .
In the wake of this disclosure , shares of banking stocks , including Citigroup , were trading lower .
Deferred tax assets can be used to offset future gains .
However , if over time , a company does not have gains to offset , the value of the deferred tax assets must be written down .
Mayo estimates the $ 10 billion writedown would be equal to about 25 percent of Citigroup 's existing $ 38 billion in deferred tax assets , and about 10 percent of Citigroup 's tangible equity .
According to Mayo , Citigroup may be able to offset a portion of the expected write down with other gains .
Someday , instead of typing your text message on a cramped iPhone keyboard , neuroscientist Michael Linderman says you 'll be scrawling your thoughts in the air .
Linderman and colleagues have figured out how to translate electrical impulses from muscles in the forearm and hand into written language .
Using pattern - recognition algorithms and a technique called electromyography , the researchers can recognize and reproduce a person 's unique handwriting pattern from the movement of their hands .
Eventually , they hope to create a fingerless glove equipped with electrode sensors that can automatically translate hand motions into digital or handwritten text .
" You can write in the air , can write on any surface , can write using a pen or pencil or even without , " said Linderman , " and this will be converted into text on the display of a cellphone or computer . "
For the first phase of their research project , published Wednesday in PLoS ONE , the scientists asked six volunteers to don a prototype glove that recorded the electrical activity of eight muscles in the hand and forearm .
Each subject wrote the numerals zero to nine 50 times , and a computer recorded both the input from their digital pen and the electrical activity of their hand muscles as they completed the exercise .
Then , using pattern recognition software , the researchers taught the computer to convert the electrical - impulse tracings into written language .
" We wanted the system to be able to recognize those bursts of electricity as particular patterns associated with this type of mechanical activity , " Linderman said .
The results of the experiment can be seen in the figure on the right :
What participants actually wrote is shown in blue , while their handwriting reconstructed from the electrical recordings is in red .
The reproduction is n't perfect , but since submitting the paper , Linderman says the team has significantly refined its process .
" That was using a very simplistic algorithm , because we had a very short time to work on this project , " he said .
" We do not have the pictures yet , but we have certainly improved the algorithms . "
Once they could accurately reproduce handwriting from electrical tracings , the team tested how well their computer program could recognize characters based on muscle movements using a technique called discriminate analysis .
After five repetitions of each character , the computer could recognize 63 percent of the numerals ; with 35 training repetitions , the computer achieved 97 percent accuracy .
" I think it ’s a very solid piece of work , " said electrophysiology expert Andrew Fuglevand of the University of Arizona , who was not involved in the research but has consulted with Linderman in the past .
" It ’s something that they should in the future be able to use to as a way to electronically extract somebody ’s handwriting based on recording the patterns of their muscle activity . "
However , Fuglevand says he has a hard time envisioning what sort of practical functions the technology might serve .
Linderman , on the other hand , has no trouble imagining myriad uses for his device .
He says digital hand technology is n't just for teenagers who want to send a faster text message :
Because many neuromuscular disorders , including Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's , often start with mild hand tremors , he thinks the glove could be used as a screening device to catch diseases earlier .
It might also be useful for creating prosthetic writing devices , he said , or helping patients with a hand tremor learn to write again .
Linderman founded the company Norconnect Inc. to market his device , and last February , the researchers received a NSF grant of more than $ 450,000 for the second phase of their research .
But medical indications aside , there 's at least one major drawback to this technology :
If people look silly now while talking on a bluetooth , just think how ridiculous they 'll look waving their hands in the air to send text messages .

Bless you , Rupert Murdoch , you really do keep things interesting .
The News Corp media maven is threatening to take all of his newspapers ' content off Google and give Microsoft Bing exclusive rights to index his news .
This is the second Big Murdoch Threat recently , the first being his brazen announcement to put all of his news behind a pay wall .
What is Murdoch thinking ?
I think I know .
The central struggle of monetizing online news is that ad rates for web pages are significantly worse than the print ad rates that once buttressed newspapers .
So for a newspaper publisher like Murdoch , big online traffic helps , but it does n't pay for a sprawling roster of reporters and editors .
Somebody 's gotta break the tyranny of revenue - light banner ads , eventually .
You can go the Daily Beast model and try to infuse online ads with a dash of glamour to drive up premiums and juice click - through rates .
You can go the Financial Times / WSJ model of combining limited free content with paid registration for full access .
Or you can think outside the box , turn off Google and get another search engine to pay you for exclusive rights to your content .
Would Murdoch lose traffic with this gambit ?
Oh you bet .
By " turning off " Google , WSJ could , by one estimate , lose 25 % of its page views -- although that number does n't take into account any increase in traffic from the Bing deal .
But remember , big traffic numbers are a fig leaf .
Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review found that this 25 % Google crowd accounted for less than $ 12 m a year in advertising .
If Murdoch can get a better deal with Bing -- at a time when Bing might be desperate to increase its news integrity -- then we should take this threat seriously .

" First of all , the Men 's Rights Movement made it on the title of one of the biggest magazines ( named Focus ) in Germany .
" Very well done article that features DV , education , feminism etc. , about 8 - 10 pages .
Also talking about media , male DV victims were recently on TV .
" Secondly , parts of the German Men 's Rights Movement ( MRM ) were able to shoot down a sexist TV series .
Surprise .
" And finally as we approach the next election I can see parts of the MRM reaching out to a political party .
A small one that is , but good efforts are being made ( heck , I will vote them , my wife will , my uncle , too ) .
We will see what happens .
The best thing is that we are going forward .
Even the ( female ) chancellor of Germany does n't believe in discrimination of women anymore .
Step by step ...
More than 500 people gathered in Griffith Park on Sunday to demand less government spending and voice their opposition to any government - run healthcare plan .
The rally was the latest stop on a national tour -- dubbed the Tea Party Express II -- that began Sunday morning in San Diego and plans to visit 38 cities in 19 days .
Organizers are calling the tour a “ Countdown to Judgment Day ” for elected officials , timing it to one year before the 2010 congressional elections .
Sal Russo , chief strategist for the Tea Party Express II , said that his group is calling on politicians to “ clean up their act ” and stop voting for deficit - increasing measures .

Lisa Markell of Long Beach and Bruce Berger of Cypress wore long brown hooded robes to the rally Sunday , to protest government spending and taxation .
“ This is a grave concern , ” said Markell , 46 , clutching a 6 - foot scythe with a tombstone - shaped sign .
Earlier this year , tea party protests were timed with April 15 , the filing deadline for state and federal taxes .
The current tour is scheduled to end Nov. 12 in Orlando , Fla .

The World from Berlin ' Bing Has Little Chance against Google '
In the world of search , Microsoft 's Bing search engine is the David to Google 's Goliath .
Now Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. is hoping to be the pebble that brings the giant down by only offering its content via the Microsoft site .
German commentators are skeptical about the new alliance 's chances .
The largest animal ever still exists today .
Balaenoptera musculus more affectionately known as the Blue Whale dwarfs any living creature past or present ( dinosaurs included ) .
Below you will find a collection of facts about this magnificent mammal .
We will also attempt to put its mind - boggling size and weight into perspective .
SIZE MATTERS
The largest ever recorded Blue Whale measured 108 feet ( 33 meters ) in length !
Typical adult Blue Whales tend to measure approximately 75 - 100 feet ( 22 - 30 meters ) .
To put this staggering length into perspective we ’ve compared it to some more recognizable objects :
A Blue Whale ’s heart beats only 5 - 6 times per minute and is about the size of a Mini Cooper
GREAT WEIGHT
Blue Whales can weigh up to 181 metric tons ( 1 metric ton = 1,000 kg ) or 399,000 pounds !
The Blue Whale ’s tongue weighs around 2.7 metric tons ( 5,952 pounds ) about the size of an average Asian Elephant
Its mouth is large enough to hold up to 90 metric tons ( 198,400 pounds ) of food and water which is equivalent to 420,560 Big Macs
Despite the size of its mouth , the dimensions of its throat are such that a Blue Whale cannot swallow an object wider than a beach ball
Its heart weighs 600 kg ( 1,300 lb ) and is the largest known in any animal .
Not only is it a similar size to a mini-cooper but also comparable in weight
FOOD FOR THOUGHT
The Blue Whale is thought to feed almost exclusively on small , shrimp - like creatures called Krill .
During the summer feeding season the Blue Whale gorges itself , consuming an astounding 3.6 metric tons ( 7,900 pounds ) or more each day .
This means it may eat up to 40 million krill a day .
The daily calorie requirement of an adult Blue Whale is in the region of 1.5 million
15,800 8 oz New York Strip Loin Steaks = 7,900 pounds
5,500 Snickers Chocolate Bars = 1.5 million calories
BIG BABIES
– Blue Whale calves enter the world already ranking among the planet ’s largest creatures .
After about a year inside its mother ’s womb , a baby blue whale emerges weighing up to 2.7 metric tons ( 6,000 pounds ) and stretching to 8 meters ( 25 feet )
– It gorges on nothing but mother ’s milk and gains about 200 pounds ( 91 kilograms ) every day for its first year , growing about 3.8 cm ( 1.5 inches ) in length a day
RANDOM FACTS
– A Blue Whale ’s lungs carry about 5,000 litres ( 1320 gallons ) of air , about 1,000 times the lung capacity of an average human
– Blue whales are the loudest animals on Earth !
Their call reaches levels up to 188 decibels which is louder than a jet , which reaches only 140 decibels .
Human shouting is about 70 decibels
– They are fast , strong swimmers , capable of reaching 30 mph ( 48.3 km / hr ) when alarmed , but they usually cruise along at about 12 mph ( 19.3 km/ hr ) .
– A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 Blue Whales worldwide
– They emit a series of pulses , groans , and moans , and it ’s thought that , in good conditions , Blue Whales can hear each other up to 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometers ) away
– The longest recorded dive is 36 minutes .
They often reach depths below 200 meters ( 700 feet ) when feeding
– Scientists estimate that Blue Whales can live for at least 80 years

Complaints against police officers in England and Wales rose to record levels last year , according to a report released today .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said that 31,259 complaints were made by members of the public in the financial year 2008 /09 .
It represents an increase of 8 per cent on the previous year .
The number of complaints received last year was nearly double the number received in 2003 / 2004 , the year before the IPCC came into existence .
Among the complaints upheld , 46 officers were found to have committed perjury , 11 were found to have indulged in " corrupt practice " and six committed sexual assaults .

The IPCC said the increase may be indicative of greater public awareness of the IPCC in the wake of high - profile investigations that it has carried out , most notably that into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes , the Brazilian shot dead on the Tube by Metropolitan Police officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist .
The increase is also said to reflect changes in the way incidents are recorded .
Last year , all police forces were required for the first time to record and refer to the IPCC all complaints received , rather than only serious ones .
Of the allegations made , 46 per cent related to perceived rudeness or a " neglect or failure in duty " – officers being slow or ineffective when responding to calls .
Another 13 per cent of complaints related to assault .
Complaints over the G20 protests on 1 April this year were excluded as they fell just outside the reporting period .
The release of the figures coincides with new data from the 2006 / 7 British Crime Survey which revealed that more than one in four respondents said their contact with the police had left them " really annoyed " .
But of those , only one in 10 made a complaint .
The IPCC chairman , Nick Hardwick , said : " At a time when politicians and the police are debating public confidence in the police and how to make them more accountable , the complaint figures published today give a strong indication of what the public want sorted out .
The public recognise the police have a difficult job to do .
However , this does not alter the fact that they expect officers to do their job politely and efficiently .
These statistics show that when it is not done in this manner , they are likely to complain . "
Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales , 25 reported an increase in complaints on last year , while 17 saw a decrease .
One force , Dyfed - Powys in Wales , saw no change .
Lincolnshire saw the biggest increase in complaints , up 46 per cent .
Staffordshire saw the largest drop , down 24 per cent .
Compared to 2003 / 04 , the number of complaints rose by 97 per cent last year .
Every force in England and Wales saw an increase , with the biggest in West Mercia , up 200 per cent .
The number of complaints upheld remained relatively static at 10 per cent , compared to 11 per cent last year and 12 per cent in 2003 / 04 .
Mr Hardwick said the increase in complaints " reflects growing confidence in the system and more consistent complaint recording standards .
We want to make sure all sections of society have confidence . "
The Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman chief constable John Feavyour said : " Inevitably there will be occasions where we do not always get it right .
When we get it wrong we should recognise the facts quickly , encourage debate and be willing to listen to the views of those who wish to engage in the policing debate and learn more from them . "
Simon Reed , the vice - chairman of the Police Federation , which represents frontline officers , said : " These complaints not only reflect the increasing pressures on police officers but also highlight the need to invest in appropriate training for officers . "

Climate change protesters attempting to prevent a coal - fired power station from operating were bitten by police dogs yesterday as they tried to tear up fencing .
More than 1,000 activists descended on the huge Ratcliffe - on - Soar site in Nottinghamshire on Saturday , and at least three protesters managed to breach the perimeter .
Confrontations continued yesterday with police arresting four people , in addition to tthe 52 arrests made on Saturday .
Earlier reports indicated 80 had been detained .
The so - called " Great Climate Swoop " included members of the Camp for Climate Action , Plane Stupid and Climate Rush .
They chose their target in an online vote following an earlier , peaceful Climate Camp held in London in August .

Protester David Martin , 28 , said his friend had been treated in hospital for a bite to the stomach .
The student from Hackney , east London , said : " A lot of people had puncture wounds from the dogs .
People were bleeding .
I saw at least 10 or 20 people who had been bitten . "
The energy company E.ON , which owns the power station , had earlier won a High Court injunction giving police the power to arrest anyone trying to enter the site .
Chief Inspector Linda McCarthy , of Nottinghamshire Police , said the injuries were " regrettable " but blamed the protesters ' " reckless " behaviour .
Natasha Blair , from Camp for Climate Action , said : " We 've achieved what we came here to do , to show that coal has no future and there is a growing movement which is prepared to take action on climate change . "
The home secretary , Alan Johnson , is facing growing anger from scientists and government advisers over his decision to force the resignation of his senior drug adviser , David Nutt .
Two other senior scientific advisers to the Home Office told Nutt they were " horrified " at his treatment .
The former chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) told the Guardian that Dr Michael Rodd , a specialist in computing who sits on the Home Office Science Advisory Committee , and Professor Sheila Bird , a Cambridge University statistics expert who sits on the same committee , had written to him privately saying " they were unhappy with the way the Home Office had dealt with my case " .
Neither could be reached for comment .
Other senior scientists and former government advisers also criticised Johnson today , arguing the episode would create a gulf between researchers and politicians and prevent the best scientists from offering their expertise to the government in future .
" I thought it was an appalling decision and totally inappropriate , " said Lord Krebs , a former Food Standards Agency chief , who has also led several independent scientific studies for government .
" It will send shockwaves through the scientific community and make it more difficult for the government to recruit the best people to help with scientific advice to underpin public policy . "
If the government wanted to ignore scientific advice , he said , they should explain why .
" Alan Johnson could have said , 'we hear what you say but the science is not yet sufficiently robust enough for us to take action ' , " said Krebs .
Krebs said he had spoken to many scientists and former government advisers over the weekend , and " not one person … has been other than horrified about it and feeling that this called into question the whole validity of the government 's approach to independent scientific advice " .
Michael Donmall , head of the National Drug Evidence Centre and a former member of ACMD , said : " No independent advisory council should be expected to rubber - stamp government policy decisions .
This totally undermines the whole value and role of the advice … in this case it appears that government has neither heeded the advice of the ACMD , nor entered into an informed debate about the issues . "
He added : " Sometimes it is necessary to be outspoken in order to bring public attention to the way it is possible for political expediency to run roughshod over expert advice . "
Mark Walport , director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the prime minister 's Council for Science and Technology , said the episode risked alienating scientists and politicians .
" There 's an important relationship of trust here – governments have to trust scientists to give their best possible advice and be conscientious , and , equally , scientists have to trust governments that their advice will be listened to and the interplay between them will be as transparent as possible , " he said .
" If that trust is lost , that would be a bad thing . "
Nutt 's sacking came days after the government supported the independence of scientific advisers in its official response to an inquiry by the House of Commons science and technology select committee on the use of scientific advice in government .
In its report , the committee said scientists should not be criticised for publishing scientific papers or making statements as professionals , independent of their role as government advisers , and that " it is important to safeguard the independence of the [ science ] advisory system .
In situations where the independence of a [ science advisory council ] chairman or member is or might be threatened for political reasons , support should be offered by the DCSA [ departmental chief scientific adviser ] and / or the GCSA [ government 's chief scientific adviser ] " .
In response , the government said : " The committee can be assured that the GCSA will take steps to support [ scientific advisers ] should he believe that their independence is being impinged upon . "
Sir David King , the former chief scientific adviser to the government , said Nutt had " stepped over the line " by criticising ministers ' decision to go against his advice .
" It is fine for him to reassert the advice but it is a step further to criticise a minister for not taking it , " said King .
" His advice was extremely sound and I wish the government had followed it but this has created a crisis in a way which is not being discussed in the media .
I spent a lot of my time in government trying to recover public trust in the scientific community and all of this work could be undone by creating confrontation between scientists and ministers . "
He added the home secretary should have let Nutt 's criticism pass .
Lord Drayson , the science minister , has yet to comment officially on Nutt 's dismissal but has expressed his concerns on Twitter .
In a series of tweets over the weekend , he said Johnson had " assured me of the importance both he and his department places on the academic freedom of advisers [ and ] of the importance both he and his department places on the independence of the advice they provide " .
His office said Drayson would be investigating the matter further on his return to the UK tomorrow .
The minister also acknowledged the strength of feeling among scientists .
" I recognise how seriously concerned the science community is by this . "
Chris Gaskell , chairman of the science advisory council at the environment department , said the case served to " highlight the tensions that sometimes exist when advice is offered on the basis of scientific evidence and other evidence is taken into account " .
Both sides needed to " understand and respect " each other , he said .
" We are fairly clear what our role is .
We advise , we do n't make policy . "
Science evidence was " a very important component but often not the whole evidence base and therefore has to take its place " in the total evidence feeding into policy .
But , he added , explanation should be given if particular evidence did not " hold sway " .
Krebs said the sacking was surprising because , on the whole , the government listened to scientific advice .
" On some occasions , contrary to what Alan Johnson says , I 've heard ministers say I can't formulate the policy until the scientists have given me the answer .
They 'll hide behind science when it suits them , " he said .
" That makes this all the more shocking . "

New BSD licensed debugger
As one or two of you know , I 've been working recently on writing a new debugger , primarily for the FreeBSD platform .
For various reasons , I 've been writing it in a relatively obscure C - like language called D ( see http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/index.html for more details including a free download of a FreeBSD D compiler .
So far , I have a pretty useful ( if a little raw at the edges ) command line debugger which supports ELF , Dwarf debugging information and ( currently ) 32 bit FreeBSD and Linux .
The engine includes parsing and evaluation of arbitrary C expressions along with the usual debugging tools such as breakpoints , source code listing , single - step etc .
All the code is new and BSD licensed .
Currently , the thing supports userland debugging of i386 targets via ptrace and post - mortem core file debugging of same .
I 'll be adding amd 64 support real soon ( TM ) and maybe support for GDB 's remote debugging protocol later .
If anyone is interested in taking a look at a ' Technology Preview ' , I 've put up a git repository at http://people.freebsd.org/~dfr/ ngdb.git .
To build it you need to install ' omake ' from /usr / ports / devel / omake and you will need a D compiler .
There are three options there - DMD which you can download from http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html is free , closed source and works pretty well .
GDC is a D front end to GCC and you can find it in ports - it works well enough but has n't been updated for ages .
Personally , I use LDC which is a D front end to LLVM but that does n't build out - of - the box ( I have a private hacked version of LDC and some associated libraries ) .
Have fun with it and do n't complain too much if it does n't build / breaks / eats your homework etc .
Battery Operated Prototype Train Hits the Norfolk Southern Railway Tracks
October 20th , 2009 by Beth Graddon - Hodgson
The Norfolk Southern Railway recently debuted a green transportation option that ’s among the first of its kind .
It ’s currently only a prototype , but is just the beginning of things to come ; with plans by 2011 to unveil a long - range locomotive that will produce zero-emissions .
The battery powered plug - in locomotive has been in the works for the past couple of years , and has finally come to fruition in the Pennsylvania Rail Yard .
While it ’s not taking passengers on board today , it is hard at work transporting trains around the yard between the charging requirements of its 1080 rechargeable 12 - volt lead acid batteries which are capable of storing about a day ’s worth of power between charges .
The development of this prototype hybrid locomotive cost $ 4 Million to develop and was funded in part by US Rep .
Bull Shuster in a hopes of reducing pollution output from diesel which is responsible for 40 tonnes of pollution in the United States every year .
Initially , new trains that will be designed to carry passengers will be hybrid models which will combine diesel and rechargeable battery power , but now that this prototype has finally come to fruition in Pennsylvania , there ’s no doubting that this is just the beginning of things to come .

The caravan airship – simply , an airship with a caravan attached underneath it – came from an idea he had as a child .
‘ To be honest , ’ he says , ‘ a lot of the things I ’m doing on telly at the moment are things that I ’ve pretty much been working on since I was a child , and they ’ve only just come to fruition , like my Airfix spitfire and my Lego house [ both of which he made for his ongoing BBC Two series James May ’s Toy Stories , with the latter to be shown in a Christmas special ] .
Those have been rattling around in my brain since I can remember . ’

In the green grass , just off Victoria Drive , stands an apple red shed .
It represents a full year ’s work for the Cedar Cottage gardeners .
Unlike so many community gardens in Vancouver , this one is here to stay .
The City of Vancouver is enthusiastic about community gardening .
The City ’s 2010 Challenge calls for 2,010 new shared gardens on City - owned , Park Board or privately - owned land by next year .
But land owned by the Park Board and the City of Vancouver is only granted to gardeners on a renewable five - year term .
“ Building a garden is quite an investment , ” said Melanie Wilson of Cedar Cottage Garden .
“ So what happens if you build it and it ’s only for five years ? ”
Home to 61 plots
When a piece of City - owned land in East Vancouver was offered up for use as a community garden , nearly a dozen residents of Cedar Cottage got together to start planting .
Soon after , the City announced the land was marked for real estate development and not open for gardening .
Rather than disband , the group refocused .
They found an adjacent piece of land beside the SkyTrain tracks .
It took five months but the group gained permission from TransLink to use the land and planted their first crop just over a year ago .
Now the garden is home to 61 plots and even more members , with still more neighbourhood residents on the waiting list .
Carole Christopher , chair of the Vancouver Food Policy Council , said growing support for community gardens makes lease renewals more likely , but City and park gardens are not guaranteed .
“ It ’s very bad PR to turn people off community garden land , ” Christopher said .
There are 55 community gardens currently on City , park and private land in Vancouver .
A community garden is defined as a single piece of land used collectively by a group of people .
Wilson said the City is interested in garden beds , not orchards and fruit bushes because planners want to keep their options open .
But gardeners want a diverse harvest , and that includes long - term crops .
Gardeners team up with transit
Cedar Cottage Garden is located at Victoria Dr. and Hull St. The land is owned by BC Hydro and leased to TransLink .
TransLink is allowing the group to use the former Austrian Plaza for community gardening , unless the site is needed for transit purposes .
Wilson said the garden seems more secure on TransLink ’s land than it would be on City or park land .
“ In some ways we ’re helping transit out , ” Wilson said .
“ We ’re occupying a site where they ’ve had issues with vandalism and crime , and we ’re not out of the woods on that yet , but it seems there ’s been a reduction in that since we ’ve been there . ”
Wilson said TransLink is unlikely to develop the land near the SkyTrain tracks so the risk of losing the garden seems minimal .
Backyard farming
Community gardens on private land provide another option for gardeners looking to plant orchards and other long - term crops .
But one Vancouverite has another plan .
Ying Dwyer turned her front lawn on E 11th Ave. into a food garden two years ago .
This year she started Urban Community Farmer .
Landowners who donate their yard space to Urban Community Farmer will have fresh produce on their doorsteps year - round .
Community members who do n’t have land can buy shares in the organization and receive a weekly basket of local produce .
Dwyer currently has three farms in East Vancouver .
“ I just think more and more people realize it ’s such a good thing to have a garden instead of a lawn .
When you have a lawn you still need to spend lots of money on maintaining the lawn , ” Dwyer said .
“ We ’re in the city so there ’s limited opportunities for gardens , ” Wilson said .
“ There ’s a lot of people in our gardening group who live in apartments who do n’t have other land to grow food on . ”
“ I do it with my kids because I think it ’s so great to put seeds in the ground and see them grow and have them know where food comes from in a way that lots of city kids do n’t .
It comes from the ground and not from the supermarket . ”
With projects like the 100 Mile Diet gaining popularity , the city is encouraging local food production .
The Cedar Cottage gardeners have been asked to develop a nearby City - owned patch of land .
Wilson said the group is unsure if they will apply .
They are interested in expanding , but they want a longer term commitment from the city .
NewRelic RPM is a very popular performance monitoring solution in the Ruby on Rails space .
The latest release , RPM 2 , is now available and brings RPM 's features to the Java applications .
InfoQ talked to NewRelic 's Lew Cirne about the new release .
InfoQ : How does the Java support for NewRelic RPM work ?
New Relic RPM can collect information from different sources .
Since it was designed for production monitoring , as well as deep diagnosis , the key is to ensure that the information it collects is relevant and that the monitoring and collecting of information does not add overhead to the performance of the application itself .
JMX , for example , provides pretty good summary metrics , but is too shallow for adequate root cause diagnosis .
We use official APIs where they exist and we complement this data with byte code instrumentation to gather deep information that enables rapid troubleshooting .
For example , RPM automatically gathers SQL explain information for slow database queries .
This can be extremely valuable for the teams responsible for monitoring and diagnosing issues as many performance problems are database related .
InfoQ : What 's your experience with bytecode instrumentation ?
Have you encountered any problems with other libraries that instrument bytecode ?
We use official APIs where they exist and we also use byte code instrumentation to instrument app server specific methods .
RPM instruments classes at load time , and has no issues co-residing with other tools that modify bytecode , such as AOP libraries .
InfoQ : What platforms and systems does your Java agent support ?
New Relic RPM supports different frameworks including Spring , Grails , and JEE .
RPM can monitor standard JEE components such as Servlets , EJBs , JDBC , Hibernate , Web Service invocations , POJO ’s , JSPs , and more .
It can also monitor applications deployed on the Spring stack .
Additionally , RPM monitors web applications deployed on WebSphere , WebLogic , JBoss , Tomcat , Jetty and Glassfish .
InfoQ :
Is there a way for 3rd parties to extend NewRelic to support new web frameworks ?
RPM was designed to allow for easy integration of third party tools and metrics .
Using RPM's API , customers can integrate data from other sources .
We also offer a REST API that allows our customers and third party software vendors to integrate RPM application performance data into their solutions .
Companies like Rightscale have been using this API for some time now .
InfoQ : NewRelic now also supports monitoring JRuby applications , in addition to MRI .
What was necessary to support JRuby ?
JRuby support is relatively straightforward .
There are some subtle differences in Ruby and JRuby methods , which RPM uses to collect information .
Once we identified and allowed for the differences , automatic instrumentation was straightforward for RPM , given its architectural flexibility .
InfoQ : Are the JRuby and the Java support related ?
RPM is unique among application performance management tools in that it provides one UI for monitoring Ruby / JRuby and Java .
There is one agent for Ruby / JRuby and one agent for Java .
Our Ruby agent and Java agent both work in much the same way and , as mentioned , both report data to the same console .
For customers running a Rails application in JRuby , we recommend they use our Ruby agent , which is fully compatible in this environment , and will offer a more relevant set of metrics .
InfoQ : NewRelic also supports Ruby 1.9 .
Do you see Ruby 1.9 adopted among your customers ?
One of the benefits of our SaaS approach is visibility into literally thousands of applications in production , and therefore have excellent knowledge of what platforms and runtime versions our customers are adopting .
We periodically share key observations on our RailsLab site ( http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/06/11/the-state-of-the-stack-a-ruby-on-rails-benchmarking-report-10-june-2009) in our “ State of the Stack ” Articles .
Based on this information , we are seeing relatively low penetration of Ruby 1.9 in our customer base , but we like to stay ahead of the curve .
When our customers move a major platform or runtime upgrade ( be it a release of Ruby , JRuby , Java , Rails , Spring , Grails , etc ) we make best efforts to support that before the market generally adopts it in production .
NewRelic RPM is available at several levels of pricing , starting with the free of charge RPM Lite .
Special offers are available for EngineYard and RightScale customers .
Seeing NewRelic RPM 's features , what do you currently use for performance monitoring in Java ?
It was just before 2 a.m. when Dhumman Kasana knelt and prayed , facing west , toward Mecca .
The mud walls of his family 's hut glowed in the flicker of a kerosene lamp .
Tea brewed over a fire .
Milk was being sloshed into butter .
Children asleep on the floor were prodded by elder siblings who were packing the burlap bedrolls :
Time to get moving .
Twice Dhumman interrupted his prayers , advising his sons about loading the bullocks with the family 's belongings .
He closed his devotion by asking Allah to help his family and their 44 water buffaloes on the journey ahead .
They travel the same route every April , migrating from the lowland forests of India 's Shivalik hills up to their summer meadows in the Himalayas , following in the footsteps of countless ancestors .
But Dhumman feared trouble this year .
Government agencies in charge of his clan 's traditional pastures had threatened to block them from entering , in the name of environmental preservation .
His family is Van Gujjar , a tribe of nomadic buffalo herders who 've migrated across north India for at least 1,500 years .
Today their population is estimated at between 50,000 and 70,000 .
Concentrated today in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand , they base their livelihood entirely on buffalo milk , which sells for between 14 and 22 rupees ( 30 to 45 cents ) per liter .
Though Muslim , they 're vegetarian and would never eat or sell their animals for slaughter :
They love buffaloes and treat them like kin , even burying them when they die .
" They come when you call their names , and when you give them affection , they return it , almost like people , " explains Sharafat , Dhumman 's 16 - year - old son .
During winter along the border of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand , the serrated Shivalik hills are covered with leafy trees ; Van Gujjar teens scamper barefoot up the highest branches , deftly lopping leaves to feed their herds .
By April , the heat rolls in ; creeks run dry and leaves wither .
The buffaloes need to head for the bugyals , the grassy alpine meadows of the Himalayas .
Families , including infants and pregnant women , trek hundreds of kilometers to reach the highlands .
When the snows return , the families and their herds descend .
For generations , this has been the cycle of Van Gujjar life .
But it may not remain so much longer .
Many Van Gujjar grazing areas have been incorporated into wildlife sanctuaries and national parks , and India has long followed a conservation policy of " no people in parks " ( except tourists ) .
Since the creation of Rajaji National Park in 1992 , park authorities have pressured the Van Gujjars who winter there to settle in villages and learn to farm .
Despite years of protest , 1,390 families have been relocated from Rajaji to settlements , where buffalo herding is impossible and their nomadic culture can't survive .
Dhumman 's clan is among the few thousand Van Gujjars who winter just west of Rajaji .
But their alpine pasturage , 120 miles farther north and 8,000 feet higher , where Dhumman has spent his 51 summers , has been absorbed into Govind Pashu Vihar National Park .
Uttarakhand 's forest department , which manages the park , has resisted admitting Van Gujjars .
Aside from environmental concerns , they assert that they do n't want Uttar Pradesh " outsiders " using state resources .
( Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh until 2000 . )
When Dhumman , his wife , Jamila , and their seven children started their migration to high pastures in April , the forest department had n't yet issued entry permits for the summer territory .
Dhumman 's family walked north along the Yamuna River , accompanied by the families of his brother and a cousin , on a route followed by hundreds of Van Gujjars .
None knew when , or if , permits would be approved .
As days passed , bringing them closer to a possible blockade at the park entry , anxieties mounted .
To linger too long in one place , they 'd run out of fodder for the herds ; to move too quickly , entering their pastures without permission , they 'd face arrest and fines .
In late April , park officials declared , " [ T ] here is no possibility of allowing these Van Gujjars entry into Govind Pashu Vihar . "
On reaching a fork in the route , with no sign of compromise by park officials , Dhumman decided to head somewhere different this summer , where maybe a couple thousand rupees ( around $ 50 ) and a few liters of milk , given to a ranger , was all the permission they 'd need .
Fighting their eviction from parklands , Van Gujjars insist that they 're a natural part of the environment and help maintain balance within the forests they rely upon for survival .
They assert that because they 've been returning to the same areas for hundreds of years , their grazing practices must be sustainable .
Conservationists , however , point to the substantial size and appetite of buffaloes as surely destructive to forests and grasslands .
" Buffalo herders are banned from the park because overgrazing and trampling causes environmental degradation , " says G.S. Rawat , a professor at the Wildlife Institute of India .
The actual environmental impact of Van Gujjar herds has never been determined , says Nabi Jha , a scientist studying alpine grasslands in Uttarakhand .
" We need to measure the land 's carrying capacity against the buffaloes ' demands before we 'll know if there 's any reason to ban Van Gujjars or limit their numbers .
Rotational grazing is often good for these meadows . "
In mid-May Uttar­a­khand park authorities abruptly reversed themselves , allowing Van Gujjars to enter this year .
It was two weeks too late for Dhumman , who was by then deep in an unfamiliar forest to the east , too far to reverse course .
The tribe 's future hinges on whether its families will be recognized in Uttarakhand as beneficiaries under India 's Forest Rights
Act of 2006 , which grants rights to " traditional forest dwellers " to the lands they 've relied on for generations .
In Uttarakhand , the act is scheduled for implementation this year .
If Van Gujjar claims are legitimized by committees established by the state 's Tribal Welfare Department , their right to migrate should be assured ; if their claims are denied , future migration will become more difficult , as families will have to scramble for new summer pastures and might be completely shut out of the highlands for good .
For Dhumman , this year was hard enough .
Usually , his migration lasts about 20 days .
This time his family was on the trail for 40 .
Along the way , children fell ill and pack animals went lame , sometimes forcing men to shoulder full saddlebags on the trail .
Once , a hailstorm swept a tree off a cliff ; it fell on a young buffalo , crushing its leg .
Refusing to abandon it , Dhumman splinted the leg , and the buffalo was carried over a 12,500 - foot mountain pass .
Upon reaching a ramshackle hut perched on the grassy slope where they 'd spend the summer , the family was disappointed .
The roof and walls would have to be repaired before it could meet the definition of shelter , and Dhumman 's brother 's family would have to build an entirely new hut nearby .
Compared with their usual camp , 4,000 feet lower , everything was more difficult .
Weather was temperamental , and ice coated their tent at night .
They were more than 15 miles ( and 6,000 feet in elevation ) from the nearest village where they could buy provisions , so food was rationed and everyone was perpetually hungry .
But perhaps worst of all , for which even the staggering views of the snow - covered , 20,721 - foot Bandarpunch massif could n't compensate , it just did n't feel like home .
The stress of the journey had taken its toll .
Jamila , Dhumman 's wife , suggested she'd be open to a government settlement program – long anathema to the fiercely independent Van Gujjars – if one was offered : " I never wanted to settle before , " she said , " because we used to be free to move around ....
But now we have no security .
Living in a village , sure , we 'd lose a lot , but at least we'd know where we'd be . "
Humor Under Communism East German Jokes Collected by West German Spies
Did East Germans originate from apes ?
Impossible .
Apes could never have survived on just two bananas a year .
Such jokes were whispered in communist East Germany -- and West German spies recorded them diligently to gain insights into the public mood , according to recently released intelligence files .

As conveyed in his recent book , “ Golden Leaf : a Khmer Rouge Genocide Survivor ” , Kilong Ung was a “ golden leaf ” propelled by the wind that blew him from one terrifying part of the world to the next .
Through adverse weather , turmoil and calamity , he was subjected to a barrage of horrors .
While two million other leaves disintegrated along the way , Ung persevered against all odds , rose above the devastation , and landed safely here in Oregon .
His legacy is the tree that took root and the many branches he has utilized to reach out to others who have experienced a similar plight .
For more than 30 years , Kilong Ung , currently a Portland software engineer , struggled with nightmares , insomnia , paranoia and haunting memories of nearly starving to death in a slave labor camp where his parents and other family members perished before his very eyes .
Ung was living in the city of Battambang in Northwest Cambodia with his parents and seven sisters in 1975 when the brutal Khmer Rouge regime took control of the country .
During its four years in power , the Khmer Rouge , led by Pol Pot , attempted to completely recreate Cambodian society by systematically imprisoning , torturing , starving and executing nearly two million people , primarily those considered urban and intellectual .
Wweek.com recounts how the Khmer Rouge invaded Ung ’s town and forced his family into slave labor camps where they worked 13 hours a day .
Daily rations were two small bowls of rice porridge , plus whatever wildlife they could catch on their own .
Although his mother grew weak , she refused to eat the rats he caught .
“ To some people , they would rather die than go that route .
My mother was one of those , ” Ung told wweek.com .
“ Eating rats — if you get to that point , you ’re pretty much dead anyway .
You ’re no longer human . ”
In addition to losing his mother and father , Ung lost his youngest sister and seven other relatives to exhaustion , starvation , and disease .
Other Cambodians were subject to torture and execution across the country ’s infamous “ killing fields ” .
The Vietnamese overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979 , and Ung fled to Thailand with his older sister and her boyfriend , according to wweek.com .
The three came to America as refugees and eventually settled in Portland .
Ung graduated from Cleveland High School and Reed College , where he earned a math degree .
Ung went on to graduate school and several well - paid jobs in the corporate world .
Along the way , he married his high school sweetheart , Lisa , and together they had two children .
But the nightmares continued , despite his successes .
Ung hoped to find a way to share his experiences with his two children , as well as honoring the survivors and non-survivors of the atrocities .
He decided to write a book to achieve both objectives .
This summer , he self - published his memoir and is hoping his book will help to heal the wounds that continue to plague his homeland .
The book depicts the cruel , agonizing and ravenous life inside a labor camp from a survivor ’s perspective .
He describes burying his grandmother , his frantic attempt to catch and eat a rat and his degrading arrest for stealing a coconut , among other painful and horrific experiences .
“ On the one hand , I wanted to free myself from this memory .
On the other hand , I was afraid to lose that memory , ” Ung told wweek.com .
“ Anything I put down in the book , I am clear from it now ….
and my nightmares are better . ”
According to The Oregonian , Ung hopes his memoir will “ leverage the past ” and help his native country .
He plans to use some of the proceeds from the sale of the book to build a school in Cambodia , which he plans to name “ Golden Leaf . ”
Ung also hopes to encourage others in the Cambodian community through his leadership and involvement as a language teacher , youth mentor and past president of the Cambodian American Community of Oregon ( CACO ) , which provides support for members of the Cambodian community .
His aspires to serve as a bridge between the Cambodian and American communities and hopes his successes will inspire and motivate others .
Mardine Mao , current president of the CACO , told The Oregonian that what sets Ung apart from fellow survivors is his ability to transform pain and suffering into something positive .
“ His work is a great example that ordinary people can do extraordinary things .
It provides an inspiration to those of us that may want to share similar stories , ”
“ I ’ve lost so much , ” Ung told The Oregonian , “ and if I do nothing with the past , all that has happened would have happened for nothing .
A book becomes evidence .
It becomes a legacy , a document . ”
Ung is a living testament to the power of faith and forgiveness — that through these virtues one can rise above life ’s seemingly insurmountable challenges and not only survive , but thrive .
The drought that gripped the Southeast from 2005 to 2007 was not unprecedented and resulted from random weather events , not global warming , Columbia University researchers have concluded .
They say its severe water shortages resulted from population growth more than rainfall patterns .
The researchers , who report their findings in an article in Thursday ’s issue of The Journal of Climate , cite census figures showing that in Georgia alone the population rose to 9.54 million in 2007 from 6.48 million in 1990 .
“ At the root of the water supply problem in the Southeast is a growing population , ” they wrote .
Richard Seager , a climate expert at the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory who led the study , said in an interview that when the drought struck , “ people were wondering ” whether climate change linked to a global increase in heat - trapping gases could be a cause .
But after studying data from weather instruments , computer models and measurements of tree rings , which reflect yearly rainfall , “ our conclusion was this drought was pretty normal and pretty typical by standards of what has happened in the region over the century , ” Mr. Seager said .
Google upgraded the beta version of its Chrome browser yesterday , adding integrated bookmark synchronization and boasting of a 30 % speed improvement over the current production edition .
Chrome 4.0.223.16 , which runs only on Windows XP , Vista or Windows 7 , includes the ability to sync bookmarked sites across multiple computers , said Idan Avraham and Anton Muhin , a pair of Google software engineers who announced the beta on a company blog late on Monday .
Bookmark sync requires that all the machines being kept in step run the Chrome beta , and that the user has a Google account , such as a Gmail username and password .
The browser syncs bookmarks using Google Docs , the company 's Web - based application suite .
There 's no way to set the interval between synchronizations , but Avraham and Muhin said that " any changes you make to your bookmarks will appear on all synced computers in just a few seconds . "
Google is using the same servers based on XMPP ( Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ) that power its Google Talk instant messaging service for Chrome 's sync .
Most other browsers can sync bookmarks only with special add - ons , such as the free Xmarks , which is compatible with Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) , Mozilla 's Firefox , Apple 's Safari , and Chrome .
Opera Software 's Opera is the only other browser that currently offers free built - in bookmark synchronization .
Mozilla , however , launched its Weave project in late 2007 , and in September of this year updated the synchronization service to version 0.7 .
Avraham and Muhin also touted Chrome 4.0's faster JavaScript rendering speeds .
" We 've improved performance scores on Google Chrome by 30 % since our current stable release , and by 400 % since our first stable release , " they said , referring to Chrome 3.0 , which left beta in mid-September and the original Chrome that Google unveiled 14 months ago .
Google measured its JavaScript speed using rival Mozilla 's DOM Core benchmark suite .
Chrome 4.0 is available for Windows only , although Google has been working on versions for Linux and Mac OS X for months .
The Mac version -- the latest is 4.0.223.11 -- has remained in Google 's " dev " channel since June , indicating its not ready for official beta testing .
A message posted to the Chromium - dev forum by a Google employee , however , indicates that the Mac team is pushing forward .
" Our goal for this Friday is to be able to count our Mac P1 M4 release blocker bugs on one hand ( we 're in the 20s now ) , " wrote Mike Pinkerton .
In Pinkerton 's message , " P1 " represents the highest - priority bugs , while " M4 " is a designation for " Milestone 4 . "
Chrome accounted for about 3.6 % of all browsers used last month , according to just - released data from Web measurement company Net Applications , but Chrome gained more market share in October than either Firefox or Safari .
Chrome 4.0 beta for Windows can be download from Google 's Web site .
A federal judge has ruled in Apple 's favor in its lawsuit against Mac - clone maker Psystar .
Prevailing in the court battle seems like it should be a good thing , but what Apple really gets out of the victory is limited market share potential .
Uhm , congratulations ?
Obviously , I am not a lawyer , but it does seem like Apple 's case against Psystar was pretty solid .
In order to make the Mac operating system work on the PC clone hardware Psystar had to actually hack part of the operating system and replace it with unique code of its own .
Even if Apple was being compensated , the result still seems that Psystar was profiting from a derivative work that violates Apple 's copyright .
U.S. District Court Judge William
Alsup explains in his ruling " In sum , Psystar has violated Apple 's exclusive reproduction right , distribution right , and right to create derivative works . "
I do n't agree that Apple should have the ability to restrict the hardware that I install the Mac OS X software on , but based on the application of existing laws I can understand why Apple won this case .
The fact that Apple can leverage existing law to maintain draconian control over how its products are used is a flaw with the laws and their application , not with Apple .
I do n't understand or agree with most copyright law and EULA restrictions as they pertain to computer hardware and software .
As far as I am concerned , Apple dictating what hardware I can install Mac OS X on is like Doubleday Books telling me where I am allowed to read Dan Brown 's The Lost Symbol , or like Sony restricting me from playing The Taking of Pelham 123 on a Toshiba DVD player .
Imagine if other industries worked like that .
Let 's use cars as an example .
You pay $ 30,000 for the privilege of indefinitely ' borrowing ' a Chevy Camaro , but General Motors reserves the right to tell you where you can park it .
And , if you try to customize or modify it in any way , like changing the factory - default rims or installing a new stereo system , General Motors sues you for creating a ' derivative work ' .
There would be riots .
I fully understand that I can't reproduce the product in part or whole for redistribution as my own .
Got it .
But , once I have paid Apple for my copy of Mac OS X it should n't be Apple 's business any longer what I do with it .
If I want to modify it to make an automated toaster oven , or use the DVD as a coaster for my coffee mug that should be my prerogative .
Its mine , I paid for it .
This judgment comes in the wake of the recent update Apple released for the Mac OS X operating system that prevents users from creating ' Hackintosh ' systems .
By removing support for the Intel Atom processor , Apple effectively disabled the ability for users to install Mac OS X on inexpensive netbook hardware .
The Psystar case and the Hackintosh ' update ' both work to ensure that Apple retains complete , draconian control of every aspect of Mac ownership .
From developing the operating system , to what hardware the operating system can run on , to where you can buy the hardware and software , Apple dictates the customer experience .
The result is a solid operating system and a wonderful customer experience , with little or no potential of growing much beyond its current market share .
Apple seems to be generating huge profit and maintaining high customer satisfaction just fine though , so choosing draconian control over market dominance seems to be working out OK .

Lobbyists are quitting the business at a record pace , according to a study released Monday .
Over 1,400 lobbyists " deregistered " with Congress in the second quarter of 2009 , according to a study conducted jointly by the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) and OMB Watch .
Typically , only a few hundred lobbyists quit each quarter .

The giant spike in resignations came just after the Obama administration instituted strict new rules on lobbyist activity .
The White House banned employees from receiving gifts from lobbyists and announced that any lobbyist hired by the executive branch could not work on the same issues on which he or she lobbied .
“ While we ca n’t draw a direct link between the president ’s executive order and the increased pace of terminations during the second quarter of 2009 , we can say that they came at a most controversial time , ” said Lee Mason , director of Nonprofit Speech Rights for OMB Watch .
The report also found that since January 2008 , lobbyists are quitting at a faster pace than they are being replaced .
Over 18,000 lobbyists have deregistered , while only 15,310 have registered .
But the study 's authors warn that not all of the deregistered lobbyists may actually be out of business .
" At the federal level , many people working in the lobbying industry are not registered lobbyists , instead adopting titles such as ' senior adviser ' or other executive monikers , thereby avoiding federal disclosure requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act , " CRP and OMB Watch said in a statement .
Legitimate dealers , museums and private collectors have a financial incentive to pay for expert excavation and analysis of artifacts , because that kind of documentation makes the objects more valuable .
A nation could maintain a public registry of discoveries and require collectors to give scholars access to the artifacts , but that can be accomplished without making everything the property of the national government .
The timing of Dr. Hawass ’s current offensive , as my colleague Michael Kimmelman reported , makes it look like retribution against the Westerners who helped prevent an Egyptian from becoming the leader of Unesco , the United Nation ’s cultural agency .
But whatever the particular motivation , there is no doubt that the cultural - property laws have turned archeological discoveries into political weapons .

In his book “ Who Owns Antiquity ? ” , James Cuno argues that scholars have betrayed their principles by acquiescing to politicians who have exploited antiquities to legitimize themselves and their governments .
Saddam Hussein was the most blatant , turning Iraqi archeology museums into propaganda for himself as the modern Nebuchadnezzar , but other leaders have been just as cynical in using antiquities to bolster their claims of sovereignty .
Dr. Cuno advocates the revival of partage , the traditional system in which archeologists digging in foreign countries would give some of their discoveries to the host country and take others home .
That way both sides benefit , and both sides have incentives to recover antiquities before looters beat them to it .
( To debate this idea , go to nytimes.com /tierneylab . )
As the director of the Art Institute of Chicago , Dr. Cuno has his own obvious motives for acquiring foreign antiquities , and he makes no apology for wanting to display Middle Eastern statues to Midwesterners .
“ It is in the nature of our species to connect and exchange , ” Dr. Cuno writes .
“ And the result is a common culture in which we all have a stake .
It is not , and can never be , the property of one modern nation or another . ”
" Adults only " rental ads , immigrants shoved into substandard apartments and single mothers turned down arbitrarily are just some of the discriminatory practices a new human rights policy spells out as illegal .
Housing is a human right , Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Barbara Hall said this morning as she introduced what she calls the first policy of its kind in Canada .
Now , tenants and landlords alike in Ontario will have clear rules about their rights and obligations when it comes to rental housing .
The policy , released at a news conference at the downtown YMCA in Toronto , puts together two years of research into housing discrimination that involved hundreds of people and dozens of organizations in Toronto , Ottawa , Kitchener and Sudbury .
The study found that some tenants in Ontario face evictions after a long hospital stays , sexual harassment to keep apartments , racial discrimination and neighbourhoods that band together to keep out social housing .
Eid Ismail , who is blind , talked about being denied a unit by alandlord who insisted he had no ground - floor apartments available , even when Ismail said he had no problem getting to upper floors .
Vince Brescia , president of the Federation of Rental Housing Providers of Ontario , talked of his concern that accommodating people who are physically disabled could bankrupt small landlords .
Hall said the policy is flexible enough to give them a recourse if they prove an elevator in a single four - storey building , for example , would be too expensive for a landlord .
Legal decisions and the Ontario Human Rights Code itself already lay out what constitutes discrimination in housing ; this new policy focuses on rental housing specifically .
It states that tenants cannot be refused an apartment or harassed on the basis of :
Race , colour or ethnic background
Religious beliefs or practices
Ancestry , including native descent
Place of origin
Citizenship , including refugee status
Gender , including pregnancy or sexual orientation
Family status
Martial status , including having a same - sex partner
Disability

Age , including teens 16 and older who are no longer living with their parents
Receiving public assistance .
For landlords , the policy spells out what they can and can't do in screening for tenants :
They can ask for rental history , credit references and do credit checks
They can ask for income information and use that together with other important income information
They can only use income information to decide if a person has enough money to cover the rent
They can not use the " 30 per cent rule " — whether rent is 30 per cent or less of the person 's income — to turn down a tenant
They can ask for a guarantor to sign the lease , but only if all tenants are asked .
A United Nations report last year declared Canada was in the midst of a " national housing crisis . "
A patchwork of federal , provincial and municipal agreements govern affordable housing .
Canada is the only major country in the world without a national housing strategy .
In Ontario , a family of four on welfare gets only $ 660 a month for housing .
In Toronto , the average monthly rent for a two - bedroom apartment is almost twice that .

Las Vegas
Some sections of the storm drains are decorated with graffiti
The state of Nevada has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the US .
But even though there are more than 14,000 homeless people in Las Vegas , it is easy to spend a weekend in Sin City and never see signs of a crisis .
Most tourists take in Vegas from the interior of a casino - slot machines , blackjack tables , cocktail waitresses in impossibly tiny outfits .
If you are willing to pay the price of admission , a lift can transport you to more excess upstairs - rooftop pools and lavish suites .
But what if there were a lift that descended below the sunken lounges , past kitchens and utility closets , through layers of concrete , into the ground beneath the casinos ?
Here , you would see another , very different , version of the city : the storm drains .
Tunnel network Matt O'Brien , a Las Vegas writer , has been exploring this underworld for several years .
In 2007 , he published a book , Beneath the Neon , about exploring the 300 miles of tunnels that criss - cross beneath the strip .
The evening I meet him , he is wearing heavy boots , and carrying a backpack and industrial - sized flashlight that could double as a weapon .
" I 've been exploring these storm drains for more than five years , " he says , sloshing through muck and gravel that blanket the tunnel floor .
" I think I know these storm drains better than anyone who does n't actually live in them .
And I know the storm drain system probably - and this is nothing to brag about - better than anyone else . "
Just because you 've been in the drain the day before , that does n't mean it 's going to be the same environment the next day
Matt O'Brien
Author
It is after 9 pm on a weekday night .
Above , the Vegas strip is coming to riotous life .
Gamblers are laying bets , showgirls are flourishing their feathers .
Below , in utter darkness , the storm drains echo with the faint sounds of dripping water .
At one point , the tunnel widens to form a chamber .
A flashlight reveals the plump , almost illegible cursive of graffiti lettering covering the walls - beautiful colours and designs .
" This is one of the underground art galleries that I discovered down in the storm drains , " Mr O'Brien says .
Noises make me stop and shine the light back in the other direction .
Mr O'Brien understands this impulse .
" There 's always the butterflies , " he says .
" There 's always that apprehension when you walk into a storm drain .
Just because you 've been in the drain the day before , that does n't mean it 's going to be the same environment the next day .
" I 've met people down in the drains - you 'll come down the next day , and all of a sudden , you know , they 'll tell you to screw off .
They 'll ... make it clear they do n't want to talk to you today . "
Over the years , Mr O'Brien has met more than 100 people who live in the tunnels .
Thanksgiving dinner
We head away from the trickling water , down a side channel that stays dry most of the time .
The ceiling gets lower , the corridor narrower , and the air becomes stale with the faint scent of body odour and human waste .
We come upon an encampment - a cardboard lean - to where two men are sitting in the glow of candlelight .
One of them is slumped on a couch .
In front of him , on a makeshift coffee table , are a few hypodermic needles .
The other man is better groomed , wearing a button - down shirt and a decent pair of trousers .
They greet Mr O'Brien enthusiastically .
Matt O'Brien still visits the tunnels , even though his book is finished The men are introduced as Brian and Steve .
They have not seen O'Brien since he was down here at Thanksgiving last year .
Steve talks about how they returned to their camp that day to find Mr O'Brien had left them Thanksgiving dinner .
" Big turkey and stuffing .
It was pretty good , " he says .
Steve is the well - dressed one .
He is 42 and grew up in Las Vegas .
He makes his living at casinos around town , doing what is known as " silver mining " : looking for credits left behind on slot machines .
" You know , I 'll start at Harrah's .
And depending on how I feel , I 'll go to either the Venetian and the Mirage .
A lot depends on how I look , because those are two very hard places .
If you do n't look right , they 'll stop you and watch you .
It 's always busy at Harrah's , so you 're able to walk through the casino without drawing much attention to yourself . "
To blend in , Steve has to dress the part .
At his " bedroom " ( demarcated by cardboard walls ) , he has got racks of shirts and trousers .
He has a queen - sized bed , a dresser , and even a makeshift shower .
Needles and bottles
Steve says his luck varies .
The night before , he had visited several casinos , and things had not been going well .
" Then I went to the Bellagio .
I was walking through and turned the corner in one area of the casino , and there on the machine was $ 116 ( £ 70 ) .
Nobody around , so I hit the cash - out button .
Took it , cashed it out , and that was the end of my night .
Helped me out today .
I ate very well today .
I had a late breakfast last night .
And I still have about 50 bucks left , " he says .
But Steve is addicted to methamphetamine and gambling , so holding on to money can be difficult .
" That 's what I 'm trying not to do is gamble my money away any more .
And as far as the drugs , I 'm trying to slowly get myself to where I do n't crave it , " he says .
" Tonight , I 'm taking it easy .
I figure I 'll just call it an early night and see what I can do tomorrow , " he says .
There are certain things about underground Vegas that I prefer to above ground Vegas
Matt O'Brien
After a while in the Las Vegas storm drains , it is easy to lose one 's bearings - to forget that directly above is a very different world .
" You can be in the Hard Rock Casino , which is one of the hipper , kind of younger , richer casinos in town , kind of celebrity - watching people , people - watching , betting $ 1,000 per hand in a game of blackjack .
And right underneath the Hard Rock is one of the worst Skid Rows I 've ever seen in my life , " Mr O'Brien says .
There are broken bottles , hypodermic needles strewn all over the tunnel floor and people passed out .
" And last time I was down there , I actually saw some blankets and teddy bears and stuff , which gave me the impression that a young kid was living down in there with a mom or dad , or both . "
That contrast is what keeps Mr O'Brien coming back to the tunnels .
He brings food and clothing to people like Brian and Steve .
The tunnels have become a kind of refuge for him from the city .
" When work was n't going all that great , or my relationship with my girlfriend was n't that great , I would strap on the boots and grab my flashlight , my gear in the trunk .
And a lot of times I would just gear up and walk a tunnel , " he tells me .
" In some ways , there are certain things about underground Vegas that I prefer to above ground Vegas . "

Jack pointed out the lameness and creepiness of the Blood Energy Potion , but it gets lamer and creepier .
The makers are touting it as being the best way to deal with your imagined vampirism while drinking faux blood .

Yes , here comes the lameness in pretty much the funkiest way of saying that something will give you a four hour energy boost I 've seen in a while :
Blood Energy Potion is packed with iron , protein and electrolytes , providing up to four hours of energy .
This blood drink features the same color , consistency and tactile experience of real blood , quelling those otherworldly cravings that polite mortal society frowns upon .
It is important to understand that Blood Energy Potion is not a treatment for Vampirism , but regular use may help control certain symptoms of Bloodlust , including : Unquenchable thirst
Irritability
Restlessness
Inability to control behavior
Insomnia
Brutal , violent attacks
Homicide
Odd choice of advertising aside , his creepy goop is now available for $ 3.99 a shot ( less than the six buckeroos we previously thought ) and I , for one , am gonna try it out just to see if it 'll quell those homicidal urges .

September 22 is the anniversary of the most widely known version of an old vaudeville routine – the “ Slowly I turned ” shtick .
In this classic comedy bit , the name of a certain place causes a husband to recall how his wife ran away with another man and how he took his revenge on the wife - stealer when he found him .
The Three Stooges made “ Niagara Falls ” that place in their short film Gents Without Cents , which was released on September 22 , 1944 .
Today , most people know what comes after “ Niagara Falls , ” even if they never saw that Stooges film :
“ Niagara Falls !
Slowly I turned , step by step , inch by inch ... ”
As he says these words the husband gets so worked up he starts demonstrating on an innocent listener how he smacked , poked , punched and otherwise took his revenge on the wife - stealer .
When the poor listener is reeling from the blows , the husband suddenly realizes what he ’s doing , stops and apologizes .
Ah , but then , the listener accidentally mentions the place name again – triggering another “ Slowly I turned ” rant and another beating .
In Gents Without Cents , the Stooges do a stage show in which Moe and Larry both get triggered by “ Niagara Falls ” and Curly is the recipient of their smacks , pokes and punches .
Other comedians , such as Joey Faye and Abbott and Costello , did their own versions of the routine before and after the Stooges , using other trigger words .
But , for some reason , the Three Stooges ’ Niagara Falls version is the one that has stuck in our language and brains .
Along with those eloquent words : “ Nyuk ! Nyuk ! Nyuk ! ”
Here are some of the other famous quotes and phrases linked to SEPTEMBER 22 :
It is ironic that President Barack Obama would travel to China and speak against government control over the internet .
If the American Department of Homeland Security has its way new cybersecurity laws will enable Obama ’s administration to take control of the internet in the event of a national crisis .
How that national crisis might be defined would be up to the White House but there have been some precedents that suggest that the response would hardly be respectful of the Bill of Rights .
Many countries already monitor and censor the internet on a regular basis , forbidding access to numerous sites that they consider to be subversive .
During recent unrest , the governments of both Iran and China effectively shut down the internet by taking control of or blocking servers .
Combined with switching off of cell phone transmitters , the steps proved effective in isolating dissidents .
Could it happen here ?
Undoubtedly .
Once the laws are in place a terrorist incident or something that could be plausibly described in those terms would be all that is needed to have government officials issue the order to bring the internet to a halt .
Government intrusion in the private lives of citizens is already a reality , particularly in the so - called Western Democracies that have the necessary technology and tech - savvy manpower to tap phones and invade computers .
In Europe , draconian anti-terrorism laws enable security agencies to monitor phone calls and e-mails , in many cases without any judicial oversight .
In Britain the monitoring includes access to detailed internet records that are available for inspection by no less than 653 government agencies , most of which have nothing whatsoever to do with security or intelligence , all without any judicial review .
In the United States the Pentagon recently sought an internet and news " instant response capability " which it dubbed the Office of Strategic Influence and evidence is growing that it has seeded a number of retired military analysts into the major news networks to provide a pro-government slant on the war news .
The State Department is also in the game , tasking young officers to engage presumed radicals in debate on their websites .
There also is the warrantless wiretapping program , which continues under the Obama administration in spite of pre-electoral promises that it would be stopped , while the growing use of national security letters means that private communications carried out using the internet can be accessed by Federal law enforcement agencies .
The national security letter , established by the PATRIOT Act , is an investigative tool that is particularly insidious as it does not require judicial oversight .
More than 35,000 were issued by the FBI last year and the recipient of a letter commits a felony if he or she reveals the receipt of the document .
In a recent case involving an internet provider in Philadelphia , a national security letter demanded all details of internet messages sent on a certain date , to include account information on clients with social security numbers and credit card references .
The free flow of information on the internet has also produced a reaction among those who are more concerned with getting out a specific message .
If you have noticed the frequent appearance of bloggers and " talkbackers " on the various internet sites who write in less than perfect English and who always support attacking Iran and are defensive about Israel , sometimes overwhelming sites with garbage messages , you are not alone as it is clear that a sustained effort is underway to intimidate , influence opinion , and suppress opposing views .
The United States and Israeli governments have taken the lead in putting out propaganda over the internet and there are also indications that several European countries , including Britain and Germany , are engaged in creating regulatory hurdles and countering information that they do not approve of .
When the debate is open and the interlocutors are identifying themselves as government representatives one might well argue that the process is healthy as it permits a genuine exchange of views , but where the government hand is hidden the exchange should be regarded as little more than propaganda , what the old Soviet Union might well have referred to as " agitprop . "
The focus on war by other means over the internet is important , if only because it means that governments are using their vast resources to spread propaganda in a deliberate effort to confuse the debate over important foreign and domestic policy issues .
Israel is at the forefront , exploiting its cutting edge telecommunications industry and enabled by its large and powerful diaspora to get out its message .
Not surprisingly , its lobbies including AIPAC are also leaders in the effort , sometimes acting openly and sometimes covertly .
Israel became heavily engaged on the internet during its devastating assault on Gaza last January , when world opinion came down strongly against it , recruiting teams of young soldiers and students to blog in support of Operation Cast Lead .
It has recently focused on the UN ’s Goldstone Report that claimed that Tel Aviv had committed numerous war crimes in Gaza , supporting a worldwide organized campaign to discredit anyone promoting the report .
The latest victim of the smear has been the respected and nonpartisan group Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) .
In June Israel ’s Deputy Prime Minister pledged that his government would " dedicate time and manpower to combating " human rights organizations .
Shortly afterwards Ron Dermer of the Israeli Prime Minister ’s office named Human Rights Watch as one of the offending organizations .
Many attacks on HRW were subsequently carried out openly using various front organizations , including NGO Monitor which is based in Jerusalem and funded by wealthy Americans .
Elie Wiesel , who cashes in on his humanitarian credentials while remaining notably silent over Israeli war crimes , is on the Monitor board and has written a letter attacking HRW .
Critical pieces in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times soon followed the initial attacks , commentary that was distributed widely by AIPAC on Capitol Hill and also all over the internet .
Israel ’s Foreign Ministry , headed by right - wing extremist Avigdor Lieberman , runs a semi- covert program which is openly funded by the government as the " internet fighting team " but which deliberately conceals the affiliation of the " talkbackers . "
Ilan Shturman coordinates the Ministry effort , which is run out of the Hasbara Department , " hasbara " being a Hebrew word that is normally translated as propaganda .
Shturman ’s young and enthusiastic employees work from a prepared script of official Israeli government positions .
They are instructed not to identify themselves either as Israelis or as government employees .
There have been numerous applicants to work for Shturman .
An Israeli source reports that one applicant emphasized his own qualifications , writing " I ’m fluent in several languages and I ’m able to spew forth bullsh*t for hours on end . "
But there is also concern that the program will further distort the news cycle which is already suffering from deliberately misleading government leaks , making it impossible to discern what information that is surfacing is being fabricated .
One Israeli critic of the Foreign Ministry program has described it as part of a " thought police state . "
And the effort is increasingly international in nature .
During the attack on Gaza , Shturman headed an effort to obtain the assistance of Jews abroad , recruiting a " few thousand " to work with his Israeli volunteers to bombard hostile websites with Israel - friendly commentary .
Much of the chatter is in English , though the teams also work in the other principal European languages .
Recent immigrants from the Israeli government ’s Ministry of Absorption have been recruited and used to attack sites in their own more exotic native languages .
The Israeli government program is expected to increase .
A private advocacy group called Give Israel Your United Support has a reported 50,000 activists who use a specially developed software called megaphone that sends an alert when anti-Israeli commentary appears , permitting supporters to bombard the hostile site with their own comments .
In July , 5,000 members of the World Union of Jewish Students were given the megaphone software .
There are also reports that several American Christian evangelical groups have indicated that they are interested in helping the cause .
The goal is to have hundreds of thousands of activists worldwide who are prepared to place messages supportive of Israel .
The danger is real .
Most Americans who are critical of the actions of their own government rely on the internet for information that is uncensored and often provocative , including sites like Antiwar.com .
As the United States generally follows Israeli initiatives for security it is likely only a matter of time before Obama ’s internet warfare teams surface either at the Defense Department or at State .
Deliberately overloading and attacking the internet to damage its credibility is all too possible ; witness the numerous sites that have been " hacked " and have had to shut down or restrict their activities .
American citizens who are concerned about maintaining their few remaining liberties should sound the alarm and tell the politicians that we do n’t need more government advice on what we should think and do .
Hands off the internet .
Rapper Shyne is expected to be released from prison today , as initially reported on HipHopDX this August [ click to read ] .
The 30 year - old rapper a/k / a Jamal Barrow was sentenced to 10 years in June of 2001 for charges stemming from a high - publicized 1999 shooting incident involving Diddy and Jennifer Lopez .
During his eight - plus year sentence , the Brooklyn emcee was incarcerated at Riker ’s Island , Woodbourne and Clinton Correctional Facility .
Since the incident , the rapper released his only two albums : 1999 ’s platinum self - titled album on Bad Boy Records , and 2004 ’s Godfather Buried Alive [ click to read ] release on Def Jam , including a song recorded through the phone from prison .
In the last eight years , the rapper has been speculated and rumored to sign with various labels including Murder Inc. , Death Row Records and most recently Roc Nation .
The rapper has confirmed none of these rumors , and spoken few times publicly , most recently to XXL magazine .
Diddy spoke to HOT97 recently on Shyne ‘s release , stating , “ It ’s a blessing that he ’s coming home … I spoke to him like a couple of weeks ago and he sounded like he was in good spirits .
I know he ca n’t wait to get home .
I know he is definitely going to heat the whole scene up .
He was definitely one of [ many ] talented young artists that I had the pleasure to work with .
I ’m quite sure he ’s been using his time wisely and has some heat . ”
HipHopDX will keep you posted upon Shyne ‘s actual release today .
FOR all the 21st century ’s medical expertise , societal judgements still taint illness : cancer patients are to be pitied , those with heart disease probably gorged on fatty food , and people with herpes just were n’t careful enough .
Andrew Scull ‘s sharp and witty biography of hysteria , part of Oxford University Press ’s new “ Biographies of diseases ” series , explores the history of a condition that was once practically a fashion statement , so strongly linked was it with breeding and social superiority .
Its treatment ranged from the bizarre pharmacopoeia of strychnine , mercury and morphine to alpine spas and leeches on the labia .
However primitive the …
I realise I am walking willingly into the snares of the toxic sisterhood by admitting this , but as a woman ( and elected students ' union officer )
I think the new crop of male - specific support groups that are springing up across universities is actually a pretty good sign .
Groups such as the MENS society ( Masculinity Exploring Networking and Support ) at the University of Manchester and Oxford University 's MC - O ( Man Collective - Oxford ) have been caught in a maelstrom of feminist outrage .
Here in Manchester , the MENS society has had just about everything thrown in its way to stop it being formalised as a society , from condemnatory letters from the NUS women 's officer to a squabble over the suitability of its original name .
Back in October I ran a debate piece in the University of Manchester student newspaper , on whether or not the students ' union should ratify the MENS society ( then just simply the Men 's society ) .
I am still receiving letters about it now .
While , undoubtedly , there must still be concerns about how genuine the welfare - based aims of the MENS society and their Oxford brethren may prove to be , it seems that a whole lot of valuable feminist energy has been directed at prohibiting groups like these – and to what end ?
Now the MENS society is formally established ( and making national headlines to boot ) , it seems that all that has been achieved is a rather soured relationship between those defending women 's rights and those who would tackle enduring male stereotypes .
Hardly a brick in the road to true gender equality .
And frankly , the feminists are missing a trick .
If you accept that the remaining gender inequalities – be they in the City , in the boardroom , in Whitehall or in the apportioning of domestic chores – are the more pernicious , institutional inequalities , then the welcoming of men's rights / welfare / support groups is not only immensely practical , but a smart PR move too .
Feminism needs to give the public a good reason to sit up and realise that there 's more to it than a puffed - up sense of vegan self - righteousness .
We have reached a stage where a majority of women do not associate a fight for gender equality with their daily lives .
Now , when we 're talking of gender inequality , it comes down to the persistent and seemingly immovable notions as to what is " male " and what is " female " .
And this is where the feminists should willingly accept the help of men .
The time has come and gone for games of " she who shouts loudest wins " and the ghastly rhetoric of " having it all " .
We need a seismic shift in how we perceive gender roles , something that cannot come from enfranchising the female of the species alone .
Yet now that some young men are finally saying this very thing , feminists have refused to listen .
As Sarah McCulloch , the female treasurer of the MENS society at Manchester puts it : " It 's important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society , and I do n't believe that we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women 's liberation movement – men have their own problems . "
And if you 're looking for a succinct example of why male and female activists need to work together , why not Google " maternity leave " and witness the ocean of bile that swims before your very eyes .
Because what makes the furore kicked off by Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman 's damning assertions about maternity rights notable beyond the usual observations about women being their own worst enemies , is the conspicuous absence of voices pointing out the fundamental inequality when it comes to parental leave .
The fact that women are effectively legislated into assuming the role of primary carer by a lack of comprehensive paternity leave allowance is precisely the kind of issue that feminists and men's support groups should be tackling together .
But that would be far too logical now , would n't it ?
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has removed controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio ’s authority to arrest suspected undocumented immigrants on the streets based solely on their immigration status .
Carolyn Trowbridge , a Tucson , Ariz. , immigrant rights activist and a state board member of the American Civil Liberties Union , said the government ’s move was correct .
The Maricopa County sheriff “ has clearly violated people ’s human rights on a grand scale ” in tracking down and sweeping up anybody with brown skin , she said in a phone interview .
“ In most cases he is clearly out of his jurisdiction and clearly he is also out of his mind , ” said Trowbridge .
“ The guy is a maniac . ”
Trowbridge said Arpaio is known for causing confrontations with small town mayors and chiefs of police who speak out against his immigration roundups .
“ Arpaio and his posse will arrest anybody who looks like an immigrant and his definition of ‘ illegal ’ is anybody with dark skin , ” she said .
“ Racism plays a major role here . ”
Arpaio has arrested 33,000 immigrants in the past two years .
Trowbridge recalled how a father , a legal resident , and his U.S. citizen son were picked up by Arpaio ’s men on the street and taken to the father ’s workplace where an immigration raid was in progress , where they were arrested on the spot .
The controversial sheriff had sought a renewed agreement with federal officials to allow him to conduct both field arrests and immigration checks at his jails .
However a high - level Homeland Security official recently presented Arpaio with a document allowing the county sheriff to conduct only jail checks of immigrant status , not street arrests over immigration .
In a ranting press conference Oct. 6 Arpaio said he plans to press on , using state laws , to round up immigrants .
He said he would drive suspects picked up on the streets to the border if federal officers refused to take them into custody .
If Arpaio violates the Homeland Security decision , Trowbridge said , “ I hope he comes up against the full force of the federal government and is held accountable for his actions . ”
Homeland Security officials said they are in the process of reviewing their agreement with the sheriff ’s department and the other 65 agencies that participate in a Bush administration program allowing local and state police to make immigration arrests .
Immigrant rights activists and lawmakers are urging the Homeland Security Department to terminate the program , known as 287 ( g ) after the section of the 1996 law that authorized it , saying it has led to racial profiling and other abuses .
Last week , the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote to President Obama asking him to immediately end the program due to complaints of shocking abuse .
A recent Government Accountability
Office report said the program was not supervised , often leading to the arrest of minor offenders instead of the criminals it was supposed to pursue .
Since the department announced it was reviewing the program , two agencies in Massachusetts have withdrawn from the program .
Orlando Arenas , 28 , a volunteer with “ Puente ” ( Bridge ) , an immigrant rights group in Phoenix , said , “ The 287 ( g ) program should be completely terminated .
It should n’t be reformed , it should be ended entirely .
Do n’t amend it , end it . ”
“ Here in Maricopa County , ” he said , “ the immigrant and migrant community lives in fear and as a Mexican American what concerns me the most is the constant racial profiling . ”
“ We need immigration reform that includes everybody including day laborers because people cannot continue living in the shadows , ” Arenas said .
He called Arpaio “ evil ” and said the sheriff exercises his power to intentionally hurt the Latino community there .
Arpaio has more officers , 160 , with special immigration enforcement powers than any other local police agency in the country .
In March , the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division announced it was investigating Arpaio ’s office on accusations of racial profiling , discrimination and unconstitutional searches and seizures .
“ There needs to be a real change in how we view immigration rights in this country and I ’m heartened to know that the Obama administration is looking at this process in a more humane way , ” said Trowbridge .
She said what ’s needed is real comprehensive immigration reform , and people should be allowed to come here and a build a life without being attacked by people like Arpaio .
“ Immigrants come here to work because they have to , ” Trowbridge said .

Jake Towne , running as an independent private citizen for United States Congress in Pennsylvania 's 15th District encompassing the Lehigh Valley and parts of Berks and Montgomery counties challenged Republican incumbent Charlie Dent , and Democrat challenger John Callahan to a public debate on the issues facing the district and the nation .
In his letter , Towne noted a great need for a healthy public debate on topics ranging from our health care , the wars abroad , the economy , and the stability of the dollar .
He related that many people in the district are hurting financially , and they want answers from their candidates for government now .
Towne is a Lehigh Valley native raised in Nazareth and holds a chemical engineering degree from Lehigh University .
He returned home earlier this year from a nearly 4 - year stint in Shanghai , China working in the semiconductor industry to run for Congress .
His experiences living abroad have given him a deep appreciation for America 's freedoms and quality of life .
Towne strongly believes that the actions of career politicians in Washington , DC , are leading our country down a path of both moral and economic ruin .
He has created a novel - yet - simple plan of transparent and accountable government called the “ Our Open Office ” concept which can be read in detail at the campaign website , www.TowneForCongress.com.
Last week Towne raised over $ 2700 from 74 donors in a single day in an online “ money bomb ” created by grassroots supporters not affiliated with the campaign .
This week he will be interviewed by Judge Napolitano at the FOX News studios in New York .
Two weeks ago , Towne was part of a panel of FOX's Freedom Watch show taped on the campus of Drexel University .
Towne extends an invitation to any local group to invite him to meet their members , listen to their concerns , and explain his campaign .

Dear Congressman Dent and Mayor Callahan –
I respectfully challenge either of you to a debate concerning our congressional race .
I am open to either one - on - one debate or debating both of you at the same time .
While I can understand a reluctance on your parts to a debate so early before the November 2010 election – and that since you both are members of political parties that use the optional primary system so additional challengers are still possible – there is a great need for a public discourse on the troubles facing our nation .
We are the only three candidates currently registered with the FEC .
The times we live in are not normal .
The dollar is in crisis and unemployment is rampant .
Civil liberties are restricted more with each passing day .
We have apparently endless wars continuing in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
I am traveling the district and the people are hurting .
Congress 's solutions of more spending through the stimulus plan and more taxation via the Cap and Trade bill on energy and even our health care seem dubious at best .
Regardless of our differences in views as candidates , we owe it to the public to debate on these issues .
Mayor Callahan , per the FEC you began your campaign on July 31 , 2009 .
As of today , your website only contains an email sign - up .
Why have you been unable to provide a website to the people with your stances on the critical topics facing our nation after 3.5 months as a candidate ?
Congressional races should not be similar to sports teams duking out a popularity contest , we should have a healthy debate on the issues – for the good of the PEOPLE .
Reply if you like by simply confirming whether you are open to one - on - one debate with me , or a group debate between the three of us FEC - registered candidates , or both .
After the next ten business days , I will deem no reply as a negative to both questions .
Respectfully ,
Jake Towne
2010 Candidate for US Congress , PA -15
Liberty , Sound Money , the Rule of Law , and Accountability

If the word " feedsack " conjures up thoughts of burlap , then you probably were n't around before 1960 .
From the mid 1920s through the beginning of the 1960s , products bought in bulk were packaged in colorful sacks made from cotton .
And even though they are collectively referred to as feedsacks , the most common products packaged in the sacks were flour and sugar .
Sack packaging first appeared in the 19th century , but those sacks were made from white or unbleached muslin .
Even so , the sacks were saved and reused , or they were cut and sewn into clothing and household goods .
The printed and colored sacks came about as part of a clever marketing scheme .
Someone at one of the many sack factories realized that they could sell more sacks if their sacks were somehow more desirable .
The idea was that people would request printed sacks if they needed extra fabric to match a sack they already had .
The idea was successful and soon printed sacks were commonly used as packaging .
Consumers loved them and soon many Americans were making everything from aprons to underwear from the bags .
One 100 pound bag was large enough to make a simple blouse , but it took at least three bags to make a dress .
The bag manufacturers even distributed booklets like the one at the left , which gave suggestions for using the bags in different ways .
Republicans had to look for a very long time at last week ’s Field Poll of California voters to find something remotely uplifting as they ponder the 2010 state elections .
There it was , eventually : Against San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , a Democrat running for governor , the assorted GOP candidates were losing by only single digits .
But they were losing to Newsom , a candidate who was behind in his own party ’s primary by 20 points and who had a net unfavorable rating among all voters questioned by the poll .
Former governor and current Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown was clocking not only Newsom but also his potential GOP general election foes , each by more than 20 points .
Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer , like Brown a longtime punching bag and fundraising tool to the Republican Party , was also running double digits ahead of her two potential Republican challengers in the 2010 race .
All told , even as Democrats find themselves on the defensive nationally , California inhabits a different political planet .
There is no hint of a backlash against incumbents of the sort that Republicans nationally have hoped will help them gain seats in Congress and in statehouses .
That is key in California , given the experience of the Democratic candidates and the neophyte nature of the biggest - named Republicans .
Just as troubling to Republicans , the poll served to remind them of the continued Democratic hold on younger voters .
Unless arrested and reversed , it could eventually make the party ’s current challenging times look rosy in the rear - view mirror .
True , blizzards of attack ads have yet to fall .
True , the only poll that counts -- as losing candidates often proclaim -- is the one on election day .
And true , polls can be on soft ground as they measure match - ups featuring many candidates -- in this case mostly the Republicans -- about whom voters know little .
“ I do n’t necessarily think the Republicans do n’t stand a chance , ” as Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo put it .
Right now , however , there is one group in which they really do n’t , and that is among younger voters .
The conundrum for the state Republican Party and its candidates : how to get ethnically diverse voters who demand healthcare reform and environmental protection to side with a party associated with neither , and whose icon remains a former president elected before they were born .
In match - ups against Republicans in the race for governor , both Brown and Newsom did better as voters grew younger , although Brown also won among older voters .
Taking the hint , GOP state party chief Ron Nehring blasted Brown via press release for his “ last failed governorship . ”
Democrats have a driving impetus to corral younger voters in 2010 .
Generally speaking , newcomers are perceived to be free - floating and unattached in their early voting years ; a party that manages to attract them for several elections in a row stands a good chance of keeping them indefinitely .
Many of the young voters in question streamed to the polls for the first time in 2008 .
If Democrats ’ dreams are realized , the youngsters will stick with the party -- much as young voters attracted in 1980 to President Reagan formed the bulwark of the conservative revival of the 1990s and beyond .
“ If they can get them for two to three election cycles , they ’re pretty much locked in , ” said Republican pollster Steve Kinney .
That said , he added , “ that ’s easier said than done . ”
In California , for one thing , many of the young did not register as Democrats but as “ decline - to - state ” voters with allegiance to candidate over party .
Nonpartisan voters are the swiftest - growing class of California voters and , according to Kinney , fully half of those who registered that way between 2006 and 2008 were under 30 .
Trying to reach them where they live , Republicans this week will unveil a pod-cast available on ITunes in which party chief Nehring and guests discuss issues and GOP positions .
Party leaders are also becoming Twitter - philes and are active on Facebook .
“ Everyone knows the other team did a better job harnessing technology last time , ” said Nehring .
Unlike their parents , the new voters “ are getting a plurality of their news online , so we have to be there . ”
The GOP argument to them is that the party ’s historic advocacy of lower taxes will translate into more jobs .
“ We want to be sure that young people can stay here , ” he said .
“ California ’s economy is in the tank , and in the tank in part because we have economic policies in this state that drive jobs elsewhere . ”
Democrats , too , are trying to attract voters through “ text messaging , Twitter , e-mail , the whole thing , ” said party chairman John Burton .
Unlike Republicans , Democrats have opened their party primary to nonpartisan voters , in part to help lure young voters in .
“ If you ’re young and you ’re concerned with things , whatever it is -- jobs , global warming . . . -- clearly the future for people is within the Democratic Party , ” he said .
The fight for younger voters is likely to be a long - term siege .
Unlike the 2008 election , when younger voters embraced President Obama ’s reach for history , the 2010 California elections stand to involve less compelling candidates against a backdrop of spiraling state difficulties .
“ They have this interest in it , ” pollster Kinney said of the upcoming elections .
“ The difference is : Do they have interest and passion ?
Or do they just have interest ? ”

Each Sunday , The Week examines implications of major stories .
It is archived at latimes.com / theweek
This is one of the most unusual motorcycles I ’ve seen in a long time : it ’s a ‘ Killinger und Freund ’ built in 1935 in Munich , Germany .
The art deco styling is obviously eye - catching , but it ’s hiding something even more interesting : this machine has a driven front wheel , like the Rokon Trail - Breaker .
And underneath that huge front fender is the engine itself .
The motor is a sizeable 600 cc two - stroke triple — or perhaps three one - cylinder engines joined together .
Yet the bike was reportedly very light , at just 135 kg .
There ’s obviously a story behind this picture too : is the soldier an American who found the bike in the dying days of the war , and posed for a picture taken by a colleague ?
The Allies rolled into Munich on 30 April 1945 , and Wikipedia reports “ One motorcycle was discovered by the US Army in the spring of 1945 at a German military installation , but it is not known if this was the original prototype or another Killinger und Freund Motorrad . ”
If you can cast any further light on this oddity , please let us know .

Cash on the Sidelines ?
Last week , the Australian Financial Review was doing its best to spruik the ongoing prospects for the Australian share market in their front page article “ Cashed - up funds have $ 70 bn to invest ” .
The article is only available online to subscribers , but this quotation sums it up :
analysts cite the volume of cash stockpiled as a reason for stocks to keep rising
Mostly consisting of quotations from people in the equity business ( who all arguably stand to benefit from talking up the market ) , the authors do include some data to support the proposition as well :
The latest data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that fund managers have increased their cash holdings to about 18 per cent of the $ 880 billion they manage , or about $ 160 billion .
If managers were to return their cash holdings to more normal levels , there would be about $ 70 billion available for investment , with the local sharemarket receiving up to $ 30 billion .
The image of a wall of cash on the sidelines waiting to spill over into equity markets is compelling , but does it make sense ?
The power of this commonly used image arises from the idea that cash is somehow transforming into shares , when of course for every buyer there is a seller who gets the cash , so share trading never changes the total amount of cash in the system ( note that aggregate money supply can change through central bank operations and banking deposit creation , but that is a whole other story beyond the sharemarket and is not part of the standard “ cash on the sidelines ” argument ) .
Of course , this does not stop share prices from going up or down .
So , if the cash in the system does not change , what is going on ?
For a start , most commentators who consider cash on the sidelines to be a driver of stock prices look at the percentage of total assets held in cash ; this post on the Market Thoughts blog is a good example .
The problem with this approach is that , while it creates an apparent correlation , it is trivial and has no predictive power .
This is because a fall in the value of shares ( or indeed any risky asset class ) will reduce the aggregate value of investment assets and , with the total amount of cash staying constant , the percentage in cash automatically increases .
It will then decrease again when shares increase in value again .
But of course , this means that the move in cash percentages is coincident with movements in share prices and provides no better prediction than simply saying “ shares have fallen and eventually they will go back up ” .
A more sophisticated interpretation is to say that “ cash on the sidelines ” does not mean aggregate cash in the system , but refers specifically to cash held by a segment of the market , namely investors in money market funds ( the figure most often measured ) .
The argument could go something like this : many investors target asset allocation mixes and if their cash holdings become too high , they would be forced to buy more shares , thereby adding to demand for shares , shifting the demand curve and pushing prices higher .
I have a few problems with this argument .
First , if this phenomenon is significant , why would the cash imbalance have arisen in the first place ?
Presumably because investors became more risk averse and demand for shares decreased .
If so , I would argue that what would push share prices up is sentiment : investors become less risk averse and increase their demand for shares once more .
This may , as a consequence , push the cash in the segment back down if investors ’ net buying was from participants outside their segment .
If so , I would see that the change in cash is a consequence of a change in demand , not the cause .
Second , by segmenting you need to consider not only the demand side , but the supply side .
Investors cannot simply trade among themselves , otherwise the cash in their segment would not change .
Their increased holding of cash would have to be offset by a reduced holding in cash by other segments , such as the corporate segment , which may affect the supply curve .
A plausible scenario would be that corporates , starved of cash , begin issuing shares to raise cash , possibly at a discount to market prices .
In the process , they channel the cash back from the investor segment and push share prices down .
While I am not saying this would happen , I do n’t think it is much less plausible than the explanation that excess cash shifts the demand curve for investors .
A related point is that the segment of investors with money in money market funds is bigger than asset allocators .
While asset allocators may feel the pressure of their cash holdings increasing relative to their target , other investors may be becoming more risk averse , offsetting the effect of the asset allocators .
So much for theoretical arguments .
Since this is the Stubborn Mule , I really should look at what the data says .
The AFR article refers to Australian Bureau of Statistics data on the cash holdings of fund managers .
Looking at the history of cash and deposits held by fund managers and comparing it to the Australian All Ordinaries share price index , there is no obvious pattern of increases in cash holdings leading to rises in share prices .
Fund Managers ’ Cash and the Share Market ( 1988 -2009 )
In case there is a hidden pattern in these time series charts , we can also look at a plot of quarterly changes in the share price index against changes in cash holdings of fund managers .
Cash versus Share Prices ( 1988-2009 )
There are a few outliers in this chart , but certainly nothing to support the claim that cash on the sidelines can push the market up .
Of course , it may be that there is a lag before the effect on share prices takes effect , so here is a plot where changes in the All Ordinaries index are lagged by six months .
Cash versus Lagged Share Prices ( 1988-2009 )
Even with the lag , there are a couple of occasions where an increase in cash was followed by share market rises , but the biggest cash build - up was followed by share market declines and for more modest changes in cash levels , the change in the share price index is distributed across gains and losses .
So , neither theory nor data supports the cash on the sidelines argument .
And finally , I ’ll just note if you believed in the argument back when the article I linked to above was published , you would have gone long stocks in June 2008 !
So , the next time you hear someone talking about all the “ cash on the sidelines ” , tell them they are talking nonsense .
UPDATE : Commenting on this post , James suggested calculating the correlation between changes in cash balances and changes in share prices for a variety of time lags .
The chart below takes up this suggestion .
The correlations are quite variable , which is consistent with my contention that build - ups of cash do not drive share prices .
But it is also interesting to note that , if there is a pattern to be found , it is that the correlations are mostly negative , suggesting that increases in cash are more often followed by share price declines not rallies .
Correlation of Cash and Lagged Share Prices ( 1988-2009 )
I should concede that this chart , which stretches out five years ( 20 quarters ) , ends up looking for correlations far beyond where even the most hopeful “ cash on the sidelines ” advocates would expect to see a relationship .

Here 's what the future Mayor Johnson wrote in The Spectator shortly after the bomblings of 7 July 2005 :
The Islamicists last week horribly and irrefutably asserted the supreme importance of [ their ] faith , overriding all worldly considerations , and it will take a huge effort of courage and skill to win round the many thousands of British Muslims who are in a similar state of alienation , and to make them see that their faith must be compatible with British values and with loyalty to Britain .
That means disposing of the first taboo , and accepting that the problem is Islam .
Islam is the problem .
To any non-Muslim reader of the Koran , Islamophobia - fear of Islam - seems a natural reaction , and , indeed , exactly what that text is intended to provoke .
Judged purely on its scripture - to say nothing of what is preached in the mosques - it is the most viciously sectarian of all religions in its heartlessness towards unbelievers ....
It is time that we started to insist that the Muslim Council of Great Britain , and all the preachers in all the mosques , extremist or moderate , began to acculturate themselves more closely to what we think of as British values .
Emotions ran high after that cruel atrocity in Central London , so perhaps allowances should be made .
Also , if you read the whole article , you 'll see that Boris 's argument is more nuanced than this extract might make it appear .
Even so , his claim that Islam is intrinsically an obstacle to Muslim loyalty to Britain seemed pretty unequivocal .
Compare it with what he said during a Politics Show debate last April as Mayoral election polling day approached :
The problem is people who wrench out of context quotes from the holy book of Islam , the Koran , and use it to inspire evil in men 's hearts .
That is a fact that few serious people would deny and we need to tackle the extremists .
So three years after 7/7 Boris no longer seemed prepared to say that " Islam is the problem " only that a minority of Muslims who deliberately misinterpret its scripture are .
And now this , uttered at the East London Mosque last Friday :
I urge people , particularly during Ramadan , to find out more about Islam , increase your understanding and learning , even fast for a day with your Muslim neighbour and break your fast at the local mosque .
I would be very surprised if you did n't find that you share more in common than you thought .
This has excited much comment , most penetratingly at Harry 's Place where ( via Conservative Home ) some rather unBritish connections of the mosque 's imam are documented at length .
My interest here , though , is in Boris 's intriguing journey from an anti-Islam , pro-" Britishness " position where he called for Muslims to align their faith with " British values " to one where he urges everyone who 's not a Muslim to sample an Islamic lifestyle .
Perhaps the answer lies in something else he said in Whitechapel last week :
Whether it's in theatre , comedy , sports , music or politics , Muslims are challenging the traditional stereotypes and showing that they are , and want to be , a part of the mainstream community ... Muslims are at the heart of every aspect of society .
Their contribution is something that all Londoners benefit from .
Muslim police officers , doctors , scientists and teachers are an essential part of the fabric of London .
Islamic finance is contributing to the economy by changing the way Londoners invest , save , borrow and spend .
There are valuable lessons that people of all backgrounds can learn from Islam such as the importance of community spirit , family ties , compassion and helping those less fortunate , all of which lie at the heart of the teachings of Ramadan .
It really does appear that " Islam is the problem " no more - quite a conversion .
Is it because Boris believes that his call for British Muslims to embrace " British values " has been heeded in the four years since he made it , or might other factors be at play ?
Is n’t this the elephant in the room ?
Secular enviros are scared to death to mention it , as are religious ecologists .
Those most willing are the engineer - rationalist types , who have been warning of overshoot for decades now .
It ’s well past time this issue was brought into the deliberations on global ecological deterioration .
The human - earth relationship reached a critical moment when we pushed the planet past biocapacity , sometime around 1986 .
World population then was around 4.8 billion
The latest figures , from 2006 , put us at 130 % of biocapacity , with the average biocapacity at 5.25 acres / person , whereas the average footprint ( carbon , developed land , and food / fiber / timber ) was 6.725 .
World population now is 6.7 billion .
Population is definitely a critical component of our current , and potentially fatal , overshoot .
Even at 4.8 billion , we were squeezing out other species ’ habitat , and the extinction curve that is currently accelerating , now well over one hundred species a day , was already rising .
But it is absolutely critical to note the relative proportion of biocapacity used by the rich and the poor .
The wealthiest 1 billion now use 100 % of biocapacity ( Jim Merkel , Radical Simplicity ) !
The remaining 5.7 , living marginally in cities and rural areas , use the overshoot amount .
This does not mean we would reach steady - state if we simply got rid of those rich billion , which includes you and me .
The desperately poor repeatedly cut down fledgling trees and sometimes eat “ bushmeat ” in the form of our simian cousins , simply to survive .
But George Monbiot details the huge damage that the wealthy inflict upon the earth in a sobering recent post .
Despite global recession , wealth is increasing in some nations , along with population .
The human drive for more and better has the developing world rapidly becoming just like us , or at least like the Europeans , who maintain half the carbon footprint of the US .
For example , the biggest growth in car sales is in China and India .
Along with the cars comes a huge growth in infrastructure as roads and parking space replacing crucial farmland .
China no longer feeds itself , and though India , thanks to the Green Revolution , remains a net exporter of food , it is rapidly replacing arable land with sprawling cities and hydrodams .
As for highway development , in 1968 I watched a motor rally on one of three national highways in India , spectators five - deep all along the route .
It was one and a half lanes wide , heading north - south through Madhya Pradesh , across the Malwa Plain .
Drivers were lucky to make it much past 40 miles / hour .
Now India is building the Golden Quadrilateral , an interstate highway system reaching all the major cities .
Paved roads are reaching further and further into the hinterlands , helping booming economic development .
Many of those who owned cars ten years ago in places like Mumbai only had them as status symbols , because traffic density precluded actually driving them .
Now vehicular embodied energy will be compounded by actually using petroleum and cement , as well as sacrificing land .
Subsistence farming , requiring additional family members to work the land , severely stresses the land , and competes too successfully for habitat needed by other species .
But when one compares their modest footprint with the industrialized billion who feed at the top of the chain , the differences are huge .
( See my previous post on the Remnant of the Meek ) .
We in the US consume twice the carbon that Europeans and Japanese do , but seventeen times the amount consumed in Malawi .
So having a child is a much more important decision in our culture than theirs , whose death rate has moreover doubled due to the scourge of AIDS .
We know that the principal indicator of number of offspring is the level of female education .
Wherever young women have increased their level of education , the birthrate has significantly dropped .
So it concerns me that highly educated and materially comfortable young couples in the US frequently have more than two children .
If you inquire a bit , their usual answer is that they want to increase the pool of “ good genes , ” with occasional references to the rate of population growth among the underclasses , especially those of alien cultures and religions .
In a world that is already overpopulated , and the lifestyle of those with relative wealth the most significant factor in resource use , a decision to have only one biological child is much more ethical ( see Bill McKibben , Maybe One , where he argues convincingly against the myth of psychic scarring from being an only child .
See also the powerful graphic in New Solutions ( # 8 , March 2006 ) for the huge range of resources the typical American infant will use in their lifetime : 3.3 million pounds of minerals , metals , and fuels ) .
Having two is pushing things , since the population of the developed world is already using 100 % of biocapacity .
With the figure heavily dependent on lifestyle , a global population somewhere between 2 to 4 billion would allow for several of the ecosystems currently under human assault to recover , at least partially .
Parents the world over make their own decisions about having children .
Even China has recently loosened its one child policy .
I have discussed the option of having only one biological child with each of my sons .
Jacob , the elder , thought for a long time that having one and adopting one was the way to go .
But after deliberation with his wife , they decided to have two .
Jesse is now also married , but still childless , and similarly speaks of one biological child .
But his wife , who comes from a family with four children , always speaks in the plural .
Short of the government making rules in the matter , perhaps this choice needs to be more informed by the social group .
Quaker Earthcare Witness , of which I am a member , counsels prospective parents to have a clearness committee with members of their Meeting before conceiving , to help them make the choice prayerfully after considering all the implications .
It thus becomes an extension of the clearness for marriage , which is a serious matter , sometimes requiring many meetings to explore in depth .
This seems like an intrusion of privacy to most people , but the social and ecological consequences of having a child in a rich country are enormous .
Many thoughtful people acknowledge that the earth has too many human beings on it .
If we do n’t voluntarily limit our offspring , does n’t it make sense for government to use its authority for the sake of the whole ?
The alternative is to leave matters to the Four Horsemen , who are already sharpening their swords .

A paramedic who described a diabetic woman who collapsed on a bus as " drunk " has been struck off the register of health professionals .
Jason Sefton failed to assess the woman 's condition after she became ill in Liverpool in December 2007 .
Mr Sefton , from Liverpool , swore and told the bus driver who raised the alarm that the woman was drunk .
A Health Professions Council ( HPC ) disciplinary hearing ruled that his actions constituted misconduct .
Striking the rapid response paramedic from the register , panel chairman Martin Ryder said : " This was a very serious incident .
" His behaviour was inappropriate and highly offensive towards a member of the public and a colleague .
" He clearly knew what he was doing and intended to do it . "
He had abused me , the patient , the bus driver
Chris Berry , colleague
The tribunal ruled that Mr Sefton failed to check the blood sugar level of the woman and then lied to his control room , claiming she was refusing treatment .
She was only treated after bus driver Frank Hodson insisted the woman , who was in her 50s , was examined .
Mr Sefton 's colleague , Chris Berry , realised she was hypoglycaemic and administered glucose before she was taken to hospital .
Mr Berry confronted his colleague at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and was subjected to a tirade of abuse .
He told the hearing : " I 've never experienced anything like it before in 10 years working as an ambulance paramedic .
" He had abused me , the patient , the bus driver - I just thought he 's not fit to be working for whatever reason . "
Mr Sefton , who declined to appear at the hearing , resigned from his position at North West Ambulance Service ( NWAS ) NHS Trust before the allegations were investigated .
In a letter sent to the hearing Mr Sefton spoke glowingly of his own career and denied he had answered the emergency call .
A spokesman for the NWAS said the trust accepted the findings of the hearing and fully supported the decision .

In 1920 , Ludwig von Mises wrote a comprehensive critique of the economics of socialism that launched the " calculation debate . "
The significance of his seminal essay , " Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth , " as Mises Institute Senior Fellow Joseph Salerno writes in a postscript , is that it " extends far beyond its devastating demonstration of the impossibility of socialist economy and society .
It provides the rationale for the price system , purely free markets , the security of private property against all encroachments , and sound money .
Its thesis will continue to be relevant as long as economists and policy - makers want to understand why even minor government economic interventions consistently fail to achieve socially beneficial results . "
But Mises also recognized that the economic fallacies of socialism were only part of the problem .
He accordingly extended his critique of socialism into the full - scale book Socialism : An Economic and Sociological Analysis .
There he not only comprehensively analyzed all forms of interventionism , but addressed politics , history , property , ethics , and even religion .
Indeed , for someone who was an agnostic , Mises wrote a great deal about religion .
The number of references he makes to religion is staggering , actually numbering over twenty - five hundred in his published corpus .
He mentions God over two hundred and fifty times in his writings .
There are seven references to religion on the opening page of Human Action .
His books Omnipotent Government , Theory and History , and Socialism are permeated with references to religion .
So why should we be interested in what Mises had to say about religion ?
Did not Mises himself say : " I am an economist , not a preacher of morality " ?
What Mises said about religion is important for two reasons .
Religion cannot be separated from the study of history .
The Bible itself is primarily a history book , not a religious book .
Mises had a keen sense of history , and was extremely well - read , which , in previous ages , would have included the Bible .
He recognized not only the place of the Bible in history , but its authority , even if he did n't subscribe to its tenets .
Mises actually " quotes " Scripture on thirty - two occasions throughout his writings .
So unlike many who are irreligious , Mises was knowledgeable about religion .
He mentions the doctrines , customs , occupations , and activities of various sects .
He refers to religious people and events in history .
Religious controversy and conflict is a theme he visits often : the " great schism " of the Eastern and Western Churches , anti-Semitism , the Crusades , the Inquisition , the Reformation and Counter - Reformation .
Mises 's writings are full of religious imagery :
" The Philistine will be quite prepared to give up the tickets which admit him to art exhibitions in return for opportunities for pleasure he more readily understands . "
" The idea of this third solution is very old indeed , and the French have long since baptized it with a pertinent name . "
Whether or not the Italian Fascists " knew that their gospel was merely a replica of British guild socialism is immaterial . "
From the Communist Manifesto the Progressives have learned " that the coming of socialism is inevitable and will transform the earth into a Garden of Eden . "
Some maintain that " good economics should be and could be impartial , and that only bad economists sin against this postulate . "
Socialists have " proclaimed the socialist program as a doctrine of salvation . "
" If it rains manna for forty years , other things being equal , the price of manna must go down . "
According to Marxians , " Private ownership in the means of production is the Red Sea which bars our path to this Promised Land of general well - being . "
Public opinion " looks askance at wealth acquired in trade and industry , and finds it pardonable only if the owner atones for it by endowing charitable institutions . "
Marx knew that " the final cause of historical evolution was the establishment of the socialist millennium . "
Eminent writers of history " have preached the gospel of war , violence , and usurpation . "
One cannot avoid religion when studying the works of Mises .
But there is another reason to note what Mises said about religion , for in Mises 's day , as in ours , the religious arguments for socialism prove to be the most intractable ; they stem from deep - rooted beliefs about God and man and the purpose of the universe .
And yet the arguments must be addressed .
Writing in the middle of the twentieth century , Mises observed about Christianity and socialism : " The Christian churches and sects did not fight socialism .
Step by step they accepted its essential political and social ideas .
Today they are , with but few exceptions , outspoken in rejecting capitalism and advocating either socialism or interventionist policies which must inevitably result in the establishment of socialism . "
Unfortunately , nothing has changed since Mises wrote this almost fifty years ago .
Liberal churches and denominations that have all but abandoned traditional orthodox Christianity have also abandoned the free market .
Their pleas for " equity " and " social justice " are pleas for socialism , pure and simple .
Conservative churchmen today are for the most part interventionist to the core .
Their support of government - financed " faith - based " initiatives and moral crusades , their incessant demands for constitutional amendments , and their acceptance of state intervention as long as it is on behalf of their causes are only exceeded by their ignorance of the most basic economic principles .
Read Mises ?
He was an agnostic Jew , why should I read Mises ?
Mises did not shy away from engaging religious defenders of socialism .
He rightly criticizes religious rejecters of capitalism whose only fault with Marxian socialists is " their commitment to atheism or secularism . "
Mises perceptively points out that " many Christian authors reject Bolshevism only because it is anti-Christian . "
The Church " opposes any Socialism which is to be effected on any other basis than its own .
It is against Socialism as conceived by atheists , for this would strike at its very roots ; but it has no hesitation in approaching socialist ideas provided this menace is resumed . "
But Mises did not condemn religious ideas because he was an agnostic .
To the contrary : " The popular attacks upon the social philosophy of the Enlightenment and the utilitarian doctrine as taught by the classical economists did not originate from Christian theology , but from theistic , atheistic , and antitheistic reasoning . "
It would therefore be a " serious mistake to conclude that the sciences of human action " and liberalism are " antitheistic and hostile to religion .
They are radically opposed to all systems of theocracy .
But they are entirely neutral with regard to religious beliefs which do not pretend to interfere with the conduct of social , political , and economic affairs . "
The fact is , not only atheists , but even religionists have almost universally accepted socialism and interventionism .
They are all guilty , as Mises tragically recognized : " The atheists make capitalism responsible for the survival of Christianity .
But the papal encyclicals blame capitalism for the spread of irreligion and the sins of our contemporaries , and the Protestant churches and sects are no less vigorous in their indictment of capitalist greed . "
Accordingly , Mises criticizes both religion and atheism at the same time for the same economic fallacies .
Both " Christian Socialism " and " atheist socialism " have brought about the " present state of confusion " in the world today .
Both pious Christians and " radical atheists rejected the market economy . "
Both divines and atheists rejected the ideas of laissez faire .
" Militant antitheists as well as Christian theologians are almost unanimous in passionately rejecting the market economy . "
One reason that Mises used so much religious terminology in his writings is that he viewed the supporters of the State as devotees of a religion .
The state has its priests that people consider infallible , as well as its monks to serve it .
Mises terms the idolization of the state " statolatry , " which he classifies as a counterfeit religion along with socialism and nationalism .
Supporters of " the new religion of statolatry " are even more fanatical and intolerant than were the Mohammedan conquerors of Africa and Spain .
If the supporters of the State are devotees of the religion of statolatry , the ultimate result is that the State is made into a god .
How assorted socialists and interventionists make the State into a god is a theme that appears throughout Mises 's works .
He often quotes or refers to the German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle ( 1825 –1864 ) , who actually said : " The State is God . "
And once the State is made into a God : " He who proclaims the godliness of the State and the infallibility of its priests , the bureaucrats , is considered as an impartial student of the social sciences .
All those raising objections are branded as biased and narrow - minded . "
Mises relates that the state , like a religion , considers some things to be heresy .
In discussing how governments are intent on " restricting the freedom of economic thought , " he points out how some believe that " government is from God and has the sacred duty of exterminating the heretic . "
But it is not just the religious arguments for socialism that are so deep - seated .
Today it is the same with regard to the religious arguments for war .
We can make a case against war , the most violent of all socialist means , and do it with economic , historical , and philosophical arguments .
And yet , many supporters of war on Iraq care nothing about these issues .
This is true about religious arguments for any subject .
Make an issue a religious issue , and the indifferent and apathetic suddenly become interested .
Connect religion with a cause and someone will be willing to die for it .
What drives many supporters of this war is faith .
In particular , they have come to believe that Christianity has licensed this war and God has blessed it and the nation that pursues it , or at least that is what they outwardly profess .
( Although I find it strange that over 1,400 dead American soldiers is God 's way of blessing America . )
Actually , however , Christian advocates of the war in Iraq are more like the Moslem armies that Mises refers to who " conquered a great part of the Mediterranean area " while believing that " their God was for the big , well - equipped , and skillfully led battalions . "
Those concerned about the future of freedom need to follow Mises 's example and not shy away from engaging these religious arguments .
I have made an attempt to do so in my book Christianity and War and Other Essays Against the Warfare State .
There I contend that Christian enthusiasm for the state , its wars , and its politicians is an affront to the Savior , contrary to Scripture , and a demonstration of the profound ignorance many Christians have of history .
Christians who condone the warfare state and its nebulous crusades against " evil " have been duped .
There is nothing " Christian " about the state 's aggressive militarism , its senseless wars , its interventions into the affairs of other countries , and its expanding empire .
Paul Craig Roberts has recently pointed out how " evangelicals , aghast at Vietnam era protests of America 's war against ' godless communism , ' turned to the military as the repository of traditional American virtues . "
Unfortunately , the same thing was basically done in regard to the Republican Party .
A point I do not raise in any of the essays in my book is a possible reason why some evangelical Christians are so quick to support the state and its coercive arm of aggression , the military , in its various wars and interventions .
That reason is their support of state intervention in general .
Intervention at home leads inevitably to intervention abroad , as Mises says when writing about the economics of war : " What has transformed the limited war between royal armies into total war , the clash between peoples , is not technicalities of military art , but the substitution of the welfare state for the laissez - faire state . "
The religious arguments for socialism and war are really arguments for the state .
Conservatives who decry the welfare state while supporting the warfare state are terribly inconsistent .
Mises reminds us that " whoever wishes peace among peoples must fight statism . "
Those who want " peace among nations must seek to limit the state and its influence most strictly . "
Interventionism of any kind is a curse because " government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action .
Government is in the last resort the employment of armed men , of policemen , gendarmes , soldiers , prison guards , and hangmen .
The essential feature of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating , killing , and imprisoning .
Those who are asking for more government interference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom . "
There are no sensible , logical arguments , religious or otherwise , for socialism , interventionism , or war .
Religious arguments can and should be dealt with at every opportunity .

One of the most elegant courtship rituals in the animal kingdom has been captured on film by a BBC crew .
The dance of the weedy sea dragon takes place every year in the shallow seas off the coast of Australia .
During the ghostly dance , two beautifully odd - looking fish mirror each other 's every movement .
At the end of the ritual , the male fish is the one to get pregnant , giving birth two months later , a process the BBC crew filmed for the first time .
The dance of the weedy sea dragon is captured for the BBC natural history series Life .
You feel you have seen the most intimate moments of their lives
Life producer Adam Chapman
Weedy sea dragons are a type of fish related to seahorses and pipefish .
Two species exist .
The weedy sea dragon ( Phyllopteryx taeniolatus ) lives among weed beds in the seas off the southern coast of mainland Australia and Tasmania .
The leafy sea dragon ( Phycodurus eques ) lives further along the southern and western Australian coast .
When a male and female weedy sea dragon come together to mate , they perform an elaborate courtship ritual known as a " mirror dance " .
Looking for a partner " It 's an amazingly engaging sequence , because it is so beautiful and graceful , and yet totally observed , " says Adam Chapman , a BBC producer who helped film the behaviour with cameraman Doug Anderson .
" There is no sense that they are at all concerned about anything other than each other . "
The mirror dance usually takes place in the fading evening light .
In a graceful duet , each partner mirrors the actions of the other , swimming and wriggling their bodies .
" What 's so lovely is you feel you have seen the most intimate moments of their lives , " says Mr Chapman .
The ritual usually takes place in spring .
With the help of independent biologist and leading sea dragon expert Mr Pang Quong , the BBC filmed the sequence in October , around two miles southeast of Melbourne .
After two months , the results of the courtship are revealed .
A baby sea dragon is born Sea dragons , seahorses and pipefish are the only fish species in which the males carry and raise the young .
In doing so , the male weedy sea dragon keeps them safe until the eggs are ready to hatch .
After two and half weeks of diving , Mr Anderson caught the act of a male sea dragon giving birth on camera .
The " dance of the sea dragon " is broadcast within the Fish episode of the BBC series Life at 2100BST on BBC One on Monday 2 November .

Blair confronts ' evil ideology '
SPECIAL REPORT QUICKVOTE
Do you agree with UK PM Tony Blair that the London bombings were driven by " evil ideology " rather than opposition to any policy ?
Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS London Acts of terror or or Create Your Own LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair met Muslim leaders on Tuesday to discuss ways of tackling homegrown Islamic extremism in the wake of the July 7 terrorist attacks in London .
Blair said that those present -- clerics , lawmakers and business leaders -- shared a " strong desire " to " confront this evil ideology , take it on and defeat it by the force of reason . "
The meeting comes as a new poll published by the Guardian newspaper revealed that two - thirds of Britons believed the London bombings were linked to the UK 's role in the war in Iraq .
Some 33 percent said Blair bore " a lot of responsibility " for the attacks which killed 56 people , including the four suspected bombers , and injured more than 700 .
A further 31 percent said he bore " a little " responsibility .
Three - quarters of those polled also believed further suicide attacks were likely .
Speaking after Tuesday 's meeting , Blair rejected speculation that British foreign policy had influenced the London bombers .
" When people talk about the links between Iraq , Afghanistan or Palestine and what has happened , yes it is true these people will use these things as an excuse , " said Blair .
" My view is that they will use whatever is going on in foreign policy to justify what they do ... or just generally the fact that Britain is an ally of America .
" It is not that their means are wrong but their ends are right .
Everything about their ideology and what they stand for is wrong . "
Blair 's comments followed Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissal of a report by two leading think tanks which claimed that Britain 's close alliance with the U.S. over Iraq had put the country at particular risk of terrorist attack .
( Full Story ) Meanwhile wire services reported that Pakistani security forces had detained 25 people as part of an investigation into possible links between Islamic militants and the London attacks .
On Monday Pakistani intelligence and immigration officials told CNN that two of the suspected bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , and Shahzad Tanweer , 22 , had traveled to Karachi in November 2004 .
( Full Story ) Tuesday 's meeting with Muslim representatives at Downing Street was also attended by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition leaders Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy .
Blair , who also met Afghan president Hamid Karzai on Tuesday , described the talks as " heartening . "
" The meeting revolved around a very strong desire of people from right across the Muslim community in our country to be united , not just in a condemnation of the terrible terrorist attacks here in London but also to confront and deal head - on with the extremism that is based on a perversion of the true faith of Islam , " Blair told a press conference .
Lawmaker Shahid Malik , parliamentary representative for Dewsbury where one of the bomb suspects lived , said that Muslims faced a " profound challenge . "
" We recognize we 've got to work better at confronting those evil voices -- as minute as they are -- inside our communities , " he said .
Muslim representatives have expressed shock that the four men suspected of carrying out the bombings were all born in the UK .
On Monday British imams issued a fatwa condemning violence that will be read at mosques during prayers later this week .
The religious edict ruled that suicide bombings were " vehemently prohibited . "
Conservative party leader Howard said the Muslim community had a responsibility " for reaching out to those who have been the targets of the merchants of evil and hatred . "
CNN 's European Political Editor Robin Oakley said the government wanted better regulations controlling the admittance of imams and holy leaders into the UK and " stricter standards applied to those who influence impressionable young people . "
Iqbal Sacranie , secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain , the country 's largest Islamic group , told Reuters that any initiatives should be based on a partnership between government , police and faith organizations .
" The Muslim community should not be treated as a problematic community , but treated as a community that is willing to play its role in the mainstream , " said Sacranie .
But Anjem Choudary , UK leader of the militant Islamist group al - Muhajiroun , told BBC radio that Muslim leaders should not meet Blair for talks .
Choudary said that no division between moderates and extremists existed in Islam and refused to condemn the London attacks .
" I do n't think one should legitimately sit down and negotiate .
I think the time for talking , quite honestly , is over .
Now is the time for action .
You can't sit down and negotiate while you are murdering Muslims in Iraq , " said Choudary .
On Monday evening British Home Secretary Charles Clarke announced plans to introduce new antiterror legislation before the end of the year that would ban militant preachers from inciting terrorism .
The measures , which include a new offence of " indirect incitement to terrorism , " will be put before lawmakers in October .
The bill would forbid activities such as accessing terrorist Web sites and acquiring bomb - making materials and make it an offence to undergo terrorist training .
It would also ban preachers who praise terrorist attacks .
" We believe that is the right way to go and we believe it will enable us to address the threat which we face with the unity and determination which is critical , " Clarke said after talks with his Conservative and Liberal Democrat counterparts .
The British government faced fresh criticism on Tuesday over revelations that security services failed to detain one of the bombers after linking him to an alleged plot to explode a truck bomb in London .
UK newspapers reported that Mohammad Sidique Khan had visited a man allegedly involved in the plot , which led to eight arrests in March 2004 .
The eight suspects are due to face trial later this year .
Charles Shoebridge , a security analyst and former counterterrorism intelligence officer , told The Associated Press that if the report was true it would be " evidence of an enormous failure . "
The New York Times on Monday claimed that British intelligence officials had concluded less than a month before the bombings that there was no group intent on or capable of launching an imminent attack , prompting the government to lower its formal threat assessment from " severe defined " to " substantial . "
The newspaper , citing a confidential intelligence report , said the assessment was particularly surprising because it stated that terror - related activity in the UK was a direct result of the country 's role in the war in Iraq .
( Full Story ) " Events in Iraq are continuing to act as motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist related activity in the U.K. , " the report said .
