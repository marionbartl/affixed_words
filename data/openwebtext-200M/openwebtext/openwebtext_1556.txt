In 1970 , the remarkable Miles Davis released a genre bending album called “ Bitches Brew ” , and a new level of passion and design was introduced to the world of music .
Davis brought a surreal fusion of jazz and rock to the open ears of the world with this album which still blows my mind .
So thank you very much Miles for your inspiration , cause Dogfish Head founder and beer legend Sam Calagione for the 40th anniversary of this album are creating a threaded beer with three primary fermentations to be released in August .
As reported by BeerNews.org , it is a blend of three different unique Dogfish beers which was just tested earlier this week .
Once again , I love this kind of collaboration and creativity that is coming out of craft brewing – very excited guys !
Below is a description of Bicthes Brew and its impact on music culture .
“ The revolution was recorded : in 1969 Bitches Brew sent a shiver through a country already quaking .
It was a recording whose very sound , production methods , album - cover art , and two - LP length all signaled that jazz could never be the same .
Over three days anger , confusion , and exhilaration had reigned in the studio , and the sonic themes , scraps , grooves , and sheer will and emotion that resulted were percolated and edited into an astonishingly organic work .
This Miles Davis was n’t merely presenting a simple hybrid like jazz - rock , but a new way of thinking about improvisation and the studio .
And with this two - CD reissue ( actually , this set is a reissue of the original set plus one track , perfect for the fan who ’s not so overwhelmed as to need the four - CD Complete Bitches Brew box ) , the murk of the original recording is lifted .
The instruments newly defined and brightened , the dark energy of the original comes through as if it were all fresh .
Joe Zawinul and Bennie Maupin ’s roles in the mix have been especially clarified .
With a bonus track of “ Feio ” –a Wayne Shorter composition recorded five months later that serves both as a warm - down for Bitches Brew and a promise of Weather Report to come–this is crucial listening . ”

Microelectromechanical devices — tiny machines with moving parts — are everywhere these days : they monitor air pressure in car tires , register the gestures of video game players , and reflect light onto screens in movie theaters .
But they ’re manufactured the same way computer chips are , in facilities that can cost billions of dollars , and their rigidity makes them hard to wrap around curved surfaces .
MIT researchers have discovered a way to make microelectromechanical devices , or MEMS , by stamping them onto a plastic film .
That should significantly reduce their cost , but it also opens up the possibility of large sheets of sensors that could , say , cover the wings of an airplane to gauge their structural integrity .
The printed MEMS are also flexible , so they could be used to make sensors with irregular shapes .
And since the stamping process dispenses with the harsh chemicals and high temperatures ordinarily required for the fabrication of MEMS , it could allow MEMS to incorporate a wider range of materials .
Conventional MEMS are built through a process called photolithography , in which different layers of material are chemically deposited on a substrate — usually a wafer of some semiconducting material — and etched away to form functional patterns .
Since a wafer is at most 12 inches across , arranging today ’s MEMS into large arrays requires cutting them out and bonding them to some other surface .
Instead of using a wafer , the MIT researchers begin with a grooved sheet of a rubbery plastic , which is coated with the electrically conductive material indium tin oxide .
The researchers use what they call a “ transfer pad ” to press a thin film of metal against the grooved plastic .
Between the metal film and the pad is a layer of organic molecules that weaken the metal ’s adhesion to the pad .
If the researchers pull the pad away fast enough , the metal remains stuck to the plastic .
“ It ’s kind of similar to if you have Scotch tape on a piece of paper , ” says Corinne Packard , a postdoc in the Research Lab of Electronics at MIT who led the work , along with professors of electrical engineering Vladimir Bulović and Martin Schmidt .
“ If you peel it off slowly , you can delaminate the tape very easily .
But if you peel fast , you ’ll rip the paper . ”
Once the transfer pad has been ripped away , the metal film is left spanning the grooves in the plastic like a bridge across a series of ravines .
Applying a voltage between the indium - tin - oxide coating and the film can cause it to bend downward , into the groove in the plastic : the film becomes an “ actuator ” — the moving part in a MEMS .
Varying the voltage would cause the film to vibrate , like the diaphragm of a loudspeaker ; selectively bending different parts of the film would cause them to reflect light in different ways ; and dramatically bending the film could turn a smooth surface into a rough one .
Similarly , if pressure is applied to the metal film , it will generate an electric signal that the researchers can detect .
The film is so thin that it should be able to register the pressure of sound waves .
Serendipity
The discovery of the manufacturing technique , which the MIT team describes in a forthcoming issue of the journal Advanced Materials , was a happy accident .
The researchers were actually trying to use a printing technique to build an electrical circuit .
They had created a plastic stamp with a pattern molded into it and were trying to transfer that pattern to a thin sliver film .
They had expected that the plastic would pull away the silver it made contact with , leaving behind an electrode that could control an organic light - emitting diode .
Instead , however , the stamp kept pulling away the entire silver film .
“ The first couple times we did this , we were like , ‘ Ah! Bummer , man , ’ ” says Bulović .
“ And then a light bulb went off , and we said , ‘ Well , but we just made the world ’s first printed MEM . ’”
The stamp was intended as a means of creating an electronic device ; instead , it ended up serving as the basis for a device itself .
The researchers ’ ensuing work was on the ideal architecture for the device and on ways to minimize the metal film ’s adhesion to the transfer pad and maximize its adhesion to the grooved plastic .
Because the researchers had n’t set out to make MEMS , and because , to their knowledge , their films constitute the first stamped MEMS devices , they ’re still trying to determine the ideal application of the technology .
Sheets of sensors to gauge the structural integrity of aircraft and bridges are one possibility ; but the MEMS could also change the physical texture of the surfaces they ’re applied to , altering the airflow over a wing , or modifying the reflective properties of a building ’s walls or windows .
A sheet of thousands of tiny microphones could determine , from the difference in the time at which sound waves arrive at different points , where a particular sound originated .
Such a system could filter out extraneous sounds in a noisy room , or even perform echolocation , the way bats do .
The same type of sheet could constitute a paper - thin loudspeaker ; the vibrations of different MEMS might even be designed to interfere with each other , so that transmitted sounds would be perfectly audible at some location but inaudible a few feet away .
The technology could also lead to large digital displays that could be rolled up when not in use .
John Rogers , a researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign who has pioneered techniques for printable electrical circuits , is particularly intrigued by the idea that printable MEMS could incorporate materials that are incompatible with existing MEMS manufacturing processes .
“ The ability to do heterogeneous integration of different material types into micromachines is a neat capability that would be enabled by this form of manufacturing , ” Rogers says .
“ It opens up new design opportunities because it relaxes constraints on choices of materials . ”
And in general , Rogers says , the idea of printing MEMS is “ cool . ”
“ What they ’ve done in this paper is demonstrated , for the first time , to my knowledge , this kind of concept . ”
On December 5th , several hundred people gathered in Foley Square , in lower Manhattan , and withstood a drenching rainstorm for two hours in order to send a message to Attorney General Eric Holder .
A JumboTron , set up by the protesters , played clips of Holder ’s recent testimony before Congress , in which he explained his decision to hold the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed — the self - proclaimed planner of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 — and four co-conspirators in the colonnaded federal courthouse flanking the square , rather than in a military commission at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
Members of the crowd shouted at the screen : “ Holder ’s gotta go ! ” ; “ Arrogant bastard ! ” ; “ Communist ! ”
Holder ’s choice of a civilian trial for the architect of 9/11 has galvanized Republicans .

Greg Manning , whose wife , Laura , was severely burned in the World Trade Center attacks , stood before the crowd and said , “ Thousands are already dead because of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s choices .
We do not want to see . . . hundreds of thousands dead because of the Attorney General ’s choices . ”
Andrew McCarthy , the former Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney who led the prosecution of the 1993 World Trade Center attacks , also gave a speech , declaring that Holder did n’t “ understand what rule of law has always been in wartime . ”
He said , “ It ’s military commissions .
It ’s not to wrap our enemies in our Bill of Rights . ”
“ Traitor ! ” someone shouted .
Edith Lutnick , who works for the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund , told the crowd , “ My brother , Gary , lost his life that day . ”
The 9/11 victims , she said , “ were murdered by the terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and we do not want him and his fellow - terrorists tried in that building .
. . .
We need to tell Eric Holder that we will be victims no more . ”
“ Lynch Holder ! ” an onlooker cried .
One protester , Carolyn Walton , who works for a water - filtration company in Manhattan , told me that Holder was “ a Marxist mole . ”
She asked , “ How can someone who is not an American have any right to our rights ?
Holder wants to help the terrorists . ”
The rally was organized , in part , by Debra Burlingame , the sister of the pilot Charles Burlingame , who was killed on 9/11 when Al Qaeda hijackers crashed the plane he had been flying into the Pentagon .
Burlingame is one of the three founders of Keep America Safe , a new political - advocacy group .
Her partners in the venture , which is aimed at attacking the Obama Administration ’s national - security decisions and vindicating those of the Bush Administration , are William Kristol , the conservative pundit , and Elizabeth Cheney , the daughter of former Vice - President Dick Cheney .
The organization ’s political strategist is Michael Goldfarb , a spokesman for Senator John McCain during his 2008 Presidential campaign ; among its funders is Mel Sembler , a conservative donor and a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Despite the prominence of the demonstration ’s organizers , the campaign against Holder ’s Justice Department was largely overlooked by the national media , which considered the event a fringe affair .
But the anger was growing , and it became impossible to ignore on January 19th , when Scott Brown , a Republican , captured the Senate seat left vacant by the death of Edward Kennedy , the Massachusetts Democrat .
As Eric Fehrnstrom , Brown ’s political consultant , put it to me recently , the “ most potent political issue ” in the race was voter opposition to the Justice Department ’s decision to extend customary legal protections to suspected terrorists such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the Nigerian suspect who on Christmas Day attempted to detonate a bomb on a Northwest Airlines passenger plane bound for Detroit .
In a debate with his Democratic opponent , Martha Coakley , Brown declared , “ We ’re at war in our airports , we ’re at war in our shopping malls .
I have to be honest with you , folks .
. . .
I ’m scared at some of the policies I ’ve heard . ”
In a television ad , Brown , who is in the Army National Guard , flashed a photograph of himself in fatigues and declared , “ Some people believe our Constitution exists to grant rights to terrorists who want to harm us .
I disagree . ”
Brown also announced his support for waterboarding suspected terrorists — a tactic that Holder , among others , has denounced as torture .
As Brown ’s attacks grew more pointed , Fehrnstrom said , Coakley got “ bollixed up ” defending Obama ’s policies .
He added , “ The obvious follow - up is : Are you going to read Osama bin Laden the Miranda warning if you catch him ? ”
After the Christmas Day incident , conservative pundits lambasted the Justice Department ’s handling of Abdulmutallab , who had concealed in his underwear a bomb that ignited but failed to explode .
When the plane landed , Abdulmutallab was taken to a hospital for treatment ; at Holder ’s directive , he was arrested as a criminal suspect .
( The F.B.I. , the C.I.A. , and the Pentagon signed off on Holder ’s decision . )
F.B.I. agents questioned Abdulmutallab for some fifty minutes , under what is known as the “ public - safety exception ” to the right to remain silent .
He divulged time - sensitive intelligence : he had been trained in Yemen , by affiliates of Al Qaeda , and had obtained explosives from them .
After he received medical treatment , a Justice Department source said , he started to “ act like a jihadi and recite the Koran . ”
He stopped coöperating and demanded a lawyer , at which point authorities read him his rights .
On “ Inside Washington , ” Charles Krauthammer declared that it was “ almost criminal ” that Holder had allowed Abdulmutallab access to an attorney .
Rudy Giuliani , the former mayor of New York , appeared on ABC , saying , “ Why in God ’s name would you stop questioning a terrorist ? ”
Joseph Lieberman , the Independent senator from Connecticut , released a statement declaring that Abdulmutallab was “ an enemy combatant and should be detained , interrogated , and ultimately charged as such . ”
Then , to the dismay of Justice Department officials , the Obama Administration ’s top intelligence official , Dennis Blair , the director of National Intelligence , appeared at a Senate hearing and , under harsh questioning from Republicans , second - guessed Holder ’s decision to turn Abdulmutallab over to the F.B.I .
( Blair later said that his remarks had been “ misconstrued . ” )
Soon , even Democrats were attacking Holder ’s decisions .
In a letter to Obama , Dianne Feinstein , the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , suggested that holding a trial in New York was dangerous .
“ New York City has been a high - priority target since at least the first World Trade Center bombing , ” she wrote .
“ The trial of the most significant terrorist in custody would add to the threat . ”
The death blow was struck by New York ’s mayor , Michael Bloomberg , who had previously pledged his support to Holder .
On January 27th , Bloomberg distanced himself from the Justice Department , saying that a trial in New York would be too expensive .
For months , companies with downtown real - estate interests had been lobbying to stop the trial .
Raymond Kelly , the commissioner of the New York Police Department , had fortified their arguments by providing upwardly spiralling estimates of the costs , which the federal government had promised to cover .
In a matter of weeks , in what an Obama Administration official called a “ classic City Hall jam job , ” the police department ’s projection of the trial costs went from a few hundred million dollars to a billion dollars .
Senator Charles Schumer , of New York , quickly released a statement echoing Bloomberg ; the wisdom of moving the trial away from lower Manhattan , he said , was “ obvious . ”
Then , on February 1st , Schumer told the Daily News that he opposed the idea of a 9/11 trial taking place anywhere in New York State .
Officials in Pennsylvania and Virginia — the two other states where the 9/11 attacks occurred — began declaring their opposition to hosting the trials , too .
Bill Martel , an international - security expert at the Fletcher School , at Tufts University , told me that Holder , having been impervious to the shifting public mood , had been sucked into “ a political riptide . ”
The Christmas Day bombing attempt , he noted , had come only a month after Nidal Malik Hasan , an Army psychiatrist who had exchanged e-mails with radical Islamists , massacred thirteen people at Fort Hood , Texas .
Both incidents had revived public concern about America ’s vulnerability to terrorism .
Holder ’s decisions , Martel warned , had “ the makings of a sustained and self - inflicted political hemorrhage . ”
He added , “ I think they ’re going to have to give up on civilian trials .
And Eric Holder is in for some pretty brutal days . ”
Indeed , on January 31st , Senator Lamar Alexander , of Tennessee , declared on Fox News that Holder should “ step down , ” for his inability to make “ a distinction ” between “ terrorists who are flying into Detroit , blowing up planes , and American citizens who are committing a crime . ”
On January 11th , a few weeks before his plans for a trial at Foley Square fell apart , Holder flew to Boston , to preside over the installation of a new U.S. Attorney .
That evening , he returned to Washington in the Justice Department ’s Gulfstream jet .
Holder , who had jokingly lamented that such perks would n’t last forever — “ I ’m missing it already ! ” — sat down , put on headphones , and blasted one of his favorite songs , Jimi Hendrix ’s “ Purple Haze . ”
Holder , who is fifty - nine , seemed determined not to let the tensions of Washington politics poison his mood .
He was equally determined not to capitulate on the idea of holding a 9/11 trial .
“ I do n’t apologize for what I ’ve done , ” he told me at one point .
“ History will show that the decisions we ’ve made are the right ones . ”
Holder said that he regarded trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a courtroom as “ the defining event of my time as Attorney General . ”
But , he added , “ between now and then I suspect we ’re in for some interesting times . ”
Holder , despite the controversy he has inspired , has not actually pushed for radical change .
Indeed , critics in left - leaning legal circles have complained that he has kept too many of George W. Bush ’s counterterrorism policies in place .
For example , Holder ’s Justice Department has continued blocking lawsuits by people who were subjected to extraordinary rendition — the practice of sending suspected terrorists captured abroad to countries known for administering torture — on the ground that such litigation would expose state secrets .
Even some former members of the Bush Administration see more continuity than change .
Bradford Berenson , who served as a White House lawyer when the Bush Administration was forging its controversial legal approach to terrorism , told me that “ from the perspective of a hawkish Bush national - security person the glass is eighty - five per cent full in terms of continuity . ”
Holder told me that he was frustrated by much of the criticism over the handling of Abdulmutallab .
“ What we did is totally consistent with what has happened in every similar case ” since 9/11 , he said .
“ There ’s a desire to ignore the facts to try to score political points .
It ’s a little shocking . ”
Without exception , he noted , every previous terrorist suspect apprehended inside the country had been handled as a civilian criminal .
Even so , critics such as Krauthammer were denouncing Holder for failing to send Abdulmutallab directly to Guantánamo .
As a senior national - security official in the White House put it , “ It ’s a fantasy !
Under what alternative legal system can Special Operations Forces fly into Detroit , and take someone away without court oversight ? ”
According to Kate Martin , the director of the Center for National Security Studies , in Washington , the military can’t simply grab suspects inside the U.S. and hold them without charge or a hearing .
“ It violates the Constitution , which extends to everyone inside the U.S. , ” she said .
“ You ca n’t be seized without probable cause .
You have the right to due process , and to a trial by a jury of your peers — which a military commission is not . ”
Confusion on this point may derive from the Bush Administration ’s controversial handling of two suspected terrorists , José Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri .
Both men were arrested in the U.S. by law - enforcement officials , and indicted on criminal charges .
But Bush declared Padilla and Marri to be “ enemy combatants , ” which , he argued , meant that they could be transferred to military custody , for interrogation and detention without trial .
( Neither suspect provided useful intelligence . )
The cases provoked legal challenges , and in both instances appeals courts ruled that Bush had overstepped his power .
The Administration , not willing to risk a Supreme Court defeat , returned the suspects to the civilian system .
For all the tough rhetoric of the Bush Administration , it prosecuted many more terror suspects as criminals than as enemy combatants .
According to statistics compiled by New York University ’s Center on Law and Security , since 2001 the criminal courts have convicted some hundred and fifty suspects on terrorism charges .
Only three detainees — all of whom were apprehended abroad — were convicted in military commissions at Guantánamo .
The makeshift military - commission system set up by Bush to handle terrorism cases has never tried a murder case , let alone one as complex , or notorious , as that of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who will face the death penalty for the murder of nearly three thousand people .
PHILADELPHIA --
A policy change by prosecutors and judges
will eliminate criminal prosecution of persons caught with small amounts of marijuana , according to a report on Philly.com .
The report said the city 's new district attorney and the state Supreme Court are making the change to try to alleviate a backlog of cases in the city 's court system .
Persons found to be in possession of about an ounce or less of marijuana will pay a fine but not be given a criminal record .

Here are some old - school Christian games ...
Noah 's Ark ( 1983 , Arcade - Enter - Tech ) Noah 's
Ark was a cabinet game for arcades .
As Noah , you collect pairs of animals and put them in the Ark before the Flood waters rise .
Each level you had to collect more and more pairs .
If you succeeded , you got to see an animation of the dove being released and God 's rainbow in the sky .
It was a very advanced game for its time , featuring a scrolling outdoors environment with weather effects like thunder .
It was historically accurate too , showing kangaroos in their native Middle Eastern habitat .
The biggest challenge was getting the male unicorn , who pops up only for a while before disappearing again .
The Fellowship U. cafeteria has one of these old machines and I tried getting the unicorn on it , but I never could .
I do n't know if anything special happens if you do .
Bible Adventures ( 1991 , NES - Wisdom Tree ) Bible Adventures was a Christian alternative to Super Mario Brothers , with three games in one :
In Noah 's Ark , you played Noah as he gathers male and female versions of various animals , along with their food supply , in a giant forest around the Ark .
In Baby Moses , you played Moses ' sister , Miriam , carrying baby Moses along the Nile while avoiding Egyptian guards , seagulls , and giant Nile spiders .
You needed to be carrying Moses at the end of the level to complete it .
If you accidentally dropped Moses into the Nile you could keep playing , but you would have to start the level over again !
In David and Goliath , you played David as he collects sheep to earn a sling while being chased by nut - throwing squirrels , head - butting rams , sheep - hungry lions , scorpions , and angry bears .
He later must pass a gauntlet of Philistines and boulders to fight Goliath .
( You can play the game online for free ! )
Spiritual Warfare ( 1992 , NES - Wisdom Tree ) Spiritual Warfare was a Christian alternative to the Legend of Zelda .
You are a soldier in the army of the Lord .
Your city has been taken over by demons under the command of Satan .
You must explore the city and cast out the demons , as well as recover the Full Armor of God ( Ephesians 6:13 - 17 ) .
Along the way you meet many villains , as well as helpful Christians and angels .
You are armed with a selection of Fruits of the Spirit ( Galatians 5:22 - 23 ) , which you can throw at unsaved people , such as business men , cyclists , city workers , muggers , and plumbers , to convert them into Christians , or at demons to make them disappear in a ball of smoke .
You also have exploding pots that can both remove obstacles and convert the unsaved .
Occasionally an angel will appear and ask you Bible questions .
Get them right and you earn doves that let you buy supplies and weapon upgrades from an angel .
( You can play the game online for free ! )
Super 3D Noah 's Ark ( 1994 , SNES - Wisdom Tree ) Super 3D Noah 's Ark was a Christian alternative to Wolfenstein 3D .
You again play Noah , only this time you have been on the Ark for months and the animals are getting restless .
One day you go to do your rounds and find all the animals have escaped from their cages ... and they are coming after you !
You have to explore an advanced 3D model of the Ark to find them all and subdue them by shooting them with feed using a slingshot .
Do n't worry , this only puts them to sleep .
You start off being attacked by rams and sheep , but eventually you face larger animals like a camel and elephant .
The Bible does n't say much about what happened in the Ark the 370 days that Noah and everyone were in there , so it 's not to hard to imagine something like this really happening .
THOUGHTZ 4 GAMERZ : “ Be IN the game , not OF the game . ”
Secular & Un- Christian Games
Critical Reviews & Exposés :
Here are some Secular and un-Christian games that parents , youth ministers , and values gamers should be aware of :
Portal ( Valve , PC & Mac ) 9.4.2010 : ( This game is rated T for teen . )
Portal is a first - person action puzzle game where you have to escape rooms by the clever use of a gun that shoots portals , allowing you to move between distant locations .
Your character is forced to do this by a female - voiced computer named Gladys , who has killed all the workers at the Aperture Science facility and is now " testing " you like a lab rat .
Portal 's story is based on the idea of the " Singularity " taught by Atheist prophet Raymond Kurzwell .
The Singularity has been called Atheism 's version of the Rapture , only twisted and evil .
According to Singularity believers , humans will eventually create intelligent computers just like God created us , then the computers will become smarter than us and kill humanity like Atheists claim that humans " outgrew " and " killed " God .
( Darwinists refer to this replay of events as " Recapitulation Theory " or the " Biogenetic Law . " )
This is of course nonsense .
Humans cannot create intelligence ... only God can do that !
And computers can never be truly intelligent since they do n't have souls ( unless God decides they should , and then He will do the ensoulment Himself , not Atheist computer programmers ) .
While showing the supposed outcome of the Singularity , where the created becomes superior to its creator , Portal also mocks God and advocates man 's rebellion against His authority .
Gladys , whose omnipresent voice makes her a not -very - subtle mockery of God , promises cake after the testing is complete , but really she intends to incinerate you in a fire .
There are hidden messages scrawled throughout the levels saying " The cake is a lie " , which in context really mean " God 's promise of Salvation is a lie " .
The ultimate goal of the game is to kill Gladys and free yourself from her control , much like the Atheist 's ultimate goal of killing God so he can live a life of wantonness .
While the game has no blood ( you only " kill " robots ) or sex ( although it implies possible intimate relations with an inanimate object known as the " weighted companion cube " ) , the bleakness of its worldview and oppressive proselytizing of crazy Atheist theology earn it ZERO CROSSES .
( A sequel , Portal 2 , has been announced .
Early previews show it to be more of the same . )
Red Dead " Redemption " ( Rockstar , Xbox 360 & PS3 ) 6.19.2010 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
Red Dead " Redemption " is the latest in the Grand Theft Auto series by notorious publishers Rockstar .
This one takes place in the Wild West in 1910 .
You play John Marston , a former murderer and horse thief , who must redeem himself for his evil ways by killing his former gang members , as well as US Army soldiers , Indians , Mexican soldiers , Mexican villagers , and the last remaining buffalo .
Uh , guys , that 's not how redemption works !
Redemption is through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who gave His Life on the Cross so that we may be redeemed for our sins , not through mass murder .
But RDR tries to mock the story of Christ in order to promote twisted values , even having John Marston die in the last mission only to be resurrected in his son , Jake Marston , who carries on his father 's " redemption " killing spree .
The game includes many brutal and depraved acts , as well as a constant stream of swears :
You must aid a man who robs graves to do unspeakable things to corpses .
You help a homosexual Mexican general kill villagers .
There 's a nude sex scene that 's 1000 % more graphic than the " hot coffee " scene Rockstar got in trouble for a few years ago ( which shows that the Secular video game industry is getting worse ) .
You can hunt animals in the game , which is a necessary part of our post - Fall world , but the game focuses in lurid detail on butchering the animal , showing blood splattering all over the screen .
You are given achievements for killing 1500 people ( with no distinction between outlaws , lawmen , and innocent villagers ) and making 250 " headshots " .
You are actually given an achievement for hogtying a woman , placing her on a train track , and watching as her body is mangled by a train !
You specifically must watch this happen to get your reward ( there are videos of people doing this on YouTube , but they are too sick to link to ) .
Red Dead " Redemption " is not about redemption and has no redeeming qualities , so I give it ZERO CROSSES .
Brütal Legend ( EA ( who else ? ) , Xbox 360 & PS3 ) 10.26.2009 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
Brütal Legend is a game centered around so - called " Heavy Metal " music ( not the righteous kind like Stryper or Bloodgood , but the Satanic kind that is common in Secular culture ) .
You play as Eddie Riggs , a roadie for a Heavy Metal band who is transported to a world based on the Satanic covers of metal albums , where he battles " supernatural overlords " using a battle axe and magic he conjures via his guitar as he travels in a hot rod named " the Deuce " , which is slang for the Devil .
Eddie Riggs ( the character is named in honor of the Satanic demon mascot of Iron Maiden ) is voiced by Secular musician / actor Jack Black .
Black is a notorious anti-Christian Satanist .
At a nationally televised awards show held by the Secular cable network MTV in September , Black actually led the audience in a prayer to Satan !
He also appeared in a pro-Homosexual agenda video playing Jesus in which he mocked our Lord .
His band , Tenacious D , regularly includes vulgarity and dark imagery in its songs .
In his appearances promoting Brütal Legend , Black has been wearing a rubber muscle suit .
Unlike real bodybuilders who grow their muscles through dedication to Christ , Satanists find themselves atrophied , both physically and spiritually , and so they need artificial means to pump them up ( such as drugs or rubber suits ) .
Having someone like Black as the public face of this game tells you all you need to know about it : it has no spiritually redeeming value and will likely turn players into physically weak Satanists .
( Also I heard a rumor that if you press the Triangle / Y button 666 times at the title screen , you unlock a cheat that makes the dozens of licensed Heavy Metal songs in the game play backwards , allowing you to hear their backmasked Satanic messages .
Players who do n't enable the cheat instead get the messages delivered subliminally into their minds . )
Considering all this , Brütal Legend has earned ZERO CROSSES .
Dante 's Inferno ( EA ) and Electronic Arts in general 7.3.2009 : I hesitated to mention this here when it was in the news a month ago , since it would only bring more attention to people who do not deserve it , but I keep getting emails asking me to review a Secular game called " Dante 's Inferno " so I thought I should address it .
The game itself looks forgettable , with lots of violence and killing and the usual stuff you find in Secular games .
It also has nothing to do with Dante 's classic poetic work , they 're just stealing his name to make their game seem more high - brow or something .
If I were to bother with a mini review based on the media reports of the game itself , I 'm guessing I would probably give it ZERO CROSSES .
But the real notable thing about it is the way that the game 's makers , Electronic Arts ( EA ) , have been promoting it with a viral marketing campaign centered around mocking Christians .
At E3 , a trade show for the Secular gaming industry , EA 's Atheistic marketing department held a fake protest against the game with people holding picket signs saying stuff like " Hell Is Not A Game " and " EA = Electronic Anti-Christ " .
Of course , the Secular media ( both gaming and mainstream ) ate up this anti-Christian deception and ran numerous stories gloating at how silly Christians are for protesting the game .
( Protip for the media : I 've been to real Christ - centered protests and we had much more clever signs . )
EA also made a fake website for the supposed " Christian " group that is against their game .
I mean , really , what sort of jerks would do such a thing ?
( This is n't even the first time EA 's done this ... see the review of Spore below . )
Impersonating Christians and making fake Christian websites to make us look like fools is not only despicable , but a further sign that we are in the End Times ( see Mark 13:13 ) .
I would suggest a boycott of EA 's games , but they do n't make any I would give more than ZERO CROSSES .
Doom 1 , 2 , & 3 ( I.D. Software , PC ) 12.12.2008 : Much has been written about Doom , especially its role in causing the Columbine High School massacre .
It is a violent game filled with dark , Satanic imagery that desensitizes young players to murder and the Devil .
Everyone knows this so I wo n't go over all that again .
Instead , I would like to point out the real tragedy with Doom was what could have been .
In the Doom series , you play a U.S. Marine who fights the forces of Satan .
While you use violence , it is only against demons .
On its own this would be a positive thing as it reinforces the role of our Christian military in spreading the Light of God throughout the world and opposing the Satanic forces that would do us harm .
Unfortunately , the game 's maker , John Carmack , is an Atheist .
This means that he had no clue what he was doing when he used this idea as the central narrative of his game .
Instead of highlighting the positive aspects of Spiritual Warfare and uplifting people to become Warriors for Christ , his Atheistic ignorance of the Bible let him become a conduit for Satan to sensationalize the demonic enemies , actually making them seductive to youth !
I know this because , before I was saved , I played Doom .
I was entranced by the Satanic imagery and violence .
I thank the Lord that OBJECTIVE : Ministries ' Jim Carlson came along and led me to Jesus and got me in touch with Pastor Skeet before I did anything really bad .
I do n't know if I would have killed anyone , but you can never be certain when dealing with Satan 's works .
Because of its complete and devastating failure to deliver on the promise of uplifting Spiritual Warfare training , to the point of actually recruiting some players into Satan 's army , the Doom series gets ZERO CROSSES .
For those who want a real Spiritual Warfare game made by knowledgeable Christians , I would suggest Catechumen , reviewed above .
Tetris ( Soviet Academy of Sciences , available everywhere ) 12.10.2008 : Tetris is an action puzzle game where the player rotates falling block shapes to make them fit together in a pile .
When a row is filled , it disappears , keeping the height of the pile of blocks from increasing .
As the game progresses , it continually speeds up until the player starts making mistakes that allow the blocks to reach the top of the game area , ending the game .
Tetris is unwinable , you can only put off your inevitable defeat .
This fatalistic aspect of the game should come as no surprise since it was originally created in 1985 in the Soviet Union , where the Atheist government taught everyone that there is nothing but a bleak , pointless existence followed by death with no chance for Salvation .
It is claimed that the word " tetris " comes from the game pieces all being made of four blocks .
In reality , the game was named in mockery of the Trinity by adding a forth hypostasis , the Communist State , to the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost .
Because it is simple to program , versions of Tetris can be found on every game , computer , and operating system .
There have even been implementations of Tetris done using computer controlled lights in office buildings , turning the lighted windows into the falling blocks .
The ubiquity of Tetris is also because it is highly addictive .
Its repetitive gameplay and use of a repetitive Russian folk tune causes players to slip into a hypnagogic state , making them receptive to the Communistic themes inherent in the game imagery ( everyone is an unindividualistic block that must be made to fit together in Soviet conformity , and sometimes whole lines of people are made to disappear without any explanation ) .
This is intentional , since , like all work done by the Soviet Academy of Science where Tetris was developed , it was part of secret military research , in this case having to do with mind control .
( The US military also researched mind control video games in the 1980s , including one called " Polybius " , but we never used them during the Cold War , unlike the Soviets who unleashed Tetris into the general public where it 's still affecting people to this day . )
Because of its fatalistic worldview and the danger it poses to people 's God -given Free Will , all implementations of Tetris get ZERO CROSSES .
[ See our Tetris video exposé on GodTube . ]
UPDATE ( 1.8.2009 ) : The Secular media must be reading my reviews because shortly after I exposed Tetris for what it really is , they started trying to counter my exposé ( without mentioning it , naturally ) by promoting a so - called " study " hastily printed in some Darwinist online journal that claims Tetris is beneficial to mental health .
They say soldiers should play Tetris within 6 hours of being in combat to keep them from having post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
The only way that could happen is if all our soldiers were equipped with Tetris games in the field !
And how did they learn this ?
They showed subjects some sort of snuff film with like people being killed ( where did they get this ?
do the police know about it ? ) then had the subjects play Tetris .
What kind of sick experiment is this !?
Before I was born again I saw a Secular movie called , I think , " the Parallax View " , where a shadowy corporation is brainwashing people to become assassins by showing them a propaganda movie that has all sorts of disturbing images mixed with words like " GOD " , " LOVE " , " COUNTRY " , etc .
They did n't have them play Tetris afterwards , but I guess that 's how they do it nowadays .
I asked my Game Theory professor Dr. Holgroth about this and he thinks this whole thing is a plot by the militant Atheists to undermine our military .
We try to install a Christian worldview in our soldiers in basic training and military academies , then when they are deployed , anti-Christians sneakily put Communist propaganda in their hands to condition them to associate relief from traumatic stress with a Godless worldview .
( For those suffering from PTSD , do not be tricked by crypto-Communists into playing Tetris !
Real relief from PTSD can be had by taking beta blockers , SSRIs , and memorizing scripture . )
Left 4 Dead , Dead Rising , Resident Evil , and other " zombie " games ( various ) 12.8.2008 : ( Note : I have not played the games mentioned here since they are all rated " M " and are n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
There 's a new game popular with Secular gamers called Left 4 Dead .
It 's a four - person co-op game where players try to escape from a city overrun with zombies .
This is only the most recent in a long line of Secular games that feature zombies as enemies .
Others include Dead Rising , where players battle zombies in a shopping mall , and the Resident Evil series .
Originally zombies were Haitians who were made into mindless slaves ( using drugs and demonic powers ) that did the bidding of Pagan voodoo priests .
Then in 1968 a movie called Night of the Living Dead redefined zombies as reanimated corpses rising out of graveyards , driven to eat the brains of the living .
What few realize is that this modern concept of zombies was created by anti-Christians as propaganda against the real biblical phenomenon of bodily resurrection of the dead .
Jesus has promised us that when He returns ,
He will raise all our dead bodies and make them better than new so that we can live forever bodily in His Kingdom on New Earth .
The so - called " zombie apocalypse " common in Secular fiction , where mortal humans must fight off zombie hoards , is really an attempt to scare the unsaved into rejecting their resurrected family and friends after His return ( nearly every zombie story pointedly includes a scene where a character is forced to destroy the animated body of a loved one ) .
Zombie games such as the ones above are designed not only to reinforce this propaganda , but to train the unsaved to mindlessly do the bidding of Satan ( much like the original zombies ) .
Because of their goal of scaring the unsaved into rejecting the last chance at redemption , and for promoting the destruction of God 's newly resurrected bodies , forcing Him to keep respawning them , all Secular zombie games get ZERO CROSSES .
Fable II ( Microsoft , Xbox 360 ) 11.11.2008 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
Even though Proposition 8 passed in California , saving millions of traditional Christian marriages in that state from being nullified by so - called " gay marriage " , militant homosexuals are still trying to press their agenda to destroy traditional marriage and families so they can live in sin supported by our tax dollars .
Their newest tactic is to desensitize young people to so - called " gay marriage " , and the " gay lifestyle " in general , by depicting it as normal in Secular entertainment , thereby raising up a generation that will not know right from wrong .
( Pastor Skeet told me that homosexual operatives control the entertainment industry through the so - called " art departments " and the powerful Crafts Services Union , which uses techniques developed by Soviet scientist Ivan Pavlov to secretly condition Hollywood workers into reflexive negative responses to Christian morality , thereby reinforcing so - called " Hollywood values " ) .
Now that the influence of video games has surpassed that of movies in the entertainment landscape , it is no surprise that militant homosexuals are using them to promote so - called " gay marriage " .
In the Secular role - playing game Fable II , your male character is actually encouraged to " marry " other men .
In fact , the game does nothing to stop you from " marrying " multiple men !
This subversive anti-family propaganda combined with other immoral behavior -- including perversions such as prostitution , group sex , and divorce , as well as the ability to measure your character 's progress as he becomes evil and corrupt through the growth of devil horns !
-- forces me to give the game ZERO CROSSES .
Spore ( Electronic Arts , PC & Mac ) 9.10.2008 : People have been emailing me about this game , but I have not looked into it enough yet to give it a proper review like the ones below .
It 's apparently designed to teach children ( it 's rated " E " ) to believe in Darwinism by having them " evolve " a spore into a race of UFO pilots who take over the galaxy ( this is totally unrealistic , so it's an accurate simulation of Darwinism ) .
Some Christians ( and oddly militant Atheists ) are claiming that it actually promotes Intelligent Design because it lets you design what your organism will look like ( if this is the case , then it is promoting the blasphemy of Raëlism , not Biblical ID ) , but apparently that design part was just slapped on top of the evolutionism teachings and most players are only using it to design obscenities ( I wo n't go into details , but suffice to say the word " sporn " has been coined ) .
I will make a more thorough report later , but for now serious researchers can read more details on the Anti Spore blog .
( Be warned that they show screenshots that are not wholesome ...
I had to use Pastor Skeet 's unfiltered research computer just to access them .
Do n't worry though , if you 're using Covenant Eyes you 'll be safe . )
UPDATE ( 9.13 ) : Do n't go to that anti-Spore site !
It 's actually a " satirical " viral ad from Electronic Arts that mocks Christians in order to drive up sales of Spore among angry Darwinists .
Will Right , the guy who made Spore , is a professed Atheist , so he likes to deceive people with so - called " satire " ( which is really just an elitist way of saying " lies " ... did you know that the word " satire " is really a combination of the words " Satan " and " ire " ?
It 's true , I read it somewhere . )
" Satire " like that is only designed to enrage people and confuse the issues , like how in the TV ads for Spore they promote it by asking " Do you believe in Creavolutionism ? " , which totally confuses people about proper creation science by making them think it 's somehow compatible with Evolutionism .
Also , I 've been hearing that Spore puts some sort of monitoring / tracking software called DRM on your computer .
I think this might be one of the Marks of the Beast , but I 'll have to ask Pastor Dr. Miller to be sure .
This DRM obviously is n't placed on your right hand or forehead like in Rev. 13:16 ( yet ... implanted RFID chips may soon be required in people and they will probably have DRM on them ) but read the rest of the quote from Rev. 13:17 ...
" And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . "
From my understanding , DRM uses a number ( the cryptographic key ) that is essentially the numerical name of the DRM maker , and unless you install the DRM on your computer you can't buy stuff , and people making games are forced to use DRM in order to sell them !
So even though Spore 's rated " E " and allowed on campus I wo n't be installing it on my computer to review ( I do n't want my computer marked by the beast ! ) .
Given all these issues with Darwinism , deceptive marketing , and possible beast marking , I am giving Spore ZERO CROSSES .
Halo 1 , 2 & 3 ( Bungie , Xbox & PC )
8.31.2008 : ( Note : I have not played these games since they are rated " M " and are n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
The Halo series is a very popular first person shooter game that first appeared on the original Xbox .
The single - player campaign is set in space on a giant ring - planet ( that is why it is misleadingly called " halo " , it has nothing to do with angels or anyone holy ) where human soldiers are battling aliens for possession of the halo .
The player controls the Master Chef who in a surprise twist turns out to be more than just a military cook ... he 's also a super soldier ( I think this was the plot of a Steven Seagal movie I saw before I was born again , only that was set on a Navy ship and he fought terrorists instead of aliens .
But it 's the same general idea . )
It 's a war game , so there 's lots of violence , but it 's against aliens ( God has n't said anything yet about aliens , so I guess that 's morally acceptable for now ) .
However , the alien forces are called " the Covenant " and are depicted as having strong religious values and a desire for Salvation , so they are undoubtedly a reference to Christians .
The Halo planet itself is probably a reference to the rainbow God gave as a sign of His Covenant with us ( Gen. 9:12 - 17 ) , which means the game 's objective of keeping Halo from the aliens is really about destroying God 's relationship with His creation .
Typical for the Secular media , the Christians are alien bad guys and must be either led away from God or killed .
Also , there 's a naked woman in the game , only she 's a computer and translucent , but I 'm told you can still totally see stuff .
Where the Halo series gets really bad is in its online play , which allows teams of players to fight each other to capture the flag or other objectives .
Unlike in single - player , here the players are trying to kill other humans ( who are actual real people , not just AIs ) , desensitizing them to the murder of their friends and classmates ( although the games are rated " M " most players are underage ) .
Players swear and use blasphemies constantly in the voice chat , but that 's not the worst part .
When a player kills another player , he goes to the corpse and does something called " tea bagging " .
I 'm not going to describe this since it 's gross , but , according to Skeet , it 's something that homosexuals do to each other .
Why would they do this in a game !?
( That 's not the only homosexual content .
The human soldiers are referred to as " Spartans " -- the real Spartans were notorious homosexuals .
Come to think of it , homosexuals have also stolen the rainbow symbol from Christians and are using it to separate people from their God by leading them astray into the " Gay lifestyle " .
Maybe Bungie included " tea bagging " to further their anti-Covenant theme into the multiplayer campaigns . )
For violence , nudity , swearing , promoting homosexual activities and promoting the destruction of the Covenant , the Halo series gets ZERO CROSSES .
Guitar Hero / Rock Band / Guitar Praise ( Various ) 8.27.2008 : ( Note : I have not played Guitar Hero or Rock Band since they contain music that is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini-review on Secular media reports . )
This is actually a review of a genre of games .
It started with Guitar Hero , which included a plastic guitar controller that lets the player " play along " with a song by pressing the buttons on the fret and strumming a bar .
The challenge is to both match the correct " chords " and to strum at the right time to stay in sync with the song , which is represented on screen with a stream of colorful " notes " coming at you .
Guitar
Hero became wildly popular with both kids and adults ( some sources call it a " cultural phenomenon " ) and has spawned both sequels and a competing game called Rock Band , which adds drums and a mic .
While the basic gameplay itself is otherwise wholesome and fun , the problem with these games are the songs included , which are all Secular and even Satanic in nature .
These games are gateway drugs that lure innocent youths , under the guise of a harmless " party game " , into listening to ( and memorizing through repetition ) some of the most anti-Christian and Satan - exalting rock music ever published , including songs by Marilyn Manson , Ozzy Osbourne , White Zombie , Slayer , the Blue Oyster Cult , and the S*x Pistols ( if you do n't know who those bands are ... they 're really bad .
Before I gave myself to Jesus , I listened to some of these bands and I know that they are destructive and their messages promote a bleak and immoral worldview ) .
Besides the songs , the games also have other Satanic trappings , including having Satan himself appearing as your band 's manager in GH3 !
Parents and youth pastors are strongly encouraged to look into the songs hidden in these games and not allow their kids to be exposed to them .
Thankfully , there is now an alternative for parents and pastors who want to allow their kids to get their shred on at parties and youth group meetings but do n't want them having Slayer 's " Reign in Blood " brainwashed into their minds .
Christian game publisher Digital Praise are about to release Guitar Praise ( PC & Mac ) , which will do for Guitar Hero what their Dance Praise did for the Secular Dance Dance Revolution .
Guitar Praise will have a guitar controller just like GH's and the same gameplay , only it will include only top Christian rock bands , such as dc Talk , Thousand Foot Krutch and Skillet , that reflect Christian values instead of those of Satan .
For their sneakily hidden Satanic rock content , Guitar Hero & Rock Band both get ZERO CROSSES .
Guitar Praise is not released as of this writing , but I 'm sure I 'll give it least ††† † Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots ( Komani , PS3 )
6.12.2008 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
In Metal Gear Solid 4 , you play the role of Snake , a soldier who uses stealth to sneak around a battlefield on a mission to steal guns from the Patriots ( and to choke people from behind ) .
As his name implies , Snake is actually a symbolic agent of Satan , sent into the world to finish what he started in the Garden .
Evidence of this symbolism can be seen by Snake 's use of an Apple iPod throughout the game ( Apple is a notorious promoter of Darwinism and counter - culture ) .
Also , Meryl , who guides Snake via a disembodied voice , uses an Apple Macintosh computer ( I think Meryl is supposed to represent Satan himself , but all the symbolism is very confusing since it was written by a Japanese guy ) .
This game promotes drug use ( Snake is addicted to cigarettes and the HDD installation process features an 8 - minute video of Snake teaching players how to smoke ) , eugenics through human cloning ( Snake was the product of a project to clone " super soldiers " ) , disrespect of Authority ( Snake 's main enemy in the game are the Patriots , who represent the Christian founders of our nation ) , and Materialistic Determinacy with an absence of Free Will ( every game in the MGS series is a remake of the first , only with a different Snake clone , the theory being that by putting the clones through the same missions , they will develop into the same person ) .
MGS4 was designed to train those who will be left behind after the Rapture to serve in the Antichrist 's military forces .
As such , it has no value for the Christian gamer , who is among the Elect and wo n't have to deal with that , but it may help the unsaved to know the tactics they will be up against in a post - Rapture world should they choose to join the fight against the Antichrist and secure themselves a place among the Sheep when Christ returns .
Therefore , I am giving it ONE CROSS for this slight benefit .
† Grand Theft Auto IV ( Rockstar , Xbox 360 & PS3 ) 5.6.2008 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
Grand Theft Auto IV is a game designed to brain - wash players into the Atheist worldview .
In it you play Nick , an immigrant recently arrived to Liberty City ( a copy of New York City ) who is tasked with stealing cars and murdering prostitutes .
Nick came from a former Communist country where he was brought up in Godlessness and so he sees no problem stealing and murdering .
The game touts its ability to let you " go anywhere and do anything you want " , the central philosophy of Atheism .
It also teaches how to escape from police , instilling in the player the main motivation behind Atheism : avoidance of authority .
The underlying game engine is called " RAGE " , which is apt since the game is fueled by anger at God .
It also uses something called " Euphoria " which treats humans as " rag dolls " who act only in accordance to physics , which is what Atheistic Materialism teaches .
The game series ( as the title notes , this is the fourth game ) has already resulted in murders in real life .
This game has no redeemable qualities .
Needless to say , all Christians should avoid this game and pray for the people who made it and their victims ( murder victims and gamers of all ages who have played it and have been spiritually scarred ) .
ZERO CROSSES BioShock ( Take - Two , Xbox 360 & Windows ) 8.24.2007 : ( Note : I have not played this game since it is rated " M " and is n't allowed on the Fellowship U campus , so I am basing this mini- review on Secular media reports . )
BioShock is a first - person shooter set in Rapture , an underwater city created upon the Atheist philosophies of Ayn Rand and Charles Darwin .
In a Darwinian struggle to survive , players must kill small children in order to harvest their " Adam " ( a.k.a. " stem cells " ) , which players use to obtain " plasmids " that cause them to macro-evolve superhuman abilities .
The children themselves also kill other people to harvest their Adam , which is the sort of behavior Godless Darwinism teaches young people ( I do n't think its a coincidence that these children are aided in their killing by large diving - suited beings called " Big Daddies " ) .
There 's lots of not - so - subtle anti-Christian imagery used in the game , like how the city name , " Rapture " , refers to there being no Christians living there , since they are all up above the water ( much like how when the real Rapture comes , we will all be above the Earth ) and how players use resources called " Adam " and " Eve " to become genetically degraded by the plasmids making them less human ( just like how the Fall , caused by Adam and Eve , brought death , mutations , and carnivores to our world ) .
I 'm not sure if this game is supposed to be a cautionary tale about how Atheism and Darwinism destroy society , or a simulator to train its teenage target audience to enjoy living in such a world .
Either way , the game is too disturbing to be suitable for Christian audiences .
ZERO CROSSES Bully ( Rockstar , PS2 , Xbox 360 , PC ) 10.22.2006 : Bully is a very , very bad game .
It promotes school violence , vandalism , disrespect for authority , and comic mischief .
This was all expected when Rockstar announced their " Columbine simulator " , but there 's one surprise in the game no one saw coming :
It teaches young boys to become homosexuals .
Your character , Jimmy Hopkins , can " make out " with six other boys in the game and is rewarded with a health bonus ( subtly teaching that homosexual sex is healthy ) .
This content is hidden , not mentioned anywhere on the packaging or content rating .
The game causes players to discover it by accident , then entices them to do it again and again , much like how actual homosexuality spreads .
I had to try every boy in town just to find the ones that would kiss me .
It was gross !
After one of the boys asked me if I wanted to play " shirts and skins " , I quickly turned off the Playstation because I did n't want to see what that was ( Pastor Skeet later told me it 's homosexual slang ) .
Worst of all is that Bully is rated Teen , which means boys as young as 13 could be learning how to approach and kiss other boys !
Parents need to be warned of this hidden objectionable content so they can organize boycotts .
Please inform your Church .
ZERO CROSSES
UPDATE ( 12.03.08 ) : I have learned that the Xbox 360 version of this game has an achievement called " Over the Rainbow " that you unlock when you kiss 20 boys !
Those people who have written me saying that the homosexual content in the game was incidental have been proven wrong : Rockstar rewards it through achievements !
Other Critical Gaming Views :
Here are some other viewpoints on Secular and non-Christian gaming from around the Net :
2.10.2010 : World Net Daily reports on disturbing new facts about the game Dante 's Inferno .
Apparently you spend alot of the game murdering un - " baptised " babies in Limbo !
( Catholics believe that babies that have n't been Catholic " baptised " -- aka " sprinkle baptised " -- go to a make - believe place called " Limbo " if they die , instead of going to Heaven as is what actually happens . )
You even get an Achievement for killing enough of them !
The baby - murder gameplay was discovered by a Catholic group , who also list other egregious examples of Satanic video games , such as Dragon 's Age Origins , Shadow Hearts , and Bayonetta .
3.15.2009 : According to respected news source World Net Daily , Hasbro 's online version of the classic boardgame , The Game of Life , has replaced traditional marriage with so - called " gay " " marriage " .
Instead of living a wholesome life , as was presented in the original game created by Milton Bradley in 1860 , your goal is to start a homosexual " family " .
Like many online games , this disturbing game is unrated and available for anyone to download -- including children !
Hasbro 's perversion of Milton Bradley 's creation -- which they bought the rights to -- is almost as bad as Parker Brothers ' Satanic Ouija " game " .
01.28.2009 : According to Secular news sources , an Indiana mother has discovered that the Nintendo DS baby - simulator game Baby Pals contains a disturbing secret message .
When the baby is given a bath , it repeatedly says " Islam is the light " .
The game is rated " E " and makes no note of this pro-Muslim content .
Not only is this deceptive and misinformative , it is also dangerous .
Parents will expose their kids to this game thinking it is harmless , only to have them become confused about the true nature of the light .
Like Pastor Skeet says , " Jesus is the light , turn Him on ! "
But how will these kids know to turn on Jesus if they think they 're supposed to turn on Islam ?
For parents who want to give their kids an alternative to Baby Pals without the hidden Muslim propaganda , try our own Baby Jesus simulator .
1.2.2009 : Video game addiction is an increasing problem for today 's young people .
Many Secular games try to ensnare the lives of their players , making them forget their friends , their school , and even God.
Instead of exulting God , they attempt to replace Him .
Even the most innocent looking game can lead to spiritual slavery .
In this shocking video exposé of gaming addiction , Paul comes under the control of the Secular game Space Cadet 3D Pinball .
The game demands that he give up his life and worship it as his new " god " .
Can he escape its clutches and focus on the real God ?
12.03.2008 : Bible - based investment firm The Timothy Plan has issued a guide to video games for Christmas .
They have uncovered many troubling games now on sale that I have not covered above .
The most disturbing is the game Army of Two , which promotes homosexual encounters among active - duty soldiers during a time of war , jeopardizing the safety of our troops and their mission to spread Christian civilization around the globe ( Dr. Holgroth told me this is part of a wider campaign by anti-Christians to undermine the Biblical basis of our military ) .

The Turin Shroud , which is believed by some Christians to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ , has gone on display for the first time in 10 years .
The shroud is expected to draw some two million visitors to the northern Italian city over the next few weeks .
The cloth shows the faint image of a bearded man with stains of blood on his hands and feet .
Tests in 1988 suggested it dated from the medieval period but those carbon dating findings are contested .
Measuring just over 4 m x 1 m ( 14ft x 3.5 ft ) , the frail linen sheet shows an image of a man 's body complete with bloodstains and what appear to be wounds from crucifixion .
Millions of Christians believe the cloth is the burial shroud of Jesus .
In 1988 , special tests dated it to between 1260 and 1390 , suggesting it was a medieval forgery .
But since then , other scientists have cast doubt on those findings and appealed to the Vatican to allow new tests using more modern techniques .
Some two million people are expected to visit Turin Cathedral to see the shroud , which will be on public view for six weeks , kept in a bullet - proof and climate - controlled case .
Pope Benedict XVI is due to fly to Turin on 2 May to pray before the shroud .

MongoDB can hold files up to 4MB by default .
Large or even very very large files can be managed by the GridFS extension efficiently .
The collection which we use to manage data of a given collection has many other methods for managing indexes , deleting documents and more .

Millions of Indian children remain out of school
A landmark law which makes education a fundamental right for children has come into effect in India .
It is now legally enforceable for every child to demand free and elementary education between the ages of six and 14 years .
Indian PM Manmohan
Singh said enough funds would be made available to ensure that children had access to education .
An estimated eight million children aged between six and 14 do not currently attend school in India .
Mr Singh said that the government was committed " to ensuring that all children irrespective of gender and social category have access to education " .
Recalling his own childhood , Mr Singh , a qualified economist , said : " I read under the dim light of a kerosene lamp .
I am what I am totally because of education . "
" So I want that the light of education should reach to all , " Mr Singh added .
' Building block '
Analysts say the law marks a historic moment for India 's children .
" It serves as a building block to ensure that every child has the right to guaranteed quality elementary education .
The state , with the help of families and communities , has a legal obligation to fulfil this duty , " said Karin Hulshof , India representative of UN children 's fund Unicef .
Recently , the World Bank announced two education projects worth a total of $ 1.05 bn for India - one of which is to boost the number of children enrolling in and completing elementary school .
The World Bank says the number of children reportedly enrolled in elementary education in India increased by 57 million to 192 million between 2003 and 2009 .
More than two - thirds of this increase took place in government schools .
The number of children out of school declined from 25 million to 8.1 million during the same period , the World Bank says .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
An actor who was denied entrance to the Oscars last month has sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for false imprisonment , claiming he and his wife were detained for hours without their consent .
Michael Avila , whose IMDb profile says he appears ( under the name Michael AvMen ) in the upcoming films “ Battle : Los Angeles ” and “ Straw Dogs , ” claims in a lawsuit filed Friday that he and his wife Mandy were unlawfully imprisoned outside the ceremony after a ticket mix -up .
The Venezuela - born actor says his publicist ( unidentified ) arranged for him to attend the March 7 ceremony at the Kodak Theater and told him he could pick up his tickets once inside the venue .
But when the Avilas arrived on the red carpet without tickets , they say they were “ rushed away to an AMPAS detention center where they were held and questioned about how they had been able to get onto the red carpet . ”
Six hours later , they were transferred to the police station and released without any charges .
“ Until approximately 10 p.m. , Plaintiffs continued to be held against their will by AMPAS personnel , continued to be questioned , and continued to repeatedly request to be allowed to return to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel , ” the complaint alleges .
“ At no point had Plaintiffs been arrested , been read their rights , or been allowed to contact legal representation to understand why they were being held against their will and badgered with all sorts of personal questions . ”
The lawsuit says the couple suffered “ sustained injury to his and her body and shock and injury to their nervous system ” and have been experiencing “ humiliation , mental anguish and emotional and physical distress . ”
They want $ 50 million in exemplary and punitive damages to punish the Academy .
AMPAS , which boasts about its extra - tight security at the Oscars , did n’t immediately respond to a request for comment .
It ’s no secret that Steve Jobs and Apple do n’t think too highly of Flash , with Jobs reportedly noting during an internal Apple meeting that the majority of crashes on Safari are due to Flash related bugs .
Apple has refused to budge from its position of not supporting Flash on the iPhone , and with the Flash - less iPad set to hit the streets in just a few weeks , we ’ll soon find out if user demand for Apple ’s latest and greatest product outweighs user demand for a complete web browsing experience .
In the video below , Anup Mura , Adobe ’s director of technology strategy and development for the Flash platform , address ’s some of the more common complaints levied against Flash .
In regards to the claim that Flash drains battery life , Mura responds : “ We ’re using the same video hardware , we ’re using the same graphics hardware , we ’re moving more things off the CPU into hardware acceleration that gives us similar performance and similar profile as all these other devices . ”
Looking forward , Mura highlights some of the improvements we can expect to see in Adobe ’s upcoming Flash 10.1 player
We ’ve actually done some optimizations to look at where flash is on a web page , and if content is off - screen , we actually suspend that flash instance , so that there ’s extra processing not happening off - screen .
Browsers do n’t necessarily do that , web pages do n’t necessarily do that , we ’ve actually been able to be thinking about this problem more broadly and it ’s not just about what can we do in the runtime and using hardware better , but also be thinking about how the application or the webpage is being rendered , and what is being rendered on the screen , where are we in memory ..
That sounds pretty nifty , but the only way Apple will cave and support flash on the iPhone and / or iPad is if consumers start complaining with their wallets .
Unless that happens , Adobe ’s Flash improvements are akin to the school nerd buying the headd cheerleader flowers – it ’s a nice gesture , but it ai n’t gonna seal the deal .

Here 's a wild idea .
Imagine : you quite fancy a holiday , so you go to a place on your high street called ( why not ? ) a travel agency .
In the travel agency , a friendly person called a travel agent asks you what kind of holiday it is you want , and you tell her .
Using her experience and expert knowledge , she shows you a few alternatives and together , you choose one .
What happens next is even wilder : she books it all .
And a few days later , once you have paid the travel agency ( maybe with a piece of paper called a cheque , part of a chequebook containing a handy , manually operated , readily updatable record of exactly how much you 've spent ) an envelope arrives at your home , holding some pieces of pre-printed card called tickets .
Sound enticing ?
It means , of course , you would n't have to spend an untold number of evenings on the internet , ploughing through contradictory and often unpleasant reviews until you 've found the place you 're confident ( - ish ) is right for you .
You would n't , that feat accomplished , then learn from an airline website that a whole lot of other people have had much the same idea , and as a result the flights are now three times the price they were when you first looked .
And you would n't have to print your own boarding pass ( and be charged for the pleasure ) .
More and more , it seems , we 're doing things for ourselves that once we did n't have to .
Once , people were there to help us do these things : experts and professionals .
The responsibility , basically , was not ours .
So where , six months ago , half - a- dozen generally amiable and competent cashiers sat at the back of the local branch of my bank , there now stands a forbidding array of matt - black machines and a lone , fraught and often unamiable lady in a twin - set attempting to explain to 32 confused customers how to operate them .
At the risk of sounding like an old codger , there 's more , much more : at the supermarket , we are now expected to pass our own shopping through an automated checkout machine ( which invariably either fails to read the barcode , or accuses us of placing unrecognised – and thus , obviously , unpaid - for – items in our bag ) .
We print our own maps , provide our own bags , assess our own taxes , publish our own books , print our own pictures , market and sell our unwanted goods and chattels en masse , online , ourselves .
We 're increasingly expected to " do our homework " about everything .
This causes problems for some , often older people .
" Things are n't as simple as they once seemed to be , " says Joan Bakewell .
" The phone book does n't exist any more .
Older people get terribly frustrated by things like menus on phones , with endless options .
Although it 's hard to generalise , because older people are so often thrown back on their own resources anyway .
And in many cases , we grew up doing everything for ourselves . "
But it 's not only adults who are expected to do things for themselves .
Once , it was down to local education authorities and headteachers to decide which teachers were right for which schools .
Now , according to one teachers ' union , children as young as 11 are routinely required to sit in on staff job interviews , helping to select teachers – and rejecting them on the grounds , apparently , of whether or not they are prepared to sing their favourite song or , in one instance , because they " looked like Humpty Dumpty " .
Some of the new things we 're asked to do are , of course , good : sorting your rubbish and recycling , for example ; the whole gamut of eco-activities from changing your lightbulbs to composting and growing your own .
" I 'm positive about all that , obviously I am , " says one colleague .
" But there 's no denying it takes time , and energy .
It does feel as if the responsibility is steadily shifting on to the individual .
An awful lot seems to be up to us now . "
And in a life that seems to have become increasingly do - it - yourself , David Cameron now wants us to embrace DIY government .
If the Conservatives win the election , we the people are to be given the powers to run schools , sack MPs , call for local referendums on issues of local importance , and elect police chiefs .
" We 're all in this together , " Cameron said during the launch of his party 's manifesto on Tuesday .
" Join us in forming the next government of Britain . "
( He went a bit further than that , actually , invoking a certain US president by urging voters : " Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country .
And yes , for your family and for your community , too . "
How , he asked , " will we raise responsible children unless every adult plays their part ?
How will we revitalise communities unless people stop asking ' Who will fix this ? ' and start asking ' What can I do ? '
Britain will change for the better when we all elect . . . to take responsibility – if we all come together . " )
The idea , then , is that we do more of what has previously been considered the government 's work ourselves .
" Little platoons of civil society " , in the Tory leader 's words , will be expected to start new schools , take over the running of parks and libraries , operate local health services .
Local people will have a " right to bid " to run any community service instead of the state , and a " right to buy " to protect pubs or post offices threatened with closure .
We 'll be able to take planning decisions , check wasteful spending online , hold our elected representatives to account and appoint chief constables .
Patients could be given control over their individual health and social care budgets .
" You want to be your own boss , and you can with us , " said Andrew Lansley , the shadow health minister .
( Raising , as the Guardian 's sketch writer Simon Hoggart suggested , the alarming spectre of DIY operations . )
But to what extent is DIY government a genuine political vision , a real means of empowering individuals and local communities – and to what extent is it simply adopting an existing consumer trend , a fairly crude attempt to save money while kidding us that we 're actually in charge ?
How much , in fact , is it actually about passing the buck ?
" The trend towards doing more and more yourself is definitely real , " says philosopher Julian Baggini .
" But in most cases it 's down to advances in technology .
The effect has been that the gap between what you can do and what a professional can do has shrunk .
Actually , though , what it has done is raise the level of mediocrity , while leading us into more mediocrity . "
What Baggini means , I think , is that we 've been empowered to do more things a little bit better than we once could – and that suddenly makes experts and professionals look very expensive , so we do more and more ourselves , and they do less and less , so the overall quality level inexorably falls .
" Digital cameras are the perfect example , " he says .
" They enable us to do something much better than we once could – but we 're still not there .
We still can't take pictures like professional photographers . "
We just think we can , so we do .
And applied to government , that could be dangerous .
" DIY is all a big con , really , " Baggini says .
" All the things we say we can now do for ourselves rely on tools that have been created by other people .
I 've put together an awful lot of furniture , but I 've never actually built any . "
While DIY as a political philosophy is n't really comparable to DIY as a consumer phenomenon , it 's possible that because all this has happened in the technological arena , it has created a climate in which people believe they can do things as well as professionals .
" The trend to DIY has corroded the idea that we need professionals , " says Baggini .
" And in that context , if politicians come along and offer us DIY in , for example , local government , it could seem appealing .
But maybe we should be a little bit wary of being told we can run a school .
There are some quite dangerous illusions . "
Social forecaster James Harkin is equally forceful .
" DIY is just one of many trends in society , " he says , " There are plenty of others – more and more people are outsourcing the tasks they have to do , for example : getting people to walk their dogs , or clean their ovens .
But DIY in this context is a very narrow , consumer - focused notion , often based around the internet .
It 's about playing around , usually online , with something that 's already there . "
And extended to politics , Harkin believes , it 's not truly empowering .
" I 'm sympathetic towards any attempt to re-empower local communities , really I am , " he says .
" That objective in the Conservative manifesto does appeal to me .
But this is n't about that .
You have to give local communities a reason to exist that is about more than saying : ' Hey , you could do this yourselves . '
That 's not empowering people , it 's passing the buck .
The bottom line is , we can't co-create a local dentist or a GP .
We ca n't DIY that . "
If , of course , we had the time , or the inclination .
How many of us have the energy – or even the desire – to get involved in running a school or a hospital or a police force ?
A recent Mori poll found , in fact , that only 47 % of Britons actually want " to get involved in decisions affecting their local area " .
We 're way too busy booking our own holidays , checking out our own library books , printing out our own photos and giving our opinion of our local council 's street - cleaning programme on a handy four - page form .
Still , it 's good to see some entering into the spirit .
Guardian readers on The Alternative Vote blog were yesterday proposing " setting up a school in my shed " , and volunteering " as fireman for my street , because I have a hosepipe " .
Jeremy
Hardy yesterday reported having successfully removed his own appendix , and Armando Iannucci led a band of 1,000 on Twitter in an inspired attempt to organise a police force for Wigan : a #twitterforce , slogan " Yes Wi-gan " .
Maybe there 's hope for DIY government yet .
Soyuz rocket launches Russian military satellite
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : April 16 , 2010
A Soyuz rocket launched a Russian military payload Friday on a secret mission , but observers believe the satellite carries a high - resolution camera to spy on other countries .
The defense satellite launched at 1500 GMT ( 11 a.m. EDT ) Friday aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia , according to the Novosti news agency .
U.S. tracking data indicates the Soyuz rocket deployed the payload in an orbit stretching from an altitude of 203 miles to 105 miles .
The inclination is about 67.2 degrees .
The parameters closely match the orbits reached by previous Soyuz rockets carrying Kobalt optical reconnaissance satellites .
High - resolution cameras on Kobalt satellites snap pictures of locations around the world .
Kobalt spacecraft reportedly carry canisters to return film to Earth during the satellite 's mission , which will last at least several months .
The fresh satellite will be named Kosmos 2462 under the Russian military 's nomenclature for defense satellites .
Friday 's launch marked the 14th space launch to reach orbit worldwide this year .
It was also the first launch from Plesetsk in 2010 and the third Soyuz rocket flight this year .

Many years ago I bought an LED Scrolling Badge from www.geeks.com for a few bucks , and shortly after I got it I hacked it .
Being the lazy sod I am I am just now getting to writing up a how to .
First , general crap :
This could void warranties , break things , hurt yourself , etc etc .
So do n’t be a moron .
Back story : Basically I wanted to use the LED Scrolling badge as a sign on my desk , seeing as the cool , multi color , multi function LED signs are usually in the $ 100 and up range .
Well I tried it out and it was on my cubicle wall for about a week and the battery died .
So I took out the battery and looked at it .
I noticed it was one of those flat CMOS / Watch type batteries that is thin and about the size of a quarter .
They are n’t cheap to replace , and it was obvious buying 1 every week would be retarded .
That ’s when I had a great thought .
The battery was labeled 3V ( V for volts ) .
I remembered that a standard cylinder type battery ( AA , AAA , C , D ) are rated 1.5V , so two of them would = 3 V .
I pondered what battery to use , and used my vague knowledge of things to remember that the only real difference between the different cylinder type batteries is how much juice ( electricity ) they contain .
So if a small watch battery would last about a week , how long would two D batteries last ?
So I set out , got the materials listed below , and did basically what I ’m about to tell you .
I also figured out two different ways to accomplish this .
One method that requires soldering , one that does not .
I ’ll start with the soldering method first as it is more stable , and geekier .
What you will need :
LED Scrolling Badge Can be found at various online retailers , you need to get one powered by a 3 v watch battery .
If you get an Badge that uses a different amount of Voltage you will have to figure it out yourself ( You can leave a comment and I will attempt to help you out ) .
Battery Holder with wires .
D - Cell size ( you can go with AA , or AAA if you want , but I used D ) .
Can be found at Radio Shack / Online
Tools ( Screw driver , soldering gun , knife , whatever else you think you need )
This is crap you should have anyways if you are any sort of human .
Optional : Washers ( preferably the same diameter as the coin shaped battery ) , Paper / Card Stock / Cardboard , poster putty .
( I will tell you how to make a solder - less version at the end )
10 minutes ( give or take )
Step 1 – Battery removal
Locate the battery compartment on your LED Badge .
On my model it was located on the bottom and slid out like as a tray that held the battery in place ( I have no picture of this as I removed and threw away the battery tray , and battery when I originally modified mine ) .
Remove the battery and note it ’s orientation ( as in which direction is the positive part of the battery facing , and the negative .
Also make sure that it is 3 volts .
No more , no less .
If it is different then 3V , you will have to modify what you do to get this to work .
Step 2 – Take it apart
Use your screwdriver , or whatever tool is necessary to open up your LED Badge .
Mine had six mini screws on the back holding it together .
DO NOT LOSE THE SCREWS !
They are tiny , and your friends will make horrible jokes about you having a screw loose .
Step 3 – Locate the power source
On the circuit board should be the place the battery went .
It should have something that is marked as + , and one marked as – ( positive and negative ) .
This can be figured out easily if you remember which way the battery went into the battery area .
As you can see on mine , it had this metal tab sticking up that was the negative lead , and four little solder type pads that were the positive leads .
Yours may differ .
Step 3.5 – Test
At this point you can temporarily place the batteries in the battery holder and hold the ends of the wires on the appropriate locations to make sure the LED Badge lights up successfully .
Step 4 – Strip and Solder
Strip the ends of the wires on your battery holder if they are n’t already .
( Make sure you take the batteries out so you do n’t do something stupid )
For me I soldered the red ( negative ) wire to the metal tab that was marked as the negative lead to the circuit board .
And the black ( positive ) wire to one of the 4 positive solder pads directly on the circuit baord .
( note : I realized that all 4 pads worked as a positive lead and it only had to be soldered to one ) .
Super Ultra Extra Note : The LED Badge you purchase may have different power points , this will take thinking on your part .
If you need help locating them , take a good picture of your board and I can possibly help .
Step 5 – Test and Re-assemble
Now that you have it all wired together , put the batteries into the holder to make sure it all works .
Then all you have to do is re-assemble the badge and Viola !
LED
Badge powered by two D - Cell batteries .
For those of you who either do n’t own a soldering gun of any sort , or want to be able to use it as an LED Badge every now and then , I have a solderless method .
Here is a quick how - to :
Strip back a good amount of wire from the D - Cell Battery holder .
Wrap the exposed wire from the black wire around one metal washer , do the same for the red wire .
( You can also solder the wires to the washers if desired )
Cut a piece of cardstock / paper / cardboard to a size just a hair bigger than the washers
Place the cut piece of paper between the two washers kind of like an Oreo with the washers as the cookies and the paper as the creme filling .
Slide the washer / paper assembly into the battery slot making sure the washers are going in with the correct orientation ( black wire washer going in toward the positive side , red wired washer going toward the negative side of the battery compartment )
That method is not completely stable and secure , but it will work .
When you want to use it as a badge , just pull the washer cookie out and put your watch battery back in and off you go .
End Results and Battery life :
My LED Badge came with one of those magnetic backings .
I used some poster putty stuff to stick it to the battery holder and set my LED Badge on it .
The battery holder works as a stand and can be easily put anywhere on your desk .
Sorry for the camera quality , I was using my Cell Phone .
As for battery life .
How does 8 months sound ?
That ’s right , this can last anywhere from 6 - 8 months depending on some factors .
I left mine on , CONSTANTLY , on the lowest brightness setting for over 6 months .
Toward the end of the six months I had to up the brightness as the batteries got weaker .
So instead of needing to buy a new $ 2 watch battery every week , I only have to buy two D - Cell batteries ( about $ 2 ) once every 8 months .
Now if you turn it off when you are not at your desk , like on weekends , holidays , at night , I bet you could run this for over a year on one set of batteries .
Thanks for reading , if you have questions or comments please leave them below and I will do my best to answer them .
Minneapolis , MN - Nine people were arrested here , April 13 , at the office of Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar after refusing to leave her office .
Protesters talked with Klobuchar by telephone .
When she refused to make a commitment to voting against funding for the war in Afghanistan , the peace activists decided to remain in her office until they were arrested .
Earlier , about 100 people rallied in front of the office .
The protesters demanded Senator Klobuchar vote against a supplemental funding bill for the war in Afghanistan .
The funding bill that the U.S. Congress will be considering asks for an additional $ 33 billion for the war .
The April 13 peace action Klobuchar ’s office is the second in a series of activities by a coalition of peace and anti-war groups to oppose the additional funding for the war in Afghanistan .
On Thursday , April 8 a protest was held at the Saint Paul office of Senator Al Franken .
At that event , six people were arrested and ticketed by police after they refused to leave the senator ’s office when he too refused to commit to opposing the new funding for the war .
The war funding votes Congress will be coming just as the U.S. military is preparing a major offensive against Kandahar , Afghanistan .
News reports have indicated that an attack on Kandahar could come in June .
“ The dollars in the supplemental funding bill will help finance the projected attack on Kandahar , which will be yet another bloody escalation of the war in Afghanistan , ” said a statement issued by organizers .
“ It is imperative that we speak out at this time against the escalation of the war in Afghanistan and further assaults on Afghan cities and towns , which can only result in more bloodshed , misery and death for U.S. soldiers and the people of Afghanistan , one of the poorest nations in the world , ” the statement concludes .
The events are sponsored by the Minnesota Peaceable Assembly Campaign Committee , which includes members of several Minnesota peace , religious , student and other organizations .
Do you " hope " that everyone will see the light and start living more sustainably to save the environment ?
If so , you may be doing more harm than good .
So say an environmental scientist and an environmental ethicist in a provocative essay in the journal , The Ecologist .
John Vucetich , assistant professor of animal ecology at Michigan Technological University , and Michael Nelson , associate professor of environmental ethics at Michigan State University , challenge the widespread belief that hope can motivate people to solve overwhelming social and environmental problems .
" Is hope a placebo , a distraction , merely sowing the seeds of disillusionment ? " they ask , in an opinion piece titled " Abandon Hope . "
The authors , co-founders and directors of the Conservation Ethics Group , an of environmental ethics consultancy , examine the proper role of hope in environmentalism .
They suggest that hope 's alternative is not hopelessness or despair , but rather the inherent virtue of " doing the right thing . "
For decades , say Vucetich and Nelson , we have been hammered by the ceaseless thunder of messages predicting imminent environmental cataclysm : global climate change , air and water pollution , destruction of wildlife habitat , holes in the ozone .
The response of environmentalists — from Al Gore to Jane Goodall — to this persistent message of hopelessness has focused on the need to remain hopeful .
But hope may actually be counter - productive , Vucetich and Nelson suggest .
" I have little reason to live sustainably if the only reason to do so is to hope for a sustainable future , because every other message I receive suggests that disaster is guaranteed , " they explain .
People are hearing radically contradictory messages :
Scientists present evidence that profound environmental disaster is imminent .
It is urgent to live up to an extremely high standard of sustainable living .
The reason to live sustainably is that doing so gives hope for averting disaster .
Yet disaster is inevitable .
" Given a predisposition to mistrust authorities , such contradictions justifiably elicit mistrust , " say Vucetich and Nelson .
If hope for averting environmental disaster is not the right reason to live sustainably , what is ?
The scholars say we must provide people with reasons to live sustainably that are rational and effective , based on virtues rather than consequences .
That means equating sustainable living not with hope for a better future , but with basic virtues such as sharing and caring , virtues that we recognize as good in themselves and fundamentally the right way to live in the present , they explain .
One advantage to such an approach is that it can motivate even people who do not believe that we are on the brink of environmental disaster , Vucetich and Nelson point out .
It also clarifies the connection between environmental and social problems , a connection many people fail to grasp .
" Instead of hope , we need to provide young people with reasons to live sustainably that are rational and effective , " they say .
" We need to lift up examples of sustainable living motivated by virtue more than by a dubious belief that such actions will avert environmental disaster . "
Rachel Maddow warns us about the lastest astroturf group which we 're sure to see more of as the debate over financial reform continues .
As she notes , Rick Berman has been setting up web sites and corporate front groups that mirror legitimate watchdog sites to try to undermine them .
The Consumer Rights League was set up in 2007 and it shares the same acronym with the Center for Responsible Lending , which was set up thirty years ago as an actual consumer rights group .
The Consumer Rights League is now organizing protests against the real consumer rights group , the Center for Responsible Lending .
The Huffington Post has more on this here -- Center For Responsible Lending In Fight With Front Group :
The Center for Responsible Lending says the Consumer Rights League is just doing the bidding of the financial industry , which opposes reforms advocated by the center .
" This is an industry - funded front group , also known as Astroturf , that can't win on the merits of their arguments so they have to attack people personally , " said Kathleen Day , spokeswoman for the Center for Responsible Lending .
" They lack transparency .
" That should make everyone wonder why .
Whose water are they carrying ? "
" We do n't claim to be a grassroots organization .
We claim to be a different voice for consumers , " Flynn said .
But who 's paying for the megaphone ?
Flynn refuses to say , though he admitted to Roll Call that the financial industry does contribute to the group .
According to tax forms , the league was founded in 2007 with Flynn , Jason Roe , Duane Dicharia , Michael McKay , and Theresa Kibbe as its directors .
Roe and Mckay are both principals in the Federal Strategy Group lobbying firm , which has some clients in the financial industry and was paid $ 40,000 for start - up costs .
Kibbe is married to Matt Kibbe , president of FreedomWorks , which provided office space to the league .
Flynn said the league is not connected to the Federal Strategy Group .
He said James Terry has replaced Terry Kibbe as the group 's chief public advocate , that McKay is no longer one of the directors and that he ( Flynn ) works from home .
A key part of the league 's complaint is that the center 's big donors benefited from the center 's lobbying .
It 's the same argument made against the center on websites like www.activistcash.com, propagated by notorious industry PR man Rick Berman , for whom Flynn used to work .
Flynn provided the government with two news clippings purportedly showing how the center is a front for its donors .
One , a BusinessWeek story from 2007 , suggested that hedge fund Paulson & Co. gave $ 15 million to the Center for Responsible Lending hoping to benefit from bankruptcy reform legislation for which the center had been lobbying .
Another is a December 2008 New York Times story about Herb and Marion Sandler , who helped found and fund the Center for Responsible Lending .
Citing this article , Flynn wrote in his letter to the IRS that Herb Sandler " made billions of dollars as the owner of a bank that wrote what are now called subprime mortgages for the low - income beneficiaries of CRL 's various advocacy efforts . "
As Rachel and the HuffPo article points out , they shared office space with Dick Armey 's FreedomWorks , they wo n't say who funds them but admitted to Roll Call that they are at least in part funded by the financial industry , the board of directors of the Consumers Rights League included FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe 's wife Terry Kibbe , who is a Republican fundraiser and a banking lobbyist .
Rachel said to watch out for the right wing media to start promoting the protests from the Consumer Rights League and one last tidbit , the former President of the Consumer Rights League Mike Flynn now is the editor and chief of Andrew Breitbart 's site BigGovernment.com , which is promoting the fake astroturf protests .
And as Rachel noted , Mike Flynn used to be a lobbyist for Rick Berman .

PPC is one of internet advertising methods on websites that has created quite a stir .
For example , Google , Yahoo , Bing , even Facebook , they all have PPC program , using which businessmen can advertise their products or websites , but the cost can be huge depending on how many clicks were clicked on your posted ads .

Facebook ad is actually cheaper than other sites like Google , Yahoo , and Bing .
Also , it can target ad details to another different level .
It ’s really easy to use and the result will be faster than others .
Do Your Homework :
You will need to do your homework before you get a good grade in class , right ?
That means do your research on popular keywords before you actually put them in your ad .
There are so much different ways you can do .
For me , by using Google Adword , Alexa , and Quantcast are the best ways to find out the popular keyword .
Capture Page :
For most online marketers , the Capture page is the most important page .
The Capture page is a webpage that allow people to put in information of themselves and provides several lines to insert contact information .
Why do I need to have their contact information ?
Because 97 percents of visitors that view your site will not come back again .
But by creating a capture page , they will leave you information such as email or phone number that you can contact them with .
This will increase the visit rate .
PPC charge money whenever people click on your ad , so in order to make sure you are fully using PPC , create a capture page for your visitor .

It ’s very easy !
You need to make your ad different from the others .
What I mean by different is give more details of your product ’s effect and how to use them .
You are not promoting your product , but you are promoting your knowledge of this product .
By promoting your knowledge , this will give viewers the sense of trust and they will look further into your product .
Budget Range : Lastly , if you want to start PPC marketing , you should be prepared to spend around $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 for a good start .
How come the budget is so high ?
For the first two months of PPC marketing , result will not come out as good as everyone wish .
That ’s because you will need to start picking up your leads and momentum for all the promotion you are doing .
It ’s like a snowball rolling down the hill .
As it picks up speed , it becomes bigger and bigger .
That ’s the budget you might spend to start PPC , if you know what you doing .
These are great tips for a successful PPC marketing online .
I will tell you one thing : learn as much as you possibly can before you start any marketing .
That ’s because the more you learn , the faster results you will receive .
PPC is a great way to earn income faster , but if you do n’t understanding the process it is the fastest way to lose all your money .

Almost exactly one year ago , Pinnacle Entertainment Group announced Space 1889 : Red Sands , a Savage Worlds campaign setting based on the classic Victorian SF roleplaying game .
I already own a copy of Heliograph ’s reprint of the original Space 1889 rulebook , but the rules always felt a bit too clunky for my tastes , so I was really looking forward to the release of Space 1889 : Red Sands .
So I was overjoyed as the nice guys from Pinnacle Entertainment recently provided me with a preview copy of the upcoming campaign setting .
The 190 - paged PDF is in full - color and contains a lot of original artwork that has been clearly inspired by the artwork in the original book – which is a good thing .
Space 1889 : Red Sands retains all of the charm of the classic while updating it to the modern Savage Words rules .
Please note that this preview is based on a pre-print PDF of the final book , so there might be some minor changes in the final product .
Space 1889 : Red Sands will be officially released in Summer 2010 .
The setting
Red Sands is set into an alternative 1889 .
In 1870 Thomas Edison and Jack Armstrong travelled to Mars using an ether flier of Edison ’s design which can travel through the luminiferous ether which fills the void between the planets .
On Mars they encountered not one but two races of Martians and discovered the wondrous Canals .
Other daring explorers travelled to the jungles of Venus which are home to dinosaurs and other creatures which have been extinct on Earth for millennia .
The age of imperialism is in full gear with the grand nations of Earth creating colonies all over the planet Earth and its neighboring planets .
It ’s a golden age of science and discovery .
But alas not all is well in the twilight of the 19th century .
The European nations are on the brink of war , natives all over the Solar System are revolting and anarchists and revolutionaries try to overthrow the established governments .
The setting provides GMs with uncounted possibilities for adventures .
Most people will probably focus on space travel and exploration , but campaigns focused on politics , intrigue and diplomacy should work well , too .
Since there are stats for Martian and Venusian natives , the players can “ go native ” , if that ’s what they wish .
The included plot - point campaign focuses on the exploits of the members of the Explorer ’s Society .
But more about this later .
The crunchy parts
Aside from a lot of background information on the setting , Red Sands adds a lot of setting - specific rules to Savage Worlds , which can also be used for your homebrew campaign , if you ’re not that interested in Victorian SF .
The included character concepts , hindrances and edges ( especially the professional ones ) can easily be used in a non-SF Victorian campaign .
My favorite new edge is definitely “ Liquid Courage ” which allows a character to down at least 8 ounces of hard liquor to become virtually unstoppable without an detrimental effect on the character ’s abilities .
The Status rules presented in the book definitely help players to get into the Victorian mindset .
Player characters usually start as working class , but a character ’s class can be as low as underclass and as high as upper class .
The status determines a character ’s monthly income and is a measure for the number of favors he may call in .
You can gain favor by doing heroic deeds and lose favor by being involved in scandals .
Favors in Red Sands are much like a social currency you can use to gain money , assistance of NPCs or to pay go get admission to private clubs and social events .
The invention rules allows characters ( and GMs ) to design new devices including new airships and ether flyers .
Invention is different from Weird Science because it allows characters to come up with devices that can be mass - produced later , while weird science gadgets are always unique and ca n’t be reproduced .
As expected Red Sands also contains extensive rules on space transportation and rules for aerial ships including ship combat and ship construction .
The gazetteer
Red Sands includes a 4 - paged gazetteer of the Solar System , giving players and GMs basic infornation of the planets and the asteroid belt .
This section also contains maps of Mars and Venus .
Red Captain ’s Log
The largest portion of the book is taken up by the game master ’s section including the plot - point campaign .
After given an overview of Red Sands ’ campaign , the GM is provided with additional setting specific rules including more information on Status and expanded invention rules including special and rare components for player ’s designs .
Numerous mad inventions are also listed , which range from Atomic Power Generators to Walking Tripods which can be used as devices that really stretch the fringes of Victorian science or as artifacts from ancient civilizations .
The plot - point campaign follows the same conventions like most other Savage Worlds plot - point campaigns .
It starts with an overview of the regions where the campaign takes places complete with an overview of the history , possible encounters and special rules .
The encounters can be easily used if the GM needs to come up with an adventure on the fly or if he wants to add some flavor into a pre-planned game .
The section about the regions of Mars is quite extensive and includes a map of the city of Syrtis Major , which is the British Crown colony on Mars .
Red Sands contains an adventure generator that allows GMs to roll - up a simple adventure in no time .
If you love to improvise you can run whole campaigns with the adventure generator alone or you can use it to generate adventures between the actual plot points detailed later in the book .
I ’ve used this technique in my current Rippers campaign to great effect .
The Red Sands campaign which takes up the largest portion of the book is a grand adventure in which the player characters test their mettle against the Brotherhood of Luxor .
And of course the very survival of the solar system is at stake !
I wo n’t spoil the story here , but you can trust me , that it contains everything a good Space 1889 campaign contains .
The focus of the campaigns is Mars , but the player characters will have to travel to Earth and Venus , too .
The whole campaign is divided into 13 episodes and the GM is provided with detailed information on each episode including NPC stats , maps and tips for running the campaign .
Allies & Enemies
Red Sands concludes with an appendix containing the stats for various monsters and NPCs including the members of the nefarious Brotherhood .
Conclusion
Space 1889 : Red Sands looks great and contains a lot of information on the Space 1889 setting .
In my opinion the Savage Worlds rules are a great fit .
And even if you do n’t want to run a Space 1889 campaign , you can probably use a lot of the setting - specific rules ( especially the invention and Status rules ) in your own Victorian campaign .
If you like the planetary romance genre and / or the novels by Jules Verne , you definitely should check Space 1889 : Red Sands out when it hits the shelves later that year !
Zbigniew Libera : LEGO ( 1996 )
Der polnische Künstler Zbigniew Libera bietet mit seinem Konzentrationslager aus LEGO jedem ab sofort die Möglichkeit zu Hause das eigene kleine Lager nachzubauen .
Insgesamt entwarf Libera sieben LEGO - Bausteinboxen .
Der Hauptteil ist das Konzentrationslager-LEGOset und zur Erweiterung gibt es dann noch Häftlinge , die als Skelettmännchen gestaltet sind , sowie eine Folterkammer und Wachpersonal .
Die Schrecken der Geschichte werden von Libera auf trivialste Weise thematisiert .
Die Kommerzialisierung des Holocaust ist auf dem Höhepunkt angekommen .
Der Öffentlichkeit wurde der LEGO - Baukasten erstmals im Rahmen einer Ausstellung im Jewish Museum in Manhattan gezeigt .
Die Reaktion waren erwartungsgemäß gespalten .
Lagerbaracken und ein Krematorium aus Kinderspielzeug empfanden besonders KZ - Überlebende als Zumutung .
Die Provokation ist absolut , regt aber zum Nachdenken an. Die Frage Wem gehört Auschwitz ? , die Imre Kertesz 1998 aufgebracht hatte , wird bei Libera erneut gestellt .
Kertesz spricht sich mahnent gegen eine Kommerzialisierung des Holocaust aus , im Zuge von Filmen wie " Schindlers Liste " oder Benignis " Das Leben ist schön " diskutiert er , ob es ein Eigentumsrecht am Holocaust gibt .
Libera zeigt den Holocaust als billigen Warenartikel und stellt die Frage in den Raum Kann man , darf man so über Auschwitz reden bzw .
darf man Auschwitz auf solch triviale Weise darstellen ?.
DIE ZEIT : Wem gehört Auschwitz ?
von Imre Kertesz
Alan Greenspan gives us one more example of why the man who 's been wrong about everything should not be given any time to weigh in on the mess with our banking system and Wall Street that he helped to create .
Apparently Greenspan does n't think we will be able to separate the Wall Street casinos that got mixed into the formerly trusted banking industry and to do as Paul Volcker has recommended because it will be too hard to " segregate the types of transactions which are helping customers and those which are strictly proprietary " .
I 'd love for someone to explain to me what that bit of mumbo- jumbo means since I do n't know how to interpret economics 101 - Doublespeak .
For some clarity , here 's what he 's against .
Volcker Optimistic Financial Overhaul Will Include His Rule :
“ Let commercial banks be commercial banks , ” Volcker said .
Although it may be a step back compared to developments in the financial industry over the past decades , it would be a step to a “ safer and more productive future . ”
Read on ...
Volcker wants to prevent commercial banks with federally insured deposits from engaging in “ proprietary trading , ” or doing speculative trading with the company ’s money .
The Senate bill would n’t prohibit certain forms of bank speculation outright , but it would give regulators leeway to enforce limits on a case - by - case basis .
Senate Democrats on March 15 proposed a financial overhaul that would hurt big Wall Street banks by reining in their profits and requiring them to hold more capital .
The proposal includes a version of what Obama has dubbed the “ Volcker rule . ”
“ We have a promising possibility of getting agreement here ” for a “ reasonably good bill , ” Volcker said , adding he was more optimistic than a month ago .
He was speaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The former Federal Reserve chairman defended his proposal to give regulators the power to force banks to get rid of divisions that make risky bets with their capital , in order to help prevent another financial crisis .
Paul Volcker , a top adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama , Tuesday expressed optimism that a financial overhaul containing a version of his proposal to limit bank risk would pass in Congress .
Amazingly that made some sense to me , unlike this nonsense that Greenspan was spouting .
Maybe anyone that speaks Ayn Randsism can interpret for me .
It 's really pathetic that this man is allowed to claim that the country " had no experience of the type of risks that arose following the default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 " .
Really ?
What the hell does he think caused the Great Depression , or the Savings and Loan Crisis ?
Could n't be some pesky thing called deregulation could it ?
Could n't be undoing everything FDR put in place to keep us from having another Great Depression , could it ?
For anyone that needs a reminder of this man 's hubris and why no one should be interviewing him for advice on how to fix our economic problems now , go check out my post here on the Frontline documentary The Warning -- One Lone Regulator Warned About Derivatives ' Dangers .
It 's really shameless that ABC thought we should be hearing from this man that helped create the environment for our economic meltdown to occur to come out and give advice on how to fix it .
Transcript via ABC
News below the fold .
TAPPER : You have said recently that if institutions are too big to fail , they 're too big .
Do you support the Volcker rule , which would limit some of the transactions that commercial banks can do ?
GREENSPAN : Well , I think the point that he is making , that deposit funds which are subsidized should not be employed for speculative purposes , I would agree with .
The problem basically with the Volcker rule is it 's very difficult to apply in a general way , and I think that 's why there 's been considerable resistance to it , not the principle , but the issue of being able to segregate the types of transactions which are helping customers and those which are strictly proprietary .
Until they do that , I think it 's very difficult to implement .
TAPPER : You 'll be testifying about the financial crisis on Wednesday before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
When you testified before Congress in October , you said that you finally saw a flaw in -- in the way that you looked at markets , that markets cannot necessarily be trusted to completely police themselves .
But is n't it -- is n't it more than a flaw ?
Is n't it an indictment of Ayn Rand and the view that laissez - faire capitalism can be expected to function properly , that markets can be trusted to police themselves ?
GREENSPAN : Not at all .
I think that there is no alternative , if you want to have economic growth and higher standards of living , in a democratic society , to have competitive markets .
And , indeed , if you merely look at the history since the Enlightenment of the 18th century , when all of those ideas surfaced and became applicable in public policy , we 've had an explosion of economic growth , and especially in the developing countries , where hundreds of millions of people have been pulled out of poverty , of extreme poverty and starvation , basically because we have competitive markets .
So it 's not the principle of competitive markets which really has no alternative which works .
It is a strict application -- as I presented in a Brookings paper fairly recently on a somewhat technical area , the major mistake was assuming what the nature of risk would be .
And the reason it was missed is we have had no experience of the type of risks that arose following the default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 .
That 's the critical mistake .
And I made it .
Everybody that I know who works in this business made it .
And it means that basically we have to work our way back to understanding what went on .
And as I argue , what we need is far more required capital for financial institutions than we 've had .
TAPPER : There 's -- as you know , Michael Bury ( ph ) , who is a hedge fund manager in California , who made a lot of money looking at the subprime mortgage situation in the previous years and -- and saying to himself , " This is crazy .
It ca n't continue , " and he bet against it and made a lot of money , you were asked about it last month , and you referred to him as a statistical illusion .
He -- he has an op - ed in today 's New York Times in -- in which he questions whether or not you should be taking him more seriously .
And he says , " Mr. Greenspan should use his substantial intellect and unsurpassed knowledge of government to ascertain and explain exactly how he and other officials missed the boat .
If the mistakes were properly outlined , that might both inform Congress 's efforts to improve financial regulation and help keep future Fed chairmen from making the same errors again . "
Why are you not more interested in hearing what he has to say ?
GREENSPAN : Well , on the contrary -- first of all , I was not referring to him specifically .
There are three -- three -- three ( ph ) groups of people , those who got -- those who got it wrong about what the complexity was about to emerge in the -- that 's the vast majority of people , myself included .
TAPPER : Right .
GREENSPAN : Then there 's a group -- a relatively small , but not negligible group , who got it surely by luck .
And then there 's a very small group -- most of whom are my friends -- who got it right for the right reasons and that have done it time and time again .
I do n't know Mr. Bury ( ph ) .
But he basically may very well be in that third group .
I do n't know that .
But the problem is , he in that article , which I read quickly this morning , is actually making the case that it's a very small group , because he says effectively that no one agreed with him .
Well , he made his money -- properly , in my judgment , and I think very successfully -- by effectively selling subprimes short .
Now , if nobody ...
TAPPER : He was betting against subprime mortgages working .
GREENSPAN : Exactly .
And if everybody agreed with him or a large proportion of people agreed with him , he would n't have been able to sell those contracts , the short contracts , so to speak , which worked their way through credit default swaps and technical jargon .
There would be nobody to buy it , because they would agree with him .
So it required a very large proportion of the investing public , sophisticated investing public , to disagree with him .
And I think -- I do n't know whether or not he is in that extremely small group , which may -- may , in fact , be really exceptionally adroit at these things .
As I said a minute ago , I know four or five people who are really good .
I do n't know six , seven , eight or nine .
TAPPER : All right .
Dr. Alan Greenspan , we 'll have to leave it there .
Thank you so much for coming ...
GREENSPAN : My pleasure .
A low - cost generator with the potential to transform lives in the world ’s poorest communities is now being tested across the UK and in Nepal .
The Score project , led by The University of Nottingham , is developing a bio-mass burning cooking stove which also converts heat into acoustic energy and then into electricity , all in one unit .
The £ 2 million Score project ( Stove for Cooking , Refrigeration and Electricity ) brings together experts from across the world to develop the biomass - powered generator .
By developing an affordable , versatile domestic appliance Score aims to address the energy needs of rural communities in Africa and Asia , where access to power is extremely limited .

Cape Town , South Africa ( CNN ) --
As natural habitats disappear in South Africa , baboons and humans are increasingly coming into close contact , and conflict .
In South Africa 's Cape Peninsula there has been a large - scale transformation of wild baboons ' natural habitat into land for housing , industry and agriculture , according to the University of Cape Town Baboon Research Unit .
The result is that wild baboons are surrounded by humans , which the researchers say is causing human - baboon conflict to escalate .
But the problem is n't confined only to the Cape , as baboons are increasingly venturing into towns and villages across southern Africa in search of food , often leaving a trail of damage in their wake .
In the farming village of Barrydale , a four - hour drive from Cape Town , baboons are a growing problem .
While some local farmers say they want to shoot baboons found in the village , others favor a more sustainable solution .
Report : Central African gorillas may go extinct
Jenny Trethowan , of advocacy group Baboon Matters , is known as the " Baboon Lady " back in Cape Town .
She has spent her career trying to protect the primates in the Cape Peninsula , of which there are more than 400 .
In Barrydale , she sees an opportunity to tackle the problem before it gets out of hand .
" What is so exciting about the Barrydale scenario is the fact that they are being extremely proactive , " Trethowan told CNN .
" In many of the other areas it 's been a long time , where baboons have become habituated and trained .
Now in Barrydale they are saying ' let 's stop this behavior quickly before it gets started , ' and that 's enormously exciting for me . "
Trethowan has pinned her hopes on implementing a baboon - monitoring program in the village .
At the Joshua Baboon Rehabilitation Project , just outside Barrydale , Baboon Matters is training locals to be baboon monitors .
The monitors are tasked with patrolling Barrydale and herding baboons away from homes and farms .
" If we can get the monitoring program going quickly before the baboons are habituated I believe we stand a good chance of success here , " said Trethowan .
Nola Frazier runs the Joshua Baboon Rehabilitation Project and supports the village 's monitoring program .
" I do n't think the baboon problem is going to go away , " Frazier told CNN .
" It 's a learning curve .
It 's something that 's happening here ; it 's happening all over South Africa . "
An existing monitoring program on the Cape is yielding benefits .
Statistics from the Baboon Research
Unit show human - induced injuries to baboons are at their lowest for five years .
Deaths are also down , and the baboon population is up , which means encounters with humans are more likely .
African football academy creates future stars
When she 's not helping to run monitoring programs , Trethowan takes tourists on walks around the Cape Peninsula to see baboons in what she hopes will be their natural habitat .
But despite the monitors ' best efforts , the baboons sometimes stray from their natural environment .
The smell of cooking , and windows left open , are practically an invitation to hungry baboons , whose food raids can result in damage to property .
" When I take people to walk , I never describe baboons as something they are not , " said Trethowan .
" They do cause incredible damage , and the ideal thing would be for them to be on the mountain and not in the village .
" The monitors can struggle without a doubt .
What 's frustrating to me is to see the residents make little effort to help the monitors .
If they were working with the monitors more , the monitors would be more efficient . "
When it comes to taking on one of the continent 's most opportunistic animals , researchers and advocates say there are no easy answers .
" Baboons are definitely incredibly opportunistic and incredibly adaptable , so from a management point of view it makes it incredibly difficult , " said Trethowan .
But she said it 's these same characteristics that drew her into a life of advocacy for baboons .
" It is hugely amazing to watch how these baboons will adapt to a situation and will seize an opportunity and work with whatever they 've got , " she told CNN .
" I think we 've got a lot to learn from them , in hopes of showing more people the positives in an animal so often labeled a problem . "

Anyone that loves beer knows that it usually comes in paper holders or old plastic containers that have been around for like 20 years or longer .
There has been little development in this area and some might argue that a good concept does n’t need any refinement .
Well , a little refreshment is never bad in my opinion so why not touch up the beer crate design just a little ?
Will the beer taste better then ?
Will it make the beer slightly more expensive if the breweries start researching and developing new crates for their bottles ?
Well , of course it will , but it will also taste better , at least if they stick to this creative and daring design .
Making Heineken as the focused prototype brand Luis Luna managed to create something really inspiring and useful .
The functionality is far better than anything else on the market , and it really makes the beer taste better .
Why ?
It is because the crate itself has a simple cooling system created by pure water .
Just put it in the fridge or freezer and you are guaranteed to have cold beer wherever you go .
That ’s right , wherever you go .
The crate ’s cooling system is removable so it ’s just the inlay that you put in the freezer for cooling .
Then , just pop it out and put it back into the crate and add the bottles .
On the way to the beach , picnic or whatever event you are going to while you travel , the beer will get cold and tasty , all ready to pop open when you arrive .
The design itself is also very interesting since it is meant to hold and sport several different parts , which will ensure that the brand colors are all represented in a nice and clean way .
What else could you want , right ?
Bring in the beer !
The university system is limping , that ’s for sure .
But it ’s because of short - sighted decisions by policy - makers , not because of rebellious professors , as Margaret Wente would have us believe .
I have been a professor of communication studies and French at McMaster University since 2001 .
In July of that year , I joined McMaster as the first professor in the Communication Studies Program .
We started the program on a shoestring and a prayer .
We had many students , one faculty member and lots of enthusiasm .
I was 27 years old .
Those were heady times .
Since then , the program has grown and matured , developing into the program with the largest number of majors in the Faculty of Humanities .
Our alumni are very successful , our research and the fine art our faculty members produce is internationally recognized .
This year we started a graduate program – a Master of Communication and New Media .
We have an internship program that places at least 15 students per term .
Now here ’s the kicker : we did all of this with 5 and a half full - time faculty members .
We are lean and efficient .
We do not have a sense of entitlement .
In fact , I think that Ms. Wente would be hard pressed to find the professors who do n’t understand that they work for the citizenry .
My colleagues are exquisitely aware that their jobs , and tenure , create for them a very privileged place in society .
A sacred privilege that bears with it a serious responsibility to act as critics and commentators : people who are given the freedom by society to criticize it freely .
This is a fundamental part of our democracy .
It ’s important .
I sat on McMaster ’s University Planning and Budget Committees for three years from 2005 - 2007 .
I had a first - hand look into the pains that Deans take to make sure that every penny counts .
I watched them struggle valiantly to meet the no-deficit stipulation put forward by McMaster ’s Board of Governors and enforced by us on the Budget Committee .
They cut where they could , they spread more work over fewer faculty .
They downloaded as many tasks as possible .
The faculty took all of this on and worked with it .
They asked their research assistants to do more with less .
They took care of many more menial tasks than ever before .
They shouldered the administrative tasks of retiring colleagues who were not replaced .
They did their part .
For the most part , they did n’t complain .
Let ’s talk about salaries .
Most faculty do n’t really earn much money before their early thirties .
Think about this for a second : a typical young person finishes her BA at 22 years old , then her Master ’s degree two years later at 24 .
Her PhD will take her 4 - 5 years , so that puts her at 28 or 29 .
After that , she ’ll probably take a postdoctoral fellowship to beef up her publication record .
That ’s at least another two years , if not four .
So now she ’s 31 .
That means that she ’s been in school , living on survival wages until her early thirties .
Then she might find a tenure track job – if she ’s really lucky .
If she lands a tenure - track job , she ’ll probably be hired at a salary of about 70 k.
31 years old , with neglible income during her 20s , makes 70 k at 31 not a great payoff .
Then she has to get tenure .
That means another 6 years of 10 - 12 hour days and constant worry about whether she ’s meeting the bar for achieving tenure in research , teaching and administration .
That means that at 38 yrs of age , she ’ll be granted tenure and promotion to the rank of associate professor .
She might be making 100 - 110k .
She might still be single , not having found the time to marry or have children .
She might be divorced , the stress of the previous 20 years leading up to tenure being far greater than many relationships could bear .
Then , to earn her annual salary adjustment or merit increase , she will have to face constant criticism and peer review .
Constant scrutiny on a level only certain lawyers and surgeons and parliamentarians ever have to face .
Again , if she ’s lucky , she might be promoted to Full Professor seven or ten years later , at 48 years old .
At that moment , she might be making 120-130k .
All - the - while , her “ media profile ” is measured and reported to her Dean , who encourages her to increase it .
She has to apply for grant money from government , private and not - for - profit sources .
She has to write op - ed pieces .
She has to publish , direct MA and PhD theses , and go to at least one or two conferences per year .
She gives public lectures , she is involved in community service , political action or community education .
Does this sound like a gravy train to you ?
I did n’t think so .
What the system needs is an injection of resources to be able to keep professors productive .
It makes no sense to have professors who work with skeletal administrative support .
It makes no sense to have professors teach classes of hundreds upon hundreds of students .
That is n’t education .
It is n’t even training .
It is a simulation of education – it ’s just going through the motions and saying “ we have universities and we push a large percentage of the population through those universities . ”
If you look at the amount of money that the Province of Ontario spends on post - secondary education , it looks like a large number .
But bear in mind that this is a number that has n’t grown since Mike Harris cut funding to post - secondary education in the 1990s .
Funding was flat - lined .
This means that universities have been limping along using 1990s dollars in a 2010 economy .
A proper post - secondary education costs money .
It is not cheap .
Rather than bullying professors and threatening to take away tenure – neither of which will do anything to reduce the cost of delivering world - class higher education in Canada – Government should be finding ways of injecting much - needed resources into the system .
That means choosing between a few options :
greater investment of taxpayer money ,
multi-tiered system of universities ,
privatization of several universities ,
deregulation of tuition fees .
America has colleges that deliver spectacular results , both in terms of research and educating well - rounded , thoughtful citizens .
But American student - professor ratios of 10 to 1 are very costly .
Tuition fees often hover between 25 - 40 k , and we ’re not talking about ivy - league schools here .
Just typical , small , liberal - arts colleges .
The great American institutions , such as Dartmouth and Princeton are small and spectacularly well - funded .
Princeton has fewer than 7,000 students .
Yale has fewer than 12,000 .
Those are small institutions compared to Canada ’s giant schools ( McMaster has approximately 22,000 students , U of Toronto has over 60,000 , York more than 50,000 ) .
So , in a word – Margaret Wente should understand what she is talking about before she speaks .
The Canadian university system need fixing .
But let ’s get our facts straight : the professors are n’t the problem – the funding model is .
Canada needs a powerful , national vision for post - secondary education .
And it needs it now .
Post - secondary education is the key to prosperity from today until the year 2100 .
The policy - maker who comes up with a serious plan for post - secondary education will be remembered as one of this century ’s great visionaries .
TOMORROW – why education matters .

IBM snubbed a request from the British founder of TurboHercules SAS to let it offer a disaster recovery product for IBM mainframe users and instead accused the French open source startup of violating its intellectual property .
According to a letter published today by NosoftwarePatents founder Florian Mueller , Big Blue has abandoned its commitment to the open source community by attacking the Hercules project , which was founded by Roger Bowler more than a decade ago .
The mainframe emulator code was written to enable users to run IBM 's z/OS on x64 or Itanium iron instead of System z hardware from Big Blue .
" A reliable source close to the Hercules project has provided me with this letter that Mark Anzani , IBM 's mainframe CTO , recently sent to TurboHercules SAS , " wrote Mueller .
" The letter comes with a ' non- exhaustive ' list including 106 IBM patents plus 67 pending patent applications . "
He claimed that the list includes two of the US patents ( 5613086 and 5220669 ) which were among the 500 patents IBM pledged not to use against the open source community .
" This is so appalling that I felt compelled to show to the FOSS community what IBM is doing : IBM is using patent warfare in order to protect its highly lucrative mainframe monopoly against Free and Open Source Software . "
Mueller is demanding regulatory action against IBM , which already faces an anti-trust probe after TurboHercules filed a complaint with the European Commission last month .
" In an area in which IBM generates massive revenues ( an estimated $ 25 bn annually just on mainframe software sales ! ) , any weapon will be brought into position against open source , " griped Mueller .
" Even patents , which represent to open source what nuclear arms are in the physical world . "
We asked Big Blue to comment on this story , but at time of writing it had n't gotten back to us . ®
Since mapping the human genome 10 years ago , J. Craig Venter has found plenty of work .
The biologist now is burrowing into DNA in as many forms as he can discover , in organisms from the sea and deep underground .
His goal : to use the building blocks found in naturally occurring DNA to make synthetic cells .
He and his partners at Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC believe genetically engineered life forms hold great promise for energy and other industries .

A Swedish entrepreneur is trying to market and sell a biodegradable plastic bag that acts as a single - use toilet for urban slums in the developing world .
Once used , the bag can be knotted and buried , and a layer of urea crystals breaks down the waste into fertilizer , killing off disease - producing pathogens found in feces .

The FBI , the IRS and the US Attorney ’s office in Tallahassee have opened a criminal investigation into the use of credit cards by top GOP officials for personal expenses , according to a report Wednesday .
All three agencies are involved in the probe , which centers on the use of Republican Party - issued American Express cards allegedly used for personal expenses .

A second investigation involving the IRS seeks to determine whether some of the credit card use effectively qualifies as tax evasion , since use for personal expenses should have been declared as income .
The IRS is said to be examining the tax records of at least three top GOP officials , including the Republican contender for one of Florida ’s US Senate seats .
Onetime Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio , now running against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate , is one of the individuals being probed .
Rubio billed the party for more than $ 100,000 during the two years he served as House speaker , according to credit card statements obtained by the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald .
The charges included repairs to the family minivan , grocery bills , plane tickets for his wife and purchases from retailers ranging from a wine store near his home to Apple ’s online store .
Rubio also charged the party for dozens of meals during the annual lawmaking session in Tallahassee , even though he received taxpayer subsidies for his meals .
Rubio said the billings all related to party business Ã¢â‚¬â€ the minivan , for example , was damaged by a valet at a political function Ã¢â‚¬â€  and that he repaid the party for about $ 16,000 in personal expenses .
Asked during his campaign bus tour last week if he needed to amend his tax returns to reflect any party money that covered his personal expenses , Rubio said , “ We do n’t believe it ’s income .
It ’s not .
. . .
Whatever the law is , we ’re going to comply , but I do n’t think it ’s income . ”
In February , the former Florida House speaker ( at left ) admitted that he ’d double - billed taxpayers and the Florida GOP for eight plane flights at a cost of about $ 3,000 .
The Times report says that the state party has yet to receive Rubio ’s promised check .
Rubio’s tax attorney told the paper the double - billing was an “ accounting mistake . ”

The other two named in the IRS probe by the St. Petersburg Times are ex-state party chairman Jim Greer and ex-party executive director Delmar Johnson .
“ I paid all my taxes and did everything my accountant told me to do , ” Greer is quoted as saying .
Johnson ’s American Express bill included charges for posh meals , chartered planes and rounds of golf .
Here ’s an update on the UPS iPad deliveries : we ’ve been told that it will be virtually impossible to have one delivered prior to Saturday and your shipping status does n’t mean squat .
Here ’s why …
There are iPad shipments sitting in your local UPS location right now .
Yes , they are there .
Right now .
The issue ?
Apple has hired an outside security agency to monitor all shipments from the regional distribution centers to the local hubs , and at the local hubs , the cages ( where they hold the packages ) are under 24/7 guard by the outside security agency .
Apple did the same thing when they used FedEx for iPhone shipments , and they also had the same security company literally sleeping overnight at AT&T stores when they got iPhones the day before launch day .
Do n’t worry if your tracking info still shows the package has n’t left China , it ’s probably only 10 miles from you , sitting comfortably under the watchful eyes of Top Flight security .

If it were n’t for a photo that appears a few chapters later — featuring Manfred Schoeder , an unfunky - looking , 1950s Bell Labs inventor , posing with a copy of Jonzun Crew ’s classic electro LP Lost in Space — you could n’t ask for a better snapshot of the vocoder ’s extraordinary and unlikely odyssey : a military instrument turned musical .
Like a gadget Zelig , the vocoder seems to touch everything : Solzhenitsyn and Stevie Wonder , Kraftwerk and Stanley Kubrick , heads of state and heralds of hip - hop .
This instrument with such a strange and incredible history has a hand in some pretty strange and incredible music , of course .

Author ’s Note :
When I first met Bobby Egan at his restaurant in Hackensack , New Jersey , he set a plate of barbecue in front of me , sat down , and launched into the most unbelievable story I ’d ever heard .
For 13 years , Egan claimed , he had inserted himself into a dangerous , high - stakes political game between Washington and Pyongyang .
I shook my head when he told me — among other mind - boggling tales — about how he submitted to a truth - serum interrogation on his first trip to Pyongyang , collected North Korean hair samples for the FBI , and became fishing buddies with North Korea ’s head of American affairs , Han Song Ryol .
Turns out the stories were true .
In the early 1990s , after the North Koreans ’ efforts to reach out to Washington were rebuffed , they turned to Egan , a high - school dropout from a mobbed - up Jersey town who had worked with Vietnamese officials as a POW activist .
Egan ’s wild yarns are retold in our new book , Eating with the Enemy : How I Waged Peace with North Korea from My BBQ Shack in Hackensack , out this week from St. Martin ’s Press .
The following excerpt , told in Bobby ’s voice , picks up in 2002 , shortly after President Bush declared North Korea part of an “ axis of evil . ”
— –
“ INFECTED GUMS , ” HAN SAID .
He winced as he pulled his lip up and his cheek out .
His front teeth looked like an old graveyard .
I looked deeper .
The flesh around his molars was violet - colored and swollen .
“ Nothing they can do , ” he said .
“ Too much money . ”
It was bad for world peace to have North Korea ’s ambassador in terrible pain .
And I could n’t stand to see my buddy suffer .
“ We ’ll fix it , ” I said .
“ I ’ve got just the guy . ”
John “ The Greek ” Kallis was the best oral surgeon in northern New Jersey .
He once pulled a wisdom tooth for Tom Cruise , and the photos in his office showed the other famous mouths he ’d worked on : Kevin Bacon , Jennifer Lopez , Patrick Ewing of the Knicks , Doug Gilmore of the New Jersey Devils , ice skaters Silvia Fontana and John Zimmerman , and cast members from The Sopranos .
More importantly , The Greek was a friend of mine .
He was a street guy like me — born to a couple of immigrants in Hell ’s Kitchen and raised in a tough neighborhood of Fort Lee , N.J. , which was important because I needed somebody willing to take a few risks who would n’t ask too many questions .
I told The Greek that the North Korean in charge of handling the nuclear crisis had a bad toothache , and that easing his pain was crucial to the stability of the world .
He agreed right away to help .
And he took it on faith when I said we ’d try to get funds from a charity group to pay his bill .
I told him the FBI knew I was organizing dental work for Han , which was true , although my contact , Special Agent Tom Marakovits , had tried to chase me off the idea .
“ Dentistry can be dangerous , ” he ’d said as we discussed the idea at Cubby ’s .
“ What if something bad happens , God forbid .
Or what if he alleges malpractice ?
We ’re at war with these guys . ”
“ What if his infection gets worse , and he dies , because we do n’t give him access to healthcare ? ”
“ Do n’t say that ! ”
“ You ’re right .
God forbid . ”
Marakovits shifted in his seat .
“ I checked into it , anyway .
We ’re not responsible for him . ”
“ You mean legally , ” I said .
“ If he is ill , he needs to return to his place of origin . ”
I gave Marakovits a look .
“ You ’ve never seen a medical facility in North Korea .
If you had , you would n’t say that . ”
“ I ’m looking out for your best interests , ” he said .
“ You do n’t have to take unnecessary risks . ”
I took a long pull of my coffee .
“ Sure I do . ”
“ What do you mean , you do ? ”
“ If we only took necessary risks , we would n’t get very far , ” I said .
“ You realize that if you get in trouble , I get in trouble . ”
“ Then I guess that makes us partners , ” I smiled .
“ Think about your family . ”
Marakovits glanced at the kitchen door .
“ If something happens to you , it will be bad for them , too . ”
“ Now you sound like a North Korean . ”
He waggled his head back and forth .
“ If something goes haywire , bigger feet are going to step in from the Bureau , ” he said .
“ I wo n’t be able to help you . ”
I liked Marakovits .
I did .
Deep inside , part of him probably wanted to be doing what I was doing , mixing it up with the enemy .
But he was timid .
He had a badge and a cheap suit and a pension to protect .
“ We ’re just going to knock him out , pull out a tooth or two . ” I said .
“ When you see somebody in pain , do n’t you want to help them ? ”
Marakovits sat upright .
“ Tell me you ’re not going put the ambassador from North Korea under general anesthesia . ”
He clasped his hands on the table and fiddled with his thumb .
“ Who ’s the dentist ?
Does he have a license ? ”
“ It ’s better if you do n’t know , ” I said .
I walked Marakovits to his car and lied to him .
I said I ’d call before we did any dental work on Han .
The Greek cleared his calendar for the second Saturday in November , when his practice would normally have been closed .
I arranged for Han to meet me at 8 a.m. on a side street nearby , where we could make sure neither of us had been followed by anybody from the Bureau .
The less the FBI knew about it , the better .
Han came with two guys — a security goon and one of his assistants — in a Chrysler sedan they used when they wanted to travel incognito .
I came with Mike “ O ’D ” O’Donovan , an old hunting buddy , who was ex-Special Forces and had just come back from showing coffee finca owners in El Salvador how to protect their land .
With crew - cut gray hair , crazy - looking blue eyes and questionable table manners — he liked to gross out my daughters by eating live worms —
O’D was not exactly what you ’d call refined company .
But he was one of the best private security men in the business , and it seemed like a good idea to have somebody who was loosely associated with the law in case anything went wrong .
The dentist ’s office was on the ground floor of a beautiful residential tower next to the George Washington Bridge , with a view of Manhattan across the Hudson .
We parked in the alleyway beside the building to avoid the surveillance cameras in the garage and left Han ’s junior colleague with the cars .
An assistant took X - rays of Han ’s jaw , and while we waited for the results , Han checked out at a framed photo of James Gandolfini sitting at a dinner table with a napkin , a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine in front of him .
“ The Greek worked on Tony Soprano ? ”
Han asked .
I could tell he was nervous , so I went over and put my hand on his shoulder .
“ He ’s the best of the best . ”
The North Korean security goon sat in a lounge chair in the waiting room , where he stayed for the rest of the day .
O’D positioned himself against the opposite wall .
They put on sunglasses and pretended to ignore each other .
The Greek called Han and me back into his office .
“ This is the Panorex , ” he said as a technician pinned Han ’s X - ray onto a light box .
We leaned in for a better look .
“ The immediate situation is the infection around this lower - left premolar , which has to come out right away , ” he said .
“ The larger issue is you ’ve got problems brewing in all four quadrants .
There is some really primitive dentistry .
These could flare up at any point . ”
Later , when Han was under general anesthesia , The Greek told me he ’d never seen anything like it .
“ Did you get a look at those bridges ? ” he said .
“ They ’re aluminum .
Hollow .
Crimped on .
They used to be called ash - can bridges .
You hear about these things in school , but nobody ’s done this kind of work since the 1940s . ”
We agreed to remove six teeth and replace them with implants .
“ I ’ll do this in stages , ” he told Han .
“ It ’s safer .
We can do some today , and then in the next month or so — ”
“ No , ” Han said .
“ All at once . ”
He worried that if war broke out , he could be recalled to Pyongyang with his mouth only partly fixed .
The Greek warned that putting him under anesthesia for most of the day would increase the risk of cardiac or respiratory problems .
But Han insisted , and a technician hooked him to an IV drip and a machine to monitor his vital signs .
“ I want Bobby to be in the room the whole time , ” Han said .
Two dental assistants came in and prepped .
O’Donovan followed them in , to observe .
As The Greek sedated him , Han gripped my hand and then relaxed as he slipped into unconsciousness .
O’D watched with a mixture of curiosity and disgust .
“ You guys want to be heroes ? ” he said with a cynical grin .
“ Do n’t knock him out .
Knock him off . ”
The dental assistants exchanged a look .
O’D seemed too excited about the idea of blood and bone being chiseled out of an enemy ambassador .
But he was just expressing how a lot of Americans felt after 9/11 — looking for black and white , good and bad .
Anybody from an enemy country was an enemy .
Everything was simpler that way .
The Greek and his assistants went in hard with the drill , and soon the room filled with the sound of metal chipping against bone and the acrid smell of tooth enamel vaporizing into dust and smoke .
Other times it sounded like they were sawing through wood .
One of the assistants pumped steroids and antibiotics into Han ’s veins to ward off swelling and infection .
The Greek ’s gloves were spattered red .
The second assistant siphoned off the blood and spit pooling in Han ’s mouth .
Another served up a series of tools that looked like torture instruments .
I ’ve gutted plenty of animals with my own knife and seen some gruesome stuff in my time , but nothing quite like what they did to Han ’s jaw that afternoon .
I was proud of him for what he endured .
I do n’t care if he was unconscious , it was brave .
They flapped back his gums , yanked out the teeth and set them in a metal tray .
The Greek cut a window in the upper jawbone , lifted the membrane that covered Han ’s sinuses and then packed in pieces of bone so that new bone could take root .
The hours of surgery wore on .
Outside the window the autumn sky was a clear slate .
I thought of my first trip to Manhattan as a kid , and all the flags .
They hung from tall poles , high out of reach , rustled by the wind here and there but mostly just limp pieces of green , blue , red and yellow .
Behind them , the mirrored windows of the UN building reflected the bright sky and the dark city below .
Our chaperones led us off the school bus into the General Assembly hall .
We stood on an observation deck and stared at the strange - looking people : Africans wearing full - length robes , the Asian guys in business suits .
I had some exposure to blacks and Hispanics .
I ’d seen a few in Fairfield and on TV .
Dad warned me to stay away from them if they were in groups .
But the UN was like landing on another planet .
A caramel - colored man with a face like a wedge shook hands with a round - headed guy with gold - rimmed glasses and a little goatee .
Flat faces and long faces huddled together .
One wore a white headdress with a black ring around his forehead .
What were these people called ?
Our teachers made us eighth graders take turns listening to the General Assembly with a pair of headphones .
Most kids listened for a few seconds and passed them on .
I went last , and when I put the headphones on my ears , I could n’t understand a word .
One of the kids before me had switched the dial .
I sat at the little desk , turned the knob and heard translations in French , Russian , Spanish , Chinese and Arabic .
I did n’t know what the sounds were supposed to be .
Where I came from , there was English , the northern New Jersey variety , and that was it .
To us , kids from 15 miles south in Hoboken talked funny .
I could n’t stop turning the knob back and forth .
One voice sounded like bubbles .
Another sounded like knives .
The world was full of people who understood what these noises meant .
But I ’d never know , and it made me feel small .
I tried to imagine all these people , who were loyal to their own flags and their own languages , far beyond Fairfield and Roseland and Hackensack .
“ Bolus ! ” The Greek shouted at one of his assistants .
He was starting to sweat .
He glanced up at the monitor , barking at his assistants in code words .
“ Titrate ! ” he yelled .
“ What ’s wrong ? ” I moved in closer .
“ Arrhythmia .
We gave him Atropine to dry out his mouth , but it ’s making his heart beat differently . ”
“ Is that dangerous ? ” I tried to make sense of the lines blipping around on the monitor , as the anesthesiologist dumped more drugs into the IV .
Han ’s mouth gaped open .
He looked like a vulnerable child .
Across the room , O ’D waved at me , put two fingers up to his lips and then mouthed the words , “ Going out for a smoke . ”
The Greek and his team kept picking away inside Han ’s mouth .
I took that as a good sign .
Then all of a sudden , they shuffled around .
“ He ’s stopped breathing , ” one of the assistants whispered .
To be continued …
Part II : “ Hamburger Diplomacy . ”
“ An agent from Pyongyang , somebody like Cranky , would knock on my front door and rub out my whole family .
And then he ’d come after The Greek ’s … Then a worse scenario occurred to me :
What if Han died , and it led to war ? ”

If all goes according to plan , New Jersey ’s first legally grown marijuana plants will be harvested this fall from greenhouses , where they will have been growing for months under the gaze of cameras and security guards .
The plants will be dried , packaged and readied for purchase at six licensed facilities by thousands of registered patients who have debilitating illnesses .
The product will not be called Garden State Red or Jersey Gold or anything like that .
But when that first joint is lit , New Jersey officially will have ventured where none of the other 13 states that legalized marijuana consumption for medicinal purposes has gone before : taking the lead role in the pot manufacturing and distribution business .
Queasy over the idea of filling the Garden State with scores of backyard pot plants , lawmakers in January passed the most restrictive medical marijuana statute in the nation by banning patients , their families and other caregivers from growing their own .
But for state officials who must implement the law , this tough stance raises questions so complicated they wonder if they ’ll be able to meet this fall ’s deadline .
Consider :
• In the next six months , state health officials must decide who should be permitted to grow the drug and where , how it should be tested for potency and safety , and in which communities it will be sold .
The health department has informally approached Rutgers University ’s School of Environmental and Biological Sciences to play an unspecified role , but no discussions have taken place .
• Officials will have to devise a system to screen the hundreds of aspiring marijuana entrepreneurs who have called looking to break into an industry that has been thriving in other states .
• And they will have to make sure they do n’t run afoul of the federal and state laws that still recognize marijuana possession and distribution as crimes .
Advocates say at least 5,000 New Jerseyans with debilitating diseases are waiting for the state to implement the new law .
One group predicts that number will eventually top 30,000 .
" I am tired of feeling like a criminal when obtaining and using marijuana — which I always use responsibly and away from my children — just to lead a normal life , " said Chuck Kwiatkowski of Hazlet , a 38 - year - old father of three who left his computer programming job at AT&T when multiple sclerosis disabled him .
" Each day that goes by , at least 5,000 people miss their medication . "
Speaking at her Senate confirmation two weeks ago , acting Health and Senior Services Commissioner Poonam Alaigh acknowledged the department was still in the early stages of designing the program and was " having some issues . "
" We are rigorously trying to meet the time frame , but the first priority is to create a structure " that will be the " most restrictive , in the way the law was meant to be , " said Alaigh .
Bill sponsor Sen. Nicholas Scutari ( D - Union ) said both Alaigh and Gov. Chris Christie asked to extend the nine - month start - up period required under the law .
" I said no , " Scutari said .
" I want to see them make progress .
I ’m confident the new commissioner will take the bull by the horns . "
DREADED MODEL
A wary supporter at best , Christie , a former U.S. attorney , inherited the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act from Gov. Jon Corzine , who signed it into law the day before Christie ’s inauguration .
Nancy Fedder , a 62 - year - old Hillsborough resident with multiple sclerosis , said she has bought marijuana illegally for 20 years to relieve the fiery pain and muscle spasms in her legs and feet .
She said she is discouraged that the law ’s implementation is in the hands of a governor who has expressed concerns about it .
" I know a lot of people who are waiting for this law , " Fedder said .
" We are not holding our breath , because Mr. Christie is not going to push this along .
He ’s a cop by nature .
I find it hard to believe he will implement it .
All he has to do is slow this down . "
Michael Drewniak , Christie ’s press secretary , insists the governor ’s request for an extension to implement the law is not about " trying to slow anything down . "
" There are security and legal issues that have to be attended to , " he said .
" We do n’t want to become the California model . "
Angst over California — where dispensaries are as commonplace in some communities as coffee bars , and federal officials have launched raids — is one reason New Jersey lawmakers said registered users will not be allowed to grow pot at home .
Clamping down on the supply will make New Jersey the first state in the nation to provide medical marijuana through its own centralized production and distribution system .
The law initially limits the distribution sites , also known as " alternative treatment centers , " to six locations run by nonprofit organizations , with the state deciding whether to license more centers run by both for - profit and nonprofit entities .
" We are in very new territory , " said Bradley Hillman , senior associate director of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers .
" Every other state has some level of growth allowed by individuals .
It butts up against some major issues — how state law will butt up against fed law .
It ’s my understanding even in the various states that have state laws allowing growth for personal use , you can still run afoul of federal agencies . "
New Mexico , for example , scrapped plans three years ago for a state - managed system to produce and distribute medical marijuana and decided to allow people to grow their own because officials feared state employees would be " subject to potential federal prosecution . "
The state , which still allows people to grow their own , recently licensed five dispensaries that serve about 800 registered medical marijuana users .
Robert Goodman , executive director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers , said there are many ways the school could help .
It could oversee the growth and cultivation , provide land and teach inexperienced growers , or offer guidance through research .
Any facility that grows pot , they cautioned , would require 24 - hour safeguards against theft .
But Rutgers University officials say they are wary of federal laws .
" We would n’t even attempt to proceed with this unless we first checked it out legally , " said associate director Margaret Brennan .
" In New Jersey where you talk about just six locations that are growing huge quantities , the state itself may have an issue with the federal government . "
BUSINESS OPENINGS
Last fall , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder eased states ’ anxiety by announcing that raiding medical marijuana facilities would be a low priority for federal agents .
Paul Fishman , the U.S. attorney for New Jersey , said his office " will not focus our federal law enforcement efforts on ... individuals who are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing New Jersey law . "
But , he said , the office will prosecute those who try to use the law as a cover .
As state officials sort through these legal issues , they plan to set rules to deal with people who are looking to make money from medical marijuana .
" I am sure state government is going to be hugely under pressure to let entrepreneurs find their way into this new opportunity , " Goodman said .
Brennan added : " The economics are huge .
There is a tremendous amount of potential for the state and whoever is awarded contracts to be growing it . "
J.B. Woods and his wife , Mary , operate a Colorado insurance company that is one of five in the world specializing in policies for marijuana dispensaries .
He said they hope to break into the New Jersey market .
Woods said the law will bring an " enormous economic benefit , " because growing and dispensing pot requires facilities , workers and spin - off businesses .
New Jersey ’s major business groups wo n’t say who wants to get in on the medical marijuana industry , and state officials wo n’t disclose who is knocking on the door .
Scutari said the economic benefit is another reason New Jersey should implement the law on time .
He believes New Jersey , like other states , should tax medical marijuana .
The law does n’t provide any state funding for the program ; he said it would pay for itself through charging fees for participants , dispensaries and even registered caregivers , who will need police background checks .
The Coalition for Medical Marijuana NJ has held meetings for patients , entrepreneurs and health care workers , but chief executive director Ken Wolski says the state has not responded to the group ’s request to help craft the rules .
One of the first steps the state is expected to take is creating a patient registry , allowing people to apply once their doctors attest they suffer from one of a list of specific serious illnesses and cannot be helped by traditional medicine .
Chris Goldstein , a coalition spokesman , said a registration card would be " the most important thing from a law and public safety standpoint .
They want to see registered patients with the card in their pocket so there is no question about who is registered . "
Kwiatkowski said his doctor has promised to write a recommendation for him when it comes time to apply .
For now , he ’ll continue risking arrest by buying pot illegally because he says it helps him function — and makes him a better parent .
" They have no idea what ’s going on , " Kwiatkowski said of his three daughters , ages 9 , 7 and 4 .
" Piggyback rides — that ’s what my 4 - year - old wants .
And she ’s getting them . "
Last week David Cross stirred up the internet and Arrested Development fans when he came out with this statement :
“ [ It ’s ] just not going to happen … I mean , there ’s so many people involved .
Everyone ’s doing their own thing , you know .
And everybody ’s aged .
It ’s just not going to happen . ”
Many fans were upset over the statement as demand for the show ’s movie adaptation has been high .
Well if your hopes were dashed last week , Jason Bateman has contradicted that statement , saying it ’s NOT dead .
He explained in a recent interview :
“ David says that it ’s dead , but it ’s not dead at all … [ Show creator ]
Mitch Hurwitz is busy shooting a new pilot with Will Arnett , and perhaps when they ’re done shooting and editing and he ’s delivered that , perhaps he ’ll jump into writing the script .
Once the script is done , it goes to the studio and they decide if it ’s a script they want to make , and the actors will decide if they want to be in it . ”
So basically …
“ It ’s a long process .
But it could happen and it ’s still in everybody ’s plans for it to happen . ”
The project is likely to happen ( with such a strong following ) but the ‘ when ’ seems to be the issue .
David Cross ’ statement now seems odd and probably premature , but it may be an indication he no longer wants to be involved ?
I ’m not sure , that ’s just my speculation .
If you ’re a fan of the series , there ’s still hope for this film , but do n’t start camping out for tickets just yet …it could be a long wait .

" The Iranians have a peaceful nuclear program .
This cannot be said about the Americans who mined uranium in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and went on to produce a nuclear bomb used to attack Japan , " he said .
" We have our uranium and no one is mining it , until we decide otherwise , " he said .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans are more likely to say the U.S. should prioritize development of energy supplies than to say it should prioritize protecting the environment , the first time more have favored energy production over environmental protection in this question 's 10 - year history .
The March 4 - 7 Gallup poll was conducted a few weeks before President Obama came out in favor of oil exploration off some sections of the U.S. coast , and shortly after he advocated the expanded use of nuclear power in the United States .
The current data represent a continuing shift in opinion toward energy production .
Since 2007 , when Americans ' preferences for environmental protection were the greatest ( 58 % to 34 % ) , Americans ' opinions have shown significant movement each year in the direction of prioritizing energy production .
This change has been evident among nearly every major demographic subgroup , although self - identified liberals have remained relatively steadfast in saying the environment should be a higher priority .
At the same time , Americans continue to advocate greater energy conservation by consumers ( 52 % ) over greater production of oil , gas , and coal supplies ( 36 % ) as a means of solving the nation 's energy problems .
Americans have always come out in favor of greater consumer conservation , though this year marks the highest percentage favoring production ( by a percentage point ) in the last 10 years .
The movement toward pro-production attitudes comes at a time when Americans ' concerns about the U.S. energy situation have subsided .
Thirty - three percent of Americans describe the energy situation in the United States as " very serious , " down from 42 % last year and the lowest since 2005 .
Additionally , 45 % expect the U.S. to face a critical energy shortage in the next five years , down sharply from 62 % in 2008 , when gas prices were soaring , and the lowest Gallup has measured in the last 10 years .
( See the tables on Page 2 for the full trends on these questions . )
One possible explanation for the greater public priority on energy production at a time of diminished concern about energy is that Americans typically become somewhat less likely to say they favor environmental protection during down economic times .
In the same March 4 - 7 poll , Gallup also found a new high in the percentage of Americans favoring economic growth over environmental protection .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,014 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 4 - 7 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Wildlife documentary makers are infringing animals ' rights to privacy by filming their most private and intimate moments , according to a new study .
Footage of animals giving birth in their burrows or mating crosses an ethical line that film - makers should respect , according to Brett Mills , a lecturer in film studies at the University of East Anglia .
Mills compiled a report on animals ' rights to privacy after reviewing scenes from the BBC 's 2009 wildlife series " Nature 's Great Events " .
Among the offending footage was film of a narwhal whale that appeared to have retreated from view beneath the Arctic ice sheet .
" Instead of thinking we 'll leave it alone , film - makers decide the only solution is to develop new technology so they can film it , " Mills said .
" We have an assumption that humans have some right to privacy , so why do we not assume that for other species , particularly when they are engaging in behaviour that suggests they do n't want to be seen ? "
In 2008 the BBC was inundated with complaints after Springwatch presenter Bill Oddie described an encounter between two beetles : " He crash - lands on top of a likely looking lady .
There 's a bit of luck !
One thing 's for sure : this boy is horny ! "
Mills said filming such encounters with miniature cameras was a level of surveillance humans would most likely object to .
" The key thing in most wildlife documentaries is filming those very private moments of mating or giving birth .
Many of these activities , in the human realm , are considered deeply private , but with other species we do n't recognise that , " he said .
Mills ' report appears in the Journal of Media and Cultural Studies .
Mills said that while it might seem odd to claim animals have a right to privacy , the idea should not be dismissed .
" We can never really know if animals are giving consent , but they do often engage in forms of behaviour which suggest they 'd rather not encounter humans , " he said .
The BBC's Natural History unit in Bristol said : " Constantly developing filming technology gives wildlife film - makers the ability to film animal behaviour with minimal disruption to the animal .
Film - makers work very closely with scientists whose work studying the complexity of animal lives is vital for wildlife conservation .
" Natural history films play a major role in spreading knowledge of their work .
And understanding the world around is vital in the continuing endeavour to preserve our ecosystem . "
The cider rise is particularly unpopular in the west of England
The government has dropped plans for a 10 % tax rise on cider following fierce opposition to the move .
Ministers were forced to rescind the increase , announced in the Budget , as part of efforts to get laws passed after the general election was called .
With Parliament dissolving on 12 April , a broadband tax and an electoral reform referendum have also been dropped .
The Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the cider move but Labour say it will be re-introduced if they are re-elected .
Ministers have already confirmed that plans for a referendum on the voting system and to phase out the remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords have been dropped from a bill on constitutional reform .
However , Labour are set to include plans for a referendum on electoral reform and an elected House of Lords in their manifesto .
In the rush to secure legislation before Parliament breaks up , known as the " wash - up period " , ministers historically have to make concessions in order to ensure that bills are approved .
Legislation to drive down fees charged by libel lawyers was dropped after a rebellion by Labour MPs concerned that it would deter lawyers from taking cases on .
Additionally , a 50 p - a - month broadband tax , which would have been applied to all households with a landline telephone , has been shelved .
Outstanding bills
The 10 % above inflation tax rise for cider came into force at the end of last month after being announced by Chancellor Alistair Darling .
Mr Darling said it was justified because cider had historically been treated more favourably than other alcohol categories but the opposition parties said the move was punitive , at a time when British firms were struggling to emerge from the recession .
The Conservatives said the tax rise would now expire on 30 June , after which cider would be subject to the standard 2 % increase announced in the Budget for beers and spirits .
The Conservatives and Lib Dems are fighting to win seats in the west of England , the historic home of the cider industry .
The cider tax rise was included in the government 's Finance Bill , which was eventually passed by the House of Commons on Wednesday .
The Conservatives said they also forced the government to backtrack on the plans to levy a charge on landline phone bills - due to come into force in October - to pay for the universal roll - out of broadband .
They declared the reversal of the two tax rises - as well as another on the taxation of holiday rental homes - as a " major victory for businesses and consumers across Britain " .
Labour has said all the tax measures will be re-introduced should it be re-elected .
The bill still has to be passed by the House of Lords but ministers have already said a number of other measures - including plans for a new body to support financial regulation and for consumers to be able to join together to make it easier to sue financial firms - have been dropped .

Via : EFF :
A federal judge has dismissed Jewel v. NSA , a case from the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) on behalf of AT&T customers challenging the National Security Agency ’s mass surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans ’ phone calls and emails .
“ We ’re deeply disappointed in the judge ’s ruling , ” said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
“ This ruling robs innocent telecom customers of their privacy rights without due process of law .
Setting limits on Executive power is one of the most important elements of America ’s system of government , and judicial oversight is a critical part of that . ”
In the ruling , issued late Thursday , U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker held that the privacy harm to millions of Americans from the illegal spying dragnet was not a “ particularized injury ” but instead a “ generalized grievance ” because almost everyone in the United States has a phone and Internet service .
“ The alarming upshot of the court ’s decision is that so long as the government spies on all Americans , the courts have no power to review or halt such mass surveillance even when it is flatly illegal and unconstitutional , ” said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
“ With new revelations of illegal spying being reported practically every other week — just this week , we learned that the FBI has been unlawfully obtaining Americans ’ phone records using Post - It notes rather than proper legal process — the need for judicial oversight when it comes to government surveillance has never been clearer . ”
Jewel v. NSA is aimed at ending the NSA ’s dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and holding accountable the government officials who illegally authorized it .
Evidence in the case includes undisputed documents provided by former AT&T telecommunications technician Mark Klein showing AT&T has routed copies of Internet traffic to a secret room in San Francisco controlled by the NSA .
That same evidence is central to Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit that ’s currently under appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit .
Be proud , small - business owners !
You 're now the most trusted group in America .
Listen up , federal government !
You 're neglecting small business — and most people think so .
According to the just - released study by the highly respected Pew Research Center , small business is the most trusted institution in America .
More than churches .
More than colleges .
More than technology companies .
And certainly more than labor unions or large corporations .
Republicans trust us .
Democrats trust us .
Independents trust us .
Small business is n't a partisan issue .
But we 're neglected .
When asked about which groups were getting too much or too little attention from the government , Americans felt small business was getting dealt the worst hand .
Hey , elected officials , listen up !
Small business is one of the few groups Americans want to get more government attention .
The Pew Center 's study got enormous media attention — but not about small business .
The media coverage focused on how little Americans trust their government .
But buried in the report was the fact that there is an institution almost all Americans still trust : small business .
So I picked up the phone and called the Pew Center .
I wanted to learn more .
The results were " striking , " according to Carroll Dougherty , Pew 's Associate Director .
" At a time when a lot of institutions are viewed negatively , small business is viewed very positively .
What 's really interesting is that large corporations are viewed almost as negatively as Wall Street .
The contrast between large corporations and small business is enormous . "
" So much of this survey is partisan , " Dougherty continued .
" In this case , it 's bipartisan .
It crosses party lines . " 72 % of Republicans , 70 % of Democrats and 73 % of independents say small businesses have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country .
Let 's look at the numbers of how some groups are viewed as to whether they have a positive or negative effect on this country : PUBLIC'S NEGATIVE VIEWS OF INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC'S NEGATIVE VIEWS OF INSTITUTIONS
Effect on the way things are going in the country ( in percent ) Postive Negative Other / Don't know Small business 71 19 10 Technology companies 68 18 14 Churches & religious orgs 63 22 15 Colleges & universities 61 26 13 Obama administration 45 45 10 Entertainment industry 33 51 16 Labor unions 32 49 18 Federal agencies and depts 31 54 16 National news media 31 57 12 Large corporations 25 64 12 Federal government 25 65 9 Congress 24 65 12 Banks & financial inst 22 69 10 Pew Research Center March 11 - 21 .
Figures may not add to 100 % because of rounding The Pew Center also asked which groups get too much or too little attention from the federal government .
Here , small business even beat out the " middle class " as seen as being neglected by our government : WHO GETS TOO MUCH ATTENTION , TOO LITTLE FROM FED .
GOVT .?
WHO GETS TOO MUCH ATTENTION , TOO LITTLE FROM FED .
GOVT .?
In percentages Too much Right amount Too little Don't know Small business 8 20 69 3 Middle class 9 22 66 4 Poor people 17 22 56 5 Labor unions 34 30 26 11 Business leaders 45 26 20 9 Wall Street 50 25 16 9 Pew Research Center March 11 - 21 .
Figures may not add to 100 % because of rounding
Once again , this was n't a partisan issue .
73 % of Republicans , 67 % of Democrats and 68 % of independents say small businesses get less attention than they should from the federal government .
These favorable attitudes toward small business explain why politicians — of every party — shout their affection for small business when they 're running for office .
( Remember " Joe the Plumber " ? )
But once they 're in office , these same politicians — of every party — neglect us .
Why is that ?
Because while Americans trust us , we do n't have much political power .
Not nearly as much as huge corporations , banks , labor unions or lobbyists .
But while we may not have power to change our government , we do have power to change our world .
Because we create most of the new jobs ( 65 percent of all new jobs are created by small companies ) .
We have the power to innovate .
And we have the power to create good working environments for our employees .
So the next time you 're with a group of people who own small business — or heck , you even look in the mirror — take pride !
You 're part of the group your fellow Americans trust most .

It was one of those moments you never forget .
" Gordon 's gone , " my wife said as I walked in the front door .
" He 's resigned . "
From the television somewhere behind her , the familiar Scottish brogue echoed through the house .
" I have led this country for almost 13 years , " he said .
" Ten of them as chancellor , and three as prime minister .
When I won the last election , I made up my mind to retire sooner rather than later .
My work is done ; it is time to hand over the baton . "
On the evening that Gordon Brown decided to call the 2007 snap election , we now know , he told his closest aides that if he won he would serve only two more years .
He had no intention of going down in history , he said wryly , as " another Tony Blair " .
He would set a bold agenda for the 2010s , then step gracefully aside .
Few doubted that Brown would win ; the only question was the size of his majority .
Even so , most observers were amazed when , celebrating a 21 - seat victory , this most tribal of Labour politicians announced that he had invited the Liberal Democrat leader , Menzies Campbell , to join a centre - left coalition .
" It is time , " Brown said , " to heal the progressive divide . "
What followed was six months of stunning political drama .
As the banks tottered and the world economy tumbled into recession , Brown and Campbell set out a breathtaking agenda of modernisation .
At the Treasury , Alistair Darling and his chief secretary , Vince Cable , devised
a rigorous new regulatory regime , while Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg worked out a programme of constitutional reform , cleaning up MPs ' expenses and introducing limited PR .
There was even a place for Lembit Öpik as minister for fun , though his idea of fun never seemed quite the same as anybody else's .
Meanwhile , the Labour left and the Tories were in uproar .
A dozen Labour MPs resigned the party whip in protest at Brown 's coalition , although , the cushion of Lib Dem numbers meant they were barely noticed .
As for the Tories , Cameron learned the hard way what his predecessors had known : there is no party in the western world so quick to punish failure .
Back he went into obscurity ; back came William Hague as leader of a more aggressively Thatcherite , Eurosceptic party than ever .
In stepping down so smoothly , Brown showed the same vision and decisiveness that compelled him to seek a national mandate in 2007 .
We can only hope our new Prime Minister has the same qualities .
Over to you , Ms Harman . . .
Legal Action Could Delay New Arizona Immigration Law Opponents move to block the bill as the country and state remain divided .
April 30 , 2010  --
The Arizona Legislature has wrapped up its session , paving the way for its tough new immigration law to take effect in 90 days , but with some changes amid a firestorm of criticism over the measure .
.
In their final hours in session , state legislators made some last - minute revisions to the law , restricting police from questioning someone strictly based on their race or ethnicity .
But lawmakers also ruled that civil complaints , such as an unmowed lawn , could trigger questioning about immigration status .
A growing number of lawsuits are being filed in opposition to the law .
Opponents of the controversial new Arizona immigration law have already filed legal action to block it .
A lawsuit by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders seeks an injunction preventing authorities from enforcing of the law .
The group says the law violates federal due process rights because it stipulates a suspect can be held before being convicted .
Additionally , another group has filed papers for a referendum drive that potentially could delay the passage of the bill .
The group has until late July or early August , the same time the law is scheduled to go into effect , to find the 76,000 signatures that would delay the law until a vote could be held , possibly not until 2012 .
Meanwhile , people in Arizona , like the rest of the country , are bitterly divided .
Arizona Sheriff 's Deputy Keith
Henry sees the problem the law intends to combat every day .
" Yeah there are a lot of illegals out here , " he said .
He and the more than 3,000 members of the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Department are on the front lines in the battle against illegal immigration and say human smuggling is a huge problem in the area .
For more on this story , tune in to " World News with Diane Sawyer " at 6:30 p.m. ET .
In Phoenix Wednesday , police rounded up 70 suspected illegal immigrants , all allegedly staying at a drop house .
Maricopa County is known for its tough crackdowns on illegal immigration and for its tough - talking sheriff , Joe Arpaio , who is currently under investigation by the Justice Department for racial profiling over arrests of illegal immigrant suspects .
Arpaio supports the new law .
" The minute you cross the border , you are a criminal .
You have violated the law .
So for years and years , that law has been ignored , " Arpaio said .
" So now we have the state law . "
Arpaio said he will enforce the new law , as he does all others .
But Clarence Dupnik , the sheriff in neighboring Pima County , said it goes too far .
" What they 've done with the law is if any citizen thinks that you 're not enforcing the law , they can sue you , " Dupnik said .
" And we already are in a position to get sued and they already have sued sheriffs in other parts of this state for profiling .
So we 're damned if we do and we 're damned if we do n't .
...
The law , as I have said , is unwise .
It 's stupid and it 's racist .
...
From my point of view , it 's a national embarrassment . "
Nationwide Controversy
Passions are running hot on both sides of the debate , with protesters planning rallies in 70 cities this weekend .
Protesters even greeted baseball 's Arizona Diamondbacks at Wrigley Field in Chicago this week , where the Diamondbacks played the Cubs .
Nevertheless , some states are considering following Arizona 's lead .
" I think not only should we possibly mirror some of the laws in Arizona , " said Rep. Mike Christian , R - Okla . , " but I think we should go a little further . "
Some Texas lawmakers are also interested in similar legislation .
The argument even is splitting opinions among Republicans .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sides with Arizona 's governor , Jan Brewer , who signed Arizona 's new law .
She told Fox News , " Jan Brewer did what she had to wake them up and get them to start doing their job . "
But former Bush advisor Karl Rove sees it differently .
" I wished they had n't passed it , in a way , " Rove said .
" I think there are going to be some constitutional problems with the bill . "
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is against the bill , as well .
" I think it creates unintended consequences , " he said .
" It 's difficult for me to imagine how you 're going to enforce this law .
It places a significant burden on local law enforcement , and you have civil liberties issues that are significant as well . "
Deputy
Henry still is learning about the law he 'll have to enforce in the weeks ahead .
But this week , 150 members of his department are engaging in a controversial practice called " Crime Suppression , " descending on communities suspected of harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
Deputies have arrested 93 people so far ; 63 of them , police believe , are illegal immigrants being smuggled into Arizona .
They were all crammed into four vehicles near the Mexican border
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Burma 's military government has annulled the last election held in the country , which was won in a landslide by the party of Aung San Suu Kyi .
Burma 's last elections were won in a landslide by the National League for Democracy party led by Aung San Suu Kyi .
Ms Suu Kyi won about 80 per cent of the vote but was immediately placed under house arrest , where she has remained for much of the past 20 years .
Burma is due to hold its first election since then later this year .
The military government has this week been releasing the rules for the poll , which include a clause that Ms Suu Kyi's party must expel her if they want to participate in the vote .
International observers are dismayed by the move , which will add to fears that the election will be a sham .

Michael Schumacher has warned not to expect his Mercedes team to be fighting for victory at the start of the European season , despite the upgrades to be introduced in Spain .
The seven - time champion , however , reckons there is plenty of potential in his team and is pleased with the way Mercedes has been working to move forward since the start of the season .
" I see a lot of potential here especially as our team has been reacting very well over the past four races , " said Schumacher in a team preview ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix .
" We have worked on general improvements to the car , as well as specific developments in downforce and efficiency , and I am confident that we have room to make further progress in the future .
" Our step forward in Barcelona will be bigger than you can make at each race during the flyaways but it would not be realistic to expect us to suddenly be competing right at the front . "
The German , who has been so far overshadowed by team - mate Nico Rosberg , is hopeful he will be able to enjoy a better race in Barcelona next week .
" I am hoping for a better race in Barcelona than I had in China and of course I would not mind having had better results so far , " he said .
" However the good news is that after three years away , I am feeling extremely motivated .
So I am clearly ready to take this challenge . "

It ’s known that the European Parliament voted against the ACTA and it ’s only natural considering the countless downsides there is to implement it in the country .
Not only does it change the way several industries run , but it also disrupts the peace on the internet , which we know is the fastest - growing industry around the world .
This is precisely why we at Publicacta proposes ideas and information that may help citizens of New Zealand , to protest against the dangerous Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
To give you a better understanding of how ACTA can change many industries , including the online gambling sector , take a look at the negotiation terms that prove to be worrisome .
It was not done democratically
Before we get into the actual negotiation terms , it ’s important that you understand the process in which this idea was proposed to the members of the European Parliament .
Even with much effort into tracing back to the origins of the proposal , it was not found who or what organization started this idea .
This is thus , not done in a democratic manner .
It refers to counterfeiting as if it ’s piracy
Counterfeit is used to describe fake goods , while piracy refers to the act of reproducing products or services without the permission of the owner .
Regardless , one will have a punishment , while another will have different consequences .
The negotiations from the implementation of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement makes it look as though counterfeiting is the same as piracy .
It can easily prosecute innocent bystanders
There are many internet users that are making their living online .
They are capable of doing so by making use of the properties of others .
While it may sound dirty , it ’s not exactly a crime since the original owner may have been aware that their property can be used freely .
However , in the case of ACTA , that does n’t matter and anyone who uses the property of anyone ( this is especially true for YouTubers ) , can be prosecuted .
It will take away the ability of groups to make their own policies
As we already know , platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , and more allow for fair use and users can make use of the works of others .
With ACTA , the terms clearly state that the whole nation will go along with their own rules .
There are many downsides of ACTA .
Their negotiation terms will clearly disrupt the peace on the internet , both for the uses and commercial groups .
Google buys mobile visual search startup as part of aim to acquire at least one company a month
Google has made its first ever UK acquisition , buying mobile visual search startup Plink for an undisclosed sum .
The acquisition follows chief executive Eric Schmidt 's statement that Google is aiming to acquire at least one company each month – as well as recruit more staff – as it expands the company post - recession .
Founded by PhD students Mark Cummins and James Philbin , Plink 's first product was PlinkArt , a visual recognition app for mobile that analyses pictures of well - known artworks and paintings and identifies them .
Users can then share the photo with friends and also click through to buy a poster version .
The developers claim the app was downloaded more than 50,000 times in the six weeks following launch , and Plink have also held discussions with galleries including the Tate over potential partnerships .
The two founders will work on Google Goggles , the search giant 's visual search project .
Cummins and Philbin founded Plink nearly two year ago while PhD students at the University of Oxford 's mobile robotics and visual geometry groups in the department of engineering .
The app was brought to Google 's attention during the Android Develop Challenge in December last year , an initiative to promote innovative new applications for Google 's mobile platform , when the pair won $ 100,000 – Plink 's sole funding to date .
" It 's time to be much more optimistic about the European tech startup scene , " said Anil Hansjee , Google 's head of corporate development for Europe , the Middle East and Africa .
" There is a lot of innovation here and now the tech eco-system across academia , corporates , startups , venture capital , and government is responding and supporting this effort . "
Hansjee said despite being an early stage company , Plink had " taken advantage of many of the ecosystem 's offerings " to establish itself .
The acqusition took just three months and will mean that both engineers move to the Google Gears project base in Santa Monica , California .
The pair were unable to say how much product development would continue for PlinkArt , including an iPhone app , saying that all their new features and development work would be appearing in new Google products .
James Philbin explained how Plink 's technology works : " It picks out repeatable elements from the image you take and comes out with a statistical representation of them . "
That process works even at different angles and different lighting conditions .
" We found our way into art almost by accident , because we were really interested in visual search .
But art is compelling space because it is so empty .
There is n't even a definitive site for art , " said Philbin .
Plink used AllPoster.com 's affiliate programme to populate the visual information in their database , alongside Wikipedia content for information on artists .
Cummins said the app has great potential for museum goers and for guided tours .
" You can start doing some really interesting things when you have recommendation data , like personalised tours based on your favourite paintings .
Museums are very interested in social sharing and Facebook . "
Cummins said the two had the classic startup dilemma of deciding whether to accept Google 's offer – or to acknowledge that endorsement of the product and keep developing independently .
But they opted instead to accept Google 's offer and become the first UK startup to be bought by the technology giant .
" It feels good , yeah , " said Philbin .
" I 'm not complaining . "

PARIS — President Nicolas Sarkozy of France told his cabinet on Wednesday that he would put forward a bill in May to ban the wearing of the full veil in public places in France , despite a warning from senior legal authorities that the bill may be unconstitutional .
Mr. Sarkozy wants a bill that goes farther than initial proposals , including a ban on wearing the full veil — the niqab , which leaves only the eyes uncovered , and the burqa , which is almost unknown in France — from streets , markets and shops , according to his spokesman , Luc Chatel .
The full veil “ hurts the dignity of women and is unacceptable in French society , ” Mr. Chatel quoted Mr. Sarkozy as telling the cabinet .
The idea of a ban is popular with the French and with his own political party , while Mr. Sarkozy ’s own standing in the opinion polls has rarely been lower .
An earlier proposal from a panel of the National Assembly suggested a bill banning the full veil in public places belonging to the state , like schools and public buildings , and in areas where facial recognition is vital for security reasons : airports , banks and even public transport .
Guys , we all owe Robert Maxwell many internet high - fives .
Not only did he produce that awesome flyby of the Emperor 's ship ... he went on this week to produce this wickedly cool turnaround of the
Drive - Machito from Robert Maxwell on Vimeo .
I love how he intuited that , while the ring pinches surrounding space , it 's the side nacelles that actually act as propulsion : I 'm not sure I had ever explicitly said that !
So extra high - fives for Robert .
I 'm already gonna send him a special drawing of the Drive cast ... but please , let 's all encourage him in the comments below to tackle one of the Continuum ships !
I 'd love to see how he renders their more dolphin - esque profile , would n't you ?
Robert , if you 're ever able to mock up the Continuum ships
Enlarge By Denny Gainer , USA TODAY TARP , run by the Treasury Department , spent $ 247 billion in part to revive the credit market .
LOANS FALL DESPITE AID LOANS FALL DESPITE AID BANK PERFORMANCE BANK PERFORMANCE
American University 's Investigative Reporting Workshop website shows the performance of every bank .
Click here .
Banks that received federal assistance during the financial crisis reduced lending more aggressively and gave bigger pay raises to employees than institutions that did n't get aid , a USA TODAY / American University review found .
The reduction of credit during the worst of the recession raises questions about whether the $ 247 billion assistance program achieved one of its primary goals : to stimulate the economy by reviving the flow of credit to businesses and individuals .
BANKS : Different course for those without federal help ON THE WEB : American University Investigative Reporting Workshop USA TODAY and the American University Investigative Reporting Workshop used federal bank data to conduct the first comprehensive analysis comparing the behavior of 940 banks in the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) and 7,400 banks outside it .
Key findings about TARP 's first year : • Lending fell .
The amount of loans outstanding to businesses and individuals fell 9.1 % for the 12 months ending Sept. 30 , 2009 , at banks that participated in TARP compared with a 6.2 % drop at banks that did n't .
• Employee pay rose .
Average pay at banks getting aid rose 9.4 % in the program 's first year .
By contrast , non-TARP banks increased salaries 1.8 % . • Cost - cutting limited .
Banks in TARP cut costs less than those outside the program .
Government - aided banks increased branches by 2.7 % while non-TARP banks cut branches by 1.2 % .
The differences narrowed in the last three months of 2009 as many banks repaid the government .
President Bush signed TARP into law on Oct. 3 , 2008 , at the peak of the financial crisis .
The program sought to stabilize the financial system and restore the flow of credit .
Banks have repaid about $ 181 billion , including interest and dividends .
Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , says the analysis shows that TARP " has been highly ineffective . "
The Treasury Department , which runs TARP , says the program succeeded .
Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly says " overall lending is improving as a result of the government 's actions . "

A lot has been made of the impact the oil sands are having on wildlife in or passing through the area .
But not a lot has been made of the bigger picture .
A Bit of History
April 2008 sucked .
It sucked for birds .
It sucked for workers .
It sucked for the industry .
It sucked .
It sucked a lot .
In 2008 over 1,600 birds died in a Syncrude tailings pond .
The company is currently in court facing “ charges under Section 5.1 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Section 155 under the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. ” [ source ]
If you are interested , Syncrude has a dedicated Waterfowl Trial page with audio clips covering their lawyer ’s responses to media outside the courtroom .
Needless to say , this regrettable incident has garnered a lot of negative press for Syncrude , the industry and the region .
There are over 1,000,000 hits on Google while searching for “ oilsand ducks “ … the first one is a CTV article titled “ Canada ’s image hurt by oilsands duck deaths : PM – CTV News “ .
This is a very graphic , very concentrated and very “ unusual ” event – in fact , it makes for a good , news story ( note : * not* a good news , story ) .
It ’s interesting , it grabs the attention of the reader / viewer and people can picture it in their minds .
The world has read , viewed and discussed the incident … and the scuttlebutt has not been kind .
Aside from the bird deaths , a report was recently unearthed in regards to oil sands - related wildlife deaths between 2000 and 2008 :
“ Documents obtained by Greenpeace , under freedom of information legislation , show that at least 164 other animals died during oil sands operations between 2000 and 2008 .
Those animals included 27 bears , 67 deer , 31 foxes and 21 coyotes . ” [ CTV.ca ]
Again , this is not looking good .
No one likes to hear about animals suffering due to the industry ’s impact on the environment ( no matter if they died due to the actual operations on site , or other causes , which took place on site ) .
Which is why all of the negative press around the oil sands and wildlife makes me angry – because there have been little , if any , posts , articles or feeds that bother trying to bring a balanced point of view to the topic .
Why This Post
The Toronto Star published a small piece yesterday entitled “ Oil industry is n’t heartless toward wildlife ” – in fact , it started me musing about this post … because when we look at how other industries or practices impact wildlife , the numbers in the oil sands are n’t looking so horrific .
Specifically , let ’s quickly look at two other areas : Buildings & Vehicles
What About A Clear Picture ( Window ) ?
A large source of wildlife deaths are the buildings we live and work in .
For instance , there is one particular complex in Scarborough , the office buildings at 100 - 300 Consilium Place , that is considered a “ death trap ” for birds .
The Toronto Star reported on March 9 , 2010 , that :
“ In 2008 - 2009 , more than 800 birds were recovered from the lawns around the complex , ironic considering it was awarded a “ Go Green certificate of achievement ” for its environmental practices by the Building Owners and Managers Association of Toronto .
Go Green certificates are most commonly awarded for energy efficiency .
Over the past decade , more than 7,000 birds of 82 species have met painful deaths after flying into what bird safety advocate Michael Mesure calls ‘ the most reflective glass windows of any building in the city . ' ”
So let ’s look at that again : over 7,000 birds have died .
From just 3 buildings .
3 buildings , 10 years , 82 species , 7,000 birds .
Where is the international outrage ?
Where are the calls from Europe demanding environmental justice ?
Where are the protesters repelling down the sides of the buildings unfurling banners ?
This is but one example of how buildings are impacting our friends in the sky .
Just imagine how many similar buildings dominate the skylines of Canada ’s major cities … how many birds have met the same fate across our country ?
Across the contient ?
Across the developed world ?
An Object in Motion … .
Let ’s take a look to see how the vehicles we drive impact wildlife .
I ’m not going to get into any environmental impacts , or migration impacts etc .
I ’m only going to look at what happens when an object in motion tends to stay in motion .
Let ’s look at vehicle / animal collisions .
First up is Ontario , and how many animals are reported to be involved in vehicle collisions .
“ In 2007 , 13,954 collisions were reported .
Many more go unreported . ”
And those are just the reported numbers .
13,954 collisions .
That works out to an average of one collision every 38 minutes on the roads of Ontario . [ source ]
According to statistics from the Government of Alberta ’s Transportation Ministry , about 11 % of all reported traffic collisions in 2005 involved wildlife .
In 2008 , the Transportation Ministry reported that there were over 158,000 reported collisions .
If the 11 % trend holds true , then that suggests close to 17,000 animals were involved .
Now , staying within my home province of Alberta , 17,000 animals were involved in reported traffic collisions in 2008 .
Compare that to the 1,764 animals that were killed due to oil sands operations over a span of 9 years ( 2000 to 2008 ) .
17,000 animals over one year vs. 1,764 animals over 9 years .
Think about that .
Just Two Examples
I ’m just pointing out two examples here .
I would encourage any reader who is interested in our impact on wildlife to look into the numbers for other industries like air travel , agriculture , alternative energy … and that ’s just the A’s , I have n’t gone through the rest of the alphabet .
Do some research , I am sure you will be surprised at the numbers behind other industries or practices .
It ’s just too bad that the message about the oil sands has n’t included a more complete picture .
Health - care reform's ' back - door ' tax
President Obama leads the recent bipartisan meeting to discuss health reform legislation .
WASHINGTON ( Fortune ) --
The big talk on Capitol Hill may be about health - care reform , but as part of this massive undertaking , the Democrats are quietly reshaping the tax system too .
Tucked inside President Obama 's latest health - care proposal is a major change to the Medicare tax .
Since its conception , the Medicare tax has always been tied to payrolls .
Every paycheck , employers and employees each chip in 1.45 % , regardless of how much someone makes .
Under Obama 's proposal -- which should be very close to what Congress winds up enacting -- a Medicare tax would now be applied to investment income too : Individuals who earn more than $ 200,000 and couples over $ 250,000 would pay an additional 2.9 % surtax on unearned income from interest , dividends , annuities , royalties and rents .
Two things happen here .
The first one is that the Medicare tax would go from being a payroll tax ( like Social Security ) to an income tax .
" You can certainly make the argument that [ payroll is ] really not appropriate anymore and we may as well tax all income , " says Howard Gleckman , a senior research associate at the Urban Institute and editor TaxVox , the center 's tax and budget policy blog .
" But this is kind of a back - door way to do it . "
The Democrats found their way to this " back door " because they could n't agree on how to pay for the health - care bill : House Dems do n't like the Senate 's proposal to tax so - called Cadillac plans , and Senate Democrats do n't like the House bill 's inclusion of an income tax on the wealthy to pay for health care .
That paves the way for the second change .
The Medicare tax has long been set at a flat rate -- the idea being that everyone pays into the system at the same rate and then receives the same amount of medical benefits later in life .
But by giving the Medicare tax the qualities of an income tax , Democrats can raise taxes on high - earners without explicitly calling it an income tax hike .
The proposal also targets this group by adding 0.9 % to their payroll portion of the Medicare tax too .
Adding a tax just for households making over $ 250,000 would make the tax progressive for the first time .
The Obama administration says taxing the wealthy on unearned income is only fair because anyone who lives off their dividends and interest should have that money treated as wages too .
Gleckman points out that because the tax is being changed indirectly via health - care reform , the policy design is a bit unorthodox .
" Usually we have tax brackets rather than this cliff , where suddenly if you make a dollar more you 're subject to this additional tax , " he says .
But there are ways around it : Taxpayers who want to avoid getting bumped up to the higher rate could easily wait a little longer to sell their stock after the new - year cutoff .
The Center for Tax Justice points out the changes would only affect 2.3 % of taxpayers in 2014 .
And the tax would not apply to income earned through tax - deferred retirement accounts .
Still , those higher - income taxpayers would foot a significant chunk of the bill 's revenue streams .
The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Obama 's proposal to raise the Medicare payroll tax and expand the tax to unearned income would bring in $ 183.6 billion in revenues from 2010 to 2019 .
That 's 44 % of estimated total revenues needed to pay for health care , making it the biggest portion of all the proposed changes .
There is confusion over whether the Medicare tax on unearned income would apply to capital gains too .
In Obama 's proposal , the only forms of unearned income listed are interest , dividends , annuities , royalties and rents .
But the plan does make it clear that unearned income , not just wage income , is now fair game .
If capital gains income is indeed included , the wealthy would effectively be facing a cap gains tax rate of 22.9 % .
( The rate is already due to go from 15 % to 20 % next year )
As of this writing , the White House had not responded to a request for comment .
The Democrats have to figure out some way to pay for health care to pass their bill , and this " back - door " tax could be their best hope at a workable compromise .
But as they consider how to reshape the country 's medical system , watch out for how they 're changing the tax system too .
If Obama 's proposal goes through , other taxes could start popping up in some new , unexpected places .

Here ’s my fun fact for the day , provided courtesy of Robert Litan , who directs research at the Kauffman Foundation , which specializes in promoting innovation in America : “ Between 1980 and 2005 , virtually all net new jobs created in the U.S. were created by firms that were 5 years old or less , ” said Litan .
“ That is about 40 million jobs .
That means the established firms created no new net jobs during that period . ”
Message :
If we want to bring down unemployment in a sustainable way , neither rescuing General Motors nor funding more road construction will do it .
We need to create a big bushel of new companies  fast .
We ’ve got to get more Americans working again for their own dignity  and to generate the rising incomes and wealth we need to pay for existing entitlements , as well as all the new investments we ’ll need to make .
It was just reported that Social Security this year will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes  a red line we were not expected to cross until at least 2016 .
But you cannot say this often enough : Good - paying jobs do n’t come from bailouts .
They come from start - ups .
And where do start - ups come from ?
They come from smart , creative , inspired risk - takers .
How do we get more of those ?
There are only two ways : grow more by improving our schools or import more by recruiting talented immigrants .
Surely , we need to do both , and we need to start by breaking the deadlock in Congress over immigration , so we can develop a much more strategic approach to attracting more of the world ’s creative risk - takers .
“ Roughly 25 percent of successful high - tech start - ups over the last decade were founded or co-founded by immigrants , ” said Litan .
Think Sergey Brin , the Russian - born co-founder of Google , or Vinod Khosla , the India - born co-founder of Sun Microsystems .
SEEN from afar , Europe looks like a “ gerontocracy ” , an American newspaper reported in 1963 .
Europeans were young in years and outlook ( their median age was just 32 ) .
But their leaders included the 87 - year - old Konrad Adenauer in Germany ; septuagenarian despots in Spain and Portugal ; Charles de Gaulle in France ( then 72 , and destined to hang on to the presidency for six more years ) ; and the baby of the bunch , Britain 's 68 - year - old Harold Macmillan , who was soon to quit as prime minister .
Today Europe again faces rule by the elderly .
Not because its leaders are all ancient : modern politicians tend to flaunt pregnant wives and school - age children , and disport themselves in cycling shorts and running kit .
Now it is the voters who have aged .
By 2050 , more than a third of potential European Union voters will be over 65 .
And because older voters turn out more reliably than the young , they could wield crushing power .
That alarms those worried about Europe 's pension and welfare systems .
David Willetts , a British Tory , has caused a stir with “ The Pinch ” , a book accusing baby - boomers ( a huge cohort born between 1945 and 1965 ) of stealing their children 's future .
Boomers own more than half of Britain 's £ 6 trillion ( $ 9 trillion ) of personal wealth , he claims .
The causes include a house - price boom and generous company pension schemes that are closed to younger workers .
Mr Willetts ( born in 1956 ) fears that an army of retired boomers may vote for whopping sums to be spent on health care and pensions , against the wishes of younger taxpayers who might prefer spending on things like education .
Such fears are inspiring bold thinking .
Arji Lans Bovenberg at Tilburg University in the Netherlands ( born in 1958 ) wonders if parents should be given an extra vote at elections for each young child in their charge .
An economist at Vienna University , Dennis Mueller ( born in 1940 ) notes that the old have to take driving tests to keep their licences .
What about citizenship tests before they are allowed to vote , similar to the civic quizzes faced by many immigrants ?
Some political parties , including Labour in Britain , have suggested that the legal voting age should fall to 16 .
Such solutions tend to have drawbacks .
They discriminate against those who cannot have children .
Or they insult older voters who have served their countries for decades .
In 2008 Austria became the first European country to allow 16 - year - olds to vote in national elections .
A lot of them promptly voted for far - right parties , which got more support from the young than from the old .
It is easy to be gloomy about the idea of a gerontocracy seizing power in the European Union , a place already struggling to stay competitive .
Eurobarometer opinion polls , which survey 1,000 citizens in each of the 27 EU members , offer rich seams of evidence that political and economic preferences vary with age .
For instance , older voters are less satisfied with their lives and more pessimistic about the economic future .
Older Europeans are more likely to say that the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 made life in their country “ more insecure ” , a pattern that holds true in both eastern and western Europe .
Overall , Europeans are less entrepreneurial and less mobile than Americans .
The averages conceal age differences .
A 2007 Eurobarometer found 61 % of Americans would rather be self - employed .
Europeans under 24 came close to American levels of enthusiasm for the risky freedom of the entrepreneur .
But older Europeans preferred having a regular salary , thank you .
And yet a fixation on age risks missing a more serious problem facing Europe .
It is true that Eurobarometer surveys show opinions varying with age .
But such differences are trumped by those based on nationality .
Take enthusiasm for self - employment .
Older Europeans are less keen than the young on going it alone , but not by much .
Yet at Europe 's extremes the gaps are huge : 57 % of Portuguese fancy being self - employed , but only 30 % of Belgians .
( The survey found Belgians especially keen on fixed working hours , a finding that rings true for anyone needing a Brussels plumber at the weekend . )
Golden oldies
A recent Eurobarometer asked if governments should make it easier for older people to keep working after their retirement age , if they wished .
It found small differences by age , but astonishing gulfs by nationality .
Almost nine out of ten respondents in Britain , Denmark , Finland and the Netherlands said oldies should be helped to work if they wanted .
At the other extreme , 55 % of Greeks were opposed .
That may be because Greeks lead the EU in believing the lump - of - labour fallacy : a huge majority agree that , as older people work longer , “ fewer jobs will be available for younger people ” .
The fallacy that working oldies would automatically steal jobs from the young is also popular in Cyprus , Hungary , Portugal and Italy , even though those countries face very different rates of ageing .
In other words , national political cultures matter more than age .
Spain 's government appears scared even to debate a higher pension age .
Others are braver .
In Nordic countries legal retirement ages are increasingly pegged to life expectancy .
Earlier this month a Dutch trade union boss , Peter Gortzak , suggested that workers should be promised a fixed length of retirement , say 20 years , with their retirement dates calculated backwards from average life expectancy in their sector ( ie , those in tougher trades could retire younger ) .
Gerontocratic rule certainly poses long - term dangers .
But Europe must above all avoid being pulled apart , as some countries tackle ageing better than others .
Old age is not the enemy of reform : ignorance , selfishness and timidity are .
The old have no monopoly on these vices and may have picked up some wisdom .
In the coming decades , Europe will need much of that .

Time for the SEC to take a look at what bets Goldman 's prop desk , and material affiliates as well as hedge funds that are close to Goldman 's flow traders , were taking on Goldman 's stock over the past few days .
If indeed Goldman shorted itself , bought SPY puts , bought octuple leveraged negative financial ETFs , or something else of the sort , on material non-public information , it would be time to shut the firm down .

Christian news organization CNSNews.com has the skinny on a speech from Douglas Shulman at the National Press Club on a new globalized effort to go after the networks of the rich .
“ Through our new global high wealth operating unit we are taking a unified look at the entire web of business and economic entities controlled by high wealth individuals so we can better assess the risk such arrangements pose to tax compliance , ” Shulman said at the National Press Club on Monday .
Shulman said the IRS is using “ our robust and evolving enforcement program that ensures that everyone pays what they owe . ”
This is the part that will really raise people 's hackles , perhaps even among the non-rich :
“ This brings me to another important development - - a game - changing trend -- the globalization of tax administration , ” said Shulman .

version runs at 60 frames / sec .
The raytraced version : 3 sec / frame ;‑)

Features
The renderer allows switching between rasterizing and raytracing in real - time - so one navigates quickly with the rasterizers , and requests a raytracing when the viewpoint is interesting .
This is a ( more or less ) clean implementation of the basic algorithms in polygon - based 3D graphics .
The code includes ...
3D transformations ( from world coordinates , to camera - space / light - space coordinates )
Point rendering ( vertex - based or triangle - based )
Anti-aliased lines rendering
Gouraud shading ( complete Phong equation calculated per vertex )
Phong shading ( complete Phong equation calculated per pixel )
Z -Buffer hidden surface removal
Shadow mapping
Soft shadow mapping
Raytracing , with shadows , reflections , refractions , ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing
Portable display and keyboard handling through libSDL
The supported 3D formats are :
.3ds , i.e. the well known 3D Studio format ( via lib3ds )
, i.e. the well known 3D Studio format ( via lib3ds ) . tri , a simple binary dump of vertex and triangle data
, a simple binary dump of vertex and triangle data .ply ( only the ASCII kind , as saved from MeshLab and shadevis )
Implementation wise , the code ...
Is orchestrated via autoconf / automake , so it will compile and run cleanly on most platforms ( tested so far on Linux / x86 , Mac OS/X , Windows ( using TDM / MinGW gcc ) , OpenSolaris ( GCC / TBB ) , OpenBSD / amd64 and FreeBSD /amd64 )
Includes a separate VisualC directory for Windows / MSVC users , with all dependencies pre-packaged for easy compilation
directory for Windows / MSVC users , with all dependencies pre-packaged for easy compilation Can be configured to use OpenMP , provided that your compiler 's support for OpenMP is mature enough ( e.g. GCC since version 4.3.2 )
Can be configured to use Intel Threading Building Blocks , thus taking advantage of multi-core CPUs and executing faster
Uses C++ template - based metaprogramming , in order to move as much rendering logic as possible from run-time to compile - time .
Speed - wise ...
This is a software - only renderer , so do n't expect hardware class ( OpenGL ) speeds .
Then again , speed is a relative thing : the train object ( available inside the source package , in the " 3D - Objects " folder ) was rendered ( in soft - shadows mode ) at a meager 6 fps on an Athlon XP , back in 2003 .
Around 2005 , however , a Pentium4 desktop at work took this up to 11 fps .
As of 2007 , by way of Intel 's Threading Building Blocks ( or OpenMP ) the code uses both cores of a Core2 Duo to run at 23 f ps ...
And since it uses TBB / OpenMP , it will automatically make use of any additional cores ... so give the CPUs a few more years ... :‑)
Update , November 2009 : On a 4 - core AMD Phenom at 3.2GHz , the train now spins at 80 frames per second ...
Give me more cores ! :‑)
Update , September 2017 : On a 16 - core Intel Core i9 7960X ... 718 frames per second !
Update , June 2018 : Phoronix shows the evolution of my renderer 's speed across 28 CPUs ...
The code also runs 20 - 25 % faster if compiled under 64 - bit environments .

Shadow mapping and soft shadows
Skipping points rendering , lets begin with an anti-aliased rendering of a train : Moving on to more interesting rendering modes : the same train looks far better with shadow mapping , which allows rendering self - shadowing objects in real - time , even when using multiple light sources ( 35 frames per second on a Core2 Duo ) :
In many such 3D models self - shadowing is easily identifiable , especially if we zoom in .
This nice chessboard exhibits it , too - running with shadow - mapping at 40 fps on a Core2 Duo :
The renderer also includes a SAH / AABB / BVH raytracer ( i.e. a raytracer that accelerates ray intersections using a Bounded Volume Hierarchy , formed from Axis- Aligned Bounding Boxes , created via a Surface Area Heuristic ) .
The results are of course , not real - time - but quality - wise , they are on a class of their own : here 's how the chessboard looks when raytraced with reflections and shadows ( 11 seconds to render this frame on the same machine ) : Raytracing is orders of magnitude slower than rasterizing , but it creates beautiful images ...
I recently ( Feb 2011 ) completed my first steps in speeding it up with CUDA ( check it out ) .
Notice also how zooming - in on a pawn shows reflections of reflections ...... and finally , this is how refractions create a glass dragon ( 31 seconds to render on a Core2 Duo ) :
Which brings us to the matter of speed , again :
The program allows changing the rendering mode at runtime , and therefore offers interactive control of the balance between rendering speed and rendering quality :
Shadow mapping offers a good balance between rendering quality and rendering speed .
Shadow maps are " special pictures " rendered along the normal rendering pipeline , but from the point of view of the light source .
They provide the " light - height " information that tells the rasterizer when the pixel drawn is in shadow and when not .
In case you were wondering , here is what a shadow map looks like ( 67 KB image ) .
Normally , shadow maps generate sharp , " pixelated " shadow edges , because of the sampling of the shadow map .
To improve this , instead of sampling only one " shadow pixel " , the renderer can also use a weighted average of its neighbours , and thus provide nice looking soft - shadows in real - time :
Self - shadowing at its finest ...
Self - shadowing at its finest ...
Fast though it is , shadow - mapping has an issue if you zoom - in : the artifacts of the shadowmap sampling become annoying ...
In " deep " zooms , the renderer can be switched ( at runtime ) to raytracing mode , to create the correct shadows :
The " raycasted shadows " mode that I implemented in late 2010 , was offering a compromise between the speed impact of a raytracer and the rendering artifacts of a rasterizer : it gave shadows the quality of a raytracer , but maintained some of the speed of a rasterizer , since everything else except the shadows was done via screen - space - linear interpolations : projected screen space coordinates , normal vectors used in Phong lighting , Z - Buffer handling , etc .
It was also ported to CUDA , and got a hefty speedup .
Two weeks later , I removed this mode in favour of a full raytracer - it was slower than the rasterizer modes anyway , and a full raytracer offers far better quality .
It still exists in the CUDA port , if you are interested .
Ambient Occlusion
The renderer uses ambient occlusion to significantly improve the rendering quality of indirectly lit areas .
For the rasterizers , it linearly interpolates ( per- pixel ) the ambient occlusion coefficient , which must be pre-calculated per vertex and stored in the model ( see below , " Creating more 3D objects on your own " ) .
For the raytracer , by uncommenting the #define AMBIENT_OCCLUSION , you will enable a stochastic ambient occlusion calculation for each raytraced pixel :
When a triangle is intersected by a primary ray , AMBIENT_SAMPLES rays will be spawned from the intersection point , and they will be used to calculate the ratio of ambient light at that point .
The difference is very clear :
With and without ambient occlusion With and without ambient occlusion
Download , compile and run
Warning about hyper - threading and many cores in general If your CPU uses hyper - threading and / or has * many * cores , performance as you increase threads may go down instead of going up .
You can control the number of threads used during rendering via the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable ; and you may well have to , to avoid your performance going down because of memory bandwidth saturation .
As an example from both sides of the spectrum , on an Atom 330 ( 2 real cores , each one appearing as two " virtual " ) , the " virtual " cores help a lot : running with four threads , the raytracer is 1.3 x faster than running with two .
But on an dual - CPU , Intel Xeon W5580 ( total of 8 real cores , appearing as 16 " virtual " ) , the speed increases almost linearly as we increase threads , until we reach 8 - and then the speed nose - dives , with the 16 thread version being 63 times slower (! ) .
So make sure you check the runtime performance of the renderer by exercising direct control over the number of threads ( via OMP_NUM_THREADS ) .
Here 's an ambient - occlusion raytracing of Sponza ( with 32 ambient rays cast per pixel ) : ... and another of a conference room :
The code is under the GPL , and lives in GitHub .
Here 's a tarball with the latest source code ( last update : 2.3 b , Dec 2017 ) .
Windows binaries are also available ( compiled with TDM / MinGW and Pthread - W32 , and compressed with 7 - zip ) .
For Windows / MSVC users :
Just open the project solution ( under VisualC / ) and compile for Release mode .
It is configured by default to use Intel TBB for multithreading , since Microsoft decided to omit OpenMP support from the free version of its compiler ( the Visual C++ Express Edition ) .
All dependencies ( include files and libraries for SDL and TBB ) are pre-packaged under VisualC / , so compilation is as easy as it can get .
When the binary is built , right - click on " Renderer - 2.x " in the Solution explorer , and select " Properties " .
Click on " Configuration Properties / Debugging " , and enter ..\..\3D- Objects\chessboard.tri inside the " Command Arguments " text box .
Click on OK , hit Ctrl - F5 , and you should be seeing the chessboard spinning .
Use the controls described below to fly around the object .
The default compilation options are set for maximum optimization , using SSE2 instructions .
If you have the commercial version of the compiler ( which supports OpenMP ) you can switch from TBB to OpenMP :
Configuration Properties - C/C++ - Language - OpenMP : Set To " Yes "
Configuration Properties - Preprocessor - Definitions : Change USE_TBB to USE_OPENMP
... and recompile .
For everybody else ( Linux , BSDs , Mac OS / X , etc )
Compilation follows the well known procedure ...

bash$ ./ configure bash $ make
The source package includes a copy of the sources for lib3ds 1.3.0 , and the build process will automatically build lib3ds first .
SSE , SSE2 and SSSE3 x86 SIMD optimizations will be detected by configure , but if you have a non-Intel CPU , pass your own CXXFLAGS flags , e.g .
bash$ CXXFLAGS= " - maltivec " ./ configure bash $ make
A note for Mac OS / X and FreeBSD developers :
The default FreeBSD and Mac OS / X environments ( XCode ) include an old version of GCC ( 4.2.x ) .
This version is known to have issues with OpenMP , so if you do use it , your only available option with multicore machines is Intel TBB ( which works fine ) .
You can , however , download the latest GCC from ports , if you use FreeBSD , or from High Performance Computing for Mac OS / X - they both offer the latest GCC series .
Results are much better this way : OpenMP works fine , and support for the SSE - based - mrecip option boosts the speed by more than 30 % .

Creating more 3D objects on your own
Use MeshLab to convert your 3D object to .
PLY .
Load it up in shadevis and hit ENTER to have shadevis calculate the ambient occlusion factors per vertex .
After that , hit ' D ' as many times as necessary to lower the diffuse light to 0 % , and hit 'a ' to pump up the ambient to 100 % .
Hit ' S ' to save the object .
Load the saved '..._vis.ply ' with my renderer .
.ply
The rasterizer output is looking much better if the model carries pre-calculated ambient occlusion information per vertex .
To do this :
You can now use Meshlab to perform the same work , from : " Filters / Color creation and processing / Ambient occlusion per vertex " .
Then save your object as ( Stanford polygon format ) and make sure you have only " Color " ( from the " Vert " group ) selected ( also , uncheck " Binary encoding " ) .
Enjoy !
The dark side ... of coding SMP
The dark side ... of coding SMP Rant 1 : Why did you do this , you crazy person ?
Well ...
I 've always loved coding real - time 3D graphics .
Experimenting with new algorithms , trying to make things run faster , look better ...
And as a side effect , I became a better coder :‑)
Anyway , these sources are my " reference " implementations .
At some point around 2003 , I decided that it was time to clean up the code that I 've been hacking on over the years and focus on code clarity - ignoring execution speed .
To that end , floating point is used almost everywhere ( fixed - point begone ! ) and this being Phong shading , the complete lighting equation is calculated per pixel .
I basically created a " clean " implementation of everything I have ever learned about polygon - related graphics .
The clarity of the code also paved the way for the OpenGL and CUDA versions ...
Rant 2 : Tales of Multicore
This code was single threaded until late 2007 .
At that point , I heard about OpenMP , and decided to try it out .
I was amazed at how easy it was to make the code " OpenMP - aware " : I simply added a couple of pragmas in the for - loops that drew the triangles and the shadow buffers , and ... presto !
The only things I had to change were static variables , which had to be moved to stack space .
Threading code can't tolerate global / static data , because race conditions immediately appeared when more than one thread worked on them .
Once I began using OpenMP , the
renderer crashed many C++ compilers .
As of 2009 , they have finally adapted !
Once I began using OpenMP , therenderer crashed many C++ compilers .
As of 2009 , they have finally adapted !
Only two compilers truly supported OpenMP at the time : Intel 's compiler ( version 8.1 ) and Microsoft's CL .
GCC unfortunately died with ' internal compiler error ' .
I reported this to the GCC forums , found out that I was not the only one who had noticed , and was told ( by the forum guys ) to wait .
While waiting for GCC to catch up , I kept researching multicore technologies .
Functional languages seem particularly adept to SMP , and I 've put them next in line in my R&D agenda ( Ocaml and F# in particular ) .
Before leaving C++ behind , though , I heard about Intel Threading Building Blocks ( TBB ) and decided to put them to the test .
TBB is a portable set of C++ templates that makes writing threading code a lot easier than legacy APIs ( CreateThread , _beginthread , pthread_create , etc ) .
TBB is also open - source , so it was easy to work with it and figure out its internals .
Truth be told , it also required more changes in my code ( OpenMP required almost none ) .
Still , it is a vast improvement compared to conventional threading APIs .
I must also confess that I have not invested a lot of effort in using these technologies ; I only enhanced two of my main rendering loops to make them SMP aware .
Still , this was enough to boost the speed ( on a Core2 Duo ) by 80 % !
Judging by the gain / effort ratio , this is one of the best bargains I 've ever found ...
As of now ( October 2008 ) , GCC 4.3.2 is up to speed and compiles OpenMP code just fine .
TBB is of course running perfectly ( since it is simply a C++ template library ) , so choose freely between any of the two , and easily achieve portable multithreading .
When I say portable , I mean it : these are the tests I did ...
OpenMP binaries ( ./ configure --enable-openmp -- disable - tbb ) for ...
Windows ( via TDM / MinGW GCC 4.3.2 )
Linux ( via GCC >= 4.3.2 in both 32 and 64bit )
Linux ( via Intel 's compiler in 32 bit )
FreeBSD 8.0 ( via latest GCC version , installed through ports , in 64bit )
Mac OS / X ( follow these instructions to get a GCC that supports important SSE optimizations ( - mrecip ) and has stable support for OpenMP - Xcode 's GCC 4.2.x is too old for OpenMP ) .
TBB binaries ( ./ configure --disable-openmp -- enable - tbb ) for ... Linux ( via GCC in both 32 and 64bit )
Linux ( via Intel 's compiler in 32 bit )
Mac OS /X ( even with Xcode 's old GCC 4.2.x )
FreeBSD 8.0/64bit
OpenSolaris ( tested with 2008.11 / GCC 3.4.3 ) Single - threaded binaries for ...
Poor OpenBSD4.3/64 : it does n't have real , SMP threads .
Not yet , at least :‑)
It only has user - space ones ( as Linux did at some point ) .
But it does compile the code , albeit in single - threaded mode .
Talk about portable code !
Dynamic scheduling makes sure all cores
are kept busy , even for low tesselations Dynamic scheduling makes sure all coresare kept busy , even for low tesselations
If you 're still in the ... dark ages and use legacy APIs ( CreateThread , _beginthread , pthread_create , etc ) you are really missing out : Under both OpenMP and Intel TBB , I increased the rendering frame rate of the train object by more than 40 % , by simply replacing ... # pragma omp parallel for with # pragma omp parallel for schedule ( dynamic,100 ) ( similar change for TBB , at code inside Scene.cc ) . with ( similar change for TBB , at code inside ) .
Why ?
Because these modern threading APIs allow us to easily adapt to different loads per thread , by using dynamic thread scheduling .

As some of you might have read in Mark Kretschmann ’s blog , we now have a fairly good phonon - vlc backend that already works better in many ways than other available backends .
It is still in alpha stage , but we would love to have testers give it a try .
The instructions below are for a Kubuntu or Debian system , I did the installation on the latest Kubuntu 10.04 beta checkout as of Saturday , April 4th .
I will give some additional commands for other distributions where those are needed .
DISCLAIMER : Please do not install this backend if you are not comfortable with alpha code and willing to test and report bugs .
We currently do not give support for it .
We also strongly suggest you test this with Amarok from git , since there were quite some changes applied to the Amarok code , too .
See also the KDE git tutorial for those not familiar with it .
UPDATES : I changed the VLC installation instructions to make sure you install the 1.1 version instead of the git master branch which is the development version .
UPDATE 2 : July 4th 2010 : The VLC information is updated to reflect that all distros now ship VLC 1.1 ( if they do n’t , talk to them , they really should , it is much better and fixes a lot of bugs .
UPDATE 3 : September 20th 2010 : Development is quite fast paced for both VLC and the VLC backend , so there have been some updates : VLC 1.1.4 is now a requirement and there is an addition to the Cmake command for the VLC backend , to make sure it uses a stable phonon version : erase CMakeCache.txt in the build folder and run Cmake again , with the modifications below .
UPDATE 4 : November 30th 2010 : Updated the git checkout for VLC .
UPDATE 5 : December 21st 2010 : Phonon has moved the source repository to git now .
Updated the git checkout for phonon-vlc .
UPDATE 6 : January 7th 2010 : You now need a newer Phonon build , updated the blog accordingly .
UPDATE 7 : February 5th 2011 : Please only use anongit to pull , see sections 2 and 3 .
I assume you have the environment variables set as suggested in part 3 of the above mentioned HowTo for Amarok from git .
We still need to add some more lines to make sure we get a proper debug output for the phonon -vlc backend :
Add the following lines to your $ HOME /. bashrc :
export PHONON_VLC_DEBUG=3
export PHONON_DEBUG=1
1. Install the VLC 1.1 stable branch
Most distributions currently ship VLC 1.1.4 , but for those who happen to run an earlier one it is still necessary to compile yourself , see the instructions below :
You can find the source code here : http://git.videolan.org/vlc.
I use a system - wide installation , but the careful amongst you can do a local installation .
The steps are the following :
use a local vlc directory , I use $ HOME / kde/src /
git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc/vlc-1.1.git
cd vlc
This will get you the latest stable branch , including all the latest fixes .
Now I am somewhat lazy , so I used the very handy build - dep command to find all the necessary dependencies for VLC .
You can do this by activating the source repositories in your /etc/ apt / sources.list , then type the following command :
sudo apt - get build - dep vlc
For OpenSuSE users , this would be :
sudo zypper si -d vlc
This will bring in almost all necessary dependencies , but the following did not show up , so I had to install those afterwards :
libxcb - shm0-dev
libxcb - xv0-dev
libx11 - xcb-dev
To build VLC , you will also need the following packages :
autoconf
lua5.1
liblua5.1-0-dev
OK , lets build it then :
./bootstrap
./configure -- prefix=/usr
do n’t forget to change this prefix for a local installation , and of course do not run make install with sudo rights below .
make - j3 && sudo make install
There you are , you have a brand new VLC !
For those using a local installation , do n’t forget to remove the distro packages to avoid any conflicts .
2. Build a newer Phonon
Some dependencies changed in the new backend version and we want to have a newer Phonon build than 4.4.3 which is currently shipped by most distributions in KDE 4.6 , Let ’s start with that before we can build the backend .
Phonon is now located on git.kde.org .
git clone git://anongit.kde.org/phonon
cd phonon
mkdir build
cd build
I did a system - wide installation to override the default Phonon delivered with KDE .
Here comes the cmake command :
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull
$ HOME/kde/src/phonon
All in one line , of course .
The command
sudo make install
will build it and you have a new Phonon on your system 🙂
3 . Build the phonon-vlc backend
The current code is located on git.kde.org .
Keep in mind that this is still very much work in progress , so there will be changes to the code almost daily .
Again , use a new repository for this code , I suggest $ HOME / kde/src / as usual :
git clone git://anongit.kde.org/phonon-vlc
cd phonon-vlc
mkdir build
cd build
Everything is read to build now :
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/kde/ \
-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/kde/include / \
-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/kde/lib/ \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull \
-DPHONON_VLC_NO_EXPERIMENTAL=true
$ HOME/kde/src/phonon-vlc/
all in one line , of course , do n’t forget to change the - DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX for a non local installation .
make - j3 && make install
the same warning applies for a non local build , do use sudo make install
We are almost there , now let ’s activate this backend :
kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental
And now you can change your backend in the System Settings -> Multimedia ->
Backend tab .
Start Amarok and enjoy 🙂
Please help us improve this backend and report any bugs you might find here : http://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=phonon, component “ VLC backend ” .
Keep in mind that this is still work in progress , so make sure your bug report is really against the latest version .
For those willing to give a hand and / or submit patches , please meet us in #phonon on irc.freenode .
net or make a merge request for your patch .
The ruling concerned the cooling system at Indian Point Units 2 and 3 , which were commissioned in the early 1970s .
( Indian Point 1 was shut down in 1974 . )
Both take in enormous volumes of river water — a combined 2.5 billion gallons a day , or more than twice the average daily water consumption of all of New York City — and use it to create steam for turbines and to cool the reactors .
The water is then pumped back into the Hudson , 20 or 30 degrees hotter .
Sucking so much water causes plankton , eggs and larvae to be drawn into the plant ’s machinery , or entrained , and the water pressure also causes fish to be trapped , or impinged , against intake screens , the state said .
The plant ’s “ once - through ” cooling system was obsolete by the late 1970s , when the state of the art became “ closed - cycle ” cooling — more akin to a car ’s radiator — which consumes less than 10 percent as much water and kills fewer organisms .
“ Conversion from a once - through cooling system to a closed - cycle cooling system , while expensive and involving a potentially lengthy construction process , is nevertheless the only available and technically feasibly technology ” for Indian Point to satisfy the “ best technology available ” requirement of state water - quality regulations , an official of the Department of Environmental Conservation official wrote .
If Entergy fails to overturn the state ’s ruling , it could take the fight to Washington .
And the New York region ’s economic reliance on Indian Point could give the corporation considerable leverage .
Even Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky , a Westchester Democrat who is one of the plant ’s loudest critics , said he expected Entergy to “ try to get the N.R.C. to back off the requirement ” for a water quality certificate .
Other opponents of the plant hailed the ruling .
“ The era in which you can take 2.5 billion gallons of water from the Hudson River every day , and return it to the river untreated and polluted — those days are over , ” said Mr. Brodsky , who , with the folk singer Pete Seeger , successfully sued to get the state to enforce the clean - water laws at Indian Point .
“ Entergy has to either stop polluting the river or close the plant .
End of discussion . ”
Alex Matthiessen , president of the environmental group Riverkeeper , said it was conceivable that Entergy could spend the money to retrofit its cooling system and then reapply to the state .
But that would cause a huge delay , he added .
“ For all we know , this is it — the beginning of the end , ” he said .
Ms. Screnci , the spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , said the commission was “ a ways away from reaching a decision on whether to renew the license . ”
But she added : “ It ’s my understanding that the law says that this certification must be in place for us to renew the license .
So we ’ll be watching to see what occurs in the meantime . ”
The Federal Government has banned the importation of tablet presses used to manufacture illicit drugs .
The ban comes into force on March 1 and will attract a fine of $ 110,000 .
Legitimate users must apply for approval from the attorney - general to import the machines .
Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor says the ban will help stop the manufacture of illegal drugs .
" This is one way we can reduce the distribution of drugs , by removing this element from the use of organised criminals , " Mr O'Connor said .

Is the President 's resume accurate when it comes to his career and qualifications ?
I can corroborate that Obama 's " teaching career " at Chicago was , to put it kindly , a sham .
I spent some time with the highest tenured faculty member at Chicago Law a few months back , and he did not have many nice things to say about " Barry . "
Obama applied for a position as an adjunct and was n't even considered .
A few weeks later the law school got a phone call from the Board of Trustees telling them to find him an office , put him on the payroll , and give him a class to teach .
The Board told him he did n't have to be a member of the faculty , but they needed to give him a temporary position .
He was never a professor and was hardly an adjunct .
The other professors hated him because he was lazy , unqualified , never attended any of the faculty meetings , and it was clear that the position was nothing more than a political stepping stool .
According to my professor friend , he had the lowest intellectual capacity in the building .
He also doubted whether he was legitimately an editor on the Harvard Law Review , because if he was , he would be the first and only editor of an Ivy League law review to never be published while in school ( publication is or was a requirement ) .
Consider this : 1 . President Barack Obama , former editor of the Harvard Law Review , is no longer a " lawyer " .
He surrendered his license back in 2008 possibly to escape charges that he " fibbed " on his bar application .
2. Michelle Obama " voluntarily surrendered " her law license in 1993 .
3 . So , we have the President and First Lady - who do n't actually have licenses to practice law .
Facts .
4 . A senior lecturer is one thing .
A fully ranked law professor is another .
According to the Chicago Sun-Times , " Obama did NOT ' hold the title ' of a University of Chicago law school professor " .
Barack Obama was NOT a Constitutional Law professor at the University of Chicago .
5 . The University of Chicago released a statement in March , 2008 saying Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) " served as a professor " in the law school , but that is a title Obama , who taught courses there part - time , never held , a spokesman for the school confirmed in 2008 .
6 . " He did not hold the title of professor of law , " said Marsha Ferziger Nagorsky , an Assistant Dean for Communications and Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago School of Law .
7 . The former Constitutional senior lecturer cited the U.S. Constitution recently during his State of the Union Address .
Unfortunately , the quote he cited was from the Declaration of Independence , not the Constitution .
8 . The B - Cast posted the video .
9 . In the State of the Union Address , President Obama said : " We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in ourConstitution : the notion that we are all created equal . "
10 .
By the way , the promises are not a notion , our founders named them unalienable rights .
The document is our Declaration of Independence and it reads :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
11 . And this is the same guy who lectured the Supreme Court moments later in the same speech ?
When you are a phony it 's hard to keep facts straight .
President Barack Obama - Editor of the Harvard Law Review - Has No Law License ?:
I saw a note slide across the #TCOT feed on Twitter last night that mentioned Michelle Obama had no law license .
This struck me as odd , since ( a ) she went to school to be a lawyer , and ( b ) she just recently held a position with the University of Chicago Hospitals as legal counsel - and that 's a pretty hard job to qualify for without a law license .
But being a licensed professional myself , I knew that every state not only requires licensure , they make it possible to check online the status of any licensed professional .
So I did , and here 's the results from the ARDC Website : She " voluntarily surrendered " her license in 1993 .
Let me explain what that means .
A " Voluntary Surrender " is not something where you decide " Gee , a license is not really something I need anymore , is it ? " and forget to renew your license .
No , a " Voluntary Surrender " is something you do when you 've been accused of something , and you " voluntarily surrender " your license five seconds before the state suspends you .
Here 's an illustration : I 'm a nurse .
At various times in my 28 years of nursing , I 've done other things when I got burned out ; most notably a few years as a limousine driver ; even an Amway salesman at one point .
I always , always renewed my nursing license - simply because it 's easier to send the state $ 49.00 a month than to pay the $ 200 , take a test , wait six weeks , etc. , etc. . .
I 've worked ( recently ) in a Nursing Home where there was an 88 year old lawyer and a 95 year old physician .
Both of them still had current licenses as well .
They would never DREAM of letting their licenses lapse .
I happen to know there is currently in the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City , Indiana an inmate who is a licensed physician , convicted of murder when he chased the two burglars who entered his home and terrorized his family into the street and killed them .
( And I ca n't say I blame him for that , either . )
This physician still has an active medical license and still sees patients , writes prescriptions , etc. all from inside the prison .
And he renews his medical license every two years , too .
I tried looking up why she would " Voluntarily surrender " her license , but Illinois does not have its 1993 records online .
But when I searched for " Obama " , I found this :
" Voluntarily retired " - what does that mean ?
Bill Clinton hung onto his law license until he was convicted of making a false statement in the Lewinsky case and had to " Voluntarily Surrender " his license too .

A total of 143 FSA employees took part in the operation Deutsche Bank , the leading German bank , the French giant BNP Paribas and hedge fund Moore Capital are now known to have workers caught up in an FSA probe .
Their employees are among six arrested under suspicion of taking part in a long - running insider - dealing scheme .
The investigation is a joint venture between the FSA - the City 's watchdog - and the Serious Organised Crime Agency .
The operation , which began in 2007 , is the FSA 's biggest operation against insider dealing .
It is also the first run between the two agencies .
Investigators raided 16 addresses in London , the South East and Oxfordshire , seizing documents and computers .
The FSA is probing private dealings by the traders , rather than trades for the firm .
The firms say are co-operating with the investigation .
It is not yet known where the other three involved were employed .
Suspected dealing ring
They are suspected of being involved in what the FSA calls " a sophisticated and long - running insider dealing ring " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is alleged the city professionals passed inside information to traders , either directly or via middlemen .
The traders then allegedly acted on this information and made significant profits as a result .
The raid on Moore Capital was first discovered by the BBC .
A source said that some of the suspicious trading activities allegedly had been made using the arrested hedge fund manager 's personal trading account .
A total of 143 FSA employees took part in the operation , together with officers from Soca .
" There can no longer be any doubt that the FSA is serious about cracking down on City crime , especially illicit trading in shares and securities when in possession of privileged insider knowledge , " said BBC business editor Robert Peston .

Let me start out by saying that I 'm currently 56 years old and everything I know about video game consoles can fit on a fingernail clipping .
A couple of years ago , my companion bought me a PS2 , because she had recalled my mentioning in passing ( after seeing advertisements for some pretty interesting sci - fi - themed games ) that I was curious about what 's going on in that medium .
The game technology seemed to have progressed light years since I last paid attention , sometime in the late 80s , early 90s , which went something like this : you start out with some objective , and then the game play steadily quickens until you eventually lose against the computer .
It was very dull .
After she bought me the PS2 , the only game I bought was Grand Tourismo 4 ( she had given me with the console itself Superman Returns , but I did n't like it ) , with which I relaxed by racing the realistically rendered cars around some impressively detailed tracks , but never getting into the more sophisticated levels of the game .
Then about four months ago , my son lent me Resident Evil 4 .
Of course , you gamers know this was a benchmark in game development , and can understand why I became completely immersed in it .
It was truly a creepy experience .
You were n't just WATCHING a horror movie ; you were IN it .
Here I was , at my age , suddenly finding myself lost for literally hours a day -- one weekend , twenty hours straight ; my body ached -- then thinking about the game when I was n't playing it , looking forward to the moment I could resume the story .
After I beat it , I went through it three more times .
Then I bought God of War II , quite by accident ( I selected it for the price , a mere $ 20 ) , unaware that this , too , was a hit game , and another benchmark .
The graphics were so good , so stunning , so grand and sweeping , I played it six times .
Again , hours seemed like minutes ; I 'd simply lose time .
I was now addicted , and taking into account how good a PS2 was , I figured that the PS3 -- with its Blu-ray technology -- had to be out - of - this - world incredible .
Four weeks ago , I bought this PS3 slim , and it has given me enjoyment that made it worth every penny , and then some .
I can't speak to the technical specifications of the PS3 , or how it compares to other consoles .
I 'm writing instead to other middle - aged customers who might have stumbled on this page , perhaps shopping for some young relative -- son or daughter ; niece or nephew ; or grandchild -- to suggest that you should consider buying one of these babies for yourself .
This is one powerful piece of entertainment technology .
Not only does it exceed my expectations as a game console , it 's also a BD player , and using the WiFi connection , it permits access to the PlayStation Store , for free demos and exclusive content ; plus BD live material , and downloading movies and TV episodes ; and you can import your CDs to the PS3's hard drive , to create playlists or just randomize the tracks for playback .
It 's become a virtual media center for me .
And the game play ?
Oh , man .
The PS3 advances even further the features that make gaming so addictive .
To those of you who snuff that it's a juvenile waste of time , I suggest you ask yourself , is it any different from watching sitcoms or reality TV ?
A video game requires you to REACT , to THINK , to ANALYZE .
That is NOT overstating the stimulative benefits .
While they are in fact merely games , game - play itself is a complete immersion in an experience , while requiring good hand - eye coordination and some mental agility .
All the games I 've played so far included puzzles as part of the story , and it's a very satisfying feeling when you finally solve a particularly challenging one .
If the middle - aged shopper I 'm imagining I 'm writing to is inclined to wonder if all that tapping on those buttons in specific patterns is difficult to learn , this is my honest answer :
At first , yes , it is .
But eventually your fingers learn what button is where , and it becomes second nature , like typing .
To those even older , it 's recommended by doctors that as you age , you need new stimuli to keep your acuity .
You wo n't find a more fun way to do so than this .
Ignore your previous misconception that video games are for teenagers .
An article in USA TODAY from 2004 stated that " . . . the average age of game players was 29 and the average age of buyers was 36 , with men making up 59 % of the playing audience . "
So you can add about five years to those figures , making the average age of video game BUYERS about 40 .
I have spent untold hours on my PS3 , and connected to my 47 " HDTV , it 's the ultimate entertainment .
The graphics are sharp and clear , movement of characters is realistic , making it even easier to get totally engaged in the environments .
I just finished
, a great game with easily mastered moves , some tough puzzles , and a very dark , decayed ambiance .
True gamers who are reading this are probably chuckling right now , because this is all pretty much a no - duh to them .
Well , let me offer a hardy THANK YOU for supporting the industry with enough of your dollars to permit it to advance as an entertainment medium in such awesome bounds .
This is the next step toward the future of the ultimate video game experience .
Oh , what will the technology deliver ?
A virtual reality , perhaps ?

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered a fast - moving deep ocean current with the volume of 40 Amazon Rivers near Antarctica that will help researchers monitor the impacts of climate change on the world ’s oceans .
A team of Australian and Japanese scientists , in a study published in Sunday ’s issue of the journal Nature Geoscience , found that the current is a key part of a global ocean circulation pattern that helps control the planet ’s climate .
Scientists had previously detected evidence of the current but had no data on it .
“ We did n’t know if it was a significant part of the circulation or not and this shows clearly that it is , ” one of the authors , Steve Rintoul , told Reuters .
Rintoul , of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Center in Hobart , said it proved to be the fastest deep ocean current yet found , with an average speed of 20 cm ( 7.9 inches ) a second .
It was also found to carry more than 12 million cubic meters a second of very cold , salty water from Antarctica .
“ At these depths , below three kilometers ( two miles ) from the surface , these are the strongest recorded speeds we ’ve seen so far , which was really a surprise to us . ”
He said the current carries dense , oxygen - rich water that sinks near Antarctica to the deep ocean basins further north around the Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean and then branches out .
GLOBAL CONVEYOR BELT
The current forms part of a much larger network that spans the world ’s oceans , acting like a giant conveyor belt to distribute heat around the globe .
Oceans are also a major store of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas that is emitted naturally and by mankind , mainly from burning fossil fuels .
For example , the Gulf Stream brings warm water to the North Atlantic , giving northern Europe a relatively mild climate .
Failure of the current , which has occurred in the past , would plunge parts of Europe into a deep freeze , scientists say .
“ The deep current along the Kerguelen Plateau is part of a global system of ocean currents called the overturning circulation , which determines how much heat and carbon the ocean can soak up , ” Rintoul said .
A key part of the circulation is the creation of large volumes of the very cold , salty water in several areas along coastal Antarctica that then sinks to the bottom and flows to other ocean basins .
The team deployed measuring devices anchored to the sea floor at depths of up to 4.5 km ( 3 miles ) and recorded current speed , temperature and salinity for a two - year period .
“ The continuous measurements provided by the moorings allow us , for the first time , to determine how much water the deep current carries to the north , ” Rintoul said .
He said a key issue for predicting climate was whether the overturning circulation was going to stay at its present strength or whether it was sensitive to changes as climate changes .
That meant further improving measurements of the speed and volume of the cold , salty water that is created around Antarctica .

Zeljka Raguz calls the Croatian conflict " the war for our homeland " Geography teacher Zeljka Raguz begins an impromptu test for her final - year students .
The high school is in southern Bosnia , but her questions have a rather different geographical focus .
" What are the main cities in Croatia ? " she asks .
" Which European country has the largest Croatian community ?
Are there many Croats in Africa ? "
She calls the Croatian war of the 1990s " the war for our homeland " .
The dozen or so students in the class at Stolac High School are Bosnian Croats , who learn the Croatian curriculum and attend school in the morning .
Bosniaks - Bosnian Muslims - are taught on their own at the same school , but in an afternoon shift .
The system , known as " two schools under one roof " was introduced in 2003 , replacing a previous set - up in which different ethnic groups were often taught in separate establishments .
Resolution ignored Intended only as a temporary measure , it was an attempt to allow families who returned after the war to educate their children in proper facilities .
But more than 50 schools in Bosnia remain divided today .
The parliament of the Bosniak - Croat Federation - one of the two semi-autonomous entities making up post - war Bosnia , and the part where the Bosniaks are concentrated - recently adopted a resolution to establish multi-ethnic schools .
But many local municipal authorities are unwilling to make the change .
You can see that the different students do n't communicate
Student Marija Blatnjak
" It 's not good for our future , but that 's how it is , " says Marija Blatnjak , an 18 - year - old Bosnian Croat student .
" You can see that the different students do n't communicate , " she says .
" That will be a big problem for our country because we learn to be separated . "
As the Croat shift ends , a bell signals when the waiting Bosniak students can enter the building .
They pass under a Croatian flag , which hangs over the doorway .
Eighteen - year - old Bosniak Emin Isakovic tells me he , too , has reservations about the system .
" If we were together at school , we'd be able to understand and get to know each other , " he says .
" As it is , we can't form our own opinions about others .
We have to solve the school separation issue before we can start to tackle other problems here . "
' Educational apartheid '
At the adjoining elementary school , the separation is even more marked .
Children there use different parts of the building , according to their ethnic group .
A Croatian flag hangs over the entrance of the Stolac school
To enter the school , the Bosniak pupils walk past the Croat section , through a set of gates towards their own separate door .
Fifteen years after the Bosnian war , which tore apart ethnic Croats , Bosniaks and Serbs , critics say the ongoing school separation is sowing dangerous seeds .
" It 's educational apartheid , " says local human rights activist Nerin Dizdar .
" The young are taught that the other one is a threat to them .
It generates ignorance and hatred and these are the main ingredients for future conflicts . "
There is some support for the status quo among the students .
One boy told me that , since Croats and Muslims clashed so badly during the war , it was better to keep them separate at school to avoid any unwanted consequences .
" This is the only possible education system now " , says Croat head teacher Mirjana Biletic .
" The shifts are only there for logistical reasons - not for segregation or discrimination . "
Asked why a Croatian flag hangs at the entrance to a Bosnian school , she says : " If students have a problem with that , they can lodge a complaint through the official procedure . "
Mixed - activity school Just 30 km ( 19 miles ) away in the city of Mostar , the brightly - coloured high school provides a very different educational experience .
Croats and Bosniaks are still taught their own curricula , but they go to school together and enjoy mixed activities in the library or sports hall .
It is the only former " two schools under one roof " institution in the country to have been united .
If we do n't change our way of life our kids will be the same
Student Luca Aleksic
" I like how everyone is together " , says 15 - year - old Andrea Bevanda .
" That 's how it 's supposed to be . "
" Kids in this school are more tolerant " , she says , when asked whether her friends behave differently to those in other , still - divided schools .
" They 're kind to one another .
They hang out together . "
Kenan Ridjesic , a Bosniak teenager , agrees .
" I have a lot of Croat friends , " he says .
" The good thing about this school is that I do n't see the difference between us .
We 're all humans - blood , flesh , bones .
They just go to church and I go to the mosque . "
Bosnia is still trying to move on from its devastating conflict , to rebuild the multi-ethnic harmony it once had .
But many believe these attempts will be thwarted unless the educational system is reformed - unless the next generation of Bosnians learn how to coexist peacefully .
" If we do n't change our way of life our kids will be the same , " says Luca Aleksic , an 18 - year - old at the Stolac school .
" People here think it 's wrong to mix with boys from the other culture .
If you go to a cafe together , they say you 're stupid , you 're different , " she says .
" But I think we should be grateful to have other friends .
This is one country and we could be better . "

Your Snickers bars will keep for quite a while if frozen - just layer them between waxed paper in a sealed plastic container .
Beware storing them at room temperature too long , especially during the summer , as the chocolate has a rather low melting temperature .
But do n't worry , these wo n't last long !
The hard part is not eating the whole pan yourself .
Serve frozen :
Served fresh out of the freezer , they taste awesome !
Since they lack the stabilizers and waxes used to keep commercial candy bars shelf - stable , they 're a bit soft at room temperature .
This means the texture is fantastic when they 're frozen - the chocolate is crunchy but not rock - hard , and the caramel and nougat are nicely chewy .
It 's half - way between a regular Snickers bar and Snickers ice cream bars .
Everyone in the Instructables office preferred this serving style !
Serve at room temp :
This is a great option if you want nice gooey caramel , or are serving these Snickers as party buffet finger food .
Since the chocolate will get a bit tacky , I recommend serving squares of candy bar in individual muffin cup liners - it's a great way to keep portions separated and fingers clean .
Keep an eye on the room temperature - if it's too hot , the chocolate may become too melty to handle !
If this seems likely , you can place your muffin cup liners on a metal baking sheet set atop a bed of ice .
The bit of additional chill should keep your chcoolate in good shape .
If this is for a summertime barbecue , plan to swap in new ice as needed , and keep the bars in the shade .
If you 're really concerned , consider melting an ounce or two of food - grade wax ( paraffin , sold near canning supplies ) into each batch of chocolate mixture to raise the melting point and give it more solidity .
Gov. Haley Barbour ( R - MS ) believes there ’s no need to mention slavery when honoring the Confederacy because it “ goes without saying ” that slavery is “ bad . ”
“ I do n’t know what you would say about slavery , ” Barbour said Sunday on CNN ’s State of the Union , “ but anyone who thinks that you have to explain to people that slavery is a bad thing Ã¢â‚¬â€ 
I think it goes without saying . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Virginia governor Bob McDonnell launched a Confederate History Month proclamation last week and subsequently came under fire nationally for omitting this central aspect of its history .
According to Barbour , the criticism — including from President Obama and civil rights leaders — is illegitimate .
“ To me it ’s a sort of feeling that itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s just a nit , ” he told Candy Crowley .
“ That it is not significant .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s trying to make a big deal out of something that does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t matter for diddly . ”
DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan pounced on the remarks , warning the GOP that failing to condemn these remarks “ send a strong message to all Americans that Republicans endorse Governor Barbour ’s sentiments and are content not only to be left behind in another century , but that they deserve to be a small regional party in the permanent minority . ”
McDonnell responded in kind by showering praise on the chairman of the Republican Governors Association as “ a tremendous leader for Mississippi . ”
His spokesman added , in a statement to the Washington Post , “ We thank him for his leadership and service to the state and country . ”
McDonnell profusely apologized last week following the spate of outrage , admitting his failure to include any reference to slavery was a “ mistake ” and a “ major omission . ”

The group that lobbied McDonnell ’s office to reinstate Confederate History Month in Virginia , Sons of Confederate Veterans , is linked to the white supremacist movement , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
The video is from CNN ’s State of the Union Sunday , uploaded to YouTube .

The revised Silverstone circuit revealed yesterday could take Monza ’s place as the fastest track in Formula 1 .
Though F1 cars will hit higher top speeds at Monza , the projected average lap speed for F1 cars at the new Silverstone is 4kph faster than that achieved at Monza last year .
Here ’s why .
Fastest lap speeds in F1
The graph below shows the average lap speed of the fastest lap at three tracks in their Grand Prix weekends from 2000 to 2009 .
Times from all F1 sessions were counted :
Fastest average lap speeds for each track ( highest in italics ) :
2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Monza 248.95 253.66 259.83 258.56 262.24 260.03 256.75 256.34 248.68 251.40 Spa 226.71 233.36 241.66 239.86 236.24 239.98 237.79 241.28 Silverstone 215.95 230.06 234.28 232.88 236.57 235.68 230.62 233.82 232.69 236.92
Speed - limiting rules hit Monza hardest
Rules brought in to slow F1 cars down have cut average speeds at Monza more than they have at tracks like Spa and Silverstone .
This because engine performance has a greater effect on lap time at Monza than aerodynamic downforce , and engine performance has been severely restricted in the past five years – due to the move from V10s to V8s in 2006 , and the lowering of the rev limit in 2007 and 2009 .
The teams run special low - drag aero kits at Monza to allow them to hit top speeds over 30 kph higher than any other track on the calendar .
Aerodynamic performance matters little over Monza ’s chicanes .
At Silverstone and Spa the teams use a more conventional aerodynamic set - up because the tracks have more quick corners .
As we saw earlier this month , largely unrestricted aerodynamic development over the winter means the cars are quite a bit quicker this year .
Silverstone ’s changes
The changes being made to Silverstone will make it quicker than the old version ( and how often do we say that about an F1 circuit ? ) .
Silverstone originally estimated F1 cars will lap the revised 5.9 km circuit at around 1’23.13 – suggesting an average lap speed of more than 255 kph .
When you consider that the cars will probably be flat - out from the re-profiled ( but no slower ) Club , through Abbey up to Village , and then flat - out from The Loop and down the new Wellington Straight , it ’s clear the new stretch of tarmac will be quite a bit quicker than the one it replaces even with its two slow corners .
The re-profiling will cut out the slow Abbey chicane and Brooklands will be wider and faster .
Will all these changes add up to a faster lap speed than Spa and Monza ?
We ’ll find out in July .
But even if it does , it may only prove fleeting .
With more downforce cuts planned for 2011 including the double - diffuser ban , the initiative could swing back towards Monza .

The Smoking Gun :
While doing research for my documentary , I came across the smoking gun .
This evidence is so hot that the government shut off my Internet access when I discovered it .
I called the cable company and they said that they turned off my Internet access for not paying my bill .
So it was just a coincidence that the government turned off my Internet at the exact same moment the cable company did ?
Nice try government .
Here 's what they do n't want you to know : if you take the word " TITANIC " and you remove the letters T , I , and T , and then you add the letters C , O , S , P , R , and Y , then it spells : COINCIDENCE ???
I literally got chills when I discovered this .
Whoever orchestrated this plot really knew what they were doing .
I 'm tired of being lied to .
I 'm mad as hell and I 'm going to keep editing video until I get some answers .
All day if I have to .
Spread the truth !!!

It 's en vogue to bash Shawn Horcoff for his play this year , and the more ignorant media types bash his " seven million dollar cap hit " , but allow me to mount a defense of the man .
Bear with me while we dive into some advanced stats after the jump .
I know that those who attack Horcoff do n't want to hear excuses for his play , and rightfully so .
He was signed at $ 5.5 million per year you yokels , not $ 7 million , to be the number one outscoring center on this team for awhile .
However , it 's widely agreed that the weakest position in the entire organization ( before the trade deadline anyway ) is left wing .
In fact , it 's so weak that everyone agrees that the left wings that have played the second and third most minutes for the Oilers should n't even be in the NHL .
It also happens that Shawn Horcoff has spent almost 50 % of his even strength ice time with those two left wings that should n't be in the NHL .
The results , via Vic Ferrari 's timeonice.com site , are not pretty .

So Horcoff is n't good enough to outshoot or outscore with Ethan Moreau and Jean - Francois Jacques .
His Corsi with Moreau and Jacques -- .411 -- ouch .
In the other 53 % of the time he 's spent on the ice , Horcoff is outshooting his opponents and might be breaking even in the goals department , even with his terrible shooting luck , if he had average goaltending instead of the .896 trainwreck that he 's played in front of this year .
The numbers above prove that there 's been a real problem with left wing depth this year and an even bigger problem in how that depth has been used at even strength .
The numbers above also prove that Horcoff is n't nearly as bad as his detractors say he 's been , and if there were a couple of forwards that were n't playing hockey in quicksand , Horcoff might just be back to his old ways .
CNN host Rick Sanchez described the leader of an Ohio Tea Party group as “ a bigot and a liar ” on Tuesday , after he had first referred to Hispanic immigrants as “ spicks ” and then attempted to defend himself by claiming he had merely been quoting a 1960 ’s Bee Gee ’s song .
Several weeks ago , during a march supporting immigration reform , Tea Party leader Sonny Thomas had tweeted , “ Illegals everywhere today !
So many spicks makes me feel like a speck .
Grr. Where ’s my gun ? ”
That original tweet appears to have been scrubbed from Thomas ’s Twitter feed , although a few retweets calling it “ disgusting ” can still be found .

“ So he ’s referring to Hispanics with the most offensive word that you can use , ” Sanchez remarked , “ and then he implies that he wishes he could shoot them ?
Nice . ”
Thomas ’s “ racially insensitive ” remarks have already caused an Ohio state senator to drop out of an event organized by his Springboro Tea Party group .
Thomas appears to be known for his racist attitudes , and CNN found a photo on his MySpace page of him wearing a “ white pride ” t- shirt , although that also now appears to have been removed .
According to Sanchez , when CNN contacted Thomas to ask for an explanation , he claimed , “ As I am a lifetime music lover of all genres , I always have some sort of song that can fit almost any occasion or situation .
…
Coincidentally , the song ‘ Spicks and Specks ’ had been on my player . …
I made the reference to the song , not stopping to think of the era that it was produced from and taken out of context could be so offensive to some people . ”
But Sanchez was n’t buying the excuse .
“ So , he ’s blaming it on the Bee Gees ? ” he asked incredulously .
“ And he did n’t think — he did n’t think it would be offensive .
Really ?
Really ? ”
The original Bee Gee ’s song from 1966 has no racial content whatsoever .
The lyrics run , “ Where are the girls I left all behind , the spicks and the specks of the girls on my mind . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Yeah , he is just a Bee Gees fan , like I ’m Elvis , ” concluded Sanchez sarcastically .
“ That ’s a song about love lost .
It has nothing to do with that Australian band singing about Mexicans .
With or without the music , Sonny Thomas appears to be two things , a bigot and a liar . ”

Karoli posted a story about a frothing Florida doctor who is telling Obama supporters to seek treatment elsewhere , on Friday .
On Saturday , Alan Colmes had the displeasure of interviewing said doctor and found out that the man does n't even know the details of the health care reform bill :
Dr. Jack Cassell , the Orlando urologist who put a sign on his door letting patients know he does n’t want to have to treat them if they are Obama / health care reform supporters , was on my radio show Friday night , but did n’t seem to know much about the health care bill he ’s criticizing .
Cassell : Hospice cuts in 2012 … Does the government want people to die slowly ?
Colmes :
Do you really think the government wants people dead ?
Cassell : Well I think that they ’re cutting all supportive care , like nursing homes , ambulance services …
Colmes :
What to you mean they ’re cutting nursing homes ?
Cassell :
They ’re cutting nursing home reimbursements
Colmes :
Is n’t what they ’re cutting under the Medicare plan what was really double dipping ; they were getting credits and they were getting to deduct them at the same time .
Cassell :
Well you know , I ca n’t tell you exactly what the deal is .
Colmes :
If you ca n’t tell us exactly what the deal is , why are you opposing it and fighting against it ?
Alan has audio of the interview , you can find it here .
Cassell is a typical , under informed nutter who does n't know any better than to spew this crap without knowing any of the details .
Behold your garden variety teabagger .
Well done , Mr. Colmes , thank you for exposing this hack for what he is .
If this interview is any indication of Cassell 's intellect , I fear for his patients .
Comcast is fighting its way through a battle to acquire NBC and related assets ( including MSNBC ) without being deemed a monopoly ( which they are , and should be barred from owning NBC ) .
For a preview of how dangerous it is to have one corporation control access to the Internet and cable TV , have a look at their new joint venture : RightNetwork .
Check out the slick ads , the Kelsey Grammer intro , and please have a look at their debut reality series called " Running " .
What is n't apparent at first blush becomes apparent while watching the promo .
They call it a reality show , but it 's really just a big teabagger campaign ad wrapped up in a half - hour broadcast and packaged for the web , mobile and cable broadcast .
They have a slick little " lookbook " you can download ( PDF ) for an overview of what they 're about .
[ Updated 4/18 :
They pulled theirs down , but I had an archive version , which is now linked in its place ]
Nice piece of marketing literature .
They 're marketing themselves as the " anywhere , anytime " network for " engaged people " .
On television , through partners including Comcast , RightNetwork delivers programming on demand that enables our audience to watch what they want , when they want .
Everything Right , at the click of a remote .
the lineup focuses on entertainment with pro-America , pro-business , pro-military sensibilities — compelling content that inspires action , invites a response , and influences the national conversation .
There 's this quote from Ed Snider , Chairman of Comcast - Spectacor :
We ’re creating a welcome place for millions and millions of Americans who ’ve been looking for an entertainment network and media channel that reflects their point - of - view .
Rightnetwork will be the perfect platform to entertain , inform and Connect with the American majority about what ’s right in the world .
When they launch , they 'll have lots of content , since they 've been embedded with the Tea Party Express for its tour across the country .
The YouTube channel has video from key tea party locations .
They do n't even try to hide it anymore .
It 's just outright , blatant partisanship and propaganda , brought to you by Comcast and the US Chamber of Commerce .

Population Speaking a Language Other than English at Home Increases by 140 Percent in Past Three Decades
WASHINGTON , April 27 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / --
The number of people 5 and older who spoke a language other than English at home has more than doubled in the last three decades and at a pace four times greater than the nation 's population growth , according to a new U.S. Census Bureau report analyzing data from the 2007 American Community Survey and over a time period from 1980 – 2007 .
In that time frame , the percentage of speakers of non-English languages grew by 140 percent while the nation 's overall population grew by 34 percent .
( Logo : http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090226/CENSUSLOGO)
Spanish speakers accounted for the largest numeric increase -- nationwide , there were 23.4 million more speakers in 2007 than in 1980 representing a 211 percent increase .
The Vietnamese - speaking population accounted for the largest percentage increase of 511 percent ( 1.0 million speakers ) over the same timeframe .
The new report , Language Use in the United States : 2007 , identifies the states with the highest concentrations of some of the most commonly spoken non-English languages .
The languages , and some of the states with the highest percentage of speakers of these languages , include : Spanish ( Texas , California and New Mexico ) , French ( Louisiana and Maine ) , German ( North Dakota and South Dakota ) , Slavic languages ( Illinois , New York , New Jersey and Connecticut ) , Chinese ( California , New York , Hawaii and Massachusetts ) and Korean ( Hawaii , California and New Jersey ) .
" The language data that the Census Bureau collects is vital to local agencies in determining potential language needs of school - aged children , for providing voting materials in non-English languages as mandated by the Voting Rights Act , and for researchers to analyze language trends in the U.S. , " said U.S. Census Bureau Director Robert M. Groves .
Data on the speakers of non-English languages , as well as their English - speaking ability , routinely are used to help shape legislative , legal and marketing decisions .
Of the 281 million people 5 and older in the United States in 2007 , 55.4 million individuals -- or 20 percent -- reported speaking a language other than English at home .
While the Census Bureau codes 381 detailed languages , data tabulations generally are not available for all of those detailed groups .
Instead , the Census Bureau collapses them into smaller sets of " language groups . "
The simplest collapse uses four major groups : Spanish , other Indo - European languages , Asian or Pacific Island languages , and all other languages .
Of those people surveyed in this report , 62 percent spoke Spanish , 19 percent spoke other Indo - European languages , 15 percent spoke an Asian or Pacific Island language , and 4 percent spoke some other language .
Among people who spoke a language other than English at home , a majority reported speaking English " very well . "
The range varied from around 50 percent of the Asian or Pacific Island language speakers to 70 percent of those who spoke some other language .
The report also found :
After English and Spanish ( 34.5 million speakers ) , Chinese ( 2.5 million speakers ) was the language most commonly spoken at home .
Five other languages have at least 1 million speakers : Tagalog ( 1.5 million speakers ) , French ( 1.4 million speakers ) , Vietnamese ( 1.2 million speakers ) , German ( 1.1 million speakers ) and Korean ( 1.1 million speakers ) .
The largest group of English - only speakers ( 78.3 million ) were 41 to 64 , compared with the 42.3 million speakers 5 to 17 , and 72.4 million speakers aged 18 to 40 and 32.6 million speakers 65 and over .
Among Spanish speakers , nearly as many were native - born as foreign - born – 17.0 million versus 17.5 million , respectively .
This was not the case for the other three major language groups – all three were sizably more foreign - born .
Also , of Spanish speakers , 53 percent reported speaking English " very well . "
Not all languages have grown in use over the years : Italian , Yiddish , German , Polish and Greek were spoken at home by fewer individuals in the United States in 2007 than in 1980 .
Also being released today are state by state and national tables , using the 2006 - 2008 American Community Survey multiyear data , that list every language reported by at least one person in the sample period .
The tables detail the 303 languages other than English spoken at home .
Those languages include :
134 Native American categories ;
19 African language categories ;
8 Chinese language categories ;
22 Other Asian language categories ;
39 Pacific Island language categories ;
12 Indic language categories .
The tables provide estimates of many languages that have not been published since the 2000 Census , including : Albanian , Amharic , Bengali , Cushite , Kru , Panjabi , Pennsylvania Dutch , Romanian , Serbocroatian , Tamil , Telugu and Ukrainian .

Philadelphia Flyers ' Ian Laperriere was hit by a puck blocking a shot against the New Jersey Devils during the third period of an NHL first - round playoff hockey game Thursday , April 22 , 2010 in Newark , N.J. The Flyers beat the Devils 3 - 0 to win the series 4 - 1. ( AP Photo )
( Philadelphia , PA ) –
In his short time with the organization , it 's already become painfully apparent that almost nothing will keep Flyers forward Ian Laperriere off of the ice .
On Tuesday , the man voted byas the toughest player in the NHL , finally met his match .
A brain contusion , as well as a mild concussion , has likely ended Laperriere 's season announced general manager Paul Holmgren via conference call .
Laperriere suffered the injury when he was struck by a slap shot above his right eye from the Devils ' Paul Martin in the third period of the Flyers ’ 3 - 0 victory over New Jersey in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series last Thursday ( watch the play ) .
Holmgren explained that Laperriere saw Dr. Joseph Maroon , the chief neurosurgeon at the University of Pittsburgh , earlier on Tuesday after visiting with Flyers team physicians on Monday .
All of the doctors have noticed what is essentially a bruise on Laperriere 's brain .
“ I think this is significant .
They saw a spot there [ on his brain ] initially , and I think they were hoping , like we all were , that it would dissipate a little bit , ” said Holmgren .
“ Right now , it ’s not safe for him to play .
” As much as he would like to compete for the club as it gets set for the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs , Laperriere , who says that he feels fine except for some mild blurred vision , knows that he can't afford to take that chance for a number of reasons .
“ They do n’t want any bleeding in [ my brain ] .
If you start bleeding in your brain it ’s not good , " he said .
" We ’re hockey players and take pride in playing through injuries , but that ’s one thing I just ca n’t afford to do for the sake of my family .
Trust me , I want to be out there .
I ’m mad about that .
" Do n't expect Laperriere to change his style of play once he returns to the ice .
Blocking 100 mile - per - hour slap shots is , well , his forte .
“ I ’m not mad about the play .
That ’s the play I make a living with , and I ’m going to do that play again , " he said .
" I did it 10,000 times in my career and I ’m going to do it again .
It ’s a matter of bad timing , I guess .
Right now , I ’m going to be a cheerleader , and if my teammates need anything I ’m going to do it for them .
I ’ll be right there cheering them on to the Stanley Cup Finals .
” Laperriere will not require surgery , and will have another CT scan in approximately four weeks , according to Holmgren .
Even if he has healed by then , however , it is unlikely he will be able to return to the lineup should Philadelphia still be competing for the Stanley Cup at that time .
The biggest thing Laperriere needs right now is rest , so he is not allowed to exercise or work out .
“ To be honest , you never know , but I think it ’s going to take a little miracle , " he said , when asked if there was any chance at all that he could return to the lineup .
" It ’s something , personally , I wo n’t mess with and I know the team wo n’t [ either ] .
Hockey is my passion , but my kids are my life , and I have to think about that .
“ I have a family to think about .
I ca n’t be selfish about that one .
The ending of that injury , if it goes wrong , there ’s no worse and you ’re dying on the ice .
That ’s one thing I do n’t want to put my family through and I ’m not willing to take that chance .
[ Flyers trainer ] Jim [ McCrossin ] and the organization wo n’t take that chance , either .
” Replacing Laperriere , a key member of the penalty - kill and one of the veteran leaders on the team , will not be easy .
The club has been trying out various players in practice the past few days , several of whom spent the entire 2009 - 10 season with the AHL ’s Adirondack Phantoms .
Picking up his minutes on the penalty - kill could also fall onto the shoulders of players like Darroll Powe and Scott Hartnell The Flyers are still awaiting dates and an opponent for the next round .
“ It ’s hard to replace Ian and what he does , particularly on the penalty - kill .
He ’s a heart - and - soul guy on our team , and it ’s hard to replace that , ” said Holmgren .
The 6’1 ’’ , 200 - pound right wing has one assist and four penalty minutes in five playoff games .
He played in all 82 games in the regular season , posting three goals and 17 assists for 20 points and 162 penalty minutes ( second on the team ) .
Laperriere was the recipient of the Yanick Dupre Class Guy Memorial award this season as voted upon by the team ’s media , as well as the Gene Hart Memorial Award for the player who shows the most “ heart . ”
ANALYSIS : The ' Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ' ( ACTA ) might sound like it 's aimed exclusively at the crooks selling pirated DVDs at the markets , but it 's really about curbing the behaviour of individual internet users , according to one of Australia 's leading legal academics .
As Government negotiators from 27 nations meet in Wellington , New Zealand today for the latest round of ACTA talks , Kimberlee Weatherall , senior lecturer in law at the University of Queensland , has released a paper which pulls apart the implications of the latest draft text to be leaked from the negotiating table .
Weatherall 's 37 - page paper - available for download online - has confirmed what many had suspected : the ACTA will have serious ramifications for both intermediaries such as internet service providers ( ISPs ) and web hosts , but also for the rights of individuals .
Today , Weatherall spoke to iTnews about how the ordinary citizen will be impacted .
Criminal acts
The original focus of ACTA - to crack down on commercial piracy conducted on a mass scale - has suffered some " scope creep " , according to Weatherall 's reading of the leaked draft .
In simplest terms , the leaked text of the ACTA draft could make an individual criminally liable for the most mundane transgressions of intellectual property law - the downloading of a copyright protected work for personal enjoyment .
The definition of what constitutes " copyright piracy " under ACTA , for example , covers non-commercial acts undertaken by individuals .
According to Weatherall , the draft text would suggest that a single copy of a copyright protected work copied for private use would be " a pirated good . "
Weatherall noted that this definition does not contain any requirement for the user to distribute the content in order to be defined as a pirate - the mere making of a copy , even for personal use , is considered an act of piracy .
Further , the ACTA draft seeks to suggest that it is a commercial act - and potentially a criminal one - to make this copy if it was for " private financial gain . "
One party to the talks - Mexico - has even called for the scope of " private financial gain " to include the money a private individual might save ( and therefore gain ) by NOT paying for a sound or video recording .
" That would make downloading a pirated file a criminal matter , " Weatherall explained .
" The worst interpretation of ACTA could have that impact . "
To extend criminal liability to such an infringement would run against Australia 's Copyright Amendment Bill ( 2006 ) , in which private acts were omitted as an offence , Weatherall said .
" It is not at all clear why the definition needs to be so broad , " Weatherall noted in her paper .
If the target of ACTA is organised crime and large scale counterfeiters , she suggests lawmakers would only have to apply provisions - that copies were made for trade or commercial purposes , for example .
If ACTA also targets large scale internet piracy rings , the agreement could merely include a provision requiring " mass non-commercial infringement " .
That none of those provisions are in the text suggest to Weatherall that individuals are also in the firing line .
Statutory damages
Of even greater to concern to Weatherall is that many of the " remedies " drafted in the leaked ACTA text - ie how copyright abuse should be punished - apply regardless of whether the act is considered commercial or not .
One such remedy is " statutory damages " - that each country should implement a system for pre-established damages to apply in cases of copyright or trademark infringement .
Statutory damages would see government set in law a fixed dollar amount fine for different types of intellectual property abuse .
Such a system keeps rights holders ( such as movie studios or record companies ) from having to prove what harm was done to them in any alleged infringement , and would doubly deter other individuals from engaging in the same activity .
" The biggest impact of ACTA on individuals in Australia is likely to be the introduction of statutory damages , " Weatherall said .
In Australia today , by contrast , individuals found guilty of IP infringement in a court are ordered to pay " additional damages " at a judge 's discretion .
Judges , mindful of the need for damages to reflect the harm caused by any infringement ( and mindful of the media 's analysis of their judgements ) tend to be proportionate in their awarding of damages .
But under ACTA " the courts will be deprived of that discretion , " Weatherall said .
If the United States is anything to go by , damages claims can most certainly get out of hand under a statutory damages scheme .
" If a person has engaged in filesharing , say , with even 20 songs , a simple multiplication of the minimum statutory damages award for knowing infringement ( US $ 750 ) leads to a sum of US $ 15,000 - enough to cause considerable terror in the average young person , " Weatherall noted in her paper .
" That 's big numbers for most people , " she told iTnews , especially when the subscriber has really only cost the music industry US $ 40 , not US $ 15,000 .
Weatherall noted extreme scenarios in the U.S. such as Capitol Records v. Thomas - Rasset , in which an amount of US $ 80,000 damages was set per infringed song , making one lone peer to peer filesharer liable for US $ 1.92 million in damages , despite the trial judge 's estimate of actual damages of around US$ 50 .
In practice , Weatherall noted , what usually happens is that rights holders point to these cases as a means for scaring individuals into settling out of court .
" Rights holders have taken up lawsuits against individuals accused of file sharing , pointed to the statutory damages and said , you could be up for $ 100 K here , but you can settle with us for $ 8 k , " she told iTnews .
" And who would n't settle ?
" That 's how statutory damages have unfortunately been used in recent times . "
The problem with statutory damages , she said , is that they were designed in a day before " digital mass infringement of copyright . "
" There is a punitive element to it , which was designed for tackling the guys selling physical tapes in markets , " she said .
But that does n't fit the crime for your average filesharer .
It has been argued in defence of statutory damages that legislators can cap the total amount of damages resulting from an infringement and keep the total damages bill within a reasonable dollar figure .
" But it then becomes a lobbying target , " Weatherall said .
" Every time rights holders want to put pressure on the Government , the Government ups the figures to look like they have done something . "
Stay tuned for Part II of this discussion with Kimberlee Weatherall , which looks at the implications of ACTA for ISPs , web hosts and search engines .
A glimpse on a disturbing dominionist movement
Some of my longterm readers may be familiar with the term " Quiverfull " -- I 've mentioned it in my series on religiously motivated child abuse in relation to Michael and Debi Pearl ( a series that is , unfortunately , timely again due to the recent death by chastening rod of a seven - year - old girl ) and particularly in regards to my writing on Bill Gothard 's " Bible - based " coercive group empire .
For those uninitiated , " Quiverfull " is a movement within both " independent fundamentalist Baptist " and neopentecostal - dominionist ( including New Apostolic Reformation / Joel 's Army ) circles that promotes the idea of dispensing with any form of contraception whatsoever -- even the rhythm method is prohibited -- and actively attempting to have as many children " as God will allow " .
In NAR circles in particular , this is explicitly seen as a method to breed as many future members of " God 's Army " as possible using justification not dissimilar to that of the King of England in " Braveheart " ( " If we can't burn them out , we 'll breed them out " ) ; segments of the Quiverfull movement also increasingly push for home births without medical assistance and even " unregistered births " ( where the birth is never registered with the state Department of Human Resources or other state birth registries and where the child is never signed up for Social Security ) .
In fact , the term in its modern use does have NAR - ish roots -- the term " Quiverfull " denotes having a " full quiver " of arrows to defeat The Enemy ( in this case , secular society ) -- only in this case , the metaphorical " arrows " are children who are reared from birth onwards in a regimented , socially isolated manner .
( In general , the only typical contacts kids in " Quiverfull families " have are with families of other members of the movement . )
The term ultimately stems from a scripture - twisting of Psalms 127:4-5 :
[ 4 ]
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
are the sons of one 's youth .
[ 5 ]
Happy is the man who has
his quiver full of them !
He shall not be put to shame
when he speaks with his enemies in the gate .
( RSV .
In context , this is a psalm of Solomon stating that true protection is in the hands of God and that true preparedness and security only comes from God .
Prior verses explicitly note that a watchman 's duty is in vain unless God is the foundation of the country , among other things . )
Promotion of " Quiverfull " is commonly done via dominionist correspondence - school circles promoting themselves as " Christian homeschooling " ; the Pearls ' and Gothard 's empires have largely grown , in fact , through dominionist correspondence - school support networks .
A related phenomenon is that of " purity balls " -- also written about in part one of my series on religiously motivated child abuse -- where daughters sometimes as young as four are symbolically " married " to their fathers until such time as they are married legally - - often to an arranged spouse .
As I 've noted , the movement is heavily connected with dominionism and would constitute a coercive group in and of itself .
As the article notes :
It is not an exaggeration in some cases -- particularly Gothard 's program -- to compare the general setup to a dominionist version of Taliban - era Afghanistan .
* * *
Surprisingly enough , most people have seen a Quiverfull family on TV - - though they might not have known it .
And , of note , there is at least one Quiverfull family that has become famous -- the Duggar clan , who are known Gothard acolytes and whom are presented as pretty much the poster children for the Quiverfull movement .
Another Quiverfull family , alas , became quite infamous .
This was , unfortunately , the family of Andrea Yates -- who was involved in a dominionist church that promoted Quiverfull theology , and who ultimately ended up drowning five of her young children as a result of postpartum depression complicated by what may well have been cult - related complex PTSD .
* * *
As with most coercive religious movements , there are walkaway networks for support .
The best known by far is No Longer Quivering , run by Vyckie Garrison ( who is herself not only an ex-Quiverfull survivor , but prior to walking away was a major promoter in the movement ) .
The images one gets are of a highly patriarchial , overtly female - hostile , coercive religious movement ( and it does meet the characteristics of an overt coercive religious group , particularly in its isolation of members ) in which women are expected to give all , up to and including their bodies and health , for the whim of their leaders .
And it 's through these forums that we get a rare glimpse into what it is like to be recruited into a Bible - based cult .
Like a frog being boiled in water
People have asked me repeatedly how folks get recruited into coercive groups .
As I am a multigenerational walkaway -- that is , I was raised in a coercive group rather than joining one as a teen or adult -- it 's hard for me to answer this personally ; pretty much , most of my life " Jesus Camp life " was all I knew , and my experiences have been more of essentially resocialising myself ( not unlike a kid who was raised by wolves and having to figure out human culture ) .
Johnathan W. Rice 's recent article in Salon Magazine , Fear And Loathing In Jesusland , describes a story I 've heard across ex-cult forums from recruitees who became walkaways -- that you 're never given the " Full Monty " straightaway but are gradually inducted .
The big difference , here , is that -- for one of the first times since Matt Taibbi's " The Great Derangement " -- this is talking about a non-negligible part of the dominionist movement :
In mid-February 2010 , a thread title on the forum caught my eye : How did you get yourself into this mess ?
The author , a female refugee from the movement , was wondering how she and so many others could have fallen for it in the first place .
After reading it , I again realized how closely the QF / CP movement intersects with mainstream evangelicalism and fundamentalism ; and how easily I too could have been recruited , given the wrong circumstances .
How , one may ask , do people get into such a seemingly bizarre religious movement ?
And how had I ( in the past ) been in danger of being sucked in myself ?
The answer boils down to one simple word : " gradually . "
The substance of my gradual experience , which I ’ll summarize here , is the shared story of countless rank & file believers who come under the broad labels " Pentecostal , " " charismatic , " " evangelical , " and " fundamentalist . "
In the beginning , as a teen in the mid 1970s , my cousin , followed by my mother , became born - again Christians .
It was really positive in those days : God loves you and has a wonderful plan , and so forth .
It was all about having a new life , full of purpose and meaning .
A life in which the very Creator of the Universe actually cared about little people like us !
Among other things , a big thing that the more coercive groups in the movement ( including not just Campus Crusade and YWAM , but the infamous Maranatha ) were involved in was " love - bombing " -- smothering people with affection , making them feel wonderful and loved .
The author himself experienced some of this , and also describes how after the " love - in " the indoctrination started to trickle in , eventually becoming a torrent :
It was all really positive in those early , idealistic years .
Loving Jesus , hoping to save the world , helping homeless people , having an abundance of real friends who stood with me through thick and thin : it was all good ; really good .
The song that often brought tears to my eyes in the early days was written by Keith Green immediately upon his conversion ( before he ’d entered into his extremist phase ) :
Like waking up from the longest dream How real it seemed Until your love broke through But gradually ...
A radio program called Focus on the Family that I used to hear doling out advice to crisis - wracked families , was becoming politicized .
Through the show , and then through the warnings of Tim LaHaye and others , I began learning of sinister threats being hatched against us by people called " Secular Humanists . "
LaHaye , in a breathless , frenzied spiel , warned of the threat as follows .
Humanists , he said : have been " planted " in strategic places in the United Nations , they teach children in public schools " to read the words scientific humanism as soon as they ’re old enough to read , " and 275,000 humanists control the American government , education , and media .
[ 2 ]
As conspiracy - paranoia mounted , politics in church began to subvert the innocent , Jesus - loving expressions of faith I 'd known in the beginning .
Our churches started distributing candidates ' score cards in the foyers , telling us to vote accordingly .
And then there was a radio preacher , William Steuart McBirnie , whose Voice of Americanism program daily rehashed senator McCarthy 's and Carl McIntire 's Red Scare fundamentalism , updating it for the mid-1980s .
We had much to fear and many to loathe .
( [ 2 ] Tim LaHaye , The Battle For the Mind ( Old Tappan , NJ : Revell , 1980 ) , pp. 27 , 74 , 97 , 179 .
Summarized in George M. Mardsen , Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism ( MI : Wm.B. Eerdmans Publishing Co , 1991 ) , p. 109 . )
In addition to describing a phenomena I 've witnessed myself -- the increasing radicalisation of " Christian Contemporary " performers , including Steve Taylor and Carmen ( the latter of whom actually co-published ( with Ron Luce of Teen Mania Ministries , an infamous NAR group targeting -- naturally - - teenagers ) a guide for teenagers on how to recruit fellow teens into Bible - based coercive groups using love - bombing and harassment ) -- he notes personally meeting Francis and Frank Shaeffer , two major leaders of the dominionist movement in the late 70s and early 80s .
( Frank Schaeffer later left the dominionist movement and has written a tell - all book , " Crazy for God " , describing his own experiences ; reportedly , per the book , he initially recruited his own father into the movement . )
Of note , the author almost makes a point I have been writing about for well over five years -- that dominionism is less a political movement and more of a series of Bible - based cults that have as a common goal the establishment of a dominionist - supremacist government :
Most cults have a well - planned program for the indoctrination of new recruits , in which they deceitfully hide their more bizarre teachings from seekers ( an exoteric / esoteric truth divide ) .
The new convert is only taught the vision piecemeal ; gradually gaining deeper ( and weirder ) knowledge over a period of months or years .
But with us , although it may have appeared that way , it was n't exactly so .
I later realized I was living in the midst of a drastic change in popular American Christianity .
The movement still really was ( for the most part ) benign when I joined .
The resentful loathing was added gradually , not as a planned indoctrination program , but because the church genuinely was in the midst of radical transition during 1980s and ‘ 90s .
I myself would agree and disagree with his statement -- what he may not have been aware of is that , particularly during the 80s and 90s , there was an organised campaign ( beginning as early as the waning days of the Latter Rain movement in the 40s ) to explicitly steeplejack the non-Christian - Nationalist segment of the evangelical movement .
Legitimate " Charismatic " movements in Catholic and Protestant denominations were taken over from within by neopentecostal " cuckoo churches " .
In this case , the cult recruitment was less of individual people and more of a takeover - from - within and indoctrination of a very large chunk of the evangelical movement -- one particularly mediated by New Apostolic Reformation groups as well as a group calling itself the Institute for Religion and Democracy that was closely connected to Christian Reconstructionists .
( Probably the prototypical example , in fact , was the ultimately successful steeplejacking of the Southern Baptist Convention -- formerly a conservative but relatively mainline denomination , it has gone hard - dominionist and is now quite possibly undergoing a second " consolidation " steeplejack by NAR - linked groups . )
The NAR takeovers and plans for steeplejacks -- particularly of non-NAR - linked charismatic worship groups -- is , to this day , woefully under - documented ( about the only people who 've written on this regularly are myself , Bruce Wilson , Rachel Tabachnik , and Katherine Yurica and to a lesser extent Sara Diamond ) , so that 's an understandable lapse -- to someone who did n't grow up in one of the major foci of the NAR movement ( as I did ) , it would appear that the evangelical movement just " radicalised slowly " .
Interestingly , it turns out I 'm not the only one to make that argument -- theologian Richard T. Hughes noted in a recent article the likelihood that the evangelical movement had essentially been steeplejacked by Christian Reconstructionists and the NAR for purposes of promoting " Christian supremacy " :
This definition of the kingdom of God as a kingdom of political power helps explain why so many fundamentalist and evangelical Christians lent such broad support to America 's war against Iraq .
It also helps explain the rise of the Christian Reconstruction Movement led by the late R. J. Rushdoony , a Calvinist who argued that Christians should control civil government and that biblical law should govern the United States .
It also helps explain a large and thriving contemporary network , closely akin to the Christian Reconstruction Movement , called the New Apostolic Reformation ( NAR ) -- a network that works through business , politics , religion , and the media to promote Christian control of the United States and even the world .
And by 1985 -- and definitely by 1992 -- Rice was experiencing a classic hallmark of coercive religious groupthink :
An " us versus them " seige mentality , a Culture Of Fear , that every researcher on coercive religious groups from Robert J. Lifton on has defined as a red flag warning of a cult :
And thus by 1985 , my original faith , though still there , was mixed with anger , resentment and fear — a sense of being under siege .
After another few years , the Rev. Don Wildmon , who Max Blumenthal would later describe as " churlish , " [ 4 ] started telling us to boycott Mennon Speed Stick deodorant because it was advertised on a TV show which he , and therefore God , did n't approve of .
Then , in 1990 , James Dobson openly began using the language of civil war : " Nothing short of a great Civil War of Values rages today throughout North America .
Two sides with vastly differing and incompatible world views are locked in a bitter conflict that permeates every level of society . " [ 5 ]
Whether the timing of Dobson ’s drum beating was cunning or just plain lucky , I do n’t know .
But it certainly was fortuitous .
. . .
Civil War .
What a great idea !
Brother against brother .
A woman against her coworker .
Neighbor against neighbor .
Divide and conquer .
A nation ’s unity destroyed .
And when all was said and done , Dobson emerged from the fray as the new Republican Kingmaker .
In such a milieu , those negative traits of resentment and fear had become almost central , my original faith being sickly , barely alive and far beneath the surface .
We were now in the midst of full - blown culture - war .
And all that the churches and Christian mailing list materials were trumpeting was also confirmed by an outside source :
The Rush Limbaugh show .
By 1992 I ’d made the full transition from a spirituality of awe , joy and wonder to one of hatred , fear and all - around loathing .
We Christians were under siege .
" They " were taking away our freedoms .
" They " had planted Secular Humanist agents in every ‘ government school , ’ brainwashing the next generation .
Not only that , The New Age Movement ( painted as a well - organized conspiracy rather than the loosely knit spiritual fad that it was ) was out to forge a One World Government and wipe the final vestiges of Christianity from the face of the earth .
( [ 5 ] James Dobson , Children at Risk ( Dallas : Word Publishing , 1990 ) , pp. 19-20 . )
In noting that the movement was increasingly trending towards " two - minute hates " , Rice also notes how the " Rambo Jesus " meme was becoming increasingly popularised :
As the content of our faith changed , so did our conceptualization of Jesus .
He was no longer a God of love , but a muscle - bound tyrant .
Speaking of the Christian Right in 2009 , journalist Max Blumenthal ’s following description also summarizes the view of Jesus that was gaining ascendancy among us in the 1990s :
The movement ’s Jesus is the opposite of the prince of peace .
He is a stern , overtly masculine patriarch charging into the fray with his sword raised against secular foes ; he is " the head of a dreadful company , mounted on a white horse , with a double - edged sword , his robe dipped in blood , " according to movement propagandist Steve Arterburn .
[ Mega - church pastor ]
Mark Driscoll ...stirs the souls of twenty - something evangelical men with visions of " Ultimate Fighting Jesus ... "
A portrait of virility and violence , the movement ’s omnipotent macho Jesus represents the mirror inversion of the weak men who necessitated his creation .
As [ Erich ]
Fromm explained , " the lust for power is not rooted in strength , but in weakness [ italics in original ] .
It is the expression of the individual self to stand alone and live .
It is the desperate attempt to gain secondary strength where genuine strength is lacking . " [ 8 ]
( [ 8 ] Max Blumenthal , Republican Gomorrah , pp. 9 , 10 . )
Rice also notes that he now considers himself lucky that he was not within proximity of the more charismatic promoters of Quiverfull -- as he , already inducted within what he has all - but - admitted was a coercive religious group , would have been the perfect recruit :
I knew three Quiverfull families back in those days , though I did n't yet know the term .
Two of them had become discredited in my sight , one badly so .
The other had moved far across the country to the Bible Belt , and thus their influence on me was minimal .
But : supposing a well - spoken , polished QF / CP promoter , who in outward appearance had an exemplary life and family , had befriended me then .
And supposing this theoretical person had possessed a charismatic personality .
Had this happened , I very well could have bought into the QF / CP vision .
The angry and ever - intensifying Christian Right machine had changed our churches into pre-stocked ponds in which QF / CP and other extremists fished .
I was one of those pre-stocked fish .
I just happened ( by no virtue of my own at the time ) to always be on the other side of the pond when people like Nancy Campbell , R.C. Sproul Jr. , Doug Phillips , et al. , went fishing .
That 's why I find it no surprise that so many of the former QF / CP people ( like Vyckie Garrison , for example ) are so smart and articulate .
People do n't join the movement because they ’re idiots .
On the contrary , they join because they ’re thoughtful , intelligent human beings who really care about their country ; who are concerned about the kind of world in which their children and grandchildren will live .
But these same good qualities became a curse when cunning fascist leaders subtly began to channel them for their ends .
And thus over the gradual course of time — sometimes even a decade — we ( both " regular " believers and QF / CP Christians ) became foot soldiers in a zombie-army , doing the political bidding of our Christian Right masters .
In other words ... the process of recruitment is a gradual one .
People generally do n't join knowing the " full deal " -- they are recruited with something innocuous , then the indoctrination begins over time until they 've been recruited and are marching lockstep to a leader 's command .
The process is not unlike the old yarn on how to boil a frog .
Put a frog in boiling water , he 'll jump right out ( just like nobody would willingly join a coercive religious group if they knew it was coercive ) .
Put a frog in body - temperature water , though , and slowly turn up the heat ... by the time the frog realises what 's going on , he 's cooked .
And so it is with recruitment in coercive religious groups ... and the " Bible - based " coercive groups at the heart of the dominionist movement are absolute masters at turning up the water very , very slowly for a whole kettle of frogs .
And how the frog realises , " oh dear , I 'm in a pot "
Interestingly , Rice ended up walking away in a similar way to myself -- only in his case , he ended up going to the Emerald City of the dominionist movement , Colorado Springs , and saw for himself that the Emerald City is n't nearly as pretty without the glasses on :
As I headed toward Colorado in a U - Haul van , my knowledge of that city was minimal .
I knew it was America ’s new evangelical Mecca , populated with scores of Christian organizations ; and I loved the beautiful Front Range Mountains I ’d seen on my visit a month before .
But my main source of information was a book I ’d read seven years prior , Ted Haggard ’s , Primary Purpose : Making It Hard for People to Go to Hell from Your City . [ 9 ]
In it , I ’d read the amazing story of how Haggard and his initially small band of followers had transformed the supposedly pagan , anti-Christian city into God ’s own country .
Through spiritual mapping ( identifying the ruling demons in a given area ) and systematic warfare - prayer walks through each neighborhood ( in which those demons were expelled from the region , presumably to resettle in Washington state , California , New York and Massachusetts ) , Colorado Springs was now the godliest place in America : truly a city that was " hard to go to Hell from . "
Or so I thought ...
Although the organization that employed me was benign and apolitical , through my involvement with it I was exposed to the other big ministries in the area .
Year after year I witnessed countless episodes of hypocrisy and self - congratulatory backslapping amongst Christian Right leaders .
I soon felt uneasy amongst people I ’d once greatly admired .
The church we attended turned out to be a de facto outpost of the Republican Party , and according to the pastor ’s bizarre interpretation of an Isaiah passage , God had foreordained Republican Jesus to defeat Babylonian Saddam Hussein .
By 2005 , the church was showing a smiling picture of Sam Brownback each Sunday on the large overhead screen .
The pastor would then instruct us to stretch forth our hands and pray fervently for him .
Brownback , dubbed " God ’s Senator " by Jeff Sharlet , was a near - perfect embodiment of America ’s new civil religion .
He was a syncretic marvel who could glide effortlessly between his ( Fundamentalist ) Topeka Bible Church , Roman Catholicism , and a smattering of Orthodox Judaism .
One cold winter Sunday , the pastor excitedly told us of the senator ’s latest mystical experience : Brownback , the pastor claimed , had just been to Valley Forge with a group of prayer leaders .
There , he knelt at the exact spot where George Washington had once famously prayed .
While on his knees in the snow , Brownback had received " the spiritual mantle of George Washington , " an anointing which would send him to the Whitehouse in 2008 — but only if God ’s people prayed long and hard enough .
Growing weary of weekly political rallies , we soon dropped out of the church .
As the Iraq War went sour and the federal deficit went into the trillions under the " godly " Bush , I became increasingly disillusioned .
Then came wave upon wave of varied Republican scandals ; so many that they soon became an endless blur in my mind , and would have remained so to this day had Max Blumenthal not compiled them all under one cover in Republican Gomorrah .
I realized that we ’d been duped by the Christian Right : the politicians they promoted were not godly at all .
They ’d exploited a few causes that people felt passionately about , using them to con millions of voters .
It had nothing to do with God ’s will , only the will to power .
( [ 9 ] Florida : Creation House , 1995 .
Of note , the book wass a major " how to " guide for NAR churches , though a bit less so now due to Haggard 's outing as gay . )
In addition to finding out that the local dominionist churches were essentially doing political stumping disguised as sermons , he also made the unhappy discovery ( through his daughter , no less ) that Colorado Springs was considered the methamphetamine capital of Colorado ; even worse , around the time he left ( in 2007 ) a major scandal broke regarding a human - trafficking ring where Asian women were being kidnapped and forced to work as de facto indentured servants in massage parlors .
More to the point , his breaking point was , interestingly , the same as mine -- discovering that the moral crusaders were lying out their teeth :
During that season I also learned we ’d been lied to .
Contrary to the jeremiads of the Christian Right ’s propaganda industry , it was n’t " America 's godless , secular intelligentsia " who had removed the Bible and the knowledge of God from our educational system .
In reality , Christians themselves had caused it nearly 200 years ago .
By the 1820s , America ’s public schools were in a dilemma .
Calvinists wanted the schools to teach only Calvinism , but Arminians ( mostly Methodists ) wanted them to teach only their doctrines .
Several other sects were making demands of their own .
And all of them agreed that no matter which version of Christianity won out in the classrooms , it should never be Roman Catholicism , which they all abhorred with equal passion .
The endless infighting overwhelmed school authorities , who eventually gave up on the teaching of religion , substituting a vague , generic moral science in its place . [ 10 ]
The same thing goes for taking Bible reading out of public schools .
No , it was n’t a cabal of Secular Humanists in the early 1960s , but Christians themselves who brought it about , through viscous infighting between Protestants ( most of whom championed the King James Bible ) and Catholics who could only accept the Douay - Rheims translation .
Speaking of the " Bible Wars " in the mid-nineteenth century , Stephen Prothero writes , " The most visible battlefield in these early culture wars was Philadelphia , where Protestant - Catholic riots over whose Bible would be read in public schools left over a dozen people dead and Catholic churches burned to the ground in 1844 . " [ 11 ]
In addition to outright violence and murder , the endless polemical clashes between these groups caused school administrators to become weary and wary .
As a result , by the 1870s , public schools in many states had not only done away with Christian education , but Bible reading and hymn singing as well .
Contrary to what we ’d learned from the Christian Right , the rulings of 1962 and ’ 63 were merely the final few nails in the coffin — not the beginning of a cultural decline engineered by Secular Humanists .
. . .
Living in Colorado Springs and learning what I did there was like Neo swallowing the red pill .
I ’d seen the truth about The Matrix .
I could never go back ; life could n’t continue as it had before .
( [ 10 ] Stephen Prothero , Religious Literacy : What Every American Needs to Know — And Does n’t ( New York : HarperCollins , 2007 ) , pp. 109-120 .
[ 11 ] Ibid , pp. 121-127 . )
It was much the same with me -- finding out I was being lied to was the " red pill " that eventually led me to reality in the end .
And it is precisely this breeding of a Culture of Fear that causes thousands -- if not millions -- of children to be subjected to religiously motivated child abuse ; the same one that forces women to live under a system of religiously motivated patriarchy that places them at grave risk of religiously motivated spousal abuse ...
... and it can be said that the Fear Engine , at its core , and the hypermasculine bravado is the very engine running the dominionist movement .
Why is Lindsay Graham so pissy about the climate change bill being shelved ?
He 's been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform in the past , and he's one of these Country - First type Republicans , right ?
Why not just say , we 'll come back to climate change , and in the meantime , I 'll be all bipartisan and mavericky on immigration too ?
Why throw such a petulant little tantrum ?
I think ( and it 's speculation on my part , admittedly ) that Graham might be so upset because the Democrats are n't walking into the electoral trap he had set for them .
Let me explain .
Financial reform will take another month or two , most likely .
By the time the next issue takes center stage , it will be the dominant topic until the November elections .
So whatever it is , it 's going to redound to the benefit of whichever party can best play the issue for those months .
Let 's imagine what would happen if Graham got his way ...
He draws Democrats into the climate change debate by holding out the promise of a bipartisan victory .
The Senate commits themselves publicly to getting it done , making this the issue that will dominate heading into the elections .
Once the Senate starts debate , Graham announces that liberals have changed the proposals to the point where he can no longer support it .
Republican support evaporates , and here come the big guns .
From that day until November , the Republicans ( following a Luntz memo ) hammer their talking points :
This bill will raise energy costs .
It 's a big new tax .
It will crush the economy and destroy jobs .
You 'll pay more .
You 'll pay more .
You 'll pay more , goddammit !
Sure , Americans favor addressing climate change .
But those numbers are fickle once actual proposals hit the table .
And this is a debate that is already primed for demagoguery .
It will sap independent voter support .
With the unemployment rate still high and people still anxious , this is EXACTLY the debate Republicans want to have going into the midterms .
Hell , in the short term , they would n't even be wrong to say we 'll pay more .
Now , instead , the path Democrats seem poised to take :
One year ago ( when economic anxiety was higher than it is now , so these numbers may be even better today ) , a Pew Research poll found support for giving undocumented immigrants a legal path to citizenship had actually increased since Bush 's failed push .
A five - point jump overall put public support at 63 % .
Among independent voters , that number jumped three points to 61 % - a particularly encouraging number .
Even Republicans favored the proposal ( the bedrock of immigration reform ) at rates of about 50 % .
So how much better will it be for Democrats to have THIS debate from now until November ?
On one side , moderate reform proposals that look a lot like what McCain , Graham , and Bush once wanted .
On the other , McCain and Graham and all the Republicans stomping their feet and refusing to play ball .
Not to mention Tom Tancredo's fantasies of White America .
You want to take bets on how fast that partisan voter enthusiasm gap will close ?
Democrats are going to do this right , for once .
They 're going to split the GOP base from its moderates , they 're going to mobilize moderate and left - leaning independents , they 're going to energize their liberal base and the Hispanic voters in the South and West , and they 're going to highlight the racist Arizona law and the inevitable vitriol from Tancredo , Duncan Hunter , and Rush Limbaugh .
By the time November comes and goes , the GOP wo n't know what hit them .
I think Lindsay Graham knows this , and I think that 's why he 's so upset right now ...
Am I wrong ?
Japan : Mass protest against US base on Okinawa
By John Chan
29 April 2010
A rally of 90,000 people in Japanese prefecture of Okinawa on Sunday , protesting against the continued presence of a US Marine air base at Futenma , has heightened the political crisis facing the seven - month - old Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) government over the issue .
Having pledged during last year ’s election campaign to remove the base , Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has failed to reach a deal with the US .
The Obama administration is insisting that the DPJ abide by an agreement reached with the previous Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) government to shift the base , in modified form , to the less populated Henoko Bay , while transferring 7,000 marines to Guam .
Sunday ’s demonstration in Yomitanson was the largest ever in Okinawa .
Protesters came from all 41 municipalities of the prefecture , decked out in yellow to show the government a “ yellow card ” — a warning .
Many more people dangled a yellow flag from car mirrors or wore a yellow scarf to show their support for the demonstration .
Nago mayor Susumu Inamine told the rally : “ Though [ Hatoyama ] pledged to relocate the air station outside Okinawa Prefecture , the government has been wavering on this issue .
There are even signs [ the government will proceed with the initial plan ] to relocate functions of the air station to the Henoko district .
These haphazard measures and the unscrupulous approach simply mock residents of the prefecture . ”
Inamine won the local election last year with the help of the Democrats by campaigning as an opponent of the US air base .
Even Okinawa governor Hirokazu Nakima , who is an LDP leader and accepted the 2006 deal , attended the rally and referred to the huge burden of the US military on local residents .
The extent of the protest reflects longstanding grievances over the huge US bases in Okinawa , which houses half of the 44,000 American military personnel in Japan .
Futenma base is situated in the densely populated area of Ginowan and another major base for US Air Force in Kadena is also located near residential area .
In addition to ammunition storages and training grounds , the US military is occupying nearly one fifth of the main Okinawa island .
Concerns about pollution , accidents and the economic impact are bound up with wider anti-militarist sentiments .
Okinawa played a significant role as a springboard for the US - led wars in Korea and Vietnam , provoking sustained demonstrations against the latter , and the US military presence , in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
The region remained under direct US administration until 1972 when protests forced its return to Japanese control .
Controversy flared again after the brutal rape of a young schoolgirl by US servicemen in 1995 .
During last year ’s election , the DPJ ’s promise to revise the 2006 agreement with the US on the Futenma base was part of broader efforts to make an anti-war appeal .
Hatoyama also pledged to expose secret deals between the US and Japanese governments to allow nuclear weapons into Japan and to end Japan ’s naval refuelling mission in support of the US - led occupation in Afghanistan .
While cautiously adopting a more independent foreign policy oriented to Asia , the DPJ government has been reluctant to jeopardise the US alliance , which has been the bedrock of Japanese foreign policy since World War II .
On taking office , Hatoyama immediately placed the 2006 agreement under review and has ignored US pressure to endorse the 2006 agreement .
He resisted US efforts to seal a deal before US President Obama visited Tokyo last November .
As a self - imposed May 31 deadline approaches , Hatoyama is running out of options .
Several alternatives , including moving some US air operations to Tokunoshima Island , north of Okinawa , have also met with protests from local residents .
However , Tokyo ’s relations with Washington already have been strained by the ending of its naval refuelling mission and revelations of secret Cold War agreements that allowed US warships carrying nuclear weapons to enter Japanese ports .
The US has refused to offer any significant concessions over the Futenma base .
Moreover , President Obama delivered Hatoyama what amounted to an ultimatum at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington earlier this month .
Allocating just 10 minutes for a meeting with the Japanese prime minister on April 12 , he bluntly told Hatoyama that Tokyo was running out of time .
“ Japanese officials were so taken aback by the toughness of Obama ’s tone that they did not draw up a written record of the words exchanged between the two leaders , ” the Washington Post reported .
A day later , the Japanese government appears to have played up the military threat from China in a bid to change the public mood .
Media reports began appearing about a routine Chinese naval exercise in international waters about 140 kilometres from the main island of Okinawa .
Japan sent destroyers and planes for close surveillance and published photos of Chinese warships .
The foreign ministry issued a diplomatic protest over Chinese helicopters flying “ dangerously ” close to Japanese warships .
However , the scare campaign had no impact on the mass opposition to the US base in Okinawa .
On the contrary , signs that Hatoyama may break his promise to move the US base out of the prefecture have only prompted public outrage .
The Washington Post reported last Saturday that US officials were “ pleased ” by a Japanese proposal last week to “ broadly accept ” the 2006 agreement .
Based on unnamed sources , the article stated that Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada had presented a plan to US ambassador John Roos that included relocating the air base to Henoko , with some modifications .
Hatoyama insisted the report was “ not necessarily true ” .
He reiterated that he would not accept the old deal , but did not rule out a modified version .
US assistant secretary of state Kurt Campbell , who is visiting Tokyo this week , told the Asahi Shimbun on Tuesday that Washington had received “ serious proposals from the Japanese government that included promising elements ” .
Following the visit , Hatoyama indicated that he was considering a proposal , but gave no details .
Public support for the Hatoyama government has dropped sharply since it came to office last September and failed to address public concern over falling living standards .
A poll published by Nikkei newspaper on Monday following the Okinawa protest showed only 24 percent of respondents supported Hatoyama , down from 36 percent in March and 70 percent in September .
Only 20 percent said they would vote for the DPJ in upper house elections in July — still ahead of the 14 percent for the LDP .
If Hatoyama does cave in to US demands , support is likely to fall further , compounding the crisis that faces not only his government , but the political establishment as a whole .

A jury will soon determine whether the talk - show maven defamed Mzamane .
In 2007 , a group of students at Winfrey ’s school accused dorm parents of sexual abuse .
Winfrey was intimately involved with the school and met with Mzamane , who was soon put on administrative leave pending an investigation .
At the time , Winfrey released a public statement saying that “ ( n ) othing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy .
I will do everything in my power to ensure their safety and well - being . ”
Later , Winfrey said she had “ lost confidence in ( Mzamane ’s ) ability to run this school .
And therefore , she will not be returning to this school . ”
Mzamane sued for defamation , false light and infliction of emotional distress .
Winfrey then sought to have these claims dismissed on summary judgment .
But on Monday , in a 126 - page decision , a Pennsylvania district court allowed the defamation and false light claims to go to trial , ruling there ’s “ sufficient evidence in the record to satisfy the clear and convincing evidence standard for actual malice . ”
Being associated with Oprah Winfrey has pluses and minuses , legally speaking .
On one hand , the judge found Mzamane to be a limited public figure largely on the basis of her involvement with Winfrey , which means a much higher burden for proving a defamation claim .
On the other , the judge seems to acknowledge the extraordinary power that Winfrey yields over the minds of the public .
“ The criticism of Plaintiff ’s job performance emanating from Winfrey , when received by the average listener , implies the existence of some undisclosed facts since it is reasonable to presume that Winfrey , as Plaintiff ’s superior , would be knowledgeable as to the substance of Plaintiff ’s job performance . ”
Winfrey ’s lawyers tried to present her statements as opinion , but the judge believes that without extreme discretion , she ’s being reckless .
The thing about doormen is , often they were doing completely unrelated work , like selling survival gear or bagging pork chops , when something random happened and suddenly they were doormen , tipping their caps and announcing that the in - laws were on the way up with a fruitcake .
And then they stay doormen forever , standing spraddled outside the door , their backs straight as furled umbrellas .
This comes up because it was very nearly a doorman - free city on Wednesday , contract wrangling threatening to put doormen on the picket lines .
At the last minute , though , things got hashed out and they were on duty as usual in their showy uniforms , twisting doorknobs and accepting meat deliveries .
Like sentries , doormen have patrolled New York ’s apartment buildings for some 150 years .
Roughly 10,000 union doormen work in 3,200 apartment buildings in the city .
Even though they are as familiar a species as cabdrivers and nannies , and even though they know plenty about the people who inhabit their buildings , relatively little is known about them .
China is hardly the world ’s only Internet censor .
While the Great Fire Wall is known to censor thousands of Web sites and searches on Google , many other governments have requested the California - based search giant remove content or hand over user data .
According to information released April 20 , which excludes China and several other countries , Brazil and the US lead the world in the number of requests for user data and for the removal of content .
In an effort to bring transparency to censorship , and apparently also to push back against critics , Google ’s new interactive world map shows country - by - country data requests and removal requests received between July 1 , 2009 , and Dec. 31 , 2009 .
“ Government censorship of the web is growing rapidly : from the outright blocking and filtering of sites , to court orders limiting access to information and legislation forcing companies to self - censor content , ” Chief Legal Officer David Drummond wrote on the official Google blog .
The map measures requests for removal of data such as alleged defamation , hate speech , and impersonation .
It also shows Google ’s compliance rate on removal requests and a breakdown of which Google - owned sites , like Blogger , Adwords , and YouTube , have contained the most removed information .
In the US , for instance , Google received 123 requests to remove material from its services during the last half of 2009 and complied with 80 percent of them .
Information on China ’s censorship is unavailable and regarded as a state secret and countries associated with internet censorship — such as Vietnam and Cuba — do not appear because the analysis did not track the use of filters to block online content .
“ There are limits to what this data can tell us , ” Google wrote in an FAQ , explaining that some requests pertain to multiple pieces of content , or multiple requests might pertain to the same piece of content .
The data does not include government requests for removal of copyrighted content or for the removal of pornography , which Google says it censors on its own .
The report also does n’t indicate whether Google complied with or challenged any requests .
But it does throw a spotlight on governments when Google itself has come under fire for privacy breaches .
On April 19 , Canada ’s privacy commissioner sent an open letter to Google 's CEO , Eric Schmidt , signed by the privacy heads of nine other countries ( France , Germany , Israel , Italy , Ireland , Netherlands , New Zealand , Spain and the United Kingdom ) to express their concern about privacy issues related to Google Buzz and Google Street View .
" We are increasingly concerned that , too often , the privacy rights of the world ’s citizens are being forgotten as Google rolls out new technological applications , " the letter states , according to a copy on the Canadian government 's Web site .
" We were disturbed by your recent rollout of the Google Buzz social networking application , which betrayed a disappointing disregard for fundamental privacy norms and laws .
Moreover , this was not the first time you have failed to take adequate account of privacy considerations when launching new services . "
The very next day , Google released data on government requests for user data and removal of content .
The Top 10
10 . Argentina :
The government of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner made 98 data requests during the latter half of 2009 .
Google complied with nearly 90 percent of the government ’s 42 removal requests , most of which stemmed from court orders .
9. Australia : Officials from Down Under appeared to take positively the news that Australia made only 17 data removal requests and 155 data requests .
Geordie Guy , an internet freedom activist , said the figure was smaller than expected .
" These types of requests can come in a variety of formats – some of them can be information pertinent to criminal investigations , some of them might be requirements to remove information under Australia 's content classification and censorship systems , " he told the Australian news agency ABC News .
According to a recent BBC poll , 53 percent of Australians disagree with the assertion that governments should have no role in regulating the Internet .
8. Spain : Madrid made 324 data requests , and Google complied with about half of its 32 removal requests .
Spain is considering enacting filtering policies , according to a January report from the OpenNet Initiative .
7. Germany : After Brazil , the most requests to edit material came from Germany , at 188 .
The country also made 458 data requests .
The country has laws that restrict the online display of content connected to the Nazi regime .
The government has requested the removal of a number of web sites that deny the Holocaust , which is a felony under German law .
The government has also censored Wikipedia .
6 . Italy : Rome made 550 data requests , and Google partially or fully complied with about three - quarters of Italy ’s 57 removal requests .
In February , an Italian court gave guilty verdicts to three Google executives for not blocking a video that made fun of a child with Down syndrome .
The ruling “ sets an extremely dangerous precedent that threatens free expression and chills innovation on the global internet , ” Leslie Harris , the president of the Center for Democracy and Technology , then said .
5 France : Paris made 846 data requests but fewer than 10 removal requests .
President Nicolas Sarkozy has struck a hard line on Internet issues , and in February , the lower house of the French parliament approved a draft bill that would allow the state unprecedented control over the Internet , causing civil rights activists to decry increased censorship and surveillance .
The new legislation would also allow police and security to spy on private computers , according to Der Spiegel .
4. India : Google received 1,061 data requests and 142 removal requests from India , whose estimated 48 million users makes up the fifth largest Internet community in the world .
In India , according to the web monitor Open Net , “ targeted censorship around issues of political and social conflict is a reality , particularly in areas of unrest .
With the political turmoil present in the continuing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as well as fighting between religious groups , and issues between castes , the state takes an interest in censoring offensive material that could induce violence . ”
3. United Kingdom : Gordon Brown 's government leads Europe on Google ’s Internet censorship list .
As in the US , intelligence gathering seems the primary reason for London ’s interference with Google , as the United Kingdom made 1,166 data requests – the third highest – and 59 removal requests , primarily related to YouTube .
Restrictions on terrorism - related content , according to Freedom House 's Internet Freedom Program , have in some instances caused the removal of information that was potentially beneficial to the public .
Extensive surveillance is also a concern .
2. United States : Google complied with 80 percent of the American government ’s 123 requests for data removal , which mostly focused on YouTube , The US made a whopping 3,580 data requests in the last half of 2009 .
While Google has in the past gone to court to prevent the US Justice Department from getting broad lists of people 's search requests , the Pentagon sees user information as important in cracking down on militant groups that are increasingly using the Internet to streamline their recruiting and training .
1. Brazil : The South American industrial giant made the most requests for both user content and data removal .
Brazil 's 3,663 data requests and 291 removal requests ( primarily associated with the social networking site Orkut ) underscores Brasília 's restriction of free speech .
Like Germany , Brazilian legislation restricts publications considered racist ( such as neo- nazi sites ) .
The government has also banned electoral campaigns from using such tools as Orkut , YouTube , e-mail , and SMS to circulate their political messages , according to Freedom House 's Internet Freedom Program .

Synopsis
Dr. Elmer Towns - , March 23 , 2009
Biblical Scholar Review : Are Your Children Playing With Lucifer 's Testicles ? | The Truth About Easter Eggs
" Go out and buy this book before Easter !
Be sure to have two bars of soap and a burlap sack close by after chapter 14 !
It helped immensely and I am forever indebted to Pastor Sumner Wemp for advising me beforehand . "
Pastor Jon Falwell - , March 25 , 2009
Pastor 's Review : Are Your Children Playing With Lucifer 's Testicles ? | The Truth About Easter Eggs
" You will never look at eggs in the same way again .
The shocking truth is so horrifying , and at the same time so completely obvious , I feel like a fool for not seeing it before !
Thank you Dr. Cameroon !
You are at the cutting edge of Creation Research ! "
Pastor Deacon Fred- , March 25 , 2002
Author 's Review : Are Your Children Playing With Lucifer 's Testicles ? | The Truth About Easter Eggs
" Dr. Cameroon 's book calls us to testify with careful consideration for the fragile unsaved minds that surround us !
The evidence is there , and thank you for traveling to the caves of Kenya to brave the dangerous coloreds in that region !
Daniel 's book should be mandatory reading for every Baptist parent in our Christian Nation !
It demands a full cleansing in every home of ALL evidence of Easter eggs , Easter egg paint , and rounded dippers .
I sent two of my grandchildren to the Landover Baptist Memorial Hospital before even reaching Chapter 7 , and if you are a True Christian™ , who loves the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart , and who cares about your family , you will do the same ! "
An estimated 122 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) ( mean estimate ) of undiscovered , technically recoverable natural gas are in the Levant Basin Province , located in the Eastern Mediterranean region .
Technically recoverable resources are those producible using currently available technology and industry practices .
This is the first U.S. Geological Survey assessment of this basin to identify potentially extractable resources .
" The Levant Basin Province is comparable to some of the other large provinces around the world and its gas resources are bigger than anything we have assessed in the United States , " said USGS Energy Resources Program Coordinator Brenda Pierce .
" This assessment furthers our understanding of the world 's energy potential , helping inform policy and decision makers in making decisions about future energy supplies . "
Natural gas is used for a variety of purposes , primarily for electricity generation , industrial , residential , and commercial sectors .
Worldwide consumption and production of natural gas was 110 tcf in 2008 , according to the Energy Information Administration .
The three largest consuming countries were the United States with 23 tcf , Russia with 17 tcf , and Iran with 4 tcf of natural gas per year in 2008 .
Russia 's West Siberian Basin is another large natural gas province with an estimated 643 tcf .
The Middle East and North Africa region also has several large provinces , which include the Rub Al Khali Basin with 426 tcf , the Greater Ghawar Uplift with 227 tcf , and the Zagros Fold Belt with 212 tcf .
Some natural gas accumulations in the United States include the Southwestern Wyoming Province with an estimated 85 tcf , the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Province with 73 tcf , and the Appalachian Basin Province of the eastern United States and the Western Gulf Basin Province of Texas and Louisiana , each with 70 tcf .
All of these estimates are mean estimates of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas resources .
The Levant Basin Province also holds an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of undiscovered , technically recoverable oil .
Worldwide consumption of petroleum was about 31 billion barrels in 2008 .
###
The USGS conducted this assessment as part of a program directed at estimating the undiscovered , technically recoverable oil and gas resources of priority petroleum basins around the world .

Childhood Nightmares and Fears Photography – Joshua Hoffine
The strength and sophistication of children ’s fears is limited only by children ’s imagination , which is known to be very rich .

On Feb. 20 , four Muslim women took a conspicuous step to protest gender segregation in Muslim mosques by refusing to relegate themselves to a cordoned - off prayer zone for women — which one of them ruefully called the “ penalty box ” — and instead worshiped with the men at the Islamic Center of Washington , D.C.
Their presence did not go unnoticed .
–KA
The Daily Beast :
Defiantly , they continued to pray behind a row of men at the front of the mosque , when their numbers unexpectedly quadrupled .
A tour group of about 100 Muslims , including about 30 women , from Hagerstown , Maryland , had hurriedly entered after the prayer had already began , unsuspectingly joining the protesters .
But the mood shifted when mosque officials called the cops .

Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) --
The game begins with a teenage girl on a subway platform .
She notices you are looking at her and asks , " Can I help you with something ? "
That is when you , the player , can choose your method of assault .
With the click of your mouse , you can grope her and lift her skirt .
Then you can follow her aboard the train , assaulting her sister and her mother .
As you continue to play , " friends " join in and in a series of graphic , interactive scenes , you can corner the women , rape them again and again .
The game allows you to even impregnate a girl and urge her to have an abortion .
The reason behind your assault , explains the game , is that the teenage girl has accused you of molesting her on the train .
The motive is revenge .
When does a video game go too far ?
It is little wonder that the game , titled RapeLay , sparked international outrage from women 's groups .
Taina Bien - Aime helped yank the game off store shelves worldwide .
" This was a game that had absolutely no place on the market , " said Taina Bien - Aime of women 's rights organization Equality Now which has campaigned for the game to be taken off the shelves .
But the controversy that led to stopping sales of the game instead took it viral .
That was how Lucy Kibble and Jim Gardner in Britain heard about it .
" I think the idea that you can do it by wholesale banning is just never going to work anyway because we downloaded it for free off the Internet , " Gardner said .
In the case of RapeLay , he was right .
It is still readily available on dozens of Web sites , sometimes for free .
What happened to RapeLay is an example , said Bien - Aime , of why Japan needs to police game makers .
" It 's obviously very difficult to curtail activity on the Internet .
But the governments do have a role in trying to regulate this sort of extreme pornography of children , both in their countries , and through the Internet , " she said , adding that they were calling for the Japanese government " to ban all games that promote and simulate sexual violence , sexual torture , stalking and rape against women and girls .
And there are plenty of games like that . "
Those games are known as " hentai games . "
Almost all feature girlish - looking characters .
Some of the games are violent -- depicting rape , torture and bondage in detail .
Step into a game shop in Akihabara , Japan 's electronics district , and hentai games are readily available .
In minutes , we found a game similar to RapeLay .
The object here is also revenge : Find and rape the woman who fired the player from his imaginary job .
Along the way , the player can rape a number of other girls and women .
Hentai games are not new to Japan .
This country has long produced products the rest of the world would call pornographic .
But before the arrival of the Internet , such items stayed in Japan .
Now , once a game goes on sale in Tokyo , it is digitized and shared everywhere .
Japan does have censorship laws for sexual content .
In games and videos , genitalia are obscured , even if it is animated .
But Japan 's laws do not restrict the themes and ideas of the games .
A national law that would make possession of real and virtual images of child porn illegal is under discussion , but no serious legislation has moved forward in Japan 's parliament .
CNN contacted the Gender Equality Promotion Division in the Gender Equality Bureau of Japan 's Cabinet Office , which is charged with handling the hentai gaming issue .
Despite repeated calls over a period of weeks , no representative from the government office would comment to CNN on camera .
The office refused to make a statement on paper .
A spokeswoman would only say over the telephone that the Japanese government was aware that the games were a problem and it was checking to see if self - policing by the gaming industry was enough .
A member of the Institute of Contents Culture , who did not want to give CNN his name , said restricting game themes limits freedom of expression .
" In my opinion , RapeLay 's storyline went too far .
However , if a game creator wants to express something and create content out of it , a government or public entity should n't have the power to restrain it . "
Lucy Kibble and Jim Gardner , the gamers in Britain , said trying to control games on the Internet was futile and that content control was up to parents .
" The idea of banning it , or telling people what they can and can't do just because on the off chance some kid might get involved with it is just ridiculous , " said Gardner .
Some dads find childcare more rewarding than going to work
The number of stay - at - home fathers in the UK has risen 10 - fold in the last decade , a survey suggests .
The results of the survey of 1,000 parents suggest around 6 % of fathers , or 600,000 men , are now their child 's primary carer , up from 60,000 in 2000 .
The majority of stay - at - home fathers quizzed said the reason for this was because the mother earned more money .
The web survey for insurance firm Aviva said the mother earned more in one in six of all the households it surveyed .
Men [ are ] becoming aware that they have n't had it all ... in their relationship with their children they 've had less contact
Adrienne Burgess , the Fatherhood Institute
The figures also suggested 18 % of couples shared childcare responsibilities equally .
Adrienne Burgess , research director at the Fatherhood Institute , said the findings showed men wanted to spend " more time " at home .
" It just is n't the same [ now ] , there are more women in higher education and are starting to earn quite a lot , " she said .
She acknowledged rising childcare costs mean some parents are forced to give up work , but said some men also want a closer relationship with their family .
Happy fathers " Men want to spend more time with their children , men [ are ] becoming aware that they have n't had it all , " she said .
" In their relationship with their children they 've had less contact than the mother . "
The study suggested the men that stayed at home were happier with this arrangement than the women , with 75 % of fathers saying they were lucky to spend so much time with their children .
Nearly a third of fathers also said they found childcare more rewarding than going to work , but 10 % admitted running around after their sons and daughters made them feel less of a man .
In more than two - thirds of households surveyed , one parent had reduced their hours or given up work completely in order to look after their family , with a third saying they did so because of childcare costs .
Some women found the role reversal difficult , with 37 % admitting they felt guilty going out to work and leaving their children , but only 9 % said they would swap places with their partner and stay at home .
Louise Colley , from Aviva , said : " While both roles are equally valuable , nowadays it 's quite likely that women will be heading off to the office while men are changing nappies and doing the school run . "

Police are attempting to identify a female pedestrian killed after being struck by a car south - east of Brisbane this morning .
The woman was hit near the corner of Finucane and McDonald roads in Alexandra Hills about 5.10 am , a Department of Community Safety spokeswoman said .
Emergency crews performed CPR on the woman but she died at the scene .
Police are appealing to the public to help identify the victim .
She is described as Caucasian , aged in her 40’s , about 160 centimetres tall , with a large build , brown eyes and blonde hair at the front and dark hair at the back .
She has a dragon tattoo on the left side of her chest and a brown birth mark on her right abdomen and was wearing blue jeans and a floral top , police said .
Recently I stumbled over an exercise in the very interesting book C++ Template Metaprogramming .
The challenge of the exercise is to make something like the following compile and do what you expect :
cout << PrintType<int const * const**&>( ) << endl ;
Note that we cannot use typeid , as typeid ( T ) .name ( ) is not required to print anything meaningful , and in practice does n’t .
As long as we do n’t support function pointers , the problem from above can be solved rather easily using template specializations , although it requires quite some typing :
#ifndef HH_PRINT_TYPE
#define HH_PRINT_TYPE
#include < ostream > # include < boost/tr1/type_traits.hpp > # include < boost/lexical_cast.hpp > namespace mine { template < class T_ > struct PrintType { //
Never used directly .
} ; /** *

* * Could be enhanced by using type_traits .
*/ template < class T_ > std::ostream& operator <<( std : :ostream& os , PrintType < T_ >) { os << " T " ; return os ; } ; /** * For void . */ template <> std::ostream& operator <<( std : :ostream& os , PrintType<void >) { os << " void " ; return os ; } ; /** * For int. */ template <> std::ostream& operator <<( std : : ostream& os , PrintType<int >) { os << " int " ; return os ; } ; /** * For char . */ template <> std::ostream& operator <<( std : : ostream& os , PrintType< char >) { os << " char " ; return os ; } ; /** * For const qualified types .
*/ template < class T_> std::ostream& operator <<( std : : ostream& os , PrintType < T_ const >) { os << PrintType<T_ >( ) << " const " ; return os ; } ; /** * For volatile qualified types .

*/ template < std::size_t SizeP_ , class T_ > std::string printDimensions ( PrintType<T_[ SizeP_ ] >) { return " [ " + boost::lexical_cast<std::string >( SizeP_ ) + " ] " + printDimensions ( PrintType<T_ >( ) ) ; } /** * Ends the recursion started by printDimensions ( PrintType < T_[ SizeP_ ] > ) .
*/ template < class T_> std::string printDimensions ( PrintType<T_ > ) { return " " ; } /** * For arrays .
*/ template < std::size_t SizeP_ , class T_ > std::ostream& operator <<( std::ostream& os , PrintType < T_[ SizeP_ ] >) { os << PrintType<typename std::tr1::remove_all_extents<T_>::type >( ) << printDimensions ( PrintType<T_[ SizeP_ ] >( ) ) ; return os ; } /** * For const arrays .
*/ template < std::size_t SizeP_ , class T_ > std::ostream& operator <<( std :: ostream& os , PrintType<const T_[ SizeP_ ] >) { os << " const " << PrintType <T_[ SizeP_ ] >( ) ; return os ; } /** * For volatile arrays .
*/ template < std::size_t SizeP_ , class T_ > std::ostream& operator <<( std : : ostream& os , PrintType<volatile T_[ SizeP_ ] > ) { os << " volatile " << PrintType <T_[ SizeP_ ] >( ) ; return os ; } /** * For const volatile arrays .
*/ template < std::size_t SizeP_ , class T_> std::ostream& operator <<( std::ostream& os , PrintType< const volatile T_[ SizeP_ ] > ) { os << " const volatile " << PrintType <T_[ SizeP_ ] >( ) ; return os ; } } #endif
Of course , we are still missing quite a few full specializations but adding them is trivial .
In fact , the only part of the code above that is slightly tricky is the part between line 120 and 147 , that supports pretty - printing of potentially multi dimensional arrays .
Also note the explicit overloads for const volatile at lines 80 and 172 .
Without them we would get ambiguity errors if trying to pretty print a type that is qualified as such .
While this is all very nice and impressive , the code above still fails us miserably if we do something like
cout << mine :: PrintType<int ( int , char , void * ) >( ) << endl ;
or even
cout << mine :: PrintType<int( SomeClass ::*) ( int , char , void* , ... ) >( ) << endl ;
as we did n’t yet add support for function pointers .
We can of course fix this by adding more specializations , but as functions can take a nearly arbitrary number of arguments ( the C++0x Final Committee Draft suggests implementations to support at least 256 ) , doing this in C++03 would be a rather unpleasant experience .
Using C++0 x variadic templates on the other hand side , supporting function types is not a big deal ( as soon as one understands how variadic templates work ;-) ) :
#ifdef __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__
//<-- set by gcc for ' - std=c++0 x ' .

Last but not least :
Feel free to come up with suggestions or comments .
You can imagine my surprise after I paid my 50 pence to use the public bathroom , walked in and found myself staring at not just one but three ceiling mounted video surveillance cameras .
I had to get real close to their enclosures to convince myself that I was n't seeing things .
Not only was it really there , but it was a Pan - Tilt - Zoom model with a microphone to top it off .
Must get some great noises coming from there .
It has also been reported that London officials are now installing cameras with speakers to allow them to talk as well as see and listen .
Perhaps its just me , but I had absolutely no idea that this was legal anywhere , let alone in downtown London , UK .
Sure I knew that London has more cameras per square mile than any other country on the planet , but in bathrooms ?!
How are they getting away with that one ?
It is appalling !
10 cutting - edge spy gadgets According to the London Assembly of Liberal Democrats , London has been outfitted with over 500,000 surveillance cameras .
Other put the number much higher at 1.4 million cameras but nobody is telling what the real number is .
Another few 10,000 cameras have been installed in taxis and police cars as well .
Sounds a bit big brother to me folks , downright scary in fact .
Now it gets scarier when you consider that the vast majority of these camera feeds are not sent encrypted across the wire .
This makes hacking these video feeds trivial , just a simple wire tap .
Here 's a scenario , I wake up , walk out of my hotel room and see a camera in the hallway watching me .
I get into the elevator and look up to smile at the camera there , I walk through the lobby and out to the street .
Along the way half a dozen cameras watched me walk less than 200 ft .
I get in my cab and the camera in there watches me all the way to my destination .
I walk into the building followed by 4 cameras .
I use the public restroom , 3 cameras watch me in there .
I head up the elevator to my office on the 2nd floor and smile at the camera there .
I walk down the hall to my office while under surveillance the whole way .
I close my office glass door .
Turns out the camera in the building has a vantage angle through my glass door and the outside camera on the opposite street corner pole has a clean shot into my office through the windows .
I 'm feeling a lot of love right now .
So I logon to the internet and start surfing .
Hmmm .
Now I guess they are watching physical me and virtual me at the same time as they inspect the bits and bytes I send ripping around the network .
Just in the last couple years , U.S. cities ( like my hometown of Denver ) have begun installing their own public video surveillance systems in a big way .
Now I need to check and see if U.S. cities are also watching you in the public bathroom .
Credit card skimming :
How thieves steal your card info without you knowing
Here is a shot I took in a London public bathroom .
Notice the two cameras on the ceiling .
Another one was behind me on the other wall facing towards these cameras .
They had all of the angles covered that ’s for sure .
Do n't want to miss any of the action .

With the engines providing only 40 horsepower , the plane will fly almost like a scooter in the sky , at an average flight speed of 44mph .
The trip will be split up into five stages – keeping the plane in the air for up to five days at a time – with the stopovers also allowing the team to show off their creation .
Epic , though not the best play from either players ( especially the winner ) and the game drags on a bit too much at the end .
Match Point has been one of the most mined out maps this season .

What do you think of the coaches ' decision to send Hoejja and Light in the opening set ?
FakeSteve : Wow , I 'm very surprised with KT 's choice .
fOrGG shoulda been their starter , they 're down 0 - 1 right off the bat now .
I suppose in the end it does n't really matter , what will end up happening is MBC getting four cracks at Flash .
None of the other players on KT 's roster matter in the slightest , but fOrGG definitely should have started for KT .

Do you think KT will finaly break the 2nd place jinx , or MBC will deny them the gold yet again ?
Who can stop Flash ?
FakeSteve : Nope , KT is fucked .
Someone 's gonna beat Flash tonight , someone named Sea[ Shield ] .
It 's the playoffs baby , you can't stop MBC !
Jinxes do n't exist anyway , it'd be shameful for KT fans to hide behind it after their team gets decimated tonight .

FakeSteve :
Set 1 : HoeJJa < Judgment Day >
Light
No question here .
How the fuck is HoeJJa going to beat Light ?
It 's not gonna happen .
I think HoeJJa is pretty cool to be honest , but he is massively outclassed here .
Set 2 : Stats < Match Point >
Light
KT will send a protoss , but since all their Protoss players are just awful , Light 's gonna win this one too .
Set 3 : fOrGG < New Tornado >
Light
This should have been set 1 , but whatever .
They 'll try to send out fOrGG to kill Light before they send Flash .
Obviously they 'll keep Flash as their ace player , but Light 's gonna reach 3 kills tonight .
Set 4 : Flash < Fighting Spirit >
Light
Light has a good shot at taking this match .
However , it 's still just a " good shot " .
I like the way Flash plays on Fighting Spirit , and the TvT games I 've seen Light play here have so far been uninspiring , despite being fundamentally sound .
While an all - kill is n't outside the realm of possibility , it does n't seem likely , so I 'm giving this match to Flash .
Set 5 : Flash < Neo Moon Glaive > Sea[ Shield ]
No one is going to beat Sea [ Shield ] on Moon Glaive tonight .
NO ONE .
This match is fucking OVER !
Set 6 : KT Fans ' Hopes < Roadrunner > Sea[ Shield ]
Set 7 : KT Fans ' Dreams < Judgment Day > Sea[ Shield ]
Do you think we are in the twilight of the professional SC : BW scene ?
Are we ready to switch to SC2 or does the old game have something more to offer ?
FakeSteve :
The professional StarCraft circuit is a business like any other , and let me tell you , dollars do n't give a fuck about StarCraft 2 .
StarCraft in Korea will be around until the money stops , and with Korean Air sponsoring OSL , that does n't look like it 'll happen anytime soon .
Nonkorean competition for Brood War has been relatively dead outside of TSL for years , nothing new here .
We can't enter another era of true bonjwa and just ditch it all for a flashy new girlfriend !
I mean video game .
My shrink says that 's really unhealthy and I need to take these pills to make it go away but I 'M NOT TAKING THEM because who trusts doctors ?!

After WL we are back to the conventional PL format for 2 more rounds .
Make your longterm predictions : which teams will make it to the final 6 ?
FakeSteve : Top 6 with the other format will be KT , T1 , MBC , Oz , STX , and Hite .
I have no idea what order they 'll be in , but those will be the top 6 .
Believe it !
Sorry CJ whom I love dearly !

KT fans seem to get a lot of confidence recently because of Flash 's performance .
What do you have to say to them ?
FakeSteve :
To all KT fans :
You are scum .
Especially MrHoon , who I heard was far too scared of me to ever take part in an interview .
He knows I 'd just SHRED him .
To all Flash fans :
You have exquisite taste in Terran players and are probably very successful IRL and also a hunky gentleman , but you are going DOWN .
I look forward to tomorrow when Flash fans and Sea[ Shield ] fans can once again live in harmony .

Last words ?
FakeSteve : I 'll have last words if MBC loses , because I 'm going to kill myself if that happens .
My last words , in that case , would probably be like " HURGHGGHKKK !!!! " or whatever sound I make when I drive the dagger into my own heart .

Too easy , Flash / Luxury / Forgg are going to be given a day off as Stats rapes MBC .
But in all honesty it ’ll come down to being Flash vs Light in one of the middle sets and the winner of that match will go onto win it for their team , seeing how badly Flash crushed light last time it should n’t be a problem for him to do it again .

In the past KTF were similar to Real Madrid - having a lineup full of superstar players .
Now though , besides Flash , the current KT lineup consists of young homegrown talents like Violet and Hoejja .
Do you miss the old KTF or you prefer " the new one " instead ?
Scaramanga :
It ’s hard to say , I came into progaming around the time flash won the GSI so I did n’t see too much of Yellow / Reach / Ra but what I saw was so amazingly awesome .
I love the new players that have come through for rolster but they are so frustratingly inconsistent so I ’d have to say I miss KTF .

As for the top six , the way CJ or Wemade have been playing they are likely to slip out of the top six and allow Stars to come up , if Hwaseung decide to stop sucking they have a chance to make it back into the top six but I do n’t see it happening .

Do you have something to say to them , or to the other MBC fans out there ?

Chances are that all the MBC players and the coach will quit playing sc forever because of the demoralizing embarrassment they ’ll get from this .

Young men who have better cardiovascular fitness also have higher cognitive function and perform better in educational settings , according to a study conducted by researchers from Gothenburg University in Sweden .
" Our data demonstrate that cardiovascular fitness and cognitive performance at age 18 are positively associated , " researcher Maria Aberg said .
" Change in physical achievement between ages 15 and 18 predicted cognitive performance at age 18 .
" Researchers collected data on all 1,221,727 male Swedes who had been born between 1950 and 1976 and joined the military at age 18 .
Heart rate had been measured on a stationary bicycle .
While the researchers found no correlation between muscular strength and mental fitness , they found that men with the healthiest heart rate also performed best on tests of intelligence and cognition .
" Moreover , cardiovascular fitness during early adulthood predicted socioeconomic status and educational attainment later in life , " Aberg said .
" To our knowledge , this is the first study to demonstrate a clear positive association between cardiovascular fitness and cognitive performance in a large population of young adults .
" Prior research has shown that both children and older adults who are more physically fit perform better on cognitive tests .
Yet findings on young adults have been inconclusive .
Researchers believe that physical exercise improves the health of a young adult 's developing brain , particularly improving its ability to adapt to new situations or recover from injury -- a characteristic known as " plasticity . " " These results have implications for the influence of exercise on plasticity .
In animal studies , a number of mechanisms have been shown to play a role in exercise - induced cognition and memory improvements , " Aberg said .
" These results support the notion promoting physical exercise could serve as a public health strategy to optimize educational achievement .
" Another recent study , conducted by researchers from Germany 's Saarland University and published in the journal , found that the exercise led to less chromosome damage and longer cell life .

news Swallows and New School Go to College
College Street ’s Alexandrina block : the future home of “ Of Swallows , Their Deeds , & the Winter Below ” and the Toronto New School of Writing .
Photo by Remi Carreiro / Torontoist .
Coming out of a year that saw one long - standing institution buried and another putting out a last - ditch S.O.S. , you ’d be crazy to get into the independent bookselling business in Toronto right now .
Jason Rovito is opening a bookstore at College and Spadina .
He is n’t crazy , but he does have a crazy - beautiful vision — one that ’s either off - the - hook whimsical or firmly pragmatic .
Recognizing that economic conditions make it near - impossible to just sell books , Rovito is creating a many - hat - wearing studio in which space rental and partnerships sustain a bookstore while also allowing different imprints of Toronto ’s indie - lit scene to play and piggy - back off of one another .
The space ’s lovely sounding but quirky moniker —
Of Swallows , Their Deeds , & the Winter Below , or 283 College — rambles just enough to suit the fluid , discursive project .
The first renter to stake out some collaborative square footage at 283 College is the much - anticipated Toronto New School of Writing .
Founded by Jay MillAr and Jenny Sampirisi — also the faces behind the publisher BookThug — the TNSoW picks up in the space between where academic leaves off and marketable begins .
Their intriguing first slate of writing and close - reading courses delve into pockets of avant - garde Canadian writing ( yeah , it does exist ) most often ignored by literary juries and annexed to the academy .
Rovito , who is a doctoral candidate in a joint York - Ryerson program , is also one of the founders of LOT : Experiments in Urban Research , one of the collaborating forces behind last summer ’s popular Leona Drive Project .
Through his work with LOT , Rovito has also been a co-editor of an issue of the art and culture journal Public , another project that will be sharing the 283 College space .
If you think you ’re hearing a lot of “ collective ” this and “ collaboration ” that , you ’re not wrong .
When you start to unpack the machinery behind what ’s coming at 283 College , you find a tangled web of people regularly working and playing together .
We think that ’s what you a call a community .
It ’s high time they had a space to call their own .
Of Swallows , Their Deeds , & the Winter Below opens its doors March 1 .
The Toronto New School of Writing ’s spring courses are currently open for registration .
If you thought Red Dead Redemption 's single - player looked exciting , wait until you get a load of the extensive free - roaming multiplayer Rockstar has cooked up .
Posse up !
I loved the free play multiplayer mode in Grand Theft Auto , and Red Dead Redemption 's Free Roam multiplayer is a lot like that at its core .
You and a bunch of other cowboys , riding the range .
But instead of being a standalone game mode , all other multiplayer activities are tied into this Free Roam multiplayer .
Form a posse and go hunting , or participate in team deathmatch shootouts , or just ride around , looking at the pretty scenery .
It 's all up to you .

That 's the sort of freedom I can get behind .
That 's the sort of multiplayer that pushes Red Dead Redemption past a ' must buy ' to a ... I do n't know , a ' really must buy ' , in my book at least .
Browser - obsessed netbooks running Google 's Chrome operating system will be the freshest thing to hit computing in two decades , Eric Schmidt claims .
Speaking at the Atmosphere Cloud Computing Forum the Google CEO heralded the coming of " completely disposable " mobile devices running Chrome OS that boot up in two seconds and incorporate web - based storage , HTML5 for security , and combine input , communication , and data - sharing capabilities .
Chrome devices will be priced between $ 300 and $ 400 - in line with current netbooks - when they arrive later this year , Schmidt said .
Of course , price - setting is the province of the device makers .
But Schmidt noted that Chrome is free so there wo n't be a " software tax " .
Hardware vendors pay Microsoft a license for every device they make that runs Windows .
Schmidt appeared to rule out the idea that Google might one day bundle Chrome - based netbooks to customers of its web apps .
Mobile telcos are offering customers netbooks as part of their calling plans , which means the companies are making the money off the voice and data charges instead of selling the hardware .
" We are not in that business , " Schmidt said .
" We are in the ads and enterprise software business - I do n't think we 'll go that far . "
NCs , here we come !
For Schmidt , Chrome delivers the network computer dream articulated in 1995 by Oracle 's chief executive Larry Ellison , and adopted by many other companies seeking to combat Microsoft 's dominance of the PC market .
Eric Schmidt , CTO at Sun Microsystems at the time , was a staunch advocate of the NC , so he has had plenty of time thinking how to make the concept work .
[ For more background , check out Oracle 's Lost Revolution , Daniel Roth 's excellent feature on Larry Ellison and the NC . ]
" There has not been a new successful platform in this [ mobile ] space in 20 years , " Schmidt said .
With cloud computing and HTML5 he thinks the enabling technology is in place to turn the network computer into reality .
According to Schmidt Google is having to rewrite some internal applications that are tied into existing platforms as it deploys Chrome netbooks .
" I said : ' Okay , good , let 's imagine that from this day forward everything we did was a perfect web app , what would the world look like ?'
" We found applications that were part of our business : operations , sales , accounting , so forth ... they are in the process of being rewritten , and it's no big deal - make them browser resident - but even at Google , we have this problem . " ®
Now we know exactly what Roethlisberger was accused of doing that night : straight up , unprotected sex .
Let 's dig right in to the sordid details , shall we ?
Advertisement
Since no charges will be brought , the investigation records become public ; The Smoking Gun has 572 pages of them .
Included are witness statements from those present in the bar , including the victim and her friends .
Among the highlights :
• The encounter lasted about ten minutes , beginning from when Roethlisberger entered the back area " with his penis already out of his pants . "
The alleged victim repeatedly told him she did n't want to have sex , but he kept reassuring her , as they had unprotected sex .
She told her friends immediately after , and they reported it to the first police officer they saw .
Advertisement
• According to her friend , both the girl and Roethlisberger were " noticeably intoxicated " .
His bodyguards " dragged " the victim to the back , and he followed two minutes later .
When her friends approached the bar manager to unlock the bathroom door , he told them " Ben 's an NFL quarterback , he wo n't do anything to ruin his reputation . "
• The alleged victim had met up with Roethlisberger earlier in the night at another bar , where he called her and her sorority sisters " a tease . "
They ran into him again at Capital City , where the back room was roped off to everyone but Roethlisberger and " 10 to 15 girls . "
One of her friends told police afterwards that she thought the whole thing was a " set - up , " and that Roethlisberger had selected the alleged victim earlier in the evening .

• The alleged victim was wearing a nametag labeled " DTF " When asked , she said it stood for " down to fuck . "
Roethlisberger replied , " I 'm not down to fuck , but I like to fuck girls . "
• One of the girls in the group left the bar angrily after Roethlisberger purchased a round of drinks , saying " all my bitches , take some shots . "
Advertisement
• Roethlisberger 's bodyguards were deleting photos from people 's cameras and phones that depicted Roethlisberger drinking .
• When they got home , one of Roethlisberger 's friends asked him what had happened in the bathroom .
Roethlisberger told him nothing had happened , and that they were just " messing around . "
He said that she had slipped , and once he had helped her up , he told her they were not going to continue .

• On March 17 , 12 days after the incident , a lawyer for the woman requested that the rape probe be dropped , because " a criminal trial would be a very intrusive experience . "
So there you have it .
By avoiding charges , Roethlisberger escaped potential jail time .
But he did n't escape having the sleazy details of his night in Milledgeville splashed all over , for everyone to judge .

Many people , I believe even the locals of Oregon do not realize the existence of an amazing nature place called Thor ’s Well .
Located at Cape Perpetua , Oregon , the surf surge rock without doubt is very unique .
In any event , it makes a great photo .
It occurs at a moderate to high tide with strong surf .
While I think it is best photographed near sunset , I ’m sure good photos of it could be obtained almost any time of day .
However , it is not easy to take a snap of the place because of sharp rocks are everywhere .
Plus , a very strong surge could sweep right up and be very dangerous .
The hole can be seen from the parking area at the far end of the rock shelf on the north side of Cook ’s Chasm .
Following are the photos taken from very brave and dedicated photographers .

Marketing your online business and learning how to attract customers to your ecommerce store or sales page is much harder than marketing a blog or any other type of website .
Why ?
It ’s because no one really cares about your business .
Nobody really wants to know what you have to sell and no one likes being led to a sales page .
Even if you think you ’re offering the most magnificent products ever , by default people are going to ignore you unless they know who you are .

People Hate Sales Pages On Social Media
Photo by RBarney.com
Marketing your business on social media is all the rage right now but simply posting your online store URL on Twitter or Facebook is not going to get you customers .
For one thing , most people are extremely suspicious of any type of sales page they encounter .
Anything that even resembles a product page is just going to get passed on .
For example , whenever I click on my stumbleupon button or a twitter link and am taken to page full of products , I get pissed off and immediately leave .
99.9 % of the time , I ’m using social media to do research , to read about what others are up to or to just relax .
My marketing and BS sensors are on full alert and I hate being led to a random store or ecommerce site .
Similarly , I hate it when I ’m on the forums and I notice that someone has randomly dropped a link to their ecommerce website .
Simply blasting your website URL to uninterested parties is not going to work because no one is paying attention !
You Need To Create A Connection
The other thing you need to realize is that customers do n’t necessarily shop at your store because of your products per se .
They are shopping at your store because you have created a connection somehow .
They want to buy from you because of the personality your store projects .
The best way to illustrate this point is to tell a story about an experience I had at a company I used to work for .
At the time , I was a hardware engineer designing circuit boards and I had to select a device to use in my design from 2 competing manufacturers .
Company # 1 was the leader in their field .
They produced devices that were technologically superior to every one else .
Feature wise , their product was the device of choice among developers .
Company # 2 was not as well known but had a decent product .
However from a technical standpoint , their product was not as powerful as Company # 1 but adequate for most applications .
In any case , it should have been a no brainer to go with Company # 1 , but ultimately I went with Company # 2 and a lesser known product .
Why ?
It ’s because Company # 2 projected this aura of really caring for their customers and providing superior customer support .
Because Company # 1 was already the leader , they did n’t dedicate as many resources in trying to help me integrate their device into my design .
Finding literature and documentation was more difficult as well because I had to manually request access to each document , a process which often took several days .
Meanwhile , Company # 2 had a very open philosophy with their documentation and it really showed on their website .
All of their content was freely available and as a result I got to know their products better and felt more comfortable using their devices .
Whenever I had any questions , they immediately sent an engineer over to help even for the most minor of problems .
Over time , I even became friends with the sales guy and FAE .
I continued to use Company # 2 ’s devices throughout my entire stint at my job and never even considered switching , ever .
I was a loyal customer for life .
The key takeaway here is that the superior product is n’t always the one that sells and the decision to buy is not always about the product itself .
If you can establish some sort of connection to your customers through your website or customer service , then you will have the upper hand .
In fact , that is one of the main ways that a small niche store or boutique can take on a larger business .
The key is to make people want to buy from you and no one else .
And to do that you need to make your store standout .
Company # 2 snagged me as a customer because their emphasis on good customer service was plastered all over their website .
The Secret To Marketing A Niche Online Store
So what is the secret to marketing your store ?
** Drum roll **
The secret to marketing your online store is to keep your customer engaged with your website by showing them your personality .
The secret is to keep your customer so interested in what you have to say that they do n’t even realize that you are selling to them .
And to accomplish this feat , you need to have engaging content .
In fact , I would argue that you should n’t think of your online store as a store at all .
You should think of your ecommerce site as a content site that happens to sell products .
Similar to a blog , if you have good content , the word will eventually spread , people will link to your website and you ’ll get tons of organic traffic without having to spend much on advertising .
For our store , my wife and I engage customers by providing useful craft tutorials and other projects that can be created with our products for free .
70 % of our web traffic comes directly through our content pages and a good portion of this traffic eventually goes on to purchase from us .
I would say that initially , many of our customers do n’t even visit our website to shop .
Instead , they read about some of our cool DIY wedding projects and want to make it themselves .
In the future , we also plan on adding video tutorials to our store as well .
Bottom line , the more you can engage with customers , the more you ’ll be able to sell .
Instead of a direct sales pitch , show them that you are a real person and that you are passionate and care about your products .
In order to be successful , simply listing your products online is just not going to cut it especially when you are just a small niche store with no reputation .
Strive to make your business stand out !
Let customers know what you are good at and pound that idea home .

Probably one of the most notable features of Android is the ability to download apps from the Android Market .
Simply select the Market icon and you ’ll be treated to nearly 40,000 applications to choose from .
However , things are n’t so simply if you just picked up the HTC Legend or the Desire .
You still have access to the Android Market , but many of your favorite apps are most likely most visible to you .
Apparently , Google has not updated their ROM database for the Android Market which dictates which phones can see paid and copy - protected apps .
Google uses the database to limit market access to handset in countries that are not yet set up for paid apps , but until Google adds the HTC Desire and Legend to the database , your shiny new phone will be limited to the apps not marked with copy - protection .
It ’s unclear if this issue is affecting all versions of the two handsets or a specific subset from a certain carrier over in Europe , but we ’re hoping the issue wo n’t last for too much longer .

The foundry has isolated at least one 500 - gram tungsten bar due for melting , originating from a ( so far ) unnamed bank , which as the head of the foundry stated made the unpleasant discovery that " not all the glitters is gold . "

The best practices for finding files with PHP has evolved a lot in a the last few years .
Back in 2004 , one of the very first thing I did with PHP was porting the File :: Find :: Rule Perl module to PHP .
File :: Find :: Rule is a great way to describe the files and directories you want to work with .
I used the opendir , readdir , and closedir native PHP functions , and it did the job quite well .
The PHP class was named sfFinder , and it can still be found in all symfony versions .
Even if the class is bundled with symfony , I know that a few people use it for all kind of stuff , not necessarily related to symfony .
But the code starts to show its age ; first because I learned a lot since then about PHP , and also because there is a better way now .
Enter iterators !
PHP 5 comes bundled with a bunch of iterator classes that ease all kind of , well , iterations .
You can iterate over an iterator with the standard foreach operator , a very powerful PHP construct .
PHP Iterators #
So , how do you get all the files and directories recursively with PHP iterators ?
Frankly , I do n't know .
Well , I know more or less which classes to use and how to assemble them , but instead of thinking too hard , I always copy and paste an existing snippet of code to get it right .
Here is such a snippet :
// some flags to filter .
and .. and follow symlinks $ flags = \ FilesystemIterator : : SKIP_DOTS | \ FilesystemIterator:: FOLLOW_SYMLINKS ; // create a simple recursive directory iterator $ iterator = new \ RecursiveDirectoryIterator ( $ dir , $ flags ) ; // make it a truly recursive iterator $ iterator = new \ RecursiveIteratorIterator ( $iterator , \ RecursiveIteratorIterator : : SELF_FIRST ) ; // iterate over it foreach ( $iterator as $ file ) { // do something with $ file ( a \ SplFileInfo instance ) }
Noticed the fancy \ character before each built - in class ?
That 's the way you reference built - in PHP class when using them in a PHP 5.3 namespace context .
As you can see for yourself , nothing complex .
You just need to know the which Iterator to use , their possible flags , and how to compose them together .
So , the first barrier of entry is the learning curve .
There are a lot of great tutorials and presentations on the Internet about iterators , but the official documentation on php.net probably lacks some good examples .
The other " problem " is that everything is very object - oriented .
And as soon as you want to filter the iterator , you will need to create your own classes , which seems impractical most of the time .
That 's because PHP iterators are very powerful and have been written to be general - purpose iterators .
What is filtering ?
Let 's say I want to exclude all files ending with .rb from the iterator .
I can create a simple \ FilterIterator for that :
class ExcludeRubyFilesFilterIterator extends \ FilterIterator { public function accept ( ) { $ fileinfo = $ this ->getInnerIterator ( ) -> current ( ) ; if ( preg_match ( ' / \.rb$ /' , $ fileinfo ) ) { return false ; } return true ; } }
This filter iterator can be used with the previous one by wrapping it like this :
$ iterator = new ExcludeRubyFilesFilterIterator ( $iterator ) ;
That 's easy enough .
But when I need to find files and directories , I always need the same kind of specialized filters , like excluding VCS files ( like .svn and .git directories ) , filtering files by name or by size .
The Symfony Finder Component #
Instead of writing the same iterators over and over again , I have packaged them in a Symfony Component : the Finder component .
The Symfony Finder Component provides many specialized Iterator classes for finding files and directories .
It also adds a wrapper on top of them to ease its day - to - day usage .
As any Symfony component , you first need to bootstrap your script with any class loader that is able to load classes that follows the PHP 5.3 interoperability standards , like the Symfony UniversalClassLoader class :
require_once '/ path/to/src/Symfony/Foundation/UniversalClassLoader.php' ; use Symfony \Foundation \UniversalClassLoader ; $ classLoader = new UniversalClassLoader ( ) ; $ classLoader->registerNamespace ( ' Symfony ' , '/ path/to/src ' ) ; $ classLoader -> register ( ) ;
Now , let 's see how to use the Finder class , the main class of the component :
use Symfony \Components \Finder \Finder ; $ finder = new Finder ( ) ; $ iterator = $ finder -> files ( ) -> in( __DIR__ ) ; foreach ( $iterator as $ file ) { print $ file -> getRealpath ( ) . "
" ; }
The above code prints the names of all the files in the current directory recursively .
Notice that the Finder class uses a fluent interface , which means that all methods return the Finder instance .
The only exception is the in ( ) method , which builds and returns an Iterator for the given directory , or for an array of directories :
$ iterator = $ finder -> files ( ) -> in( array ( ' / path1 ' , ' / path2 ' ) ) ;
You can convert an iterator to an array with the iterator_to_array ( ) method , and have the number of items with iterator_count ( ) .
If you want to restrict the iterator to only return PHP files in the current directory , use the name ( ) and maxDepth ( ) methods :
$ iterator = $ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '*. php ' ) -> maxDepth(0 ) -> in( __DIR__ ) ;
The name ( ) method accepts globs , strings , or regexes :
$ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '/\.php$ /' ) ;
There is also methods to exclude files by name or to exclude whole directories content from matching :
$ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( ' test .*') -> notName ( '*.rb ' ) -> exclude ( ' ruby ' ) ;
The result should contain files named test with any extension , but not the ones ending with .rb ( it excludes test.rb ) , and the iterator wo n't match any file in ruby directories ( ruby / foo / test. php wo n't match for instance ) .
If you want to follow links , use the followLinks ( ) method :
$ finder ->files ( ) ->followLinks ( ) ;
You can also restrict files by size :
$ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '/\.php$ /') -> size ( '< 1.5K ' ) ;
Most of the methods are cumulative .
So , if you want to get all PHP and Python files with a size between 1 and 2 K , here is the code :
$ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '*. php ' ) -> name ( '*. py/' ) -> size ( '>= 1K ') -> size ( '<= 2K ' ) ;
By default , the iterator ignores popular VCS files .
This can be changed with the ignoreVCS ( ) method .
As the in ( ) method returns an \ Iterator instance , you can wrap it with your own specialized iterator .
But instead of creating a class , you can also use the filter ( ) method :
$ filter = function ( \SplFileInfo $ fileinfo ) { if ( strlen ( $ fileinfo ) > 10 ) { return false ; } } ; $ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '*. php ' ) -> filter ( $ filter ) ;
This example excludes all the files with a file name of more than 10 characters .
Want to sort the result by name , use the sortByName ( ) method :
$ finder -> files ( ) -> name ( '*. php ' ) -> sortByName ( ) ;
Notice that the sort * methods need to get all matching elements to do their jobs .
For large iterators , it can be rather slow .
Under the hood , the Finder class uses specialized iterator classes :
ChainIterator
CustomFilterIterator
DateRangeFilterIterator ( coming soon )
( coming soon ) ExcludeDirectoryFilterIterator
FileTypeFilterIterator
FilenameFilterIterator
IgnoreVcsFilterIterator
LimitDepthFilterIterator
SizeRangeFilterIterator
SortableIterator
Have a look at the code to learn more about these iterators and how they work .
In a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia this week , Hillary Clinton said that Iran " is moving toward a military dictatorship , " and continued the administration 's campaign for tougher sanctions against that country .
What could America 's top diplomat hope to accomplish with this kind of inflammatory rhetoric ?
It seems unlikely that the goal was to support human rights in Iran .
Because of the United States ' history in Iran and in the region , it tends to give legitimacy to repression .
The more that any opposition can be linked to the United States ' actions , words , or support , the harder time they will have .
Second , it is tough for anyone – especially in the region – to believe that the US is really concerned about human rights abuses .
In addition to supporting Israel 's collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza , Washington has been remarkably quiet as the most important opposition leaders in Egypt were arrested as part of the government 's preparations for October elections .
Amnesty International stated that the arrestees were " prisoners of conscience , detained solely for their peaceful political activities " .
So what is the purpose of a speech like this ?
The most obvious conclusion is that it is to promote conflict , and to convince Americans that Iran is an actual threat to their security .
Americans generally have to be prepared and persuaded for years if they are to accept that they must go to war .
The groundwork for the Iraq war was laid during the Clinton presidency .
President Clinton imposed sanctions on the country that devastated the civilian population , carried out bombings , and publicly declared that Washington 's intention was to overthrow the government .
Although , as we now know , Iraq never posed any significant security threat to the US , President Clinton spent years trying to convince Americans that it did .
President Bush picked up where President Clinton left off ; and President Clinton publicly supported his campaign for the war .
So did Hillary , and she defended her decision in 2008 even as it looked like it might cost her the presidency .
President Obama is unlikely to start a war with Iran – which would likely begin as an air war , not a ground war – not least because he already has two wars to deal with .
But , as in the case of the Iraq war , his secretary of state is preparing the ground for the next president that may have a stronger desire or better opportunity to do so .
There is a strong faction of our foreign policy establishment that believes it has the right and obligation to bomb Iran in order to curtail its nuclear programme , and they have a long - term strategy .
The public relations campaign is working .
A new Gallup poll finds that 61 % of Americans see Iran as " as a critical threat to US vital interests , " with an additional 29 % believing that it is " an important threat " .
It is not clear why anyone would believe this ; even if Iran did obtain a nuclear weapon , which is still a way off , they would not have the capacity to deliver it as far as the US .
Nor is it likely that they would want to commit national suicide , any more than a number of other countries that currently have nuclear weapons .
The Obama team 's messaging is not nearly so successful with regard to the issues that the vast majority of the electorate will base their votes on in this year 's elections : the most recent ABC News / Washington Post poll finds that 53 % disapprove of his handling of the economy .
For the immediate future , foreign policy concerns will likely rank low , far behind the economy , for the electorate .
But the Obama team 's foreign policy will hurt Democrats in the future .
If I believed what Hillary Clinton and the Democratic leadership are telling me , I would have to consider voting Republican .
If it 's really true that all these people just want to kill us for no reason ; that it has nothing to do with our foreign policy or wars ; that we can effectively reduce terrorism by bombing and occupying Muslim countries ; and that terrorism is the country 's most urgent security threat – then why not vote for the party that looks tougher ?
This will inevitably come back to haunt the Democratic party , as it did in the 2002 and 2004 elections .
Meanwhile , US military spending – by the Congressional Budget Office 's relatively narrow definition of the department of defence budget – reached 5.6 % of GDP in 2009 .
Just before September 11 , 2001 , the Congressional Budget Office projected this spending for 2009 at 2.4 % of GDP .
The difference , over 10 years , is more than four times the ten - year cost of proposed healthcare reform .
BEFORE Wikileaks , or even the Internet , there were just plain leaks .
Two weeks ago , Wikileaks.org released a classified video showing a United States Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad .
The reaction was so swift and powerful — an edited version has been viewed six million times on YouTube — that the episode provoked many questions about how such material is now released and digested .
Put another way : if someone today had the Pentagon Papers , or the modern equivalent , would he still go to the press , as Daniel Ellsberg did nearly 40 years ago , and wait for the documents to be analyzed and published ?
Or would that person simply post them online immediately ?
Mr. Ellsberg knows his answer .
“ As of today , I would n’t have waited that long , ” he said in an interview last week .
“ I would have gotten a scanner and put them on the Internet . ”
In early 1971 , Mr. Ellsberg , an analyst at the RAND Corporation , passed a New York Times reporter a copy of a top - secret report casting doubt on the war in Vietnam , the so - called Pentagon Papers .
For months , he said , he waited , unsure if The New York Times would ever publish .
… im Magazin Mex des Hessischen Rundfunks , das sich mit dem Bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen befasst .
Gehalt ?
Hier werden im Titel missverständliche Assoziationen geweckt .
Und der Experte Hermann - Josef Tenhagen , was hat er zu sagen ?
Dass es eine sehr große Umverteilung wäre – etwa so wie es im Sozialbudget zum Ausdruck kommt ?
Wenn Tenhagen feststellt , es brauche doch einen großen
Wurf nicht , man könne auch mit bestehenden „ Modellen “ ( was er meint , ist unklar ) mehr Freiräume erreichen , dann unterschlägt er , dass heute aber Erwerbstätigkeit über allem steht und damit die Einkommenserzielung davon abhängt .
Es gibt eben solche und solche Experten .

Like any other small businessman , he assumed his Internet account was basically safe .
Instead , he found himself another victim of the latest 21 ’st century crime wave , when his valuable domain name , VL.com , was hijacked in a high - tech heist .
Told by a first - person witness to the crime , reconstructed from forensic evidence compiled in the aftermath , this gripping account takes you inside the mind of the attacker , showing in lay terms how domain thiefs bypass security at Internet registrars , and why domain name theft is a growing problem on the Internet that could strike any of us .
This is the detailed story of how VL.com was stolen .
Click here for Domain Name Wire ’s report on the incident .
Also available as a free downloadable eBook :
( Last updated April 3 , 2010 . )
Preface
This is a true cybercrime story , which hit my friend Tom this past weekend … a little too close to home .
And I realized that this is something that could happen to me .
Indeed , it could happen to any of us who owns his own business or website domain .
Tom wanted this story told , in the hopes that the knowledge will help prevent similar crimes in the future , to encourage other victims also to come forward , and to increase the chances that crimes like this will be prosecuted as a result , and I agree .
I ’ve drawn on chat transcripts , emails , and other forensic evidence , to reconstruct the timeline of events as accurately as I can .
Naturally , when I portray the villain ’s activities — and especially his thoughts and motivations — I ’m speculating … but let ’s call it “ informed speculation . ”
The villain , although he may sometimes appear incompetent , never acts out of random whim .
His goal is not merely to poke around inside someone else ’s computer and see what he can find .
No .
He is pursuing a goal , so he has a purpose to everything he does .
And I ’ve written his character from this perspective .
I ’ve mentioned DreamHost , our hosting company and domain registrar , by name , in the interests of full disclosure , because I have recommended DreamHost and have published affiliate links to their service , and I no doubt will in the future .
Because in the aftermath , I ’m still looking for another company who would have done better , who would have prevented the break - ins that occurred here .
Chapter 1
I expected a typical lazy weekend : read a book , get ready for the Passover holiday , watch a few seasons of Mythbusters with my new Netflix Wii streaming disc .
I never expected the weekend to bring me in so close to the world of high - stakes Internet crime .
As you may know , before I wrote books , I programmed software , and before that , I studied Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University .
During those days , I met Tom , now one of my oldest friends .
Both of us EE students , both electronics hobbyists since we were young , both hired as co-op students by the same local company .
Both of us went into developing software .
In the mid-1990 ’s , Tom registered the Internet domain VL.com for his consulting business , Venture Logic .
Shortly thereafter , I started JT Software Enterprises and registered JTSE.com .
You ca n’t get 2 - and 3 - and 4 - letter domain names anymore .
But at the time , the Internet was still an open frontier , and we actually homesteaded these domains , building them from the ground up .
Fast - forward to the year 2010 .
JTSE.com is still just an arbitrary string of characters to most people .
But VL.com could stand for almost any company name , and on the open market , it ’s worth hundreds of thousands of dollars .
( I wonder how much Barnes and Noble paid for BN.com . )
When Tom started getting genuine offers to buy his domain , we should have realized that it was like a diamond necklace , and that high - tech cat burglars would soon set their sites on it .

A dark figure lurked in the shadows , just outside the glow of the computer monitor .
No one knew him .
No one even knew he was there .
He had been observing his prey , quietly collecting information using false names and stolen ID ’s , and even trial - and - error .
Over the Internet , no one could tell he was n’t who or what he said he was .
And by the time they put together all the pieces — if they ever put together the pieces — he would be long gone , with his quarry , having taken on yet another false identity .
He knew the VL.com domain he wanted was registered with DreamHost ; that was a matter of public record .
And he knew that DreamHost would have limited resources to deal with a low - profile Internet break - in , especially on the weekend , and that could give him more time .
He had also managed to crack into a different DreamHost account .
He had asked them to add a credit card to the account , then talked to a different person and used the credit card information to validate that he owned the account .
Customer service was always anxious to shortcut security in order to aid a helpless user , and he played the part like a pro .
Through a long series of subterfuges , he had also discovered the account under which the domain was held , had even tricked DreamHost into linking it with his current persona .
And now he was ready to strike at his true target .
“ How may I assist you ? ” asked Dan , the support technician on the other end of the online chat .
“ I having trouble with updating primary email address on my account , ” the dark figure replied , impersonating his last victim .
He then explained to Dan how he had tried to change the email address on the VL.com account .
The story was a complete fabrication , of course ; he did n’t even have access to that account .
But he made sure he sneaked in the name of the account and the email address he wanted to use .
He then complained that his computer was acting up , said he needed to reinstall Windows .
It added an air of authentic helplessness .
Dan suggested he reset his browser , or try a different browser .
A common support - guy fix .
He explained that he had already done that , and had tried Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari .
It was n’t important that Windows users almost never even knew about Safari ; it was more important that he hit all the magic keywords , and fast , before Dan began to suspect anything .
Dan asked him to answer his security question .
“ What city were you born in ? ”
It took a minute for the dark figure to look up the correct answer , but he did find it , and answered correctly .
But Dan did not respond .
“ Are you still there ? ” the dark figure asked .
“ Changing , hold on , ” Dan wrote .
And finally , “ Done . ”
“ I can see that it ’s updated , ” the dark figure wrote .
Another fiction : he did not yet have access to the account , so he could not actually see anything .
But it was important for Dan to believe that he could see it , that everything was on the up and up .
It was important that no one raise an alarm , not yet .
Neither Tom nor I use such weak security questions .
Anyone can find out where you were born , or what school you went to , or your mother ’s maiden name , or whatever .
This became painfully clear to me after I wrote my romantic memoir ( Love through the Eyes of an Idiot ) .
I looked to contact the people from my past that I wrote about , to inform them about the book .
In the process of searching for them , I ran across all manner of personal information about them .
I was n’t even looking for it .
How that security question got set at DreamHost is still a mystery , lost in the memories of time .
Maybe it was an old security question , set when Tom first created his account .
( Be assured that we ’ve both verified and tightened up security on all our accounts , and no one will be pulling a similar stunt on either of us . )
Over the following hour , Tom would receive a dozen emails from DreamHost ’s computer , telling him someone was trying to reset his password .
Each email included the standard calming notice :
If you did n’t request this email , do n’t fret , the security of your account has not been compromised .
Somebody else must have requested your password .
That ’s exactly why we email it to you instead of just giving it out !
If Tom had been looking at his email inbox just then , he might have been able to cut off the cracker before he did any real damage .
Unfortunately Tom was n’t reading his email just then .
Chapter 2
Saturday , March 27 , 10:23 PM EDT
The dark figure waited for DreamHost support to respond to his chat request .
He had requested the password be reset , eight times since 9:35 , since he had tricked them into adding his email address to the account .
But he had n’t been receiving the password - reset messages in his email .
Brian answered the chat .
“ Hi there , how can I help you . ”
Now impersonating
Tom , the legitimate owner of the account , he explained his problem as best he could .
“ I ’m trying to get login info in my new email address , but not receiving email from DreamHost . ”
He gave Brian the account ID and email address .
“ You ’re already logged into the panel , if you ’re talking to me , ” Brian said .
“ Yes , ” the dark figure replied .
That was true .
He was logged into the administration panel , just not into Tom ’s account .
Not yet .
But hopefully soon .
He told Brian that he had recently updated the email address , and that he needed to use the new address , not the old one .
Brian replied , “ Both are actually listed on your account . ”
He explained that Tom could use the administration panel to make any changes he needed .
Yes , the dark figure said , he ’d tried that many times , but it was n’t working .
He kept getting an error , he said in his typical broken English .
Brian asked him to try it again .
So he did .
Of course , he did n’t actually try anything .
His story was a complete fiction , but a believable one .
He described the steps he would have gone through , had he actually had access to Tom ’s administration panel .
Every value he would type , every checkbox he would check , every button he would click on .
“ Page still pending load , ” he added after another minute .
Brian waited patiently .
“ Now get the page cannot to display error , ” the dark figure wrote , but he knew that would n’t be enough .
He knew he needed to make it sound like an insurmountable , unsolvable problem .
“ I also tried from Firefox , Safari , and cleared caches .
I think it ’s Windows issue with AJAX .
Need to re-install windows tomorrow .
Please check it . ”
This must have puzzled Brian .
Maybe he thought he was dealing with a clueless user .
Maybe he thought it was a strange , inexplicable problem that would take too much time to track down .
Maybe he just wanted to get “ Tom ” off his back .
The exact reason did n’t matter .
What mattered was that he took the bait .
“ That ’s weird , ” Brian said .
“ I just tried it , and it worked perfectly .
I changed it for you . ”
The dark figure said he would refresh his display and see if it worked .
Another fiction , of course .
He could n’t refresh any display , because he was n’t looking at the display .
But he could determine whether it worked .
He asked for another password reset .
He still did n’t receive the email message , but that might just mean the computer was still processing the .
So he tried again , and again , and again , in quick succession .
And finally it worked .
He reported to Brian that the data had been updated .
Brian was clearly pleased to have helped .
The dark figure had access to Tom ’s account now , but there was one thing he needed to do before stealing control over the VL.com domain .
He needed to cover his tracks , and for that , he needed Tom ’s email passwords .
He logged into Tom ’s account and looked up the email box ID’s .
Then he contacted support again .
Unfortunately , he got Brian again .
Brian was no doubt tired with him by now , but he gave it a try anyhow .
He said he was trying to see the passwords of two users under his account .
Brian replied that “ Tom ” could n’t see the passwords , but he could reset them .
Indeed , that was a security precaution that DreamHost had put in place some time ago , in order to stop people from doing what the dark figure was trying to do right now .
Brian suggested not making any more changes right now , just to keep everything working for now .
Yup .
He was clearly tired of dealing with “ Tom . ”
The email the dark figure was trying to erase was actually being sent to a Google Apps account , but maybe Tom had used the same password on both his DreamHost email accounts and on his Google account .
The dark figure also had asked for the Google password to be reset , and he hoped that a password - reset message then might have appeared in one of the DreamHost mailboxes .
So the dark figure waited another half hour and tried again .
This time , he got Sam , who was more than happy to help .
He was able to get the passwords for the two email boxes , but they appeared to be long strings of random characters .
And neither of those email boxes contained the Google reset message .
The dark figure would not be able to crack into Tom ’s email .
His best hope was that he could complete the thievery he came here to do , before Tom realized what was going on .
Sunday , March 27 , 1:16 AM EDT
Tom instant - messaged me : “ Somebody is trying to break into my Dreamhost account . ”
“ How can you tell ? ” I asked .
He had gotten a bunch of email messages telling him that his DreamHost account password had been reset .
But it particularly disturbed him that the last of these messages was also sent to an anonymous email address , at HushMail , an email address Tom did not control .
What to do ?
DreamHost ’s primary means of customer support was via the administration panel , if Tom could still login .
He could n’t .
I acutely realized that this is one of the instances in which you really need another means of contacting DreamHost support .
Since then , I ’ve discovered that DreamHost ’s public contact form , as well as their abuse email address .
Either would probably have worked at least as well as what we ended up doing .
We did n’t know how the attacker had cracked into Tom ’s DreamHost account .
Tom ’s Google - hosted account had not been compromised , as far as we could tell .
So the cracker had either found an exploit in DreamHost ’s password - reset form , or else he was listening in on DreamHost ’s or Google ’s network .
In any case , it was a scary prospect .
As a fellow DreamHost customer , I contacted support on Tom ’s behalf and relayed his plea for help .
It would be almost 13 hours before we received an initial response , and several more hours before we were taken seriously .
Not fast enough to prevent the disaster that was to come .
Chapter 3
Tom and I speculated on how the intruder broke into Tom ’s DreamHost account , and what damage he might be doing there .
I thought he might trash Tom ’s account , and I was concerned that Tom be able to restore any lost data quickly .
But Tom really did n’t have any data in that account .
All of his Internet services were served from elsewhere .
He thought the cracker was probably setting up a phishing site .
That is , the guy would put up a fake web page that looked like a real company web page , maybe for a bank .
Then he would send people to that fake page , maybe with fake spam emails , and then try to trick people into giving him their bank logins and passwords .
Tom even feared the guy might charge up fake domain names on his credit card .
Fortunately , there was no way for the attacker to obtain Tom ’s credit card number , except for the last 4 digits .
Nor could he charge up services or domain registrations on the card , because DreamHost ’s system always asks for new credit card information when you make new purchases .
So that was good .
Our bigger concern was how he had managed to break in .
The email box Tom had been using as a contact email for DreamHost , that account was still secure .
Tom was also certain that his Linux desktop computer was secure , and he had found no breaches on his office LAN .
He even had been using secure protocols he used to transfer email into the office LAN .
That is , even if someone were able to listen in on his Internet connection , the cracker would n’t be able to decode Tom ’s encrypted communications .
The only alternative was that someone had cracked into a mail server at DreamHost , or maybe even the DreamHost control panel itself .
I joked that at least I would have something to blog about the following week .
I sent a message to DreamHost support , on Tom ’s behalf , marked urgent .
I explained that his control panel account had been cracked into , and that he had been locked out of it , so he could not contact support thereby .
I gave them his phone number and told them he wanted them to call him immediately .
By then it was almost 2 o’clock Sunday morning .
“ Sure , self - hosted stuff is more likely to be poorly maintained and easier to breach , ” Tom commented to me , “ but if a problem happens , I can always hit the big red button and halt it . ”
And this was certainly one of those situations .
You ’ve just discovered that someone has cracked into your account and locked you out .
You want to be ableto scream that your account has been compromised , and before anything else happens , you want your service provider to freeze the account .
You can sort it all out later , when the experts can dig up the forensic details .
But for now , you just want to stop the attacker from whatever damage he ’s trying to do .
Still no response from DreamHost support .
No way I knew of to escalate the request .
No way to phone DreamHost .
( And as we discovered later , DreamHost ’s policy is not to discuss security breaches over the phone , only via email , because they want a written record of the conversation . )
At one point , we also discovered DreamHost ’s chat - support feature , and I tried contacting someone thereby , but no one responded to my chat request at 3:00 in the morning .
In the past , I ’ve defended DreamHost ’s control - panel - based support system , because it ’s more than effective for normal , “ my website ’s not working ” support requests .
But this was not that kind of support request .
We urgently needed DreamHost to freeze the account , at least temporarily , to keep the attacker from doing any more damage than he ’d already done .
Then the normal support mechanism would have been sufficient to pick up the pieces .
“ I ’m not sure it ’d be worth the savings , ” Tom noted , “ to host anything critical at an organization that is effectively unreachable .
I get that phone support would be abused , but you have to have a ‘ break glass when on fire ’ option somewhere . ”
At 3:01 AM Sunday morning , Tom realized that there was indeed some real damage the cracker could do .
“ vl.com is worth $ 100 K + .
So I need to escalate this somehow . ”
We gave up on the non-responsive chat and on the support ticket shortly before 4 AM .
We went to bed , long overdue for sleep .

“ Hello .
Welcome to DreamHost Live Chat .
My name is Javier .
How can I help you ? ”
“ I ’m sent transfer request from new domain registrar for my domain , ” the dark figure posing as Tom typed into his computer .
“ Can you see transfer request on your admin end and verify if received request from other registrar ?
VL.com . ”
He had already unlocked the VL.com domain , worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , and had transferred it to a registrar in the Bahamas .
He had done this before , with other domains .
Once the domain was out of the US , it would be harder for Tom to get it back , and much more difficult for anyone to prosecute the dark figure or his friends for stealing the domain .
International law is a bitch , and that worked to the dark figure ’s favor .
At the very least , Tom would have to spend thousands of dollars to arbitrate the case , possibly with nothing to show for it .
Some domains may be worth massive amounts of money , but they were not considered “ property ” by most governments .
And that too worked in the dark figure ’s favor .
But while the Bahamas were ready to receive VL.com , the dark figure still needed to approve the transfer away from DreamHost , and DreamHost ’s interface did n’t appear to be cooperating .
Indeed , Javier confirmed that DreamHost had not received the transfer request .
The dark figure would have to contact the registrar in the Bahamas and have them resend it .
Too much time wasted now , but there still was probably time to steal the domain away .
Hopefully , no one would know what was happening until Monday morning .

Sunday , March 28 , 2:40 PM EDT
Glen , from DreamHost ’s abuse - response team , replied to our support request , saying that Tom should provide certain billing details , in order to verify that he owned the account .
That ’s DreamHost ’s standard procedure .
But we believed that someone might be listening in on DreamHost ’s email .
How to convince Glen that this issue needs looking into ?
Tom emailed him back , explaining that he believed that DreamHost ’s email servers had been compromised , asking to talk via phone or to send the data via fax .
Tom said to me , “ I ’m sure they ’ve chalked this up to some customer with sloppy security getting their email compromised . ”
Shortly thereafter , Glen confirmed that suspicion .
He said that while he was open to evidence that DreamHost ’s network had been compromised , there had n’t been break - ins on any other accounts .
He suggested that Tom scan his computer for viruses , to make sure there was n’t something installed on it that was listening in on his email .
Tom shot back , “ It ’s a Linux machine with a secure password behind a firewall .
I have a clue about security .
The only place I am seeing any evidence of a breach is with DreamHost .
The attacker attempted , and failed , to reset the password on my Google - hosted account .
If he had compromised my machine here , he would have been able to intercept that email . ”
That seemed to have been persuasive , as Glen looked at the situation in more detail .
Although he did n’t find any record that Tom ’s account password had been accessed , he accepted that Tom knew enough about security in order to avoid the common mistakes that people usually make .
He also restored the account ’s original email address , which gave Tom access again .
At around this time , Tom ’s Google - hosted account received an email that someone was trying to transfer VL.com away to another registrar .
Unfortunately , Google thought it was spam .
Tom would n’t find the notice until another day had passed .
Sunday , March 28 , 6:09 PM EDT
The dark figure had requested that VL.com be transferred away to a registrar in the Bahamas .
But by the time the request had gone through , he had been locked out of the DreamHost account .
If he could crack back in , however , maybe he could still complete the transfer .
Using a tried - and - true method , he chatted with DreamHost support .
“ Need update current email on file , but still not successful , ” he said in his trademark broken English .
He was on the line with Schroder , who tried to walk him through the process .
But that would do the dark figure no good , because he could n’t actually log into the account .
His goal was to beg , trick , or badger Schroder into making the change for him .
“ Can you done it for me ? ” he asked .
“ No , ” Schroder replied , “ I ’m sorry .
I ca n’t change it for you . ”
“ I can verify ownership , ” the dark figure said .
He gave Schroder the answer to the security question , which he had set earlier just for this contingency .
He also recited the last four digits of the account ’s credit card , which he had gotten from the account ’s control panel and written down .
Schroder said , “ If you ca n’t walk me through the method you ’re using to change the info , then , I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t help you with this . ”
“ Ok .
Thanks , ” the dark figure wrote , resolving to try back later with a different support rep .
Sunday , March 28 , 6:52 PM EDT
While Tom waited for his browser to start up , he told me that he had two different contract programming jobs to work on this weekend , and he wanted to upgrade his operating system and switch his MythTV box over to a digital tuner .
I guess he was n’t going to make any progress on any of those projects .
“ Look on the bright side , ” I said .
“ Ca n’t think of what that is .
But I ’m sure there ’s one there … somewhere . ”
“ Metaphorical bruises are often good to motivate you to take corrective action against repeating the mistake , ” Tom replied .
He finally got back into his account , changed the account ’s login email address , locked out the attacker , and reset the passwords .
He examined his domains .
They were all still there .
He could n’t tell whether VL.com was still locked , but all the domain - name configuration looked correct .
By then , it was at 7:08 PM .
Meanwhile …
Sunday , March 28 , 7:07 PM EDT
The dark figure tried again with DreamHost ’s support chat .
This time , he got Jeremy .
He explained , impersonating Tom , that he was trying to change the primary address on Tom ’s account .
Within a few minutes , Jeremy had solved his problem .
The dark figure used the automated system to reset the password on Tom ’s account , knowing that as soon as he could get in , he would be able to complete the theft .
But before he could lock Tom out , someone had already overridden the request .
Clearly ,
Tom was onto him , logged into the system , and actively fighting with him for control of the account .
Time to switch tactics .
Sunday , March 28 , 7:19 PM EDT
Tom was on the DreamHost support chat with Jason .
“ Help .
My DH account is actively being hacked . ”
“ Unfortunately , ” Jason said , “ any inquiries pertaining to hacked sites or accounts need to be taken care of via email so our abuse / security team can assist you .
This is n’t something I can help you with via Live Chat . ”
“ Glen reset my password about an hour ago , ” Tom explained , “ and the attacker is repeating the attack . ”
“ Okay , you will need to submit a support ticket for this .
Thank you ! ”
Meanwhile …
Sunday , March 28 , 7:19 PM EDT
The dark figure contacted Seohee via the DreamHost support chat , still impersonating Tom , told him he was having trouble transferring VL.com away , and asked for help .
He was worried that Tom may have already discovered the pending transfer and may have locked down the domain .
“ What ’s current status of ‘ TRANSFER AWAY ’? ” he asked .
“ It ’s canceled ? ”
No , it was n’t canceled .
It was still pending .
The dark figure told Seohee a story about trying to approve the transfer but receiving an error .
“ Please approve it from your admin end .
Restarting transfer request taking few days . ”
Sadly .
“ Please hold , ” Seohee said .
Within a couple minutes , the dark figure was able to write : “ I can see it ’s approved .
And in new registrar . ”
“ Thanks for hanging in there .
sorry for the confusion , ” Seohee wrote .
“ Thanks again .
Have great day , ” replied the dark figure .
“ You too ! ”
Finally , everyone was happy .

“ They stole vl.com !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ”
By 7:45 , Glen had discovered that the attacker had been manipulating the DreamHost support people in order to crack into Tom ’s account and steal VL.com , a tactic called “ social engineering . ”
Glen discovered this just minutes too late .
Glen immediately promised to gather forensic evidence in order to get back Tom ’s domain , to insist on reforms of DreamHost ’s policies and practices , and to pursue prosecution .
He confirmed that there had been a security breach at DreamHost , and that the support people on chat were not supposed to be making changes on customers ’ accounts .
DreamHost serves as registrar for over a half - million domain names , and hosts close to a million websites , and the attacker could have gone after any of these — and still could .
No doubt , the story , as he reconstructed it , stunned and panicked him and everyone else at DreamHost .
In most incidents of stolen domains , once the domain is transferred away , there ’s little the rightful owner can do to get it back .
File a police report : check .
But aside from the blank stares , you ’re likely to get little response .
File a report with the FBI : check .
But while the FBI is very interested in being informed , unless there ’s substantial monetary loss , they ca n’t justify the resources needed to investigate and prosecute .
Challenge the domain on trademark grounds , but that will cost thousands of dollars and take God - knows - how - long .
You could even beg with the foreign registrar , but without conclusive evidence of fraud , they wo n’t undo the transfer .
Most businesses who lose their domains to domain hijacking or domain theft , they simply give up .
The break in the case was perhaps Glen ’s enthusiasm .
Many companies would have clammed up in the face of these circumstances —
Indeed , many have done so , whether to avoid being sued or just to avoid being bothered .
And without DreamHost ’s help , Tom ’s situation would have been as bleak as the rain - soaked skies that week .
If Tom had complained to the registrar in the Bahamas , they probably would have dismissed him .
But when an official DreamHost representative did so , they listened .
They locked down the domain , which at least kept Tom ’s Internet services up and running .
They considered the evidence that Glen had dug up , which clearly showed fraud .
And they promised to return the domain , once the paperwork had been processed .
Interestingly enough , the cracker refused to give up .
He opened a fake Gmail account , impersonating Tom , in an attempt to trick the registrar in the Bahamas into releasing the lock on the domain .
And he hit DreamHost support again at about the same time , trying to get them to stop asking for the domain back .
Then he attempted again to break in to Tom ’s Google - hosted domain , by trying to trick DreamHost into modifying the domain configuration — using the same MO : claim he tried to make the change himself , make up a story about encountering an error , and ask the support person to make the change for him .
This would have allowed him to access all the email stored in all the accounts on that domain .
But he probably only wanted to impersonate Tom , in order to call off the investigation .
He may have made other attempts as well , attempts that we do not know of yet .
But the real question is how to proceed going forward .
This story is not about DreamHost .
It ’s about the domain industry .
Domain theft happens on the Internet , and social engineering is one of the thief ’s primary tactics .
The most famous case is probably the theft of Sex.com , which is probably famous because of the letters S , E , and X .
It took Gary Kremen years to get that domain back .
Moving my domains away from DreamHost does n’t necessarily solve the problem .
Because a cracker can attack any registrar .
If I have a diamond necklace worth $ 100,000 , I can keep it in a bank safe - deposit vault .
And short of a Mission - Impossible - style heist , I can feel pretty safe that it ’ll remain in my possession .
If I have a domain name worth $ 100,000 , there is no safe - deposit vault , and the quality of security at different registrars varies .
Additionally , the law is only beginning to see domain names as “ property , ” even though , of all the things we call “ intellectual property , ” domain names bear the closest similarity to real property .
Until the law catches up to modern technology , we have to fend for ourselves .
As a defense , maybe there ’s some value in looking for a registrar who ’s as paranoid as I am .
Maybe right now , that ’s still DreamHost , because they ’ve been spooked .
And maybe there ’s also some value in a registrar who will come clean when there ’s a break - in , and do their best to set things right .
Maybe that , too , is DreamHost .
But I find it disheartening that if I go into a crowded room full of IT gurus and ask , “ Where can I register my domain to keep it safe ? ” the best I get is , “ Well , I ’ve been happy with such - and - such a registrar , but no one ’s ever tried to rip me off before . ”
No one cites any systematic studies of domain registrar security practices , and there ’s no single registrar that comes to the top as the name in domain security for the average business .
Even so , there ’s some value in looking for registrars that offer increased security and services , even at slightly increased prices and with longer waiting times :
positively identifying the domain owner before releasing a domain to another registrar , such as with two - factor authentication being offered by some registrars ;
confirming domain transfers through phone calls or cellphone text messages , as well as the standard email ;
approving domain transfers through multiple , independent means , or multiple , independent accounts , all of which must approve before the transfer goes through ;
effective crisis procedures , when a break - in does occur ;
effective forensic and recovery procedures , when a theft occurs ;
insurability — if a domain name is stolen , the insurance company will pay for recovery or losses .
Notice I did not include domain locking in the above list , even though that ’s the first thing most people mention when they talk about protecting your domain .
Why not ?
Because ( 1 ) it ’s a standard feature , ( 2 ) usually all the cracker has to do to turn it off is to click a button on some administrative panel , and ( 3 ) it ca n’t protect you from lax security at your registrar or a break - in of your account .
However , I might add confirmed domain locking to the list , that is , require approval through an independent email address or cellphone text message before anyone can unlock the domain .
Changes to approval email addresses also should use the same approval process .
So for example , no changes should be made to my account email address without affirmative approval via that email address .
The current standard system , which at best sends out a “ email address has changed ” message , that ’s inadequate for domain security , because a secure system is only as strong as its weakest link .
Even registrars of high - profile domains such as Amazon.com , BarnesAndNoble.com , and Coke.com do n’t offer services like these .
And some high profile domains ( such as Comcast.net ) have indeed been hijacked .
Fortunately , if you ’re Amazon or Coke , you can probably get your domain back pretty quickly with a simple phone call .
But if you ’re not , you need a registrar that ’s going to stand up for you , no matter how small you are .
And you can expect it to take days at best , or weeks , or months , or years , or forever .
There are some additional safety measures you can take to slow up a thief trying to steal your domain :
Use a secret email address for your account email .
Always use a secure computer and encrypted connection to download email .
Use long , random passwords for each email and domain account .
Use secure secrets for any “ secret question , ” obscure facts that no one else can find out .
If you have multiple domain names or web holdings , split them up between multiple registrars and hosting services .
Use low - value domains for daily activities , if possible .
( So if someone steals away VL.com , your email will still continue uninterrupted through VentureLogic.com . )
Know how to get in touch with your registrar in an emergency , whether by phone , email , or web form , even if you ’ve been locked out of your account by an attacker .
Establish secure , authenticated communication channels with people you are likely to work with to resolve a crisis : obtain email certificates , exchange public keys , and set up secure IM .
At least ask yourself , “ Will that busty model come to my rescue when I have a problem with my domain ? ”
Unfortunately , as long as an attacker can trick the registrar to bypass security , neither strong passwords nor two - factor authentication nor double confirmation nor any other security measure will be effective .
Conceptually , you could even test a domain registrar .
Try to convince them to shortcut security for you , in order to make legitimate changes to your account .
And if they do , bolt .
I ca n’t comment on whether that ’s legal or not .
But as for me , I ’d be interested in a broad - based study of how tight security really is at the Internet ’s top domain registrars .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Homeowners have sued Bank of America Corp for allegedly reneging on a promise it made to modify troubled mortgages as a condition of accepting $ 25 billion of federal bailout money .
In a lawsuit filed Monday in Seattle federal court and seeking class - action status , two Washington residents allege the largest U.S. bank puts its own financial interests ahead of obligations to help struggling homeowners .
According to the complaint , Bank of America agreed to take part in the Treasury Department ’s $ 75 billion Home Affordable Modification Program , known as HAMP , because it accepted bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
But the complaint said Bank of America had an incentive not to modify loans because doing so might cause it to repurchase more loans , collect lower servicing fees , or assess lower default charges because fewer payments would be deemed late .
As a result , Bank of America “ has serially strung out , delayed , and otherwise hindered the modification processes , ” leaving thousands of borrowers “ often worse off than they were before they sought a modification , ” the complaint said .
The plaintiffs Kamie and Daniel Kahlo alleged that they sought to modify their mortgage after their annual income fell to $ 20,000 , too low to cover their $ 1,460 monthly payments .
They said Bank of America advised them to become delinquent so they would qualify , and that they then signed an agreement to cut their monthly payments almost in half .
Nevertheless , they alleged that despite their making the lowered monthly payments , which were cashed , Bank of America served them with a default notice and failed to provide final modification documents .
A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment , saying the bank had not been served with the lawsuit .
The Charlotte , North Carolina - based lender has repaid the $ 25 billion of bailout money .
The complaint seeks class - action status , an order for Bank of America to perform its obligations under HAMP , compensatory and other damages , and other remedies .
The case is Kahlo v. Bank of America NA et al , U.S. District Court , Western District of Washington , No. 10-00488 .
The U.S. Status Quo : Unsustainable , Doomed and Danced Out
( April 5 , 2010 )
Socks which do n't even last one day and 20 % increases in Government fees are symptomatic of why the U.S. status quo is doomed .
Journalism avoids personal observation in favor of opinions from media - approved " experts , " but sometimes experiential evidence offers more telling clues to the future than " expert / professional " models or projections .
The story of an Empire 's inevitable decline might start with a single pair of socks .
The story begins and ends at Wal - Mart ( last discussed here in The Wal - Mart Model of Self - Destruction : Lowest Prices , Always January 24 , 2010 ) .
Our friends '
Christmas gift was alas not to our needs or taste , so we returned the gift to Wal - Mart and received an in - store credit .
Since my work socks were developing holes after years of service , we reckoned we could use the credit on new socks and a collander to replace the rusted piece of Chinese - manufactured junk we 'd received as a gift from another friend .
The selection of standard white work socks was not large but there was a choice between a brand made in Central America and one which was made in the USA ( assuming the labeling was accurate ) , so I bought the package made in the USA .
I went home , opened the package , pulled on a pair and went out to do the afternoon 's light duties and a leisurely 1 kilometer walk to cap the day .
When I returned home and took off the socks , one had a large hole on the heel .
The " made in USA " socks had not even lasted a full day .
As for the stainless steel collander ( made in India ) , it too failed to perform its simple function ; due to poor design , water did not flow through its tiny holes but sloshed around the lower steel band of the collander .
Both items will be returned and I am now hoping to use the Wal - Mart credit for corn flakes or equivalent simple food item which hopefully will not be defective / useless .
I think I know what happened with the " made in USA " socks , and it's what I call the Tyranny of Price .
Wal - Mart famously demands annual price reductions from its suppliers , regardless of any other conditions such as quality .
The working presumption is that though you will lose money on each item sold to Wal - Wart , you will make it up on volume ( that 's a small - business joke ; if you 're losing money on each sale , then high volumes will simply bankrupt you faster . )
So Wal - Mart probably squeezed this supplier for additional price cuts , and the only way to retain the Wal - Mart account and not go bankrupt was to lower the quality of the thread and manufacture of the sock to the point that the heel wore out in approximately two hours of use .
Wal - Mart obviously did n't care and did n't check the quality of either item we purchased .
The real losers are U.S. consumers who have been conned into believing that " Low prices , always " is " cheaper " when in fact low quality is always costlier .
The cost - per useage of my previous socks ( purchased at Costco , locale of manufacture unknown ) was on the order of fractions of one cent ; the per use cost of the Wal - Mart sock was almost a dollar .
Since the collander could not perform its assigned task , it provided no use - value for even a single use .
It was entirely worthless except as a piece of perforated metal .
Wal - Mart , and by extension , America , has a functional obsolescence problem .
Selling defective , zero - quality goods , even those " made in USA , " means that vast amounts of money spent by consumers is being squandered .
Money wasted on socks which fall apart in one wearing means money was wasted on their manufacture , shipping , inventorying , sale and return , and the hapless consumer has either wasted their money or their time when forced to return the useless product to Wal - Mart for a credit .
Now there may be quality goods being offered for sale in Wal - Mart ; I make no claim to a rigorous analysis , and would guess that there must be good - quality goods somewhere in the store .
But it is certainly strking that the two products chosen more or less at random were both complete wastes of money and time .
Added together with millions of similarly defective / low - quality / useless goods , this is malinvestment on a vast scale .
Add in the granite countertops in millions of falling - apart McMansions , empty malls , vacant highrises , hundreds of needless " profit center " MRI machines , etc. and we have a nation which has misinvested trillions of dollars which are now lost to productive investment elsewhere .
No economy can recover from this scale of malinvestment .
Borrowing trillions more to squander on Empire , real estate and " consumer spending " will not bring back the previously squandered trillions .
One other bit of personal experience : our dear city just jacked up the refuse collection fees it charges its residents another 20 % , on top of the 20 % increase it levied last year .
40 % in about one year is n't " inflationary , " at least statistically , though it certainly transfers hundreds of dollars a year from thousands of households into the coffers of city bureaucracies and union workers and their pension funds .
The second 20 % increase was necessitated , it seems , because stripmined residents had responded to last year 's 20 % increase by reducing the size of their trash containers ( fees are based on the volume of each container ) and recycling more of their waste .
The ironies of this increase in recycling abound .
The city claims its most cherished goal is to reduce the stream of landfill garbage , but when citizens did so then their reward is a 40 % increase in their garbage collection fees .
You might think that a major reduction in trash by volume might require fewer workers or fewer hours to collect , but apparently no staffing cuts can be made anywhere in the city payroll .
Since residents have already moved to smaller bins , their options to evade the next 20 % increase and the ones after that are limited to moving away or joining a tax rebellion which throws the current city management out the door .
Though we live in a state ( California ) which limits property tax increases to 1 % per year , politicos and their various Masters and protected fiefdoms have evaded this limitation via " tyranny of the majority " measures passed by local residents who are always delighted to have someone else pay for further amenities and improvements .
Since residents who bought their homes decades ago -- and there are many -- pay very modest property taxes based on super - low valuations ( also limited by Prop 13 ) , a " tiny " tax increase based on a percentage of their low valuation adds little to their tax bills .
And so they ( and non-property owning residents ) have been happy to pass every tax and every bond , though their enthusiasm for ever - more generous funding for the local politicos and their builder / developer allies seems to be waning slightly .
1/10 % on a house valued at $ 90,000 on the tax assessment rolls is " only " $ 90 a year to do something worthy ( rebuild the public pool , fund library improvements , etc. ) .
But their young neighbor who paid $ 600,000 for a similar house next door faces a $ 600 increase - - not trivial .
In this incremental way , our property taxes have leaped from around $ 9,700 annually to $ 11,000 in just two years .
Friends who bought near the top of the bubble pay an astronomical $ 15,000 to $ 18,000 annually .
Their neighbors pay a third or less .
If increases of this magnitude are occurring in Prop 13 - protected California , I shudder to think what increases lie ahead for those without any limitations on property tax increases .
If I have to read Paul Krugman or another Keynesian palaver on once more about how Californians pay such low taxes , I might suffer a serious loss of good humor .
Even as the Empire is beset by monstrous malinvestments in the homeland , $ 300 / gallon gasoline at the end of the Imperial supply chain in Afghanistan , marginal returns on the trillions awarded to banks and " shovel - ready " pork projects , we also pay the hidden costs of the Tyranny of Price and the Tyranny of the Majority .
I know this might seem unbelievable , but I just did the research and can report that the bottom 60 % of U.S. households ( by income ) pay about 1 % of the Federal income taxes effective tax rates ( CBO ) .
The top 10 % pay roughly 2/3 and the top 20 % pay 83 % .
While the top 1 % has seen their effective tax rate decline , the 19 % beneath them who pay the vast majority of taxes have not enjoyed any such reduction in burden .
( Disclosure : my 2008 gross income was $ 30,713 . )
It 's awfully easy to shout " tax the rich ! " but households making $ 100,000 on the Left and Right coasts do n't feel wealthy , not when their property tax bill is $ 15,000 .
Yes , they could be renting , but rents are outrageous here , too .
So while the lower - income 60 % get ripped off by low - quality " tyranny of price " goods and local government stripmining via speeding tickets and garbage collection fees , the top 20 % are getting stripmined by myriad " tyranny of the majority " tax increases approved by recipients of State largesse who cannot face any possible reduction in their swag .
This culture - wide denial is partly fueled by what I term permanent adolescence in Survival + : the inability to make the realistic assessments and tradeoffs required by adulthood .
Frequent contributor Harun I. recently made these observations about this deep societal immaturity / denial : I had an interesting encounter with an middle school educator last weekend .
She is nearing retirement and is worried about the talk of altering their benefits .
I presented the argument that , while there may be a contract , there is no reasonable way of fulfilling it .
By her body language I could tell she had no interest in the math , logic , or reality .
She hopes that there will be an offer to buy them out before the worst hits .
Right then I understood that , in the same vein of " We are all Keynesians now " , we are all interested persons now .
While you and many bloggers write perfervidly about what must be done , there is no stomach for it amongst the masses .
The greater than 60 % of the population who are homeowners have no interest whatsoever in seeing their home values plummet .
Workers , renters and homeowners care not to see their 401 K 's destroyed , their pensions bankrupted , etc. because they have no savings , no plan B , and face poverty if what must happen happens .
Was Chuck Prince being arrogant or merely stating reality on a much broader scale than was at first realized when he uttered these infamous words :
 When the music stops , in terms of liquidity , things will be complicated .
But as long as the music is playing , youve got to get up and dance .
We re still dancing , ?
For 90 % or more of Americans and much of the developed western world the music has stopped but there is the mass delusion that , if we keep dancing , the fact that there is no music will not matter .
However , refusing to submit to the rules of the game does not make you the winner .
There will be no concerted cry of havoc and unleashing of the dogs of deflation because , just as Wall Street , Main Street will see its interests destroyed .
This administration and congress will be allowed to do whatever it wishes , and the public , like the deer in my earlier analogy , may grumble but will go about grazing with the hopes that they will not become a victim of the Great De-leveraging .
In the post - industrial , exponential debt growth dependent economy , the fate of Main Street is shackled to that of Wall Street .
I am greatly saddened by this general attitude .
I have served with and know that there are kids serving today that , without a nano - second of hesitation , would expose themselves in a firefight , risking everything they have , to aid a fallen comrade .
Is this great nation still great with such pervasive moral cowardice ?
Thank you , Harun , for these unvarnished assessments .
I am reminded of the Beatles ' song I , Me , Mine .
Perhaps that will be the anthem of the next decade as everyone scrambles to protect their swag and perquisites at the expense of some other less politically adept group of citizens , until the entire system freezes up and the dancers suddenly notice the music stopped playing a long time ago .

With a group of white supremacists yet to show up for a planned rally on the lawn of City Hall , at least two people have been injured in a steadily growing crowd of counter - protesters -- developments that prompted the Los Angeles Police Department to enter tactical alert .
Some 150 white supremacists are scheduled to rally at the City Hall 's north lawn at 1:30 p.m .
More than 300 counter - protesters began to assemble there several hours earlier .
Just before noon , a bare - chested , middle - aged man with Nazi insignias tattooed to his chest and back entered a crowd of counter - demonstrators near the corner of First and Spring streets .
Counter - demonstrators surrounded him , chanting , " Nazi scum . "
One pushed a sign in his face and another jostled him .
He was bobbing his head mockingly as the crowd chanted , when pushing suddenly broke out and about a dozen protesters began showering him with punches and kicks as he fell .
The wood handle of one sign was smashed so hard into his back it snapped .
Other protesters tried to protect the man .
" You ca n't fight hate with hate , " shouted one .
After about a 15 - second beating , an undercover police officer began shouting and flashed his badge .
He pulled the man , bleeding from a gaping wound in the back of his neck , from the mob and past the yellow tape blocking the protesters .
In another area , a woman collapsed and was taken away by paramedics .
It was not clear why she had collapsed .

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn - by - turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone , although the features could come in the future to other ( unspecified ) mobile platforms .
Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn - by - turn navigation to other mobile platforms , including the iPhone , during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K..
" We did not say we would bring it to iPhone , we said to date we 've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not conf irm this will be coming to iPhone at all , " a Google spokesperson told PCWorld .
In Android 2.0 , Google introduced Maps Navigation , which includes 3D maps , turn - by - turn voice guidance , and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user .
Available initially only in the U.S. , the software does not store the maps on your phone , but uses the Internet connection to display routes .
However , Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android .
Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route , and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions .
So , while driving to your destination , if you lose the connection temporarily , the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route .
Free turn - by - turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers , to the detriment of traditional GPS device makers like TomTom or Garmin .
Next to Google 's Maps Navigation , now available in both U.S. and U.K. , Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices , and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times .

Remember back to last fall , when the whole Toyota recall mess started to unfold ?
And do you recall that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration horrified many observers , us included , by saying it had no software or electrical engineers on staff ?
Well , our elected officials took note .
Yesterday , in the wake of the Toyota incidents , bills were circulated in the House and Senate that would rewrite auto - safety regulations , give the NHTSA new powers , and greatly expand its enforcement budget .
Among other powers , the Agency could order a carmaker to recall , stop selling , and / or stop building vehicles that it found to pose an " imminent hazard of death or serious injury . "
Under the House bill , drafted by Representatives Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) and Bobby Rush ( D - IL ) , NHTSA 's enforcement budget would increase to $ 280 million by 2013 .
To fund this , every new car sale would have a fee added : $ 3 in the bill 's first year , $ 6 the second year , and then $ 9 the third year , with increases at the rate of inflation thereafter .
That $ 9 would represent 0.05 percent of the cost of a $ 20,000 new car .
The bill would also mandate event - data recorders ( " black boxes " ) on all new vehicles within two years , as well as brake - override software that cuts power to the engine if both accelerator and brake pedals are being pushed at the same time .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Thursday .
A draft of a broadly similar Senate bill is being circulated by Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) .

Update : Conservative blogger objects to being quoted as example of “ Anarchist side , ” asks for correction
It ’s war !
Or at least that ’s the word being employed by the right - wing blogosphere to describe anarchist groups ’ plans to “ crash ” the Tea Party movement ’s Tax Day demonstrations on April 15 .
“ Anarchists plan war on April 15th Tea Parties , ” reads a headline at Gateway Pundit .
The Fox Nation Web site links to that story using the same headline .
ADVERTISEMENT
But is it war the anarchists are planning ?
Not according to the blog posting that started it all : A call to action at the anarchist news site Infoshop , urging people to “ Crash the Tea Parties ! ”
“ If the tea party movement continues to grow in size and strength there is a big chance they will dominate this country in the near future , ” the posting implores .
“ If the tea party movement takes over this country they will really hurt poor people by getting rid of social programs like food stamps , unemployment benefits , disability benefits , student aid , free health care , etc . ”
Infoshop outlines “ three options ” for challenging the Tea Party movement : Organizing counter - protests on Tax Day ; handing out leaflets at Tea Party events to convince some of them to change their views ; and “ ignoring the Tea Party movement , ” which it suggests is “ the worst option . ”
Nowhere in that list is any suggestion of violence — or “ war , ” as some bloggers would have it — but that did n’t stop a number of commenters at Gateway Pundit from promising to come to the protests armed .
“ IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll wear my hard hat and carry my ‘ little friend ’ under a jacket , ” promises commenter “ Tom Mannis , ” in the first response to the Gateway Pundit article .

“ Be aware anarchists , you WILL be HUGELY outnumbered , ” writes “ Rick Mercer ” at Fox Nation .
“ You wo n’t have the numbers you like to help yourself feel anonymous .
And some of us DO legally carry concealed weapons to protect our rights .
MAKE MY DAY , PUNK ! ”
For its part , the anarchist side seems to be taking a different tack .
“ Bring your video cameras to every single tea party rally you may attend in the future , with extra batteries and more memory than you think you need , ” writes blogger “ Russ ” at The Resistance .
“ Don ’t … fight … back .
If they yell , yell back .
If they rant , rant back .
If they push or punch … make sure it was on tape , smile and tell them they ’re on Tea Party Camera . ”

Update :
In a comment left on this story , conservative blogger Russell Cote pointed out that he is far from being a member of “ the Anarchist side ” and requested that Raw Story provide a correction to the above paragraph , which cites “ Russ ” as offering the advice to anarchists that he was actually quoting sarcastically .
Cote , whose own blog is That ’s Right : A Conservative Madman ’s Conversations with Himself , writes , “ I ’m sorry you and nobody else got the joke but your site is getting a little out of control with the loons and I am holding you personally responsible for any shenanigans that go on .
A simple correction is all I ’m asking for . ”
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd merupakan perusahaan yang bergerak pada perangkat telekomunikasi dan jaringan komunikasi terbesar di Cina bahkan dunia .
Menurut berita teknologi , awal berdiri perusahaan ini pada tahun 1988 oleh Ren Zhengfei .
Ternyata , perjalanan karir Huawei juga memiliki perjalanan yang cukup panjang untuk diakui seperti saat ini .
Huawei hadir untuk pertama kalinya seperti halnya dengan perusahaan lainnya yang hanya bermodal kecil dan belum memiliki jati diri yang pasti .
Awalnya , perusahaan tersebut hanya sebagai agen switchboard buatan dari Hongkong .
Kemudian Ren , pendiri Huawei tersebut mengubahnya menjadi perusahaan hi-tech di bidang R&D , produksi , pemasaran peralatan telekomunikasi serta tempat memberikan solusi terhadap jaringan .
Namun , yang menjadi kelebihan dari sistem yang digunakan oleh Ren adalah tetap menghadirkan harga yang murah sehingga terjangkau oleh semua orang .
Menurut harga hp Huawei , teknik ini dilakukan Ren untuk mendapatkan hasil laba yang banyak , benar saja yang awalnya bermodal tak sampai US $ 4 ribu kemudian berkembang pesat hingga sekarang .
Untuk tahun 2000 saja , Huawei hanya mempekerjakan kurang dari 20.000 orang di seluruh dunia , termasuk di Indonesia .
Pada tahun 2000 , pegawei Huawei di Indonesia hanya segelemintir orang yang bertugas untuk mengenalkan Huawei di perusahaan - perusahaan besar .
Dan pada akhirnya membuahkan hasil pada tahun 2003 memenangkan National Wide GSM Network Project dari operator XL .
Di tahun yang sama , di ranah Internasional dalam tender untuk pembangunan jaringan nirkabel 3G di Emirat Arab , Huawei berhasil mengalahkan 6 nama besar termasuk Alcatel dan Siemens .
Akhirnya setelah tahun 2004 , Huawei mulai diakui dan mengalami peningkatan penjualan .
Dibuktikan pada tahun 2005 yang menyentuh angka 47 % sehingga penjualan Huawei mencapai US $ 8,2 miliar sehingga menghasilkan pendapatan sebesar US$ 5,2 miliar .
Penghasilan ini ternyata Huawei dapatkan dari 60 % negara maju seperti Amerika Serikat , Negara - negara dari Eropa Barat , Brasil , Rusia dan Singapura .
Setahun kemudian , Huawei mendapatkan keuntungan yang cukup membanggakan , pasalnya pedapatkan yang didapatkan oleh Huawei meningkat 30 % dan menyentuh angka US$ 7,8 miliar .
Perlahan tapi pasti , akhirnya Huawei menjadi pemasok digital terbesar switches dan next generation network .
Di tahun 2007 , Huawei memproduksi ponsel dengan pangsa pasar perangkat low - end .
Namun tidak berhenti dari situ saja , Huawei terus mengembangkan ponsel sesuai dengan kebutuhan pasar namun tetap menawarkan harga yang terjangkau .
Huawei mengalami masa emasnya mulai dari tahun 2008 yang ditandai dengan memenangkan kontrak proyek senilai US $ 23,3 miliar pada tahun 2008 .
Dan menariknya bahwa Huawei merupakan perusahaan yang tetap mempertahankan untuk mendaftarkan paten sampai pada tahun 2009 .
Akhirnya dengan segala inovasi dibidang ponsel , Huawei mulai memasuki pasar Amerika Latin dengan kinerja reconfigurable SingleRAN .
Bahkan , pada tahun 2009 tersebut Huawei juga sudah membekali diri dengan teknologi berstandar LTE .
Jaringan internet tersebut memang belum booming pada tahun tersebut dan kebanyakan smartphone masih menggerakkan jaringan 2G dan 3G .
Yang pada akhirnya meningkatkan pendapatan Huawei hingga US $ 21,8 miliar .
Dan pada tahun 2009 , Huawei meraih prestasi kembali dengan menjadi peringkat pertama untuk Mobile Softswitch dengan menguasai 39 % market .
Sedangkan untuk RAN Huawei mendapatkan peringkat kedua dengan 21 % market , selain itu Huawei juga mendapatkan peringkat pertama untuk Mobile Broadband Network Provider Huawei dengan pangsa pasar 28 % .
Tentu dengan berkembangnya perangkat asal China tersebut tidak lepas dari riset tenaga ahli .
Bahkan Huawei memiliki gedung riset dan pengembangan sendiri yang terletak di Shanghai , China .
Gedung tersebut mempekerjakan 8000 pegawai yang didominasi oleh pekerja riset dan pengembangan .
Seperti yang telah diketahui bahwaHuawei telah memasuki ranah pasar internasional yang mana memiliki sasaran negara maju .
Walaupun begitu , nyatanya Huawei juga menargetkan untuk ranah pasar negara berkembang termasuk di Indonesia .
Sempat disinggung bahwa Huawei telah masuk ke Indonesia pada tahun 2000 yang mempunyai Representative office bernama PT .
Huawei Tech Investment .
Sampai saat ini , Huawei telah memproduksi ratusan smartphone yang selalu mengalami inovasi yang menyesuaikan dengan kebutuhan pasar .
Produk smartphone juga sudah bisa dijumpai di Indonesia bahkan dalam varian terbarunya .
The man who mysteriously wears an astronaut suit to nearly every home game of the Washington Capitals is Geoff Dawson , a local bar mogul who co-owns a spaceship - themed bar in Chinatown , the Daily Caller has determined .
Dawson and business partner Mark Handwerger own Bedrock Management Group , which owns and operates four Buffalo Billiards locations , Atomic Billiards , Aroma , two Carpool locations , two Mackey ’s and the space - themed Rocket Bar , among others .
According to a 1999 Washington Post article , Dawson attended high school in Washington , D.C .
Dawson was photographed for an interview Washington Business Journal .
His face clearly resembles the face behind the Capstronaut mask , courtesy of a Fox 5 interview with the Capstronaut .
Dawson did not return phone calls seeking comment .
The Capstronaut is well - known and loved by many Caps fans , but the man behind the suit has remained a mystery until now .
Dawson has repeatedly declined to name himself in media interviews .
The Daily Caller would like to extend an opportunity to Mr. Dawson for an op - ed under his Capstronaut hat , our publisher , Neil Patel said .
Other things you did n’t know about the Capital ’s loss to Montreal in game one of their round one playoff series :
‘ Horn Guy ’ In Fist Fight
Sam Wolk , who toots the horn three times from Section 415 to conjure a corresponding “ Lets Go Caps ! ” from the raucous crowd at the Verizon Center , was involved in a fist fight during overtime .
The author , who holds season tickets in Wolk ’s section , witnessed the skirmish .
A man one row down from Wolk attacked him , and the two briefly fought .
Authorities quickly stepped in .
Both the unnamed assailant and Wolk left their seats afterwards .
Wolk missed roughly the last ten minutes of the game , which must have been difficult , knowing what a super fan he is .
It ’s Not A Real Burrito
Every Capitals game at the Verizon Center , Chipotle runs as promotion in which Caps mascot Slap Shot and some the scantily - clad Caps cheerleaders travel to one section of the crowd to throw them Chipotle burritos .
The author and fans nearby had long waited for their chance to snatch a burrito , thinking it would make a nice substitute for the dinner they often skipped to arrive in time to see the game .
Finally , after a season of waiting , the promotion arrived at Section 415 .
But the thrill of catching a foil wrapped burrito - shaped object was crushed when , upon unwrapping the item , fans realized the object is not a burrito at all , but a t - shirt wrapped in foil !
The package includes a gift card to Chipotle , which presumably includes enough money to buy a burrito at a nearby Chipotle restaurant .
Many fans in Section 415 were shocked and disappointed , to say the least .
Stress of Game One Overwhelms Fans
Beyond the fist fight between “ horn guy ” and unnamed assailant , the stress of the overtime loss to Montreal seemed to have ripped the social fabric of the Verizon Center scene .
Leaving the building , patrons observed what appeared to be a breakup between a departing man and woman .
“ Do n’t f*** ing touch me ! ” said the male , in his twenties , to a woman also in her twenties , who cried and lamented , “ why ? ”

The Department of Education recently updated its
dataset on college degrees by gender
, with actual data through the 2007 - 2008 academic year , and projected data through the 2018 - 2019 academic year ) .
The chart above shows the reversal between the 1966 - 1967 academic year and the 2018 - 2019 year for the percentage of all college degrees by gender : from 61 % of all college degrees in 1966 - 1967 awarded to men , to a projected 61 % of all college degrees in 2018 - 2019 awarded to women .
The last year of gender parity for college degrees was 1981 , and in almost every year since then , women have increased their share of all college degrees .
The chart below shows more detailed degree data by gender for this year 's Class of 2010 and the Class of 2019 ( both are estimates ) :
The only degree category where men are currently slightly overrepresented ( 50.6 % ) is for " First - Professional Degrees , " which includes M.D. , D.D.S. , and law degrees .
The Department of Education estimates that by 2014 - 2015 there will be more women than men earning those degrees , and by 2018 - 2019 women will earn 51 % of those degrees ( see chart above ) .
There are hundreds , if not thousands , of University and College Women 's Centers across the country , here is a partial list .
A Google search of " College Women 's Centers " finds almost 6,000 links on the Web .
A Google search of " College Men 's Centers " finds almost no links on the Internet ( a few hundred , now inlcuding this post ) , and asks the question : Did you mean : " College Women 's Centers " ?
The first search points to a book titled "
University and College Women's Centers
: A Journey toward Equity " :
" This handbook provides insights from women 's center directors at institutions across the country on how best to build a women 's center that can improve the quality of women 's experiences in college .
The best centers aid universities and colleges in responding to particularly difficult challenges in higher education related to gender . "
Questions :
1 . Now that women completely dominate higher education at almost every degree level and men have clearly become the " second sex " in U.S. higher education , is n't there a greater need for thousands of " Men 's Centers " on college campuses than " Women 's Centers " to help address the challenges males face completing college and help improve the quality of men's experiences in college ?
2. Did n't the " journey toward equity " that is mentioned in the book title above end back in 1981 when women started earning a greater share of college degrees than men ?
3 . If the best college Women 's Centers " respond to particularly difficult challenges in higher education related to gender , " will they now turn their attention to the apparent difficult challenges men are having completing college degrees at the same rate as women ?
The Magic 8 Ball is getting a movie
Posted by : Brad Sturdivant
Before you even ask ; I do n’t know how they ’re going to do this either .
But Paramount feels strongly that Mattel ’s famous Magic 8 Ball is somehow a good subject of a major motion picture .
To me , this sounds like they ’re going to take an already existing script and work an 8 Ball into it somehow .
I ca n’t imagine a screenwriter sitting down trying to craft a story about a Magic 8 Ball from scratch .
To be fair , I thought it was ridiculous when Peter Berg was hired to direct a Battleship movie .
Not because you ca n’t make a movie about Battleships , but because there was no reason to call it “ Battleship ” and advertise that it ’s related to the board game .
The same thing goes here ; I ’m sure it ’s possible to make a movie with an 8 Ball a big part of it , but calling it “ Magic 8 Ball ” seems kind of tacky to me .

In an effort to address mounting criticism of the privacy issues surrounding Google Buzz , the search giant is going to ask all Buzz users to confirm or change their privacy settings tomorrow .
In an announcement that will be coming soon , Google will admit that they " did n't get everything right , " which has resulted in serious privacy tweaks since its launch .
However , many users were n't affected by these changes because they had activated Google Buzz before the privacy updates .
Now in a renewed effort to correct its gaffs , the search company is going to ask all Google Buzz users to confirm ( or change ) their Buzz settings .
This will be gradually rolled out tomorrow , but the result will be that every user will be prompted with a confirmation page the next time they click the Buzz tab .
It will look something like this :
The page is n't anything new — it 's really just the Google Buzz settings page .
However , Google 's taking a step in the right direction by giving every user a big opportunity to change their privacy settings .
It had to be done .
While tomorrow 's move wo n't fix the damage that has already been done , perhaps it 'll help get Congress off of its back .
If it can appease critics on the privacy issues , then it can tackle the bigger challenge : making Google Buzz into a competitive threat to Twitter and Facebook .

Ben Roethlisberger will not be charged for sexual assault over an alleged incident on March 5 in Milledgeville , Georgia .
According to prosecutor Fred Bright -- the alleged victim wrote a letter on March 17 , in which she stated that she no longer wanted to pursue the case .
During his investigation , Bright claims " everyone " agreed that both Ben and his accuser were highly intoxicated on March 5 when they went into the bathroom at Capital City nightclub .
Bright said there are still " significant questions about what occurred " in the bathroom ... but Ben will not be prosecuted .
Bright said after the alleged incident , the woman went to a local hospital where a doctor and two nurses examined her and found " a superficial laceration , " bruising and bleeding in the genital area .
Bright said the woman told doctors " a boy kinda raped me " -- but Bright said the doctor could not definitively say if the woman 's injuries were the result of a sexual assault .
'' At that time it was an orthopaedic boot sold 80 per cent to German women over the age of 40 .
They felt there was a bigger market but they needed a partner , hence the ad , '' says Roach , author of Dr Martens : The Story of an Icon .
On April 1 , 1960 , the first pair of Dr Martens - the name was anglicised , for ease of pronunciation - was produced by the Griggs factory in the village of Wollaston in central England .
With eight eyelets , ox blood red with distinctive yellow stitching , the new design was dubbed 1460 after the date of its creation .
Rather than middle - aged Germans , the target market for the new boot was working - class Britons seeking a more comfortable and cheaper alternative to other footwear firms ' rigid - soled leather offerings .
'' My grandfather was the first one to sell Dr Martens in the world .
We 've sold the brand for the longest , '' says Nick Romona , owner of the British Boot Company in the trendy north London borough of Camden .
'' It was good , strong , comfortable , affordable workwear for the average working men in Britain …
'' For a lot of [ those ] that picked up on them , like the punks and the skinheads , they were a good pair of solid , decent boots . ''
Within a few years the 1460 became an essential accessory for musicians wanting to play up their working - class links , including the Who's Pete Townshend , who was followed by dozens of other stars .
'' Usually when a new subculture appears , it gets rid of the symbols of the previous subculture .
But not the Doc Martens .
It stayed with the skinheads , the punks , the mods , the grunges and so on , '' says Roach .
Their status as a style icon remains to this day , he says : '' The Doc Martens ' DNA is the same as youth fashion , so it will never go away . ''
Romona adds : '' They appeal to everybody - whether a postman , a schoolboy , a nurse or a judge . ''
Michael is a doctor buying his first pair .
'' I do a lot of walking in my work and I often wear through shoes , probably about every year .
I just wanted a pair that would n't wear out on me and that would last a very long time , and the DMs do , '' he says .
German fortysomething Sabina Muller adds : '' I had my first Doc Martens when I was a 16 - year - old girl and they are still all right … I love them . ''
More than 100 million pairs of Dr Martens have been sold since that first pair was unveiled 50 years ago - although there are now some 250 different models , from golden to fuchsia , flowered to custom patterned .
But , in a sign of the times , almost all of them have been made in Asia since 2002 : only about 50 leave the factory in Wollaston every day , including the vintage 1460 model , made by 10 or so workers on old machines .
The shop in Camden has also become an icon for the Doc Martens faithful internationally .
'' It 's a very famous destination ; we get customers from all over the world , '' says Romona .
'' They want to come here to see where it all started .
They come from father to son … especially from Europe .
Their fathers will have bought their first DM boots in this store in the ' 70s and ' 80s .
'' I am personally very proud to be the grandson of the guy who first sold them . ''

The author of " Mark My Words : Mark Twain on Writing " ( 1996 ) and " Horton Foote 's The Shape of the River : the Lost Teleplay About Mark Twain " ( 2003 ) , Mark Dawidziak has presented academic papers at the last three State of Mark Twain conferences .
He has twice been the guest speaker for the Elmira College Center for Mark Twain Studies ' lecture series .
And he often portrays Twain in appearances with the touring troupe he co-founded , the Largely Literary Theater Company .
Halley 's Comet revisits our planet about every 75 years .
When Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born on Nov. 30 , 1835 , it was blazing across the night sky over his family 's cabin in the tiny Missouri town of Florida .
The world knew Sam Clemens by his pen name , Mark Twain .
And if you know much about Mark Twain , you probably know that , when he died on April 21 , 1910 , Halley 's Comet was visible in the night sky over his last home , Stormfield , near Redding , Conn .
Even more amazingly , this was a called shot .
" I came in with Halley 's Comet in 1835 , " Twain told a friend in 1909 .
" It is coming again next year , and I expect to go out with it .
It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I do n't go out with Halley 's Comet .
The Almighty has said , no doubt : ' Now here are these two unaccountable freaks ; they came in together , they must go out together . '
Oh , I am looking forward to that . "
So , 100 years ago this Wednesday , 74 - year - old Mark Twain packed up his white suit and cigars , climbed on the back of Halley 's Comet and pulled off the greatest stage exit in literary history .
" This is merely the centennial of his physical death , " said Robert H. Hirst , general editor of the vast Mark Twain Papers collection at the University of California at Berkeley .
" Mark Twain was very forthright in saying he was no great believer in life after death .
But there 's no question he has achieved immortality through what he wrote .
Mark
Twain is more alive today and in more ways than any other writer . "
About 13 years before Twain 's actual departure from this globe , a rumor went around that he was near death .
So a reporter dispatched to cover Twain 's impending death was as surprised to find him alive and well as the author was to hear that he was supposed to be dying .
Twain famously suggested that the reports of his death had been greatly exaggerated .
" Turns out , he was right , " said comedy legend Carl Reiner , who received the Kennedy Center 's Mark Twain Prize in 2001 .
" The truth is , he never went away .
People have never stopped turning to him as a source of wisdom and common sense .
And every once in a while , somebody rightly notices that ' Huckleberry Finn ' is the closest thing we have to the great American novel . "
Symbolically , therefore , as soon as we pass Wednesday 's 100th anniversary of Twain 's death , we move ever closer to the 175th anniversary of his birth .
And 2010 also marks the 125th anniversary of the American publication of " Huckleberry Finn . "
A former Mississippi riverboat pilot and a failed miner , Sam Clemens adopted the pen name Mark Twain as a frontier reporter in February 1863 .
His early fame was built on his formidable talents as a humorist , but , while wit and satire remained writing weapons of choice throughout Twain 's life , his work took on increasingly dark and complex hues .
" He remains the most - quoted American writer because he said so many quotable , pithy things , " said Shelley Fisher Fishkin , the Twain scholar who has authored such landmark books as " Was Huck Black ? : Mark Twain and African - American Voices " and " Lighting Out for the Territory : Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture . "
" But he also gets away with telling us unpleasant truths about ourselves .
We 'll take it from Mark Twain because , although brutally honest , he is n't malevolent .
You get the idea that , no matter how foolish we are , he wo n't abandon us . "
Fishkin has gathered other writers ' opinions of Twain in the recently published " The Mark Twain Anthology . "
" Twain understood the humor of creatures who paid lip service to ideals that they constantly violated , " she said .
" Dick Gregory has one of the most cogent observations in the ' Anthology , ' saying that Twain ' was so far ahead of his time that he should n't even be talked about on the same day as other people . '
Another is from Richard Wright : ' Twain hid his conflict in satire and wept in private over the brutalities and the injustices of his civilization . ' "
Twain 's first best seller was the travel book " The Innocents Abroad " ( 1869 ) .
It was followed by " Roughing It " ( 1872 ) , " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " ( 1876 ) , " The Prince and the Pauper " ( 1881 ) , " Life on the Mississippi " ( 1883 ) , " Huckleberry Finn , " " A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court " ( 1889 ) and " Pudd' nhead Wilson " ( 1894 ) .
Many of his darker writings were published long after his death in such volumes as " Mark Twain in Eruption " and " Letters From the Earth . "
" One of the things I 'm most proud of is my recording of ' Letters From the Earth , ' " said Reiner , who also recorded a CD version of " A Connecticut Yankee . "
" And ' A Connecticut Yankee ' is what started me reading .
I read it while I was on ' Your Show of Shows ' in the early 1950s .
I was never a big reader before that .
I read the baseball scores .
But it was one of the great experiences of my life . "
Reiner continually extolled Twain 's virtues in a writers ' room that included Neil Simon , Mel Brooks and Larry Gelbart .
" I made everybody read it , " he said .
" The Mark Twain Prize was the greatest award I ever received .
It 's the only award I keep in my den . "
To Ohio native William Dean Howells , Twain was nothing less than " the Lincoln of our literature . "
To William Faulkner , he was " the first truly great American writer . "
To Eugene O'Neill , he was " the true father of American literature . "
And Ernest Hemingway , of course , declared that " all modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called ' Huckleberry Finn . ' "
" What Ernest Hemingway recognized was that ' Huckleberry Finn ' was n't just the wellspring of all modern American literature , it was America 's literary Declaration of Independence , " Fishkin said .
" It was a book no Englishman could have written , and it expanded the possibilities of what a novel could do . "
" Huckleberry Finn " also continues to kick up controversy , with its use of the n-word and its treatment of black characters sparking demands for it to be removed from libraries and required reading lists .
" ' Huckleberry Finn ' makes us uncomfortable because it should make us uncomfortable , " Fishkin said .
" Twain is challenging us in honest and compelling ways to grapple with these painful chapters of our past , and that 's still controversial .
And well it should be , because debating this book is a very useful exercise for our nation .
That 's another reason Twain 's work is so alive to us today .
" It 's quirky , ambitious and strikingly original , but it also engages many of the thorny issues we 're still grappling with today , not the least of which is the great contradiction of a nation founded on freedom by men who owned slaves .
I think Toni Morrison gets to the heart of this in her magnificent introduction to the Oxford Mark Twain edition of ' Huckleberry Finn . ' "
Morrison wrote : " What it can not be is dismissed .
It is classic literature , which is to say it heaves , manifests and lasts . "
Filmmaker Ken Burns , who made a documentary about Twain , could n't agree more : " Russell Banks said in our film that Twain identified the two great issues of the American story : race and space .
And he 's still making us confront those issues . "
Twain also asked Americans to confront the pursuit of the almighty dollar , runaway greed , political corruption , prejudice and hypocrisy .
" For a man dead 100 years , he certainly has a lot to say to us , " said Cleveland native Hal Holbrook , who has been touring his acclaimed one - man show , " Mark Twain Tonight ! " , since 1954 .
" The man 's ability to nail the body of deception and half - lies and corrupt intelligence to the wall is extraordinary .
I love Twain 's attacks on petrified thoughts and secondhand opinions .
I like to make people think -- to use Mark Twain to get people out of their partisan ruts and see something bigger . "
The reports of Mark Twain 's death also have been greatly exaggerated because the scholarship built up around him is so alive .
" It 's very much the study of a living presence , " Berkeley 's Hirst said .
" We are finding new Mark Twain letters at a rate of two a week .
And that should continue .
He wrote at least 50,000 letters , and we have only 10,000 of them . "
Twain once observed that humor must teach and preach if it will live forever .
This is yet another reason he 's still alive .
" He remains funny 100 years after his death , " Hirst said .
" Why is a blue - jay human ?
Twain tells us that the blue - jay is human because he lies , he cheats , he steals , he swears , he can't keep his word .
Well , nobody is attacking humans there , right ?
He 's just explaining what blue - jays are .
He 's making fun of things that are eternal .
He attacks things that are still of concern to us , and he does it so well , we still smile . "
Twain said that the problem with the world is n't that there are too many fools , it 's that lightning is n't distributed properly .
" That was funny in the 19th century , it 's funny in the 21st century , and it will be funny , if we do n't blow ourselves up , 1,000 years from now , " Burns said .
" Our greatest American author ?
I do n't even know a close second .
Anyone vying for second , whether you 're talking Melville or Fitzgerald , he lapped them several times over . "
My curiosity over the house next door .
Eurozone countries are still at loggerheads on bailing out the southern European nation , with Germany believed to be in conflict with other countries in the single currency over how much interest to charge on the emergency loans package .
Germany wants interest rates of 6 pc to 6.5 pc , with other countries willing to accept 4 pc to 4.5 pc interest .
If you can't beat 'em , have Congress hobble 'em .
That 's the motto of some in corporate America , and Exhibit A might be United Parcel Service 's campaign to get Washington to impose its labor woes on rival Federal Express .
This would be one more union bailout at the expense of business competition and economic efficiency .
House Transportation Chairman James Oberstar ( D. , Big Labor ) last year slipped 230 words into a spending bill that would make it easier for the Teamsters to unionize FedEx .
This ambush ...
Apple ’s iPad arrives in stores tomorrow and reviewers agree that it ’s a magic revolutionary new class of computer .
But you should n’t buy one .
Not yet , anyway .
Let ’s break this down .
First - generation Apple products are for suckers .
Only lemmings with no self - control and excessive disposable income buy first generation Apple products , especially in a new gadget category .
When they do , they pay the double the price for immature hardware and software .
Remember the iPhone ?
It debuted in 2007 with two models priced at $ 500 and $ 600 , with no native applications–only mobile Web apps , few of which came in an iPhone - friendly format at launch because it was such a new device .
A year later , in 2008 , a faster iPhone 3G went on sale for $ 300 less , with native application support .
At the time , there were n’t very many native applications because it was a brand new application platform .
Finally , last summer , the iPhone 3GS–a beefy , snappy phone for the same price as the 3 G –actually ran a huge catalog of native apps a few versions old at a reasonable speed .
The 3G is now on sale for a measly $ 100 , one fifth of the price of the first generation ’s cheapest model .
Do n’t be the guy who bought the first - gen iPad when Apple slashes the 2011 iPad price in half .
Next year ’s iPad will be faster , cheaper , less buggy , and have better apps and worthy competitors .
Let all the deep - pocketed Jobs apostles be your canaries into the iPad coalmine .
Give developers time to fix their apps to work well on the iPad .
Give Apple a year to lower prices on faster hardware and fill in all the gaping feature holes .
( Remember how long early iPhone owners lived without copy and paste ? )
people will always say how calvin and hobbes was their early comic inspiration , but i never read C&H .
Far Side was the one I read all the time and loved dearly .
Thank you Gary Larson for pushing me into what I am doing now .

The Only Democracy in the Middle East™ , right ?
Wrong .
Tel Aviv University ’s Steinmetz Center published an important opinion survey about Israeli Jewish attitudes toward free speech and civil liberties when they harm Israel ’s reputation or that of the IDF .
The poll was taken against the backdrop of the Kamm - Blau case and the smear campaign against the New Israel Fund .
Anyone who supports the possibility of democracy in this country must be positively demoralized by the results :
The pollsters surveyed 500 Jewish Israelis who can be considered a representative sample of the adult Jewish population .
They found that 57.6 percent of the respondents agreed that human rights organizations that expose immoral conduct by Israel should not be allowed to operate freely .
Slightly more than half agreed that “ there is too much freedom of expression ” in Israel .
The poll also found that most of the respondents favor punishing Israeli citizens who support sanctioning or boycotting the country , and support punishing journalists who report news that reflects badly on the actions of the defense establishment .
Another 82 percent of respondents said they back stiff penalties for people who leak illegally obtained information exposing immoral conduct by the defense establishment .
… Virtually all the respondents , 98 percent , said freedom of expression was important , but the picture changed when the questions got into the details .
Regarding human rights groups ’ rights to operate freely , responses varied based upon the respondents ’ reported political views .
Of those who said they were right - wing , 76 percent said human rights groups should not have the right to freely publicize immoral conduct on Israel ’s part .
… The poll showed 65 percent of all of those questioned think the Israeli media should be barred from publishing news that defense officials think could endanger state security , even if the news was reported abroad .
Another 43 percent said the media should not report information confirmed by Palestinian sources that could reflect poorly on the Israeli army .
Fifty - eight percent of respondents opposed harsh criticism of the country , an increase of 10 percentage points from 2003 .
The academic pollster , Daniel Bar - Tal , whose work will be featured at Thursday ’s TAU conference on free speech and academic freedom sponsored by the Steinmetz Center , put the results in a political - analytical context :
“ Israelis have a distorted perception of democracy , ” said Daniel Bar - Tal , a professor at the university ’s school of education , and one of the conference ’s organizers .
“ The public recognizes the importance of democratic values , but when they need to be applied , it turns out most people are almost anti-democratic . ”
Another conference participant , Ben-Gurion University ’s David Newman … [ noted ] : “ We say Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East , but in Europe they are beginning to think of us otherwise , ” he said .
The standard line of defense against this argument is that Israel is beset on all sides by enemies and therefore cannot afford the luxury of the rights and liberties enjoyed by those Sybarites who enjoy the good life in western democracies .
The cynical Israelis resent the hell out of our supposed moral superiority and throw it back in our faces : “ I ’d like to see how you ’d respond if you confronted the threat of terror attacks day in day out as we do here . ”
They forget of course that democracy is truly tested not when things go well for a society , but when it davke faces precisely the types of threats faced by Israel now and in the past .
While it is true that immediately following 9/11 , George Bush and many Americans treated civil liberties as if they were luxuries that could ill be afforded , this country has largely rejected these arguments .
Yes , the Obama administration has still retained some of the more unfortunate policies of its predecessor , but America is no longer engaged in a war on terror , thank God .
If Israel wishes to be a democracy , then it cannot pick and choose which rights its honors and which it discards when they become inconvenient .
Free speech , free press … these are absolute rights that cannot be abridged as the respondents appear to believe .
Doing so , renders it a truncated democracy at best .
And I ’m not even talking about the even more wretched treatment handed out to Israel ’s Palestinian citizens and residents of the Occupied Territories .
So when the Israel lobby attempts to sell the line that Israel “ shares our values , ” surveys like this will bring them up short .
Israel is not like us .
Perhaps it would like to be like us .
And it would certainly be better off if it could be .
But it is not .
This explains , at least in part , why Israelis appear unwilling to make the sacrifices and compromises necessary for peace with the Palestinians .
They simply prefer living in this cocoon of their own making .
And lest those who support Israel think that such attitudes are theoretical and do n’t have tangible repercussions for the health and well - being of society , I note another survey of Israel Jews between 20 - 30 years old .
When asked whether they would emigrate to the U.S. if they could do so without excessive visa complications , 60 % said they would .
There might be many reasons why this would be so .
Not all of them have to do with politics or Israel ’s battered democracy .
Many would like to emigrate for a better lifestyle , professional opportunities , because they have family there , etc .
But the truth of the matter is that living in Israel is a Zionist imperative and for young people to be willing to do and think the unthinkable , there must be compelling reasons .
And I maintain that fear of war , bringing up children who may have to fight an unending battle against Israel ’s neighbors , living in a country in which democracy and civil liberties are only partially honored–all of these take a heavy toll in the mind of a young person making important life choices .
Israeli youth are very aware of the wider world outside Israel .
They feel , for whatever reason , that life outside would be better .
The nation would do well to grapple with the reasons why this is so and do what it can to align the aspirations of its young people with those of the nation as a whole .
Hold on , where do you think you 're going ?
Skydiver grabs glider 's tail fin as they fly 2,100 metres up at 100mph
Advertisement
A skydiver has pulled off an astonishing stunt by climbing out of a glider 's cockpit , crawling along the wing and then somersaulting underneath and stepping onto the wing of a second glider flying below .
Paul Steiner then moves back onto the main fuselage of the second glider while the first glider turns upside down and flies overhead so that he can reach up and hold the tail fin at 100 mph , forming a human link between the two aircraft .
He then leaps off and parachutes back to the ground .
The spectacular stunt , captured on YouTube , was carried out by the Red Bull skydive team 2,100 metres above the mountains in Styria , Austria .
And they look mightily relieved as they returned to their airfield .

Like many other state employees , prison nurse Nellie Larot was hit last year with furloughs that cut her salary :
It dropped $ 10,000 , to $ 92,000 .
But she more than made up for it by working extra shifts , raking in $ 177,512 in overtime , according to state records .
Her total $ 270,000 in earnings last year eclipsed the $ 225,000 paid to Matthew Cate , head of the entire state prison system .
Despite Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s decision to furlough workers three days a month to save money , many employees are taking home paychecks fattened by overtime -- more than $ 1 billion of it last year .
The total overtime paid in 2009 actually dropped slightly , by $ 64 million from the year before .
But it was up from the $ 808 million paid in 2005 and $ 598 million in 2004 .
“ People want more money , ” said Larot .
The furloughs , which began in February 2009 , cut her monthly pay by many hundreds of dollars .
Without overtime , she said , “ it would be a hardship . ”
Records show that the top 50 recipients of overtime last year each received more than $ 100,000 in extra compensation .
Most were from the departments of corrections and mental health , which account for more than half of the overtime doled out by state agencies ; 35 of the top 50 were registered nurses .
Other top earners include prison guard Lt. Randall Rowland , who collected $ 133,000 in overtime pay , and California Highway Patrol Officer Kerry Comphel , who received $ 127,000 .
The rising overtime “ is unfathomable , ” said Jon Coupal , president of the anti-tax Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn .
“ It just shows the extraordinary disconnect between the public sector and the real world .
No business would operate this way . ”
State Auditor Elaine Howle has also raised red flags .
A review by her office found that more than 100 nurses and psychiatric workers on the state payroll had at least doubled their salaries with overtime , working as many as 90 hours a week .
Two nurses at Napa State Hospital were paid more than $ 1.3 million combined in overtime during a five - year period ending in mid-2008 , Howle found .
Beyond the cost to taxpayers , Howle worried that large amounts of overtime could impair nurses ’ performance and jeopardize patients .
“ It needs to be better managed so you do n’t have employees working significant amounts of overtime and potentially raising health and safety issues , ” Howle said in an interview .
The auditor had warned in October that furloughs and layoffs would probably increase overtime costs in some agencies , and she called for the state to renegotiate its union contracts to set caps .
Nancy Lyerla , a leader of the largest union representing state nurses , noted that some medical and mental health facilities have to be staffed 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
She said the union had warned state officials that furloughs would create staffing gaps that would have to be filled by employees working overtime at time - and - a - half pay .
“ They did n’t look at what it costs to replace the people on furlough , ” Lyerla said .
The effect of the furloughs is to cut most workers ’ regular pay by about 14 % , and the state expects to save $ 1.2 billion this way in the current fiscal year .
But on an individual basis , furloughs have not always saved money .
The unpaid time off saves the state $ 13,650 annually in pay to Larot , but her overtime last year went up nearly twice that amount -- by $ 25,000 -- from the year before .
Schwarzenegger , who ordered the furloughs to reduce a multibillion - dollar budget shortfall , has taken steps to reduce overtime , his representatives said .
The governor signed legislation last year stopping employees from receiving overtime pay in weeks when they also take leave time .
He also directed department heads to manage the furloughs so that they do not result in overtime .
Still , “ there are some facilities that require 24/7 coverage , ” said Aaron McLear , a spokesman for the governor .
That is the case where Larot works , in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ’s Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy .
She “ legitimately earned ” her overtime , with much of it spent overseeing newly admitted inmates on suicide watch , according to Luis Patino Jr. , a spokesman for the California Prison Health Care Receivership .
Patino described Larot as “ an exemplary employee who takes time off when necessary to maintain her safety and well - being and that of the inmates under her watch . ”
Howle ’s audit found that other sites , including wards at Napa State Hospital , frequently overstaffed their shifts .
Mental health officials said some units did not accurately report patient and staffing needs to the central office that gives work assignments , and Howle said a consultant should be hired to evaluate whether common staffing levels are justified .
“ Overtime has been gamed in California for decades , ” said Coupal .
“ Clearly there is a lack of oversight .
This needs to be clamped down . ”
Larot dismissed criticism that employees are taking advantage of a broken system .
“ I do n’t know why people are complaining about the overtime .
We work the overtime , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s anybody ’s business . ”

Researchers for the Wildlife Conservation Society have discovered for the first time the breeding area of the large - billed reed warbler -- dubbed in 2007 as " the world 's least known bird species " -- in the remote and rugged Wakhan Corridor of the Pamir Mountains of north - eastern Afghanistan .
Using a combination of astute field observations , museum specimens , DNA sequencing , and the first known audio recording of the species , researchers verified the discovery by capturing and releasing almost 20 birds earlier this year , the largest number ever recorded .
A preliminary paper on the finding appears in the most recent edition of BirdingASIA .
The authors include : Robert Timmins , Naqeebullah Mostafawi , Ali Madad Rajabi , Hafizullah Noori , Stephane Ostrowski and Colin Poole , of the Wildlife Conservation Society ; Urban Olsson of Göteborg University , Sweden ; and Lars Svensson .
The recent discovery of large - billed reed warblers in Afghanistan represents a watershed moment in the study of this bird , called in 2007 the world 's least known bird species by BirdLife International .
The first specimen was discovered in India in 1867 , with more than a century elapsing before a second discovery of a single bird in Thailand in 2006 .
" Practically nothing is known about this species , so this discovery of the breeding area represents a flood of new information on the large - billed reed warbler , " said Colin Poole , Executive Director of WCS 's Asia Program .
" This new knowledge of the bird also indicates that the Wakhan Corridor still holds biological secrets and is critically important for future conservation efforts in Afghanistan . "
The find serves as a case study in the detective work needed to confirm ornithological discoveries .
The story begins in 2008 , when Timmins was conducting a survey of bird communities along the Wakhan and Pamir Rivers .
He immediately heard a distinctive song coming from a small , olive - brown bird with a long bill .
Timmins taped the bird 's song .
He later heard and observed more birds of the same species .
Initially , Timmins assumed these birds to be Blyth 's reed warblers , but a visit to a Natural History Museum in Tring , United Kingdom to examine bird skins resulted in a surprise : the observed birds were another species .
Lars Svensson -- an expert on the family of reed warblers and familiar with their songs -- then realized that Timmins ' tape was probably the first recording of the large - billed reed warbler .
The following summer ( June 2009 ) , WCS researchers returned to the site of Timmins ' first survey , this time with mist nets used to catch birds for examination .
The research team broadcast the recording of the song , a technique used to bring curious birds of the same species into view for observation and examination .
The recording brought in large - billed reed warblers from all directions , allowing the team to catch almost 20 of them for examination and to collect feathers for DNA .
Later lab work comparing museum specimens with measurements , field images , and DNA confirmed the exciting finding : the first - known breeding population of large - billed reed warblers .
WCS is currently the only organization conducting ongoing scientific conservation studies in Afghanistan -- the first such efforts in over 30 years -- and has contributed to a number of conservation initiatives and activities in partnership with the Afghanistan Government , with support from USAID ( United States Agency for International Development ) .
In 2009 , the government of Afghanistan gazetted the country 's first national park , Band - e - Amir , established with technical assistance from WCS 's Afghanistan Program .
WCS also worked with Afghanistan 's National Environment Protection Agency ( NEPA ) in producing the country 's first - ever list of protected species , an action that now bans the hunting of snow leopards , wolves , brown bears , and other species .
In a related effort , WCS now works to limit illegal wildlife trade in the country through educational workshops for soldiers at Bagram Air Base and other military bases across Afghanistan .
Situated between the mountainous regions of the Pamirs in Tajikistan , Pakistan , and China , the Wakhan Corridor supports a surprisingly wide range of large mammal species , including Marco Polo sheep ( or argali ) , ibex , lynx , wolf , and the elusive snow leopard .
The court heard that Flynn was too shy to tell the woman how he felt A man who sent letters to a woman he was attracted to has been placed on probation after she called in police .
John Flynn , 54 , gave the woman , 31 , flowers after she caught his eye , but was too shy to tell her how he felt .
However , sending the love notes alarmed the woman , and engineer Flynn admitted breach of the peace .
He was placed on probation for three years at Aberdeen Sheriff Court , and was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service .
Flynn said the woman became the object of his affections after he spotted her walking down a street near his home when he was hanging out washing .
' Wee bit frisky '
He said : " I offered to give her some flowers and she thanked me profoundly .
" Then she came back and asked if I could put up some shelves in her house .
I did n't go because I was drinking at the time in case I got a wee bit frisky .
" I did n't know what to say , because I 'm shy .
I sent her letters thinking she must like me . "
One of the notes said : " I would n't mind kissing you darling " .

Opposition members of Parliament joined together Wednesday to pass a motion that would prevent the prime minister from proroguing Parliament for longer than seven days unless supported by the House .
The motion , introduced by NDP Leader Jack Layton and passed by a vote of 139 to 135 , is not considered binding , however .
" Our prime minister is not a king , and it 's time he understood that .
It would appear he does n't get it , " Layton said earlier on Wednesday in the House of Commons .
Layton blasted Harper for proroguing , or suspending , Parliament on two occasions .
In December 2008 , Gov. Gen. Michaëlle Jean agreed to Harper 's request to prorogue Parliament as he faced a confidence vote from a Liberal - NDP coalition with a signed declaration of parliamentary support from the Bloc Québécois that could have toppled Harper 's minority government .
Harper also prorogued Parliament last December , a move that angered some Canadians and prompted opposition leaders to accuse the prime minister of thwarting democracy and using the manoeuvre to avoid the controversy over the treatment of Afghan detainees .
" These last two prorogations were an abuse of power by the prime minister of Canada , " Layton said .
" These last two prorogations were pursued for narrow partisan interests , specifically to avoid accountability to the representatives who had been elected by a majority of Canadians . "
Layton said both prorogations had nothing to do with " exhausting the legislative agenda . "
The decision to prorogue Parliament effectively scuttled all bills that had been before the current Parliament , including the government 's anti-crime legislation .
" Both prorogations had everything to do with the prime minister running from his accountability to this place . "
The motion states : " That , in the opinion of the House , the prime minister shall not advise the Governor General to prorogue any session of any Parliament for longer than seven calendar days without a specific resolution of this House of Commons to support such a prorogation . "

I 'm tired of being used by this organization , by the league , by the writers , by everyone . "
" They 're not interested in winning .

" I want to prove the critics wrong ... I want to see some serious moves from management , which I really have n't seen that much of yet , and I want to see more serious attitudes from my teammates this year when it comes to the playoffs .
In the past , it 's been more or less a joking thing , sort of a ' Well , we 're here , so let 's have a good time . ' "
" I 'm sure everything will be fine if we win , but if we start losing , I 'm shooting . "

I think I speak for everyone when I say that Wikipedia simply rocks .
I use it on a daily basis for researching the background to articles , looking up obscure Japanese anime references or even digging deep into the history of 4 chan .
Actually , yuck , on that last one .
But there are plenty of things that Wikipedia does n’t rock for .
For example , if you wanted to work out when the chief executive of Fujitsu Australia and New Zealand , Rod Vawdrey , was appointed to the role , Wikipedia probably could n’t tell you .
Likewise , if you wanted to dig deep into the history of the corporate jet operated by Denis Mackenzie over at Darwin - based IT services group CSG , you ’d have to go elsewhere .
And do n’t even get me started on how little of the real history of Australia ’s telecommunications sector can be found on Wikipedia ’s pages .
That ’s why today , Delimiter is launching an alternative .
We ’re not going to try to kill Wikipedia , nor would we want to .
Instead , we ’re going to follow in Wikipedia ’s footsteps .
This morning we launched a public Wiki site that will solely cover Australia ’s technology sector — its personalities , companies , issues and memes .
Already , we have more coverage than Wikipedia in some areas — such as the history of Vawdrey ’s stewardship of Fujitsu in Australia .
Now , it should be obvious given Wikipedia ’s own history , that Delimiter wo n’t be able to do this alone .
So we ’re hoping that companies and individuals in Australia ’s technology sector — and that includes the enterprise IT , telco , consumer technology and video gaming verticals — will help us out by editing entries on the new Delimiter Wiki , particularly about themselves , so that we can build a bigger base of knowledge .
All of the content on the Delimiter Wiki will be available under a Creative Commons licence , so you should n’t be worried that Delimiter is going to somehow take all of the content people contribute and run off and make buckets of cash with it .
It will stay on the web for perpetuity and ( hopefully ) become an increasingly valuable resource for Australia ’s technology sector , although , as with Wikipedia , we ask that people take a common sense approach to the information contained within its pages — if it gets vandalised , some of the info may not be quite accurate .
We are only planning to use images on the Delimiter Wiki that are public domain ( for example , have been released for use by the press ) or that we believe we can use under fair use provisions ( such as company logos ) .
But if you see an image on the site that you do n’t think we should be using , just contact us and explain the situation .
As always , if you have questions or worries about how to contribute to or use the Delimiter Wiki , please drop me a line directly at renai@delimiter.com.au .
We would particularly welcome suggestions as to how we could tweak MediaWiki , the Wiki software we are using — it seems a bit hard for the average user to use , and we still have n’t worked out how to fix the the capitalisation in iiNet ’s page , for example .

At least two million Canadians personally know someone , a friend , relative or acquaintance , who has been sexually assaulted by a Roman Catholic priest , suggests a new national poll .
It also suggests that a majority of Canadians , and even a majority of Roman Catholics , believe Pope Benedict XVI is guilty of covering up abuse by pedophile priests .
The Ipsos Reid survey , carried out last week for Canwest News Service and Global Television , shows that child abuse scandals — which for years have troubled the Catholic Church and now directly threaten the Pope — are deeply felt in Canada , where Catholics and non-Catholics alike are unhappy with the Church 's handling of the crisis .
" Two million people is a shocking number , admitting that they personally know someone sexually abused by a Roman Catholic priest , " says John Wright , senior vice president of Ipsos Reid Public Affairs .
" This is not something that can evade scrutiny . "
Thomas Rosica , a priest in Toronto who is CEO of the Salt and Light Catholic Television Network , says the Church shares the concerns found in the survey .
But he calls the poll " misleading and sensationalistic , " because it fails to include the Church 's efforts in Canada to respond to victims and become more transparent .
" And we must not forget that most of the cases being addressed in the media these days date back decades , " he says .
Ipsos - Reid surveyed 1,003 Canadians by telephone last week .
Eight per cent of respondents , and seven per cent of Roman Catholics surveyed — numbers that if extrapolated across Canada would equal two million people — personally know a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest .
The results on this question were highest in British Columbia ( 11 per cent ) and Atlantic Canada ( 10 per cent ) , Quebec ( nine per cent ) , Alberta ( eight per cent ) and lowest in Saskatchewan and Manitoba ( three per cent each ) .
For Ontario , the result was six per cent .
The survey also found :
- Six per cent of all respondents and eight per cent of Roman Catholics surveyed , personally know of a Catholic priest in their parish or neighbourhood who has been criminally charged with sexual assault ;
- Fifty - eight per cent , and 54 per cent of Catholics , believe Pope Benedict has " perpetuated a climate of silence and cover up around pedophile priests . "
- Twenty - nine per cent , and 37 per cent of Catholics , believe instead that the Pope is being unfairly targeted in this scandal ;
- Sixty - nine per cent , and 80 per cent of Roman Catholics , believe the proportion of pedophile priests among the Catholic clergy is minor , and that only a small number are harming the Church 's reputation ;
- Sixty - four per cent , and 55 per cent of Catholics surveyed , are not satisfied with the Church 's efforts to root out predatory pedophiles among its priests ;
- Fifty - five per cent of respondents , and 57 per cent of Catholics , said they are satisfied with the way police and the justice system are investigating allegations of abuse against Catholic clergy .
However , only 14 per cent , and 19 per cent of Catholics , said they are " very satisfied " with the justice system 's response .

Mark Mayerson rips apart the new book CREATORS : FROM CHAUCER AND DURER TO PICASSO AND DISNEY by British historian and journalist Paul Johnson .
According to Mark , the book is riddled with errors about the animated art form , such as :
Winsor McCay is misspelled .
Max Fleischer is erroneously credited for Felix the Cat .
The Three Little Pigs was released in 1933 , not 1932 .
Alice in Wonderland was released in 1951 , not 1957 .
Carl Stalling was a composer , not an animator .
It ’s Carl Eduarde , not Edwards .
It ’s Grim , not Jim , Natwick .
It ’s Tytla , not Tytler .
It ’s Ted Sears , not Wears .
What ’s particularly disgusting about Johnson ’s text is not only the factual inaccuracies , but that he may have deliberately falsified history to promote his personal agendas .
For example , his description of how the Disney strike happened is a complete fabrication , but it makes sense that he would write something like that after reading this Wikipedia article about Johnson , that says , “ In his Enemies of Society ( 1977 ) , following a series of articles in the British press , he vehemently attacked the trade union movement for what he saw as its violence and intolerance , terming them as ‘ red fascists . ’
He also at this time started to inveigh against liberal and left - wing causes . ”
Check out Mark ’s blog for more of his thoughts on Johnson ’s book .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - As 2009 came to a close , Fifth Third Bancorp FITB.
O was preparing to report its sixth loss in seven quarters .
A branch location of Fifth Third Bank in Boca Raton , January 21 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Joe Skipper
The Cincinnati - based regional bank had received $ 3.4 billion of TARP funds with no immediate plan to repay .
And its Midwestern market was still struggling with a shrunken auto sector and high mortgage foreclosure rates .
Nonetheless , the board of Fifth Third , the nation ’s 17th - biggest bank , decided to increase the compensation of Chief Executive Kevin Kabat by 56 percent , to $ 5.2 million -- even though the bank was barred from paying him a bonus because of the bailout rules .
Fifth
Third was n’t alone .
PNC Financial Services Group PNC.N , Regions Financial RF.N and KeyCorp KEY.N -- all of which owed billions of dollars to taxpayers at the end of 2009 -- also increased their chiefs ' pay .
They too were prohibited by rules stemming from the U.S. Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) from paying bonuses to their CEOs .
In the aftermath of the financial crisis , Wall Street banks and their pay practices have garnered national attention .
Once Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N , Morgan Stanley MS.N and other banking giants repaid their bailouts last year , they quickly returned to setting aside billions of dollars for bonuses -- stoking the public 's anger about the bailout .
Yet at the same time , Fifth Third , PNC , Regions , KeyCorp and other large heartland banks have been quietly approving pay increases for their top executives as well .
Even banks that had yet to repay TARP money rewarded their bosses handsomely .
While far from Wall Street -- and away from the spotlight -- the pay practices of the so - called second tier banks are still a concern .
U.S. Rep. Peter Welch , a Democrat from Vermont who has proposed a tax on bonuses , called it a “ rip- off ” for banks still receiving taxpayer support to reward their CEOs with pay increases .
“ Whether they call it a bonus , a stock option , or they inflate their salary , that is wrong and a rip - off , ” Welch said .
A REBOUND
This year PNC repaid TARP , but Fifth Third , KeyCorp and Regions remain beholden to the TARP program .
Shares of all four banks have rebounded substantially in the past year as the banking industry has recovered .
“ Their results in 2009 were better than in 2008 , ” said Kenneth Raskin , the head of law firm White & Case ’s executive compensation practice .
“ The fact that their compensation increased , that is a result of the company doing better . ”
The CEOs of Fifth Third , Pittsburgh - based PNC , Birmingham , Alabama - based Regions and Cleveland - based KeyCorp had all taken pay cuts since 2007 , when the financial crisis began to shake the banking industry .
Still Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration ’s pay czar , said that any type of guaranteed compensation would be a “ concern . ”
Feinberg had the authority to enforce the TARP pay restrictions at the biggest bailout recipients before they repaid their TARP bailouts .
He used his power to slash cash compensation by 90 percent and total compensation by 50 percent for the top 25 employees at each of the companies under his jurisdiction .
Feinberg in most cases has limited base pay to $ 500,000 .
PNC , Fifth Third , Regions , KeyCorp and others like them did not have a pay czar standing over them , and thus found it more challenging to adjust to the TARP rules on their own .
Laura
Thatcher , who leads law firm Alston & Bird ’s executive compensation practice in Atlanta , said some banks had to “ readjust their thinking about how TARP ” would affect compensation .
HOW THEY WERE PAID
In better times in 2007 , PNC chief James Rohr received a pay package of $ 18.8 million , including a bonus of $ 2.63 million .
His pay included a base salary of $ 950,000 , plus $ 10.8 million in stock and options awards .
A year later , in 2008 , as PNC entered TARP and the banking industry was turned upside down , Rohr ’s compensation sank to $ 12.2 million .
His bonus , per TARP rules , was gone .
His salary increased slightly to $ 1 million , and his stock and options awards totaled about $ 7.5 million .
In 2009 , as PNC ’s shares came roaring back -- they have more than doubled in the past year -- so did Rohr ’s compensation .
PNC in February paid back the $ 7.6 billion it received from taxpayers .
Rohr made $ 18 million in 2009 , including $ 2.75 million in salary .
His stock and options were worth $ 11.8 million .
Again he received no bonus .
PNC spokesman Fred Solomon said Rohr ’s 2009 compensation included two years worth of incentive pay , which was decided on before the TARP rules were announced .
He also noted that some of the 2009 compensation could be “ forfeited under TARP rules . ”
Asked how that would work , Solomon said he did not know .
Fifth Third CEO
Kabat ’s base salary more than doubled from $ 900,000 to $ 2.1 million in 2009 .
Fifth
Third spokesman Debra DeCourcy said a portion of the base salary included “ phantom stock , ” shares that have been granted to him , but that he can not sell until 2011 .
Fifth
Third still owes taxpayers $ 3.4 billion and is eyeing repayment in 2010 .
The company trimmed its losses in the fourth quarter but remains exposed to some of the areas of the United States hardest hit by the financial crisis .
The bank declined to make available a member of its compensation committee to discuss how it decided on Kabat ’s pay .
DeCourcy said she was not permitted to speak about the compensation committee ’s decision but added that Fifth Third is a “ pay - for - performance ” company .
ON THE WAY OUT
Regions CEO
Dowd Ritter stepped down last week after a long - planned power transfer at the bank .
Before he left , Regions boosted his 2009 pay to $ 9.7 million , from $ 6.8 million in 2008 .
Ritter ’s base pay was $ 995,000 , consistent with what he received in 2007 and 2008 .
But his stock grants were worth $ 4.7 million in 2009 , nearly 10 times what he received in 2008 .
The pay of Ritter ’s successor , Grayson Hall , has not yet been disclosed .
After Regions reported a fourth - quarter loss , Ritter said in a statement : “ Regions , along with the financial services industry , still faces some near - term credit and economic challenges . ”
Regions still has $ 3.5 billion in TARP bailouts .
Tim Deighton , a spokesman for Regions , said a member of the compensation committee was not available for an interview .
The other three banks were also unable to make a member of the compensation committee available for interview .
“ Our pay decisions and programs for 2009 comply fully with TARP and we believe they meet the legislative intent of the requirements and restrictions , ” Deighton said .
KeyCorp , which has $ 2.5 billion in TARP , raised CEO Henry Meyer ’s pay raise to $ 8.1 million in 2009 from $ 6.7 million in 2008 .
Meyer ’s base salary rose to $ 1.6 million in 2009 from $ 1 million , but the increase was in shares of KeyCorp that cannot be sold until the company repays TARP .
KeyCorp spokesman William Murschel directed a questioner to the bank ’s proxy filing , which said compensation decisions were based on performance assessments and a thorough analysis of similar U.S. banks .
SunTrust Banks STI.N , an Atlanta - based regional bank , was the biggest bailed - out bank that did not increase its CEO 's pay in 2009 .
CEO James Wells compensation fell to $ 7.7 million last year from $ 8.1 million in 2008 .
OUT OF SIGHT , OUT OF MIND
Many of the major - bank counterparts of the regionals -- in particular , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N -- could not avoid the spotlight over pay .
“ The bigger guys have taken more of a beating , attracted the headlines , ” said Lawrence White , a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business .
When it comes to the regionals , White said , “ The numbers -- whether it is size of the bank , the size of the loss , the size of the CEO ’s bonus -- those numbers are smaller and less eye - catching . ”
That PNC , Regions , Fifth Third and KeyCorp could increase their CEO ’s pay with bailout cash in hand and at a time of intense public scrutiny speaks to the anonymity of the biggest U.S. biggest banks off Wall Street , White said .
“ Outside of the western Pennsylvania , eastern Ohio , northwest West Virginia , who else has heard of PNC ? ”
White said .
“ They just do n’t have the same national recognition that a Goldman or a JPMorgan or Citi has . ”
Given a choice between spending a token to get their absolute favorite food or spending it to have a choice from a buffet of options , capuchin monkeys will opt for variety .
In fact , they 'll even eat a less - preferred food from that buffet when the favorite food is on it .
They choose variety for variety 's sake .
The choices made by these captive - bred monkeys in an Italian research facility seem to show some innate desire to seek variety , said Dan Ariely , the James B. Duke Professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University .
In a series of experiments Ariely conducted with colleagues at the Instituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione in Rome , the eight monkeys first had to be taught that the abstract tokens , such as poker chips , plastic cylinders and metal nuts , represented different kinds of choice .
With training , the tokens were associated with being able to buy one piece of the most - preferred food , or being able to buy one piece from an assortment of foods that included the most - preferred food .
Lead author Elsa Addessi has used this token method before with this troop of capuchins , who are on public display as well as being used in non-invasive cognitive experiments .
" Economically , the tokens should be equivalent , because they both give you the food you like , " Ariely said .

But once they had the hang of it , the monkeys as a group chose to use the variety tokens and not the " single - food - tokens . "
Moreover , once they chose the variety tokens the monkeys also did n't always take the most - preferred food when it was offered as part of the variety assortment .
What this means is that they prefer variety for variety sake and are willing to eat food they like less to satisfy their desire for variety .
The work appears online in Behavioural Processes .
The implications of this simple experiment shed some light on consumer behavior , Ariely said .
Earlier work on variety - seeking has found that people eat 43 percent more M&M candies when there are 10 colors in the bowl instead of just seven .
" People choose variety for variety 's sake , " Ariely said .
" They often choose things they do n't even like as well just for the variety .
We knew about this , so the interesting thing was to figure out how basic it is . "
Pretty basic , apparently .
The behavior of the capuchins , which are native to South America , " suggest that there 's some inherent basic strategy for variety , " Ariely said .
In the wild , variety seeking may help ensure a nutritionally varied diet .
It is also possible , the authors suggest , that variety - seeking contributed to the rise of bartering and then abstract money in human society .
At the same time , Ariely is somewhat puzzled that humans can get stuck in a rut and not seek more variety .
" Ask yourself : How many new things have you tried lately ?
Have you tried every cereal in the cereal aisle ? "
It may be that you 're enjoying a daily bowl of a cereal that you would rate as an 8 , when just a few feet away on the shelf there is a cereal you 'd rate as a 9 , but you 've never tried it .
Businesses can push variety on customers with assortment packs , Ariely suggests , and vicarious experiences like the Food Network can encourage exploration as well .
" How do we get ourselves to explore ?
Even monkeys do it -- so maybe we should also try more variety . "
The research was supported by the Instituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione and Duke .
It 's no secret we love food at Lifehacker , and if there 's one universal truth about food , it 's that you can make any food go from good to epic by incorporating bacon .
Food Weblog
The Kitchn has kindly provided a great victim : popcorn .

First of all , if you 're still cooking your popcorn in the microwave , you really should learn how to make movie theater popcorn at home for pennies on the dollar — especially because you can't incorporate bacon in the microwave version .
If you already have a popcorn popper ( or know how to cook popcorn on the stove ) , then you pretty much know how to make it with bacon fat — all you need is some bacon fat .
If you have some leftover from the last time you made bacon , that 's perfect .
If you do n't have any , then why not fry some up right now ?
You only live once , after all .
Once you have the fat , just use about 3 tablespoons of it in place of your usual popcorn oil .

" But Lifehacker , " I can already hear some of you say , " bacon - flavored popcorn sounds incredibly disgusting . "
Luckily , the popcorn does n't actually taste like bacon — if you wanted that , you could just make some bacon — instead , it gives a nice smoky flavor to the popcorn that you do n't usually get , which is nice since popcorn can sometimes taste a little bland .
Hit the link for the detailed popping instructions , if you are n't already a stovetop popcorn master .
Got any other favorite meals or snacks made better by bacon ?
Rattle them off in the comments !

Guest editorial by Ernest A. Canning
While I 've always had the utmost respect for Australian journalist and documentary filmmaker John Pilger , I must admit that the first time I watched his video , " Obama is a corporate marketing creation , " I thought that , in implying that the President was some type of CIA - connected Manchurian Candidate , Pilger was a bit over the top .
In 1983 Obama went to work for " Business International Corporation , " which , according to Pilger , had " a long history of providing cover for the CIA and infiltrating unions on the left . "
Though Pilger conceded that there " might be nothing sinister " in that , he cited Obama 's failure to identify Business International by name or what he did there in Dreams of My Father .
The President simply said he worked at “ a consulting house to multinational corporations . ”
Coupling this with a litany of examples which place Obama on the wrong side of Empire and the corporate divide , Pilger implied the connection was not coincidental , then concluded his remarks by quoting Chris Hedges :
President Obama does one thing and brand Obama gets you to believe another .
This is the essence of successful advertising .
You buy or do what the advertiser wants because of how they make you feel .
Perhaps it 's an accumulation of all that has transpired this past year ; perhaps it 's the striking revelations that emerged during an extraordinary Feb.
2 , 2010 , broadcast of Democracy Now , especially as it pertains to torture ( video below ) , but I now can't help feeling like Claire Kubik , the sharp attorney played by Ashley Judd in High Crimes who starts out vigorously defending her husband Tom ( Jim Cazviel ) against charges he murdered innocent civilians in a covert military operation .
She 's convinced the man she married has been wrongfully accused ; convinced of his innocence until , almost when it 's too late , she learns the man she thought she knew so well was a murderous sociopath .
Who is this guy whose election so many so happily celebrated on a brisk November evening that now seems so long ago ?...
A troubling litany
One could easily follow up Pilger 's analysis with a litany of even more troubling facts :
The immediate alignment of President - Elect Obama with a bevy of former Wall Street / Goldman Sachs insiders ( e.g. , Tim Geithner , Larry Summers ) , the retention of the CIA - connected Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense , the renomination of Ben Bernacke , the " too big to fail " excuse that essentially handed Wall Street the keys to the National Treasury , even as Goldman Sachs / AIG executives gorged on seven and even eight figure bonuses , the betrayal of the single - payer cause former Illinois State Senator Barack Obama once championed , not to mention the abandonment of the more modest " public option , " in favor of back - room deals with the rapacious health insurance cartel and the pharmaceutical industry , and the deceptive , and at times Orwellian justifications for not merely continuing but expanding an irrational " global war on terror , " complete with retention of murderous mercenaries , like those supplied by Blackwater / Xe at enormous taxpayer expense .
A failure to faithfully execute the laws against torture
But for me , as an attorney , who like all attorneys has taken a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution and laws of these United States , and as the son of a man who was tortured --- waterboarded --- by the Japanese during World War II , it is the question of torture which has led me to join with Pilger in asking , again , who is this man ?
Early in this new administration , even before I published a five part series on " The History of CIA Torture " ( Part I , II , III , IV & V ) , in which I traced the current torture scandal to a more than 50 - year history of CIA torture transcending multiple administrations , I wrote in " Prosecute or Perish , " warning that nothing less than the very survival of our Constitutional democracy and the rule of law hinged upon factually warranted criminal investigations and prosecutions of all who authorized or participated in torture inside the Bush / Cheney cabal .
In " Fixing the Facts and Legal Opinions Around the Torture Policy , " I expressed dismay when the President told CIA employees , who tortured under the quasi-legal sophistries authored by the likes of John Yoo and Jay S. Bibee , they would not be prosecuted .
The President said this was " a time for reflection , not retribution ... nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibb explained that the President insisted on " looking forward . "
I pointed out that the remarks from a President , who was a Harvard Law School scholar and former Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Chicago , made no sense whatsoever ; that it would be impossible to ever prosecute anyone without " looking back " at the crime already committed .
Law Professor Jonathan
Turley blasted the effort to equate law enforcement with " retribution . "
He is trying to lay the ground work for principle when he is doing an unprincipled thing .... President Obama himself has said that water boarding is torture , and torture itself violates four treaties and is considered a war crime .
So the refusal to allow it to be investigated is to obstruct a war crimes investigation .
… There are n't any convenient or inconvenient times to investigate war crimes .
You do n't have a choice ....
You have an obligation to do it , and what I think the President is desperately trying to do is to sell this idea that somehow it 's a principled thing not to investigate war crimes because it 's going to be painful …
It will be politically unpopular because an investigation will go directly to the doorstep of President Bush … and there 's not going to be a lot of defenses that can be raised for ordering a torture program .
Yet , the Obama administration has done nothing to bring those who authorized torture or authored the quasi-legal sophistries , aka " torture memos , " before the bar of justice .
Where last May the Justice Department had prepared an initial draft of an ethics report that would recommend state bar proceedings against John Yoo and Jay Bibee , the latter a sitting judge on a federal appellate bench , on Jan. 30 of this year Newsweek reported that even this relatively minor semblance at accountability turned into a complete white - wash .
The Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility struck the recommendations for state bar discipline --- this at the same time that a Spanish court " has opened formal criminal investigations into the suspected torture of a Spanish national held at Guantánamo , " naming Yoo , Bibee , and Alberto Gonzales as the " intellectual authors " of that man 's torture .
However , as noted by attorney Scott Horton , while the Justice Department has not sought state bar discipline , its memos may contain damning information describing " meetings inside the White House with [ V.P. Cheney 's ] staff , in the course of which they are giving direct guidance to John
Yoo and others exactly how this memo is to be written and what it is to provide , and everything they ask for and require John Yoo puts into the memo . "
This level of structured control over what went into the torture memos would be consistent with much of what Jane Mayer has to say about the dictatorial reign of Richard B. Cheney and David Addington in The Dark Side .
Was the latest Justice Department white - wash intended to shield Obama White House complicity in torture ?
Had it stopped there ; had the Feb. 2 , 2010 , news coverage on Democracy Now been limited to the President 's decision to recklessly expand spending on the military - industrial complex , including the never - ending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , to $ 741 billion ; which includes " a $ 7 billion increase in nuclear spending despite a pledge to cut the US arsenal and seek a nuclear weapons - free world , " even as the Labor Department is to experience a 32 % cut in unemployment and stimulus spending ; had the Democracy Now broadcast simply reported the deaths of 123 more civilians in predator drone strikes ; had it done no more than recount that CIA operatives have been allowed to work for private firms , or that Maher Ahrar 's attorneys had to file a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking justice for the torture that innocent Canadian suffered as a direct result of Bush / Cheney 's abominable " extraordinary rendition " practice ; justice denied because it is opposed by Eric Holder 's Department of Injustice , I probably would have refrained from writing this piece .
But the Democracy Now segment , " ' America ’s Secret Afghan Prisons ' : Investigation Unearths New U.S. Torture Site , Abuse Allegations in Afghanistan , " ( video below ) and The Nation magazine 's , " America 's Secret Afghan Prisons , " by Anand Gopal , are so truly disturbing that they have shaken me to the core .
In a nutshell , if accurate , they reveal , as claimed by Scott Horton , that President Obama 's Jan. 22 , 2009 , " executive order " to shut down the " secret prisons " was very carefully tailored so that it was only CIA black sites that were closed . "
They left open the same type of black sites under the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , according to Horton .
" A major UN report on secret detention policies around the world concludes the practice could reach the threshold of a crime against humanity , " according to Amy Goodman .
The Gopal article , if accurate , reflects an ongoing campaign of vicious night raids by U.S. special forces that would do the Gestapo proud .
One entailed a raid on the home of " Majidullah Qarar , the spokesman for Afghanistan 's agriculture minister , " whose cousins , a baker and a man who simply sells carrots at a local bizarre , were gunned down without provocation , as U.S. forces barged into Qarar 's home , while " terrified children lay glued to their beds . "
They ransacked the house , located a man , Rahman , a young Afghan government employee whom the U.S. military " suspected " of having al Qaeda connections ; carted him off to a helicopter and then the first of a series of prisons .
Part of a growing number of Afghans who have joined the ranks of the disappeared , Rahman has not been seen or heard from since , despite Qarar 's connections inside the Afghan government .
The stories , if accurate , suggest that the Obama administration is up to its eyeballs in the same brutal techniques for which the Bush / Cheney regime has been , at least outside the confines of the U.S. , universally condemned --- a conclusion that is further bolstered by a claim made by five U.S. citizens in custody in Pakistan , one of whom handed a note to a reporter which read , " Since our arrest , the US , FBI and Pakistani police have tortured us .
They are trying to set us up …
Help us . ”
Per Amy Goodman , one of their lawyers claimed they were subjected to electric shock .
If true , one has to ask whether Obama had backed off his Constitutional duty to see that the laws be faithfully executed in order to shield himself from the same charges for torture he intended to carry out .
If it turns out to be true --- and that is still a very big if --- the immediate legal course would be a Congressional investigation with an eye towards possible impeachment , to determine if the President was aware of these policies and condoned them in anyway , in violation of his oath of office and duty to the American people to uphold our laws and Constitution .

Ernest A. Canning has been an active member of the California state bar since 1977 .
Mr. Canning has received both undergraduate and graduate degrees in political science as well as a juris doctor .
He is also a Vietnam vet ( 4th Infantry , Central Highlands 1968 ) .
The beautiful young socialite slipped the businessman a note scrawled in eyeliner on a crumpled napkin .
“ Help me , ” it pleaded .
She was a teenage Indonesian model who had married a Malaysian prince , but Manohara Odelia Pinot says her life with him was no fairy tale .
Press accounts of her allegations of abuse and tales of her escape from an unhappy marriage have captivated this country , and further divided two nations that have long been Southeast Asian rivals .
Known across Indonesia by her first name , which means “ thief of hearts ” in Sanskrit , Manohara is viewed here as a tragic heroine mistreated by an obsessed suitor who became outraged when she would not yield to his demands .
In Kuala Lumpur , the Malaysian capital , she ’s dismissed as a lying gold - digger under the control of a vindictive mother .
For nine months , the 18 - year - old alleges , she was held captive on the estate of the prince , Tengku Muhammad Fakhry Petra .
Grabbing headlines in the Jakarta Globe and other news outlets , she alleged that he cut her with a razor and ordered his doctor to inject her with a tranquilizer and raped her .
“ Imagine someone doing something like that to you and you are unable to move , -- you ca n’t do anything about it , ” she says softly , her eyes tearing .
“ It was torture , mentally and physically . ”
Fakhry did not respond to interview requests .
But he sued his wife and her mother , Daisy Fajarina , for defamation last summer , and in March , a Malaysian civil court awarded Fakhry a $ 1.8 - million judgment .
Haaziq Pillay , Fakhry ’s lawyer , says the prince disputed every one of Manohara ’s claims and questions why she avoided the Malaysian court proceedings .
“ From rape to cutting her with a razor to injecting her -- these are only things a monster would do , a psychopath , ” Pillay says .
“ My client wants the truth to come out .
“ She said she was afraid of the security , but this is n’t a cowboy society , ” he says .
“ People do n’t get abducted in the streets here . ”
Manohara insists that she will never pay the prince a penny and challenges him to file a second civil lawsuit in Jakarta , where she says he ’d receive a less positive reception .
She ’s also filed a police report , for alleged domestic violence , and warns that Fakhry will be arrested the moment he sets foot in Indonesia .
Even before her marriage into Malaysian royalty , Manohara was considered a rare gem here and was named one of “ Indonesia ’s 100 Most Precious Women ” by Harper ’s Bazaar Indonesia magazine .
Now , capitalizing on a saga that has obsessed Indonesians much like Tiger Woods ’ fall from grace in the United States , Manohara stars in a popular TV show about a young wife abused by her philandering husband , and she demands high fees for speaking engagements .
Many viewers simply cannot keep their eyes off the young model , born to an American father and Indonesian mother , who has become a cat - eyed Paris Hilton of Indonesia .
A full half - hour documentary on her alleged travails has aired repeatedly on Jakarta television , “ at times almost a continuous loop , ” according to the Asia Sentinel newspaper .
But not everyone is captivated .
“ This is a freak show in a freak - loving country full of two - headed goats and Islamic hard - liners , ” said Wimar Witoelar , who hosts his own TV talk show .
“ It just shows how people with cheap tastes get titillated by cheap stories .
That ’s Manohara . ”
The Malaysian businessman who was slipped Manohara ’s letter pleading for help says the 32 - year - old prince , a thin man with deeply set dark eyes , wants his wife back and is pursuing the case against his family ’s wishes .
He is convinced that once he has Manohara back , he can persuade her to silence her criticism and resume their marriage , the businessman said .
“ I have never seen a man so obsessed with a woman , ” says Dato Kadar Shah , who was asked by government officials to help solve the matter .
“ The people in his province also love her .
They view her like Princess Diana .
He needs her back for his credibility . ”
Manohara was just 14 when she met her prince .
Fakhry , the son of the monarch of one of Malaysia ’s nine regional sultanates , approached the girl at a party in Jakarta as she sat with her older sister .
Within days , Manohara says now , she did n’t even recall him .
But Fakhry remembered her .
“ You have two lovely daughters , ” Fajarina recalled him telling her .
“ I would like to keep in touch with them . ”
For years , the prince met with Manohara , with Fajarina always by her side .
But on one cruise , Manohara alleged in a story in the Jakarta Globe , Fakhry raped her while her mother was in an adjoining cabin .
In his successful defamation lawsuit , the prince denied the charges .
Then 16 , Manohara did n’t tell her mother what happened .
“ I was in denial , ” she says .
“ I knew if I changed my behavior , my mom would find out .
I was embarrassed . ”
Her mother says she was blind to the prince ’s obsession .
“ I did n’t see the signs , ” she says .
“ I thought he was charming . ”
Then in August 2008 , the prince ’s mother announced that her son was in love with Manohara and that the couple would marry immediately .
Manohara says an aide to the royal family persuaded her to go through with the ceremony to keep the peace .
After that , she says , he told her she could return to Jakarta .
“ I kept saying ‘ no , no , no , ’ ” Manohara recalled .
The teen acknowledges that she married Fakhry , but insists that she said nothing at the ceremony and signed no papers .
Manohara soon returned to Jakarta to pursue her modeling career .
But she says
Fakhry called to say he felt terrible about the circumstances of the marriage and wanted to apologize .
They agreed to meet in Mecca , Saudi Arabia , for prayer and pilgrimage .
Fajarina accompanied her daughter , but when it came time to fly home , Manohara says , she was spirited into a private jet .
“ They left me on the tarmac , ” Fajarina recalled .
“ She was running after me , ” Manohara says .
“ I could see her from the window . ”
For the next nine months , she alleges , she was injected with tranquilizers and threatened if she did not appear happy when attending functions with the prince .
She claims the prince also cut her chest several times with a razor .
In a news conference last June , she showed photos of the alleged razor wounds taken at the time with a cellphone camera .
The wounds are now gone , she said .
Pillay dismissed the claims .
“ If you are cut on the breast , the marks are supposed to be there .
Where are the scars ? ”
Manohara says she was able to keep hidden her BlackBerry and charger .
She sent e-mails to her mother , who went to the Indonesian press about her daughter ’s allegations .
The tabloid press ran with the story .
“ Fairy Tale of a Prince and His Bride Turns to Nightmare , ” one headline screamed .
“ Manohara says she was held as sex slave by her prince , ” read another .
A Jakarta Post headline trumpeted : “ Manohara : I Was Drugged and Abused . ”
Many Indonesians took to the streets , demanding Manohara ’s return .
A protest outside the Malaysian Embassy in Jakarta turned violent .
Malaysian government officials believe that Indonesians have been stirred up by sensationalist media .
“ Both governments have taken a stand and said this is a personal matter between husband and wife , ” said Eldeen Hussaini , deputy director of relations between the two nations for the Malaysian Foreign Ministry .
But businessman
Shah says he was quietly asked to intervene in 2008 by government officials on both sides .
He asked to meet with Manohara privately , but Fakhry declined .
“ I told him I just wanted to ask about the allegations , ” he says .
“ If the girl said she was happy , I was willing to let things be . ”
Last May , Fakhry and Manohara traveled to Singapore , where Shah was finally able to meet her .
At a restaurant , Manohara slipped him the note .
As soon as he left the restaurant , Shah said , he called Fajarina , urging her to rush to Singapore .
She arrived just before her daughter outwitted Fakhry and his phalanx of bodyguards and escaped , according to media reports .
The teenager pressed the emergency alarm in a Singapore hotel elevator , summoning security guards , who allowed Manohara to run into the waiting arms of her mother .
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Singapore said that Manohara ’s mother had contacted officials there before the escape and that they had assisted the teen but did not offer details .
Nearly a year later , Indonesians are still hungry for news on Manohara .
“ It ’s a universal fairy tale , a love story gone wrong .
Young , poor girl meets prince .
Prince turns into frog in her eyes , ” said TV news anchor Dalton Tanonaka .
“ The truth lies somewhere in the middle , but the story remains great for gossip programs and rumor mills . ”
The prince is still suffering , Pillay says .
“ There ’s an element of sadness because he truly loves Manohara , ” he says .
“ If I was in his position , I would n’t love her anymore .
But perhaps the prince thinks she is too young and was brainwashed by her mother . ”
For the princess , the ratings for her soap opera remain high , and she ’s starting a new cosmetic line .
As for love and marriage , Manohara plans to take a time out to heal .
She needs to purge the prince from her life , she says .
“ People want to know about my life , ” she says .
“ They ask , ‘ Who is Manohara dating ? ’
The answer is no one .
I ’ve got lots of time for that . ”

PARALLEL PACKAGE TUTORIAL
Introduction
Parallel Computing with the Wolfram Language
Parallel computing in the Wolfram Language is based on launching and controlling multiple Wolfram Language kernel ( worker ) processes from within a single master Wolfram Language , providing a distributed - memory environment for parallel programming .
Every copy of the Wolfram System comes with all the components and tools to run and create parallel applications .
The parallel computing features are written almost entirely in the Wolfram Language and are therefore machine independent .
They have been tested on Unix , Linux , Windows , and Macintosh platforms and are well suited to working locally on a multicore machine , in a grid of machines , or in a heterogeneous network .
All client and application code is distributed , so no common file system is necessary .
Parallel computing is now provided as a standard part of the Wolfram Language , thereby facilitating the use of parallel programming techniques .
These can benefit from many of the advances in technology , for example , multicore machines , usage of specialized hardware for parallel computation , and fast network technology that helps with running a grid of connected computers .
To perform computations in parallel , you need to be able to perform the following tasks :
start processes and wait for processes to finish
schedule processes on available processors
exchange data between processes and synchronize access to common resources
In the Wolfram Language environment , the term processor refers to a running Wolfram Language kernel , whereas a process is an expression to be evaluated .
WSTP
Underlying parallel computation in the Wolfram Language is the Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol ( WSTP ) .
This is a general and flexible interface for programs to communicate with the Wolfram Language .
It is a fundamental component of the Wolfram Language and is used extensively in the Wolfram Language itself .
One common mode of operation is for different components of the Wolfram Language to communicate using WSTP , which is exactly how parallel computation uses WSTP .
WSTP provides some core features , it is platform and architecture independent , it works both locally and across the network , it can transmit anything that the Wolfram Language can represent , and it provides an interface for controlling the Wolfram Language .
These are all features that are key to parallel computation , allowing local and network communication between both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks , and allowing transmission of both data and programs .
Connection Methods
The Wolfram Language can run parallel workers in a number of different ways , locally on the same machine or remotely on a network .
In addition , the network might be a homogeneous grid controlled by some dedicated management application , or it might be a heterogeneous grid .
To run in these situations , the Wolfram Language needs to launch parallel workers and then communicate with them .
To carry out parallel computation in these different situations , the Wolfram Language provides a number of different connection methods , each of which is specialized to a particular style of usage .
Some of the main connection methods are described here .
Local Kernels
The local kernels connection method is used to run parallel workers on the same computer as the master Wolfram Language .
It is suitable for a multicore environment and is the easiest way to get up and running with parallel computation .
Whenever your processor has more than one core , you can use local kernels for parallel computations .
The Lightweight Grid
The Lightweight Grid connection method is used to run parallel workers on different computers from the master Wolfram Language .
It uses Wolfram Lightweight Grid technology to launch the Wolfram Language on the remote machines .
It is suitable for a heterogeneous network and where there is no management technology .
Cluster Integration
The Cluster Integration connection method is used to run parallel workers on different computers from the master Wolfram Language .
It integrates with a large number of third - party cluster management technologies .
Remote Kernels
The remote kernels connection method is used to run parallel workers on different computers from the master Wolfram Language .
It relies on using a remote shell invocation technology for launching and is typically harder to configure and maintain .
Features
The main features of parallel computing in the Wolfram Language are :
distributed memory , master / slave parallelism
written in the Wolfram Language
machine independent
WSTP communication with remote kernels
exchange of symbolic expressions and programs with remote kernels , not only numbers and arrays
heterogeneous network , multiprocessor machines , LAN and WAN
virtual process scheduling or explicit process distribution to available processors
virtual shared memory , synchronization , locking
latency hiding
parallel functional programming and automatic parallelization support
failure recovery , automatic reassignment of stranded processes on failed remote computers
Lower - Level Features
Additional parallel programming features are available in the Parallel`Developer` context .
They allow you to get and set properties of parallel kernels and implement your own scheduler for concurrency .
$ ContextPath
The lower - level features are best made available by adding their context to your
For a single use , it is sufficient to refer to developer functions with their full name , such as Parallel`Developer`ClearKernels [ ] .

Researchers dispute that hominin fossil is a new species .
The cranium of the juvenile male found at Malapa cave .
L. Berger / University of the Witwatersrand
A team from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa , has revealed two remarkably well preserved hominin fossils aged just under two million years old .
The fossils were discovered at Malapa cave , part of a site known as the Cradle of Humankind , some 40 kilometres west of Johannesburg .
But the researchers ' suggestion that the fossils represent a transitional species in human evolution , sitting between Australopithecus and Homo species , has been criticized by other researchers as overstated .
The fossils , a juvenile male and an adult female , were found together in the Malapa cave , part of an eroded cave system , leading to speculation that the two fell to their deaths while searching for water .
The fragile parts of the skeleton that are often missing from fossils this old , such as the hands and feet , have been preserved ( see videos showing fossilized cranium constructionjpeg. mov " > here and here ) .
The collar bone of the first specimen was discovered by team leader Lee Berger 's nine - year - old son during a visit to the site in 2008 .
Controversially , the researchers have named the fossils as a new species , Australopithecus sediba .
' Sediba ' means fountain or wellspring in Sotho , which is one of the 11 official languages of South Africa .
Berger deems this an appropriate name , as he says that A. sediba is a good candidate for being the transitional species between the southern African hominin , Australopithecus africanus , and early Homo species — either the earlier Homo habilis or even a direct ancestor of the more recent Homo erectus .
The research is published in Science1,2 .
Coding questions
But palaeoanthropologist Tim White of the University of California , Berkeley , says that A. sediba and A. africanus are merely chronospecies : names given to describe slightly different anatomy in fossils from a single evolving species .
White says that the suggestion by Berger and his team that this lineage split before the emergence of Homo is " fossil - free speculation " , adding that " the obsession with Homo in their title and text is difficult to understand outside of a media context " .
The skeletons of the juvenile male ( left ) and adult female ( right ) are very complete in comparison with some other finds .
L. R. Berger et al ./ AAAS
Anthropologist Fred Grine of Stony Brook University in New York says that the authors have " not undertaken any competent analysis of variation within A. africanus — something I do not understand in the context that three further skeletons have been found by the same team at Malapa " .
He says that although Berger and his colleagues compare the A. sediba specimens to other hominins in terms of morphological characters that he and co-author Heather Smith defined in a paper two years ago3 , the team 's analysis raises questions about the character states used and how they have been coded .
White agrees , pointing out that of the characters that the authors say are shared with Homo , the key ones required to draw this kind of link — such as facial morphology and brain size — are at odds with their conclusions .
Both Grine and White are critical of the fact that most of the diagnosis of A. sediba is on the basis of a single immature individual , and point out that because anatomy changes during growth , the jury will be out until more complete adult remains are described .
Grine adds that a further issue relates to the suggestion that A. sediba was ancestral to Homo .
The earliest fossil evidence for Homo — a maxilla or upper jaw bone from the Hadar formation in Ethiopia that is attributable to the species H. habilis — is 2.3 million years old .
This is perhaps 500,000 years older than the A. sediba fossils .
" If A. sediba is supposed to represent a better candidate for ancestry than A. africanus , it is a little late in time , " Grine says .
But in a press conference on 7 April , Berger defended the classification of A. sediba as a new species .
The fossils " morphologically fundamentally differ from other fossil species that have been found " , he said .
The arms of the new fossils are long , like those of A. africanus , but the pelvises are strikingly like those of H. erectus .
And although there 's no doubt that anatomy changes during growth , he adds , the juvenile is nearly an adult in terms of the development of key characteristics .
" In human developmental terms , it 's in its early teens .
Its brain has clearly reached about 95 – 98 % of its adult capacity , " he said .
As for the age of the specimens , Berger says that as this is the first time that fossils of A. sediba have been discovered , he and his colleagues have not established over what period of time the species existed .
" The site we have found is simply a point in time and does not in any way represent the first appearance of this species nor the last . "
He also suggests that earlier Homo fossils from a similar period may have been misclassified because they are incomplete .
" Fossils from that period are very fragmentary , " he added .
" We now know that you need a lot more than just one part of the morphology to define a genus or a species . "
One mystery solved
Meanwhile ,
White says that the real significance of the find is that it finally shows what happened to A. africanus in southern Africa — the species survived longer than previously thought , and in a slightly changed form .
He explains that before this , A. africanus was generally sitting as a point in southern Africa , at 2.5 million years ago to 2.8 million years ago : " Its parentage was thought by most people to be Australopithecus afarensis and its downstream relationships debated : some thought it was ancestral to Homo , some a dead end , others an ancestor of Australopithecus robustus .
It is most commonly depicted in trees as a question mark , even though it was the first described species .
Now it is clear that A. africanus not only persisted but evolved slightly in South Africa between 2.5 and 2.0 million years ago , " he says .

Alan Morris of the University of Cape Town in South Africa is more upbeat about the findings .
" It is the presence of modern behaviours and the concomitant expansion of the brain and restructuring of the pelvis for running that defines Homo , but the evolving line that led to these developments has not been clearly visible .
The Malapa specimens will rekindle the debate about the validity of the taxon Homo habilis , and will make us look more carefully at the variability of Australopithecus africanus and her sister species , " he says .
Francis Thackeray , director of the Institute for Human Evolution at the University of the Witwatersrand , agrees that the latest finds raise important questions about the ancestry of humans .
" The new fossil has a suite of characters which confirm that there is no clear boundary between Australopithecus africanus and Homo , " he says .

WEDNESDAY , April 21 ( HealthDay News ) --
Having dense breasts has long been known to increase a woman 's risk for breast cancer , and new research confirms that a decline in breast density over time does , in fact , decrease that risk .
New research also has found that women taking hormone replacement therapy are more likely to experience an increase in breast density , a finding consistent with previous research that found women taking the hormones had a 24 percent increased risk for breast cancer .
Both findings were to be presented Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington , D.C. , at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research .
" Over 50 studies have shown that breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer , " said Celine M. Vachon , an associate professor of epidemiology in the College of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic , in Minnesota .
" Our study is one of the first to examine changes over time , " Vachon said .
A very dense breast has less fat than glandular and connective tissue .
Mammogram films of high - density breasts are more difficult to read and interpret than those of less dense breasts .
Vachon and her fellow researchers followed 19,924 women older than 35 who had never had breast cancer and looked at breast density changes and cancer diagnoses over time .
From that group , they randomly picked a sample of 219 women who developed breast cancer during the six - year follow - up period and 1,900 who did not .
Women with breast cancer were more likely to have extreme breast density -- the highest of four categories -- at the start of the study , with 16 percent in the very dense category , compared with 14 percent of those who remained cancer - free .
Those who developed cancer were somewhat less likely than the other women to have a reduction in density of one category or more , with 37 percent of those with breast cancer and 38.6 percent of the other women seeing that change .
Though density generally declines with age , and the breasts become more fatty , " these changes vary from woman to woman , " Vachon said .
" And we know the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy can increase density . "
In the other study , researchers from Georgetown University and elsewhere found that the increase in density with hormone use predicted breast cancer risk .
Drawing from the Women 's Health Initiative study , which looked at hormone therapy and other health concerns , they compared 97 women on hormone replacement who developed breast cancer and 77 who did not take hormones but did develop cancer with 733 cancer - free women , some who took hormones and some who did not .
They found that 57 percent of those who did not take hormones had a decrease in density , compared with just 16 percent of those taking hormone therapy .
Breast cancer risk increased nearly fourfold for the 20 percent of women with the biggest increase in density , compared with the 20 percent of women with the lowest increase or a decrease .
When the researchers took the density information out of the analysis , hormone use was not associated with breast cancer risk , they found , leading them to conclude that the change in density accounted for the increased cancer risk .
Dr. Joanne Mortimer , a medical oncologist and director of the women 's cancer programs at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in California , said the study results were not surprising .
" We know that breast density probably correlates with the patient 's own estrogen levels , " she said .
" The higher the estrogen , the greater the breast cancer risk . "
The new research adds valuable information , she said , about a link that is accepted .
Eventually , she said , experts may add density information to established risk models to produce a more precise estimate of an individual woman 's risk .
Another study presented at the meeting found that evaluating breast cancer risk in younger women can be done effectively by using DXA ( dual energy X - ray absorptiometry ) , a lower - radiation option to mammography .

Can you feel the Recovery ?
Via : CBS :
Desperate times call for desperate measures – even if it means camping out in the rain for a chance at a job application .
Hundreds of job - seekers did just that in Queens in the hopes of landing a coveted union job .
Construction workers , engineers , electricians — hundreds spent the weekend right here .
Many left with a job application , while many others walked away empty - handed .
“ The sky ’s the limit after this ! ” said Aaron Johnson of Mount Vernon .
Johnson is living month - to - month , struggling to pay the bills , with a 4 - year - old daughter to support — and he was one of the lucky ones .
After three days of sleeping on the street , he left with one of just 750 job applications handed out for a position as an elevator technician apprentice — a secure job with pension and benefits and an earning potential up to $ 40 an hour .
“ You do n’t wanna keep working these dead - end jobs , check to check to check to check .
I do n’t want to do that anymore , ” Johnson said .
More than 1,000 eager applicants began lining up as early as Friday morning armed with a variety of skills — and warm blankets .
Though many near the end of the line knew they probably would n’t even get an application , desperation to land a job fueled their determination to stand on line anyway — and hope for the best .

How often do you have a perfect scoring opportunity staring you right in the face ?
There is a nice open spot that the goalie is not covering so you pull the puck back , take aim , and fire … and you miss the net , or put the puck right in the goalies chest .
This unfortunate non -goal did not have to happen , but it is happening to hockey players around the world .
Please help stop non -goals from happening by practicing your wrist shot accuracy for a few hours a week , and sharing this article with friends .
If you have missed that perfect scoring opportunity , you are not alone , but do not worry I am here to help .
This article will show you a number of ways that you can drastically improve your aim .
If you are a new player you will see the proper way to aim , and take a wrist shot .
If you are an experienced hockey player you may find a few ways that you can tweak your wristshot for even better accuracy .
If you follow the steps below , you should be snipe ’n those corners in no time !
Enough small talk , lets get ’r ’ done .
Look at where you are shooting !
Yes you may have heard this a million times before , but that is because it works , and still some players ( even players in men ’s leagues who have been playing for years ) do not look at where they shoot .
This very simple RULE should be the first thing you practice .
Scan the net , look for a spot to shoot , and then go on to the steps below .
Note : Some players look down because they want to make sure the puck is on the right spot on their blade .
If this is your problem then practice getting a feel for the puck on the blade of your stick .
You can do this ( when you are practicing ) by looking up at the net , stickhandling the puck for a second and then guessing where the puck is on the blade of your stick .
Now look down and see if you were right .
Repeat this process until you are right every time .
Now you will know where the puck is , just by stickhandling .
Point with your feet !
But Jeremy , I take a wrist shot with my hands and arms , what do my feet have to do with anything ?
I am glad you asked !
Your feet guide you in the direction you are skating , but they also help guide where you are shooting .
If you are aiming for the right side of the net , then the toe of your foot should be pointed to the right side of the net .
Which foot ?
The foot of whichever leg you are transferring your weight onto ( see video below for an example )
Why does this help with accuracy ?
If you align your body properly before you take the shot , then chances are your body will follow the proper alignment and your accuracy will improve .
Pointing your foot also improves power because it helps you transfer energy in the direction of the shot .
Track the trajectory of the blade of your stick
Oh boy , that sounds confusing !
Well it is actually quite simple .
Take a few shots and watch the path that the blade of your stick follows , now draw an imaginary line from where you started shooting to where the blade left the shooting surface .
If you put an arrow at the end of that line , it should be pointing at where you were shooting .
Follow Through
When taking a wrist shot the follow through is important for both power , and accuracy .
I have already told you how to get more power from your wrist shot , so I will focus on accuracy now .
Improving your accuracy with your follow through is fairly simple , follow through high to shoot high , follow through low to shoot low .
As easy as that sounds , there are players who forget .
There is one more trick that really helps you aim the puck .
We know about shooting high , and low , but what about aiming left and right ?
Assuming you are looking at where you want to shoot , aligning your feet properly and you are ready to shoot there is only one point left .
Point at where you want the puck to go
This is another trick that involves the follow through .
When you are following through with your wristshot you want to point the end of blade or the “ toe ” of the blade at where you want the puck to go .
Why does pointing the blade help with accuracy when you do it after the puck leaves the blade of the stick ?
When you point the blade you actually have to start pointing it during your shot .
Right when the puck begins to come off of the ice , you should begin to flick and roll your wrists over .
Flicking your wrists while rolling them over helps with accuracy and power but many players do not do this properly .
When you are rolling your wrists you are keeping the puck snug to the blade of the stick , and guiding it in the right direction .
Also pointing your blade at the end of the shot , will remind you to roll your wrists at the right time .
If done properly , at the end of the shot the blade of your stick should be pointing at where the puck went .
For your viewing pleasure , I have put this video together to help with your accuracy , and help you score more goals .
I hope these tips have helped you improve your wrist shot , if you have any tips of your own you can add them below .

Kal Penn to leave White House , return to Hollywood
You can call him Kal : Kalpen Modi , the White House staffer a .k.a. Kal Penn. ( Reuters / Jason Reed )
UPDATED 5 p.m. with White House comment / non - comment :
After just less than a year , Kalpen Modi is reportedly ready to be Kal Penn again .
The actor best known as Kumar from the " Harold and Kumar " movies stunned Hollywood last year when he announced he'd leave his role on the hit series " House " -- they had to kill his character off -- to take a job with the Obama administration .
But after nine months after Penn joined the White House 's Office of Public Engagement as an associate director -- and dropped his Hollywood name for his birth name -- Entertainment Weekly reported Friday that the 32 - year - old actor will resume his film career .
Hollywood trade publications report the movie will start filming mid-summer , so Penn 's departure is n't necessarily imminent .
Asked about the reports , a White House spokesman said " Mr. Modi is honored to serve in this Administration and has no announcements to make about his tenure here at this point . "
The news should n't come as too much of a surprise .
While his tenure seems to have sped by , Penn had said at the outset that he'd likely give a year or two to the job .
And well , apparently , they just can't make the " Harold and Kumar " Christmas movie without him .
( It 's due out in 2011 , and just might be filmed in 3 - D , says EW . )
But during his time here , Penn seemed to make good on his plan to be treated like any other young executive - branch staffer , largely keeping a low profile and blending in , only occasionally being recognized by fellow pedestrians on his short commute from the Logan / Dupont area to the White House complex .
He did manage to score an invitation to the November state dinner for the prime minister of India -- but also managed to avoid getting photographed with crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi .

How to Tell a True War Story
from The Things They Carried
In a true war story , if there 's a moral at all , it 's like the thread that makes the cloth .
You can't tease it out .
You can't extract the meaning without unraveling the deeper meaning .
And in the end , really , there 's nothing much to say about a true war story , except maybe " Oh . "
True war stories do not generalize .
They do not indulge in abstraction or analysis .
For example : War is hell .
As a moral declaration the old truism seems perfectly true , and yet because it abstracts , because it generalizes , I can't believe it with my stomach .
Nothing turns inside .
It comes down to gut instinct .
A true war story , if truly told , makes the stomach believe .
This one does it for me .
I 've told it before - many times , many versions - but here 's what actually happened .
We crossed that river and marched west into the mountains .
On the third day , my friend Curt Lemon stepped on a boobytrapped artillery round .
He was playing catch with Rat Kiley , laughing , and then he was dead .
The trees were thick ; it took nearly an hour to cut an LZ for the dustoff .
Later , higher in the mountains , we came across a baby VC water buffalo .
What it was doing there I do n't know - no farms , no paddies - but we chased it down and , got a rope around it and led it along to a deserted village where we set up for the night .
After supper Rat Kiley went over and stroked its nose .
He opened up a can of C rations , pork and beans , but the baby buffalo was n't interested .
Rat shrugged .
He stepped back and shot it through the right front knee .
The animal did not make a sound .
It went down hard , then got up again , and Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear .
He shot it in the hindquarters and in the little hump at its back .
He shot it twice in the flanks .
It was n't to kill ; it was to hurt .
He put the rifle muzzle up against the mouth and shot the mouth away .
Nobody said much .
The whole platoon stood there watching , feeling all kinds of things , but there was n't a great deal of pity for the baby water buffalo .
Curt Lemon was dead .
Rat Kiley had lost his best friend in the world .
Later in the week Rat would write a long personal letter to the guy 's sister , who would not write back , but for now , it was simply a question of pain .
He shot off the tail .
He shot away - chunks of meat below the ribs .
All around us there was the smell of smoke and filth and greenery , and the evening was humid and very hot .
Rat went to automatic .
He shot randomly , almost casually , quick little spurts in the belly .
Then he reloaded , squatted down , and shot it in the left front knee .
Again the animal fell hard and tried to get up , but this time it could n't quite make it .
It wobbled and went down sideways .
Rat shot it in the nose .
He bent forward and whispered something , as if talking to a pet , then he shot it in the throat .
All the while the baby water buffalo was silent , or almost silent , just a little bubbling sound where the nose had been .
It lay very still .
Nothing moved except the eyes , which were enormous , the pupils shiny black and dumb .
Rat Kiley was crying .
He tried to say something , but them cradled his rifle and went off by himself .
The rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo .
For a long time no one spoke .
We had witnessed some - thing essential , something brand - new and profound , a piece of the world so startling there was not yet a word for it .
Somebody kicked the baby buffalo .
It was still alive , though just barely , just in the eyes .
" Amazing , " Dave Jensen said .
" My whole life , I never seen anything like it . " [...]
" Never ? "
" Not hardly .
Not once . "
Kiowa and Mitchell Sanders picked up the baby buffalo .
They hauled it across the open square , hoisted it up , and dumped it in the village well .
Afterward , we sat waiting for Rat to get himself together .
" Amazing , " Dave Jensen kept saying .
" A new wrinkle .
I never seen it before . "
Mitchell Sanders took out his yo- yo .
" Well , that 's Nam , ' he said .
" Garden of Evil .
Over here , man , every sin's ret fresh and original . "
How do you generalize ?
War is hell , but that 's not the half of it , because war is mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love .
War is nasty ; war is fun .
War is thrilling ; war is drudgery .
War makes you a man ; war makes you dead .
The truths are contradictory .
It can be argued , for instance , that war is grotesque .
But in truth war is also beauty .
For all its horror , you can't help but gape at the awful majesty of combat .
You stare out at tracer rounds unwinding through the dark like brilliant red ribbons .
You crouch in ambush as a cool , impassive moon rises over the nighttime paddies .
You admire the fluid symmetries of troops on the move , the great sheets of metal - fire streaming down from a gunship , the illumination rounds , the white phosphorus , the purply orange glow of napalm , the rocket 's red glare .
It 's not pretty , exactly .
It 's astonishing .
It fills the eye .
It commands you .
You hate it , yes , but your eyes do not .
Like a killer forest fire , like cancer under a microscope , any battle or bombing raid or artillery barrage has the aesthetic purity of absolute moral indifference - a powerful , implacable beauty - and a true war story will tell the truth about this , though the truth is ugly .
To generalize about war is like generalizing about peace .
Almost everything is true .
Almost nothing is true .
Though it 's odd , you 're never more alive than when you 're almost dead .
You recognize what 's valuable .
Freshly , as if for the first time , you love what 's best in yourself and in the world , all that might be lost .
At the hour of dusk you sit at your foxhole and look out on a wide river turning pinkish red , and at the mountains beyond , and although in the morning you must cross the river and go into the mountains and do terrible things and maybe die , even so , you find yourself studying the fine colors on the river , you feel wonder and awe at the setting of the sun , and you are filled with a hard , aching love for how the world could be and always should be , but now is not .
Mitchell Sanders was right .
For the common soldier , at least , war has the feel - the spiritual texture - of a great ghostly fog , thick and permanent .
There is no clarity .
Everything swirls .
The old rules are no longer binding , the old truths no longer true .
Right spills over into wrong .
Order blends into chaos , hate into love , ugliness into beauty , law into anarchy , civility into savagery .
The vapors suck you in .
You can't tell where you are , or why you 're there , and the only certainty is absolute ambiguity .
In war you lose your sense of the definite , hence your sense of truth itself , and therefore it 's safe to say that in a true war story nothing is absolutely true .
Often in a true war story there is not even a point , or else the point does n't hit you until , say , twenty years later , in your sleep , and you wake up and shake your wife and start telling the story to her , except when you get to the end you 've forgotten the point again .
And then for a long time you lie there watching the story happen in your head .
You listen to your wife 's breathing .
The war 's over .
You close your eyes .
You smile and think , Christ , what 's the point ?
This one wakes me up .
In the mountains that day , I watched Lemon turn sideways .
He laughed and said something to Rat Kiley .
Then he took a funny half step , moving from shade into bright sunlight , and the booby - trapped artillery round blew him into a tree .
The parts were just hanging there , so Dave Jensen and I were ordered to shinny up and peel him off .
I remember the white bone of an arm .
I remember pieces of skin and something wet and yellow .
The gore was horrible , and stays with me .
But what wakes me up twenty years later is Dave Jensen singing " Lemon Tree " as we threw down the parts .
You can tell a true war story by the questions you ask .
Somebody tells a story , let 's say , and afterward you ask , " Is it true ? " and if the answer matters , you 've got your answer .
For example , we 've all heard this one .
Four guys go down a trail .
A grenade sails out .
One guy jumps on it and takes the blast and saves his three buddies .
Is it true ?
The answer matters .
You 'd feel cheated if it never happened .
Without the grounding reality , it 's just a trite bit of puffery , pure Hollywood , untrue in the way all such stories are untrue .
Yet even if it did happen - and maybe it did , anything 's possible even then you know it can't be true , because a true war story does not depend upon that kind of truth .
Absolute occurrence is irrelevant .
A thing may happen and be a total lie ; another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth .
For example : Four guys go down a trail .
A grenade sails out .
One guy jumps on it and takes the blast , but it 's a killer grenade and everybody dies anyway .
Before they die , though , one of the dead guys says , " The fuck you do that for ? " and the jumper says , " Story of my life , man , " and the other guy starts to smile but he 's dead .
That 's a true story that never happened .
Twenty years later , I can still see the sunlight on Curt Lemon 's face .
I can see him turning , looking back at Rat Kiley , then he laughed and took that curious half step from shade into sunlight , his face brown and shining , and when his foot touched down , in that instant , he must 've thought it was the sunlight that was killing him .
It was not the sunlight .
It was a rigged 105 round .
But if I could ever get the story right , how the sun seemed to gather around him and pick him up and lift him into that tree , if I could somehow recreate the fatal whiteness of that light , the quick glare , the obvious cause and effect , then you would believe the last thing Curt Lemon believed , which for him must 've been the final truth .
Sunlight was killing him .
Now and then , when I tell this story , someone will come up to me afterward and say she liked it .
It 's always a woman .
Usually it 's an older woman of kindly temperament and humane politics .
She 'll explain that as a rule she hates war stories ; she can't understand why people want to wallow in all the blood and gore .
But this one she liked .
The poor baby buffalo , it made her sad .
Sometimes , even , there are little tears .
What I should do , she 'll say , is put it all behind me .
Find new stories to tell .
I wo n't say it but I 'll think it .
I 'll picture Rat Kiley 's face , his grief , and I 'll think , You dumb cooze .
Because she was n't listening .
It was n't a war story .
It was a love story .
But you can't say that .
All you can do is tell it one more time , patiently , adding and subtracting , making up a few things to get at the real truth .
No Mitchell Sanders , you tell her .
No Curt Lemon , no Rat Kiley .
No baby buffalo .
No trail junction .
No baby buffalo .
It 's all made up .
Beginning to end .
Every goddamn detail - the mountains and the river and especially that poor dumb baby buffalo .
None of it happened .
None of it .
And even if it did happen , it did n't happen in the mountains , it happened in this little village on the Batangan Peninsula , and it was raining like crazy , and one night a guy named Stink Harris woke up screaming with a leech on his tongue .
You can tell a true war story if you just keep on telling it .
And in the end , of course , a true war story is never about war .
It 's about sunlight .
It 's about the special way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross that river and march into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do .
It 's about love and memory .
It 's about sorrow .
It 's about sisters who never write back and people who never listen .

Top 10 Junk Food Substitutes
10 Substitutes You Should Try Instead Of Grabbing The Junk Food
No matter how hard you try , unhealthy foods are almost impossible to avoid .
It does n't help that a recent study by researchers at Ontario 's University of Waterloo appears to have revealed a link between giving into cravings for junk food and lapses in brain function .
The healthier your brain , it seems , the better you 'll be able to resist the lure of that bag of chips at the grocery store checkout .
While completely avoiding junk food is practically impossible , at the very least , you can satisfy your cravings by replacing junk foods with healthy substitutes .
To guide you on this transformation , AskMen has compiled a list of the top 10 junk food substitutes .
World Bank and OECD say water is a finite resource that must be valued at a higher price in order to repair old supply systems and build new ones
Major economies are pushing for substantial increases in the price of water around the world as concern mounts about dwindling supplies and rising population .
With official UN figures showing that 1 billion people lack access to clean drinking water and more than double that number do not have proper sanitation , increases in prices will be – and in some countries are already proving to be – hugely controversial .
However experts argue that as long as most countries provide huge subsidies for water it will not be possible to change the wasteful habits of consumers , farmers and industry , nor to raise the investment needed to repair old supply systems and build new ones .
And price rises can be managed so that they do not penalise the poorest .
Last Friday , the World Bank held a high - level private meeting about water in New York , at which higher prices were discussed .
Days before that the OECD , which represents the world 's major economies , issued three water reports calling for prices to rise .
" Putting a price on water will make us aware of the scarcity and make us take better care of it , " said Angel Gurría , the OECD secretary - general .
It has also been a key theme at this week 's meeting of industry leaders in Paris , hosted by Global Water Intelligence .
The discussion at the World Bank was raised by Lars Thunell , chief executive officer of the International Finance Corporation .
" Everyone said water must be somehow valued : whether you call it cost , or price , or cost recover , " said Usha Rao - Monari , senior manager of the IFC 's infrastructure department .
" It 's not an infinite resource , and anything that 's not an infinite resource must be valued . "
Concern about dwindling water supplies has been rising with growing populations and economies .
And with climate change altering rainfall patterns , experts warn that unless changes are made , up to half the world 's population could live in areas without sustainable clean water to meet their daily needs .
Global Water Intelligence 's 2010 market report estimated the industry needs to spend $ 571bn ( £ 373 bn ) a year to maintain and improve its networks and treatment plants to meet rising demand - more than three times this year 's projected spending .
At the same time , a major report last year by consultants McKinsey , paid for by a group of water - dependent global brands including SABMiller and Nestlé , said that most of the estimated " gap " in water in 2030 could be met from efficiency savings such as better irrigation and new showerheads .
However , highly subsidised prices are hampering both investment and efficiency , because private and public companies cannot collect enough water , nor persuade farmers , homeowners and businesses to make - and sometimes pay for - changes to reduce their water use , say the experts .
" We were in a vicious cycle , " says Virgilio Rivera , a director of Manila Water , which took over water and sewage services in the city when the Philippines government passed a National Water Crisis Act in 1997 .
" Lack of investment ; poor service ; government can't increase the water rates because customers are dissatisfied ; they are not paying , so low cash flows ; so the government can't improve the service . "
Huge opposition to price rises is expected however , especially as so many prices are set by elected politicians .
Even in Washington DC there has been an outcry over calls for prices to double over the next five years to help the city raise money to spend on its 76 - year - old network of leaking lead pipes .
Obstacles include a long term " legitimacy " from providing free or very cheap water ; and vested interests , says Rao -Monari , who cites the example of water vendors in India making big profits from desperate households .
The biggest concern though is the impact on the poorest households .
There is evidence that they suffer most from the bad services of poorly funded water companies , because often they are not connected at all or have such bad services they are forced to rely on even more expensive water vendors .
In Manila , Manila Water increased bills from 4.5 to 30 pesos per cubic metre .
At first there was resistance but by 2003 the company doubled connections from 3 m to 6 m , including 1.6 m of the poorest squatters , leakage had been cut drastically , and pressure and quality had improved , said Rivera , one of the company 's directors visiting Paris .
Bills for the poorest households are now less than one - tenth of when they relied on vendors , and payment in the slum areas is 100 % , said Rivera .
Some say step pricing can be used to protect a basic water allowance for drinking , cooking and washing – either for very low prices or for free , as it is in South Africa .
" I fully agree the water we need of hydration and minimal hygiene are part of the Human Rights declaration , but this is 25 litres of water [ a day ] , which is the smallest part , " said Peter Brabeck - Letmathe , chairman of food giant Nestlé and one of the most prominent global business leaders campaigning on water .
More than 95 % of water is used to grow food , for other household needs and for industry , he added .
Food prices should not have to rise as higher water bills could be offset by efficiency improvements , from irrigation , to new seeds , or even a changing pattern of what is eaten to favour less water - intensive ingredients , said Brabeck - Letmathe .
Others favour separating water supply from government 's duty to take care of the most vulnerable .
" Ideally utilities should not make any distinction between rich and poor , " said Prof Asit Biswas , president of the Third World Centre for Water Management .
" The moment you subsidise [ someone 's bill ] people do n't use water prudently . "

Police reportedly fired live ammunition into a crowd of young people on April 3rd , killing two — at a protest against the force 's killing of another man two days previously .
The protest , called in the Ajegunle suburb against the April 1st killing of 24 - year - old Charles Okafor , was turned into a bloody massacre after police responded to some hurled stones by spraying bullets around the street .
Local media said four people had died in the incident , specifically attributing two deaths to the police action .
Sources at Lagos police dismissed the claims , saying no - one had died .
Tensions have been growing in the city as public pressure is put on the local government to clean up Lagos ' notoriously corrupt and violent public service .
The situation came to a head after Okafor allegedly died from a beating meted out when he was allegedly caught spraying graffiti .
Again , police have refused to take responsibility for the death , saying there were no marks found in his autopsy and telling reporters " he just slumped over " as police were arresting him .
The protests in Ajegunle have been mirrored in Abuja , where motorcycle couriers rioted and barricaded a road on April 2nd after a policeman allegedly killed one of their colleagues at a police observation point near the junction .
This has also been denied , with police saying the death was an accident .
Further protests are likely , including one organised by the youth group Enoughisenough , which will be holding a demonstration at the office of the Lagos state Governor in Alausa , on April 13th against corruption and the state 's misuse of power .

KUWAIT ( Reuters ) - OPEC would pump more oil to prevent a rally in oil prices above $ 100 from hurting the global economic recovery , Kuwait ’s oil minister said on Sunday .
Oil is well below the $ 100 a barrel mark , settling at just over $ 85 a barrel on Friday .
For a month , oil has traded over the $ 70 to $ 80 level that many in OPEC have pegged as fair .
But there was room for more upside before the producer group would respond , Sheikh Ahmad al - Abdullah al - Sabah told Reuters in an interview at a media event .
“ If it ’s sustained above $ 100 that would damage the economic recovery , ” he said .
When asked if OPEC would boost supply to prevent that , he replied “ I would say so . ”
Current oil prices were acceptable to both producers and consumers , he said .
The oil market was oversupplied , but Kuwait had seen a sudden , surprising surge in demand from Asia that was absorbing some of the surplus , he said .
“ I was surprised a little bit , to see a sudden surge , ” he said .
“ I was expecting to see the demand , but not at the same pace as we ’ve seen lately . ”
The whole of Kuwait was sat on more oil than previously thought , not just the Burgan oilfield , Sheikh Ahmad said .
He declined to give more details
Last week , a Kuwaiti official said Greater Burgan , the world ’s second - largest oilfield , was bigger than past estimates had indicated .

I have never seen a smaller digital camera with video recording capability so I assume this is the world ’s smallest .
It measures only 44 x 28 x 12 mm and comes in black with lots of features .
It can take pictures at up to 2048 x 1536 pixels and record videos of 1281 x 1536 at 30 frames per second with clear sound , all while attached to your keychain .
The Nano Cam seems to be a great spy gadget too because being so small it can be used as a hidden camera .
It stores AVI videos and photos on the microSD memory card and you can transfer the files on the computer via the miniUSB 2.0 interface .
You can even use it as a web camera with your computer .
This miniature high - resolution DV camcorder has the following specifications : time and date stamp , 1 lux illumination , 5MP CMOS image sensor , rechargeable Li-Ion battery , 1 hour recording per charge , 3 hours charging time , external memory support for up to 8GB , compatibility with all operating systems , button for mode selection , button for power On / Off , LED light indicator , and built - in microphone .

Internet users are still opening their spam e-mail with abandon and clicking the links and / or opening the attachments within .
These are the latest findings from the Ipsos Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group ( MAAWG ) , which found once again that people continue to practice poor e-mail habits despite awareness of the consequences .
A healthy dose of denial and ignorance about who should protect them is apparently enough to keep users clicking away .
According to the MAAWG report , a full half of all North American and Western European users admitted to having opened spam , with nearly half of those people ( 46 percent ) doing so intentionally .
Sure , a quarter of those users claimed they did so in order to unsubscribe or complain to the sender — bad idea , people !— but a full 15 percent said they opened spam because they were interested in the products or services being offered .
Another 18 percent simply wanted to " see what would happen , " and four percent actually forwarded an e-mail they identified as spam to someone else .
All this is despite the fact that many Internet users ( 44 percent ) consider themselves " somewhat experienced " in the ways of security online while another 20 percent think of themselves as an " expert . "
Nearly all were aware of the existence of bots and botnets , but two - thirds said they felt they were n't likely to get infected .
Fewer than half of those surveyed said they were responsible for protecting themselves from viruses and spam .
Strangely , the demographic most guilty of doing all this is not the older , less - Internet - experienced group of parents and grandparents .
According to Ipsos , men and those under the age of 35 are the most likely to engage in risky e-mail behavior , " the same demographic groups who are more likely to consider themselves experienced when it comes to Internet security threats . "
Younger users open spam more often , click links in spam more often , and respond more often than those over 35 .
( As an aside , my younger brother has had to completely reinstall his operating system due to malware more times in a year than I change my underwear . )
These findings are similar to those from the same group published last year ( although last year , it seems only six percent opened spam just to see what would happen — are we a bored society , or what ? ) .
At that time , the MAAWG said that this behavior coming from even a tiny percentage of users can drive a " booming spam - driven underground economy . "
Ultimately , this makes the spam problem worse for all of us , because that 's enough of a return on investment to keep encouraging spammers .
With botnets supposedly sending more than 80 percent of that spam , there are now relatively few worker - hours involved in making money from a spam - based business , making it even more appealing .
Given this , combined with users ' social networking and pop-up clicking behaviors , is it really any surprise that IT admins see us as the biggest threat to corporate security ?

TOMAH , Wis. —
Farmers markets , with their hodgepodge of organic kale , artisan rye bread and peach preserves , have surged in popularity in recent years .
But now authorities are questioning whether they 're missing a crucial ingredient : real farmers .
Here in Tomah , where a farmers market has operated for the past decade in a grassy downtown park , a nasty dispute has cropped up .
Local farmer Ronald Waege , who grows his own apples and blueberries just outside of town , says resellers are buying up produce at an auction and peddling ...
Dr. Aaron Shirley has devoted his career to serving the rural poor in the Mississippi Delta , but now the 77 - year - old pediatrician believes the key to reducing the nation ’s highest infant mortality rates lies in a surprising place : the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Never mind that America and Iran broke diplomatic relations after militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 , or that the White House is seeking new United Nations sanctions to punish the regime for its nuclear development program .
In May , Shirley and two colleagues flew to Iran for 10 days to study a low - cost rural healthcare delivery system that , according to the World Health Organization , has helped cut infant deaths by 70 % over the last three decades .
In October , four top Iranian doctors , including an official from Iran ’s Ministry of Health , visited Mississippi for a week .
They spoke at a conference in Jackson , the state capital , and toured the Delta .

“ Sometimes communication was not easy , ” Dr. Hossein Malekafzali , a professor in the School of Public Health at Tehran University , recalled in a phone interview .
“ But they can understand our system and translate it to Mississippi . ”
Iran and healthcare are politically toxic topics in Washington these days .
But Shirley and a colleague are to go to Capitol Hill today to seek funding to open an Iranian - style “ health house ” in Baptist Town , an impoverished neighborhood on the edge of Greenwood , and in 14 other Delta communities .
“ We played black gospel and blues for those Iranians , ” said Sylvester Hoover , 52 , owner of Baptist Town ’s only business , a one - room grocery , laundromat and barbecue grill .
“ They were just hugging us they were so excited .
They loved it . ”
Tensions between the United States and Iran dominate daily headlines , but both governments have given quiet support to the little - known initiative in the Delta .

In Tehran , the Foreign and Health ministries approved a memorandum of agreement to authorize collaboration between Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and Shirley ’s team , which includes Jackson State University .
In Washington , the Treasury Department granted the Mississippians a license to ensure they were not violating sanctions on Iran .
The National Institutes of Health also signaled its approval .
A posting on the NIH website notes that the “ remarkable success of Iran ’s health house concept . . . is providing hope and inspiration to officials in the Mississippi Delta . ”

Iran has 17,000 health houses , essentially rural medical outposts staffed by community health workers .
The proposed Mississippi version calls for training nurses ’ aides in each community , and then sending them door to door to help with basic needs , such as taking blood pressure and improving sanitation .
The health workers would refer patients to clinics or hospitals for more advanced care and follow up with home visits .
“ The community health workers will know who has diabetes , who has high blood pressure , who is 10 or 12 years old and pregnant , ” Shirley said .
“ They will know it because they live in the neighborhood and see them at church or the corner store . ”
Over the years , the federal government has poured tens of millions of dollars into primary healthcare research and delivery programs in the Delta , but the effect has been limited .
“ The system is broken , ” Shirley said in frustration .
“ It ’s time to try something new . ”

Mississippi ranks at or near the bottom of most healthcare indexes .
Obesity is rife among children , and teenage pregnancies , hypertension and diabetes are all too common .
The state suffers the nation ’s worst infant mortality rate -- about 50 % higher than the national average -- and the lowest life expectancy .
The uninsured mostly go to hospital emergency rooms for basic care , from colds to toothaches .
Better preventive care could ease that traffic and lower costs , so local hospital administrators are receptive to a new system .
“ People will be skeptical at first because of Iran , ” said Paula Lang , chief nursing officer at the 34 - bed Patients ’ Choice Medical Center of Humphreys County in Belzoni , which is slated to get a health house .
“ But I think they will embrace the concept when they see how it works . ”
Jennifer Tate Hibbler , payroll administrator at the Greenwood Leflore Hospital , the largest in the area , said health workers could help with problems such as identifying children about to quit school because their families could n’t afford glasses .

“ I was a senior in high school before I saw a dentist , ” she said .
“ Our community definitely needs this . ”
Shirley ’s group is seeking $ 30 million in federal funds for a three - year pilot project and has lined up support from Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D - Miss. ) , who represents the area .
But Thompson said colleagues facing reelection could balk at backing anything tied to Iran .
“ It ’s fine with me , ” Thompson said .
“ To be honest , anything that can improve deplorable health conditions in the Delta , I ’m going to support .
Even ideas that are foreign to a lot of people . ”
The proposal to emulate Iran came from James Miller , a medical services consultant in Oxford , Miss .
He first heard of the Iranian health houses several years ago at a conference in Germany .
Advertisement
“ I realized this was a model that worked , ” Miller said .
“ Plus the Iranian model seemed most transferable to the Delta situation . ”
He took the concept to Shirley , who has a much - deserved reputation for challenging the status quo in Mississippi .
Raised in poverty , Shirley became the state ’s first black pediatrician in 1965 .
He endured police brutality as a civil rights activist , helped create the state ’s largest community health center and won a MacArthur “ genius ” award in 1993 .
He now heads a nonprofit group that turned a former shopping mall into a medical center for Jackson ’s poor .
Going to Tehran did n’t faze him .
“ I felt safer in Iran than I felt in Mississippi in the 1960s , ” he said with a laugh .

An Iranian American professor at Jackson State University , Dr. Mohammad Shahbazi , reached out to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southwest Iran .
The university agreed to sponsor a visit , and Iranian authorities approved visas for the three Americans .
“ When we went , all we received were open arms and ‘ How can we help you ? ’ ” Miller said .
“ They were just amazed that Americans would come and ask for their help . ”

The Iranians who were brought to Mississippi got a shocking view of rural American poverty when they arrived in Baptist Town .

The blighted warren of muddy streets , weed - filled lots and about 500 shotgun shacks -- each has three rooms in a line so a shotgun fired through the front door supposedly would exit the back door -- is isolated between two railroads and a bayou .
The all - black community boasts a proud history as a front line in the civil rights struggle and a cradle of the Delta blues .
The local cemetery is one of three that claims to be a final resting place for Robert Johnson , the blues legend who died in 1938 .
But unemployment is widespread .
There is no school , medical clinic nor community center , and many occupied houses look as decrepit as those that are abandoned .
In one , retired cotton worker Erleen Smith , 80 , huddled on a folding chair by a space heater as a frigid draft blew through her ill - fitting door on a recent afternoon .
She had lit all four burners on the kitchen stove to help fight the cold .

She grabbed a pill for her blood pressure , swigging it down with water from a jelly jar .
Old vinyl records hung on the wall as the only decoration .
She ca n’t afford a TV , but friends stop by to check in and chat .
Told about the proposed health house , she shrugged .
“ I ai n’t never heard of Iran , ” she said .
“ But we could sure use somebody ’s help . ”

Shai Agassi boldly predicts one - third of Israel 's cars will run on electricity within five years .
It would be an outlandish claim if the entrepreneur had n't lined up a sweet plan to jump - start the country 's adoption of EVs .
Agassi's Silicon Valley startup Better Place has signed a deal under which 92 corporate fleet owners will replace their conventional vehicles with electric vehicles when their leases begin expiring next year .
What 's more , Better Place has forged a partnership with Dor Alon , one of Israeli 's largest gas station chains , to deploy its battery swap technology .
We 'll see the first of the Renault electrics on the road in 2011 , and they 'll plug into one of the dozens of charging stations Better Place is erecting or change their batteries in about the time it takes to fill your gas tank .
Many major automakers are scrambling to develop electric vehicles , and we 'll see the first of them – the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf – on the road by the end of this year .
But no one is looking at adopting them at the scale or pace Agassi and Renault / Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn are talking about .
“ With the Better Place project , for the first time , we in Israel are providing a solution for one of the biggest global problems , ” Agassi said Sunday , according to the Jerusalem Post .
“ By a happy coincidence , the Israeli government announced today that it was calling for a national plan to reduce Israel ’s dependence on fossil fuels .
I promise you that we had nothing to do with it , but we are happy about it because it shows where we ’re going . ”
Agassi spoke during the opening of Better Place Center , a " demonstration center " near Tel Aviv where Israelis can try out an electric car .
The center is housed in a refurbished petroleum tank .
But the opening was overshadowed by Agassi 's announcement that many of Israeli 's biggest fleets will embrace EVs beginning next year .
When the last of them switches to cars with cords , some 45,000 vehicles will run on electricity .
" That 's one - third of the fleet and half the fleet cars , " Agassi told Reuters , noting that the country 's 280 biggest fleets comprise about 100,000 vehicles .
" By 2020 there will be more electric cars sold per year than gas cars . "
Many of those cars will be Renaults , at least to start .
They 'll be built in Turkey and sold at a rate of 1,000 a month beginning next year .
Renault has a contract to build 100,000 EVs by 2016 .
" We are starting a country - wide test nine months from now , " Agassi said at the opening , according to Bloomberg .
" By the second half of 2011 we will open for consumers a full commercial launch after which 1,000 cars a month will come into the market . "
Better Place says there will be between 70 and 100 charging stations open by next year to ensure people can charge those cars when they are n't at home .
The startup got a big boost from Morgan Stanley and HSBC when the two firms invested $ 350 million last month .
Reuters says that puts Better Place 's value at $ 1.25 billion .
" We think there will be extremely large demand and Better Place can rapidly achieve profitability , " Mark Norbury of HSBC told reporters Sunday .
" We like Better Place 's business model . "
The company is slated for another big infusion of cash .
Israel Corp. , already a huge backer , plans to invest another $ 72 million next month , bringing its total stake to 30 percent , according to Bloomberg .
“ We believe this is the way for the future , ” Idan Ofer , chairman of Israel Corp. , said .
“ This is actually the biggest business opportunity I can see for the next 20 years . ”

Greece Is Out , We Just Have To Sort Out the Details
April 8 , 2010
By John R. Taylor , Jr.
Chief Investment Officer
Global monetary and macro economics have become more like the literary nonsense in Alice in Wonderland .
It is great fun to read , but unfortunately for all of us , we are living through this economic house of mirrors , which is more and more rapidly spinning out of control .
The situation in Greece is the most poignant example at the moment .
Although there do not seem to be more than 100 people in all of New York City that have any interest or concept of what is going on in Greece and within the euro , the events of the next few months will have a tremendous impact on the world .
If the political actors in this tragedy - comedy play their roles well – staving off collapse – our suffering will be worse .
There is no way to win .
The powerful elite political forces , and their co-opted market allies , involved in this fanciful decision - making can not control the economic reality that will eventually destroy Greece and Europe .
Hopefully , they will be forced to give up before the damage is too severe .
The quicker the crisis comes , the better for the world , but almost everyone is working in the other direction , stretching it out to inflict maximum pain .
At this point , the best way out for Greece is very clear .
Greece should pull out of the euro this weekend , issue new drachma notes as soon as possible , and let the lawyers clean up the mess .
If I were running Portugal , Italy , or Spain I would do the same thing – the first one out is the winner .
Our office has done a non-exhaustive , but quite extensive search of the research coming from banks , and it made no difference whether it was from Anglo - Saxon or European names , it was all positive for the rest of the year .
Greece will make it !
Fantastic cash flow projections , great statements about ‘ never giving up , ’ assessments of how horrifying it would be to leave the euro , and legal issues galore .
Almost not one of these major institutions issuing these studies talked about how horrifying it would be to remain in the euro , how many man-hours of work would be lost , and how lives would be destroyed .
There was no comparative studies section , which would have compared what we already know from Ireland , Latvia , Lithuania , and Iceland .
Internal devaluation is hell .
We believe the Baltic states will make it because they would eat grass and leaves to stay out of the hands of the Russian bear next door , and if Europe follows its Greek strategy much longer , they might have to .
Remember , retail sales in Latvia were down 30.2 % last year and this year they should decline another 10 % or so .
My heart goes out to them , but their country is in a much better situation to suffer this internal devaluation process than Greece , as international trade is a much bigger factor of GDP .
Latvia can win even if the Germans are determined to have no wage growth , positive productivity growth and no appreciable CPI movement , but the Greeks and the other southern Europeans are more rational than the Lats .
There is nothing but politics that says that Greece can make it through this process .
Although politics includes compromise when it is working , the breakdown of politics is war .
Usually the war implied in this famous aphorism would be between states , but in this case it would be between the people and the government that has failed them .
The Greek government can’t follow the current course .
On the issue of ‘ internal devaluation , ’ the European political elites are way out of touch with their people : almost no one will stand for it .
The political maze we are entering might have many twists and turns with distorting mirrors , but money is money and its powerful logic will win in the end .
No matter how many speeches and new regulations are made , the Greek economy will continue to deteriorate , dragging down the rest of Europe far more powerfully than its 3 % implies .
Please let the Greeks out and please restructure the euro , or drop the whole idea .
If you do n’t , the future will not be pretty .

ATLANTA --
The Georgia police officer who took the first report from the woman who accused Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger of sexual assault has resigned .
Milledgeville police Chief Woodrow Blue on Friday confirmed that Sgt. Jerry Blash resigned Wednesday , a day before the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made public all documents related to its investigation of a 20 - year - old woman 's claim that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted her in a nightclub .
Prosecutors announced earlier this week that they are not charging Roethlisberger in the March 5 incident .
Blash is the only officer who interviewed the quarterback .
He acknowledged in an interview with investigators that he made some derogatory comments about the accuser to other officers , and that some in Roethlisberger 's party may have overheard him .
Multiple calls to a phone number listed for Blash went unanswered .
Photos surfaced online a week later of Roethlisberger smiling alongside Blash at the Milledgeville nightclub where the alleged assault took place .
Blue said the photos were taken hours before the allegation was made .
Blue said on March 12 that beyond filing the report , Blash was not involved in the investigation .
The accuser , a college student , said she tried to get away from Roethlisberger while in the bar , named Capital City , and told him , " No , this is not OK , " according to the police documents released Thursday .
In a statement to police on March 5 , the woman said Roethlisberger encouraged her and her friends to take numerous shots of alcohol .
Then one of his bodyguards escorted her into a hallway at the nightclub , sat her on a stool and left .
She said Roethlisberger walked down the hallway and exposed himself .
" I told him it was n't OK , no , we do n't need to do this and I proceeded to get up and try to leave , " she said .
" I went to the first door I saw , which happened to be a bathroom . "
According to her statement , Roethlisberger then followed her and shut the door .
" I still said no , this is not OK , and he then had sex with me , " she wrote .
" He said it was OK .
He then left without saying anything . "
Also revealed in the GBI reports released Thursday was the fact investigators wanted to talk with a woman about a separate incident reportedly involving Roethlisberger .
The documents show that after the alleged assault in Milledgeville , a 16 - year - old in a youth law enforcement program told authorities he knew about incidents involving Roethlisberger and a friend 's sister .
Authorities repeatedly sought to interview the woman , who is in her early 20s , but she declined .
The teen had said he believed the two - time Super Bowl winner twice made unwanted sexual advances toward the woman .
A message seeking comment was left Friday with Roethlisberger 's lawyer , Ed Garland .
Roethlisberger also is being sued in civil court by a former Nevada hotel employee for an alleged sexual assault in 2008 .
No criminal charges were filed in that case .
In the meantime , the fallout continues to affect the Steelers , this time in the pocketbook .
The behavior of Roethlisberger and former Steelers wide receiver Santonio Holmes might result in a fine by the NFL of as much as $ 200,000 .
Holmes , traded Sunday to the New York Jets , is suspended for the first four games of the season for violating the league 's substance abuse policy , and has been involved in a number of incidents that put him in a bad light .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .

A Special Operations Forces raid on Feb. 12 on what was supposed to be the compound of a Taliban leader but that killed three women and two Afghan government officials demonstrated a fatal weakness of the U.S. military engagement in Afghanistan : after eight years of operating there , the U.S. military still has no understanding of the personal , tribal , and other local sociopolitical conflicts .
In targeting the suspected Taliban in such raids , therefore , the U.S. military command has been forced to rely on informants of unknown reliability  and motives .
As a provincial council member from Gardez , near the scene of the botched raid , declared bitterly last week , U.S. Special Forces " do n’t know who is the enemy and who is n’t . "
When the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command , Adm .
William McRaven , went to the site of the raid to apologize , the head of the extended family that lost five people to the SOF unit , Hajji Sharibuddin , demanded that the U.S. military turn over " the spy who gave the false information to the Americans . "
Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and his chief of intelligence , Gen. Michael Flynn , have admitted the profound ignorance of the U.S. military about Afghan society , while avoiding the implications of that ignorance for the issue of false intelligence on the Taliban .
McChrystal acknowledged in his " initial assessment " last August that his command had to " acquire a far better understanding of Afghanistan and its people . "
In an interview with National Public Radio Aug. 13 , Flynn admitted , " What we really have not done to the degree that we need to is really truly understand the population : the tribal dynamics , the tribal networks , the ethnicity . "
Such dynamics are different " from valley to valley , " Flynn observed .
And in an unusual paper published by the Center for a New American Security last October , Flynn was even more frank , saying , " I do n’t want to say we ’re clueless , but we are .
We ’re no more than fingernail deep in our understanding the environment . "
Flynn avoided any suggestion that this profound ignorance of the society in which U.S. troops are operating could affect targeting of suspected Taliban .
He asserted that the intelligence problem is not about the Taliban but about the lack of knowledge about governance and development issues .
But a foreign military force that is so fundamentally ignorant of the sociopolitical forces at play inevitably allows local sources which have access to it to act in their own self - interest .
More often than not , the U.S. and NATO have depended heavily on ties with Afghan tribal leaders and warlords .
That has proven disastrous over and over again .
Col . David Lamm , who was chief of staff for Gen. David Barno , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 , has said that it became clear to top officials in the command that it should not make alliances with tribes to obtain information on the Taliban .
It often turned out that a group which a tribal leader said was the Taliban was actually a competing tribe , Lamm recalled in a September 2008 interview with IPS .
Barno also ordered his commanders to shun local police as intelligence sources on the Taliban .
" Local police were too close to the local elite , " said Lamm .
Despite such warnings , however , CIA and military intelligence operatives have continued to rely on tribal patriarchs and local warlords as intelligence sources on the Taliban .
As recently as December 2008 , U.S. intelligence officials were telling Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick that their operatives had been using gifts of Viagra , among other inducements , to get warlords and tribal leaders to provide such intelligence .
The U.S. military , including SOF units , have also relied on local warlords to provide security for their bases and logistics , as documented by a study by the Center on International Cooperation at New York University last September .
Those ties translate into channels for intelligence as well .
The most egregious example is the CIA ’s use of intelligence from Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of President Hamid Karzai , the chairman of the Kandahar province council and the most powerful figure in the province .
Rajiv Chandrasekaran reported in the Washington Post last September that U.S. and Canadian diplomats had not pressed President Karzai to dismiss his brother from his position , because he had provided " valuable intelligence " to the U.S. military .
The inability of the U.S. military to organize its own networks of reliable agents has also led to a willingness to act with lethal force on the basis of tips from dubious sources .
In the most widely known instance of mass civilian casualties from a U.S. attack , an air strike on the village of Azizabad in Heart province in August 2008 , Afghan officials expressed certainty that U.S. commanders had been misled by a rival of clan leader Timor Shah , who had died some months before .
An investigation of the incident by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission ( AIHRC ) revealed that a former business partner of Timor ’s who still had personal enmity toward the family  and who had been involved in various criminal activities  had passed false information to Coalition Forces that there would be a big gathering of Taliban fighters in Azizabad .
The U.S. command carried out a devastating bombing of what turned out to have been a memorial ceremony for Timor Shah .
As many as 90 civilians , including 60 children , were killed by the bombing .
UN Rapporteur Philip Alston wrote in a May 2009 report that " numerous government officials " had told him that " false tips " had " often " caused night raids to result in the killing of innocent civilians .
He reported that one provincial governor had " stated that there were people in his province who made a business acting as intermediaries who would give false tips to the international forces in return for payment from individuals holding grudges . "
Alston was told by a village elder in Nuristan that a district government had fed false information to " international forces " that led to a raid targeting his local opponents .
He also said a similar incident in Nangarhar ’s Ghani Khel district was reported to him .
Alston reported that a " senior official " who responded to his critical report did not deny that " feuds " drive much of the identification of local Taliban officials .
Instead the official suggested that such " feuds " were simply " part and parcel of the conflict between the Taliban and the government . "
Instead of admitting that U.S. intelligence was fatally flawed , the U.S. military command had simply adopted a justification that did not require any real understanding of the society .
McChrystal , on the other hand , has lamented that ignorance but continues to authorize raids that are based on the faulty intelligence it generates .
( Inter Press Service )
Pope Benedict has made worse just about everything that is wrong with the Roman Catholic Church and is directly responsible for engineering the global cover - up of child rape perpetrated by priests , according to this open letter to all Catholic bishops
VENERABLE BISHOPS ,
Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict XVI , and I were the youngest theologians at the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 .
Now we are the oldest and the only ones still fully active .
I have always understood my theological work as a service to the Roman Catholic Church .
For this reason , on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the election of Pope Benedict XVI , I am making this appeal to you in an open letter .
In doing so , I am motivated by my profound concern for our church , which now finds itself in the worst credibility crisis since the Reformation .
Please excuse the form of an open letter ; unfortunately , I have no other way of reaching you .
I deeply appreciated that the pope invited me , his outspoken critic , to meet for a friendly , four - hour - long conversation shortly after he took office .
This awakened in me the hope that my former colleague at Tubingen University might find his way to promote an ongoing renewal of the church and an ecumenical rapprochement in the spirit of the Second Vatican Council .
Unfortunately , my hopes and those of so many engaged Catholic men and women have not been fulfilled .
And in my subsequent correspondence with the pope , I have pointed this out to him many times .
Without a doubt , he conscientiously performs his everyday duties as pope , and he has given us three helpful encyclicals on faith , hope and charity .
But when it comes to facing the major challenges of our times , his pontificate has increasingly passed up more opportunities than it has taken :
Missed is the opportunity for rapprochement with the Protestant churches : Instead , they have been denied the status of churches in the proper sense of the term and , for that reason , their ministries are not recognized and intercommunion is not possible .
Missed is the opportunity for the long - term reconciliation with the Jews : Instead the pope has reintroduced into the liturgy a preconciliar prayer for the enlightenment of the Jews , he has taken notoriously anti-Semitic and schismatic bishops back into communion with the church , and he is actively promoting the beatification of Pope Pius XII , who has been accused of not offering sufficient protections to Jews in Nazi Germany .
The fact is , Benedict sees in Judaism only the historic root of Christianity ; he does not take it seriously as an ongoing religious community offering its own path to salvation .
The recent comparison of the current criticism faced by the pope with anti-Semitic hate campaigns – made by Rev Raniero Cantalamessa during an official Good Friday service at the Vatican – has stirred up a storm of indignation among Jews around the world .
Missed is the opportunity for a dialogue with Muslims in an atmosphere of mutual trust : Instead , in his ill - advised but symptomatic 2006 Regensburg lecture , Benedict caricatured Islam as a religion of violence and inhumanity and thus evoked enduring Muslim mistrust .
Missed is the opportunity for reconciliation with the colonised indigenous peoples of Latin America : Instead , the pope asserted in all seriousness that they had been “ longing ” for the religion of their European conquerors .
Missed is the opportunity to help the people of Africa by allowing the use of birth control to fight overpopulation and condoms to fight the spread of HIV .
Missed is the opportunity to make peace with modern science by clearly affirming the theory of evolution and accepting stem - cell research .
Missed is the opportunity to make the spirit of the Second Vatican Council the compass for the whole Catholic Church , including the Vatican itself , and thus to promote the needed reforms in the church .
This last point , respected bishops , is the most serious of all .
Time and again , this pope has added qualifications to the conciliar texts and interpreted them against the spirit of the council fathers .
Time and again , he has taken an express stand against the Ecumenical Council , which according to canon law represents the highest authority in the Catholic Church :
He has taken the bishops of the traditionalist Pius X Society back into the church without any preconditions – bishops who were illegally consecrated outside the Catholic Church and who reject central points of the Second Vatican Council ( including liturgical reform , freedom of religion and the rapprochement with Judaism ) .
He promotes the medieval Tridentine Mass by all possible means and occasionally celebrates the Eucharist in Latin with his back to the congregation .
He refuses to put into effect the rapprochement with the Anglican Church , which was laid out in official ecumenical documents by the Anglican - Roman Catholic International Commission , and has attempted instead to lure married Anglican clergy into the Roman Catholic Church by freeing them from the very rule of celibacy that has forced tens of thousands of Roman Catholic priests out of office .
He has actively reinforced the anti-conciliar forces in the church by appointing reactionary officials to key offices in the Curia ( including the secretariat of state , and positions in the liturgical commission ) while appointing reactionary bishops around the world .
Pope Benedict XVI seems to be increasingly cut off from the vast majority of church members who pay less and less heed to Rome and , at best , identify themselves only with their local parish and bishop .
I know that many of you are pained by this situation .
In his anti-conciliar policy , the pope receives the full support of the Roman Curia .
The Curia does its best to stifle criticism in the episcopate and in the church as a whole and to discredit critics with all the means at its disposal .
With a return to pomp and spectacle catching the attention of the media , the reactionary forces in Rome have attempted to present us with a strong church fronted by an absolutistic “ Vicar of Christ ” who combines the church ’s legislative , executive and judicial powers in his hands alone .
But Benedict ’s policy of restoration has failed .
All of his spectacular appearances , demonstrative journeys and public statements have failed to influence the opinions of most Catholics on controversial issues .
This is especially true regarding matters of sexual morality .
Even the papal youth meetings , attended above all by conservative - charismatic groups , have failed to hold back the steady drain of those leaving the church or to attract more vocations to the priesthood .
You in particular , as bishops , have reason for deep sorrow :
Tens of thousands of priests have resigned their office since the Second Vatican Council , for the most part because of the celibacy rule .
Vocations to the priesthood , but also to religious orders , sisterhoods and lay brotherhoods are down – not just quantitatively but qualitatively .
Resignation and frustration are spreading rapidly among both the clergy and the active laity .
Many feel that they have been left in the lurch with their personal needs , and many are in deep distress over the state of the church .
In many of your dioceses , it is the same story : increasingly empty churches , empty seminaries and empty rectories .
In many countries , due to the lack of priests , more and more parishes are being merged , often against the will of their members , into ever larger “ pastoral units , ” in which the few surviving pastors are completely overtaxed .
This is church reform in pretense rather than fact !
And now , on top of these many crises comes a scandal crying out to heaven – the revelation of the clerical abuse of thousands of children and adolescents , first in the United States , then in Ireland and now in Germany and other countries .
And to make matters worse , the handling of these cases has given rise to an unprecedented leadership crisis and a collapse of trust in church leadership .
There is no denying the fact that the worldwide system of covering up cases of sexual crimes committed by clerics was engineered by the Roman Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Cardinal Ratzinger ( 1981-2005 ) .
During the reign of Pope John Paul II , that congregation had already taken charge of all such cases under oath of strictest silence .
Ratzinger himself , on May 18th , 2001 , sent a solemn document to all the bishops dealing with severe crimes ( “ epistula de delictis gravioribus ” ) , in which cases of abuse were sealed under the “ secretum pontificium ” , the violation of which could entail grave ecclesiastical penalties .
With good reason , therefore , many people have expected a personal mea culpa on the part of the former prefect and current pope .
Instead , the pope passed up the opportunity afforded by Holy Week : On Easter Sunday , he had his innocence proclaimed “ urbi et orbi” by the dean of the College of Cardinals .
The consequences of all these scandals for the reputation of the Catholic Church are disastrous .
Important church leaders have already admitted this .
Numerous innocent and committed pastors and educators are suffering under the stigma of suspicion now blanketing the church .
You , reverend bishops , must face up to the question :
What will happen to our church and to your diocese in the future ?
It is not my intention to sketch out a new program of church reform .
That I have done often enough both before and after the council .
Instead , I want only to lay before you six proposals that I am convinced are supported by millions of Catholics who have no voice in the current situation .
1 . Do not keep silent :
By keeping silent in the face of so many serious grievances , you taint yourselves with guilt .
When you feel that certain laws , directives and measures are counterproductive , you should say this in public .
Send Rome not professions of your devotion , but rather calls for reform !
2 . Set about reform :
Too many in the church and in the episcopate complain about Rome , but do nothing themselves .
When people no longer attend church in a diocese , when the ministry bears little fruit , when the public is kept in ignorance about the needs of the world , when ecumenical co-operation is reduced to a minimum , then the blame cannot simply be shoved off on Rome .
Whether bishop , priest , layman or laywoman – everyone can do something for the renewal of the church within his own sphere of influence , be it large or small .
Many of the great achievements that have occurred in the individual parishes and in the church at large owe their origin to the initiative of an individual or a small group .
As bishops , you should support such initiatives and , especially given the present situation , you should respond to the just complaints of the faithful .
3 . Act in a collegial way : After heated debate and against the persistent opposition of the Curia , the Second Vatican Council decreed the collegiality of the pope and the bishops .
It did so in the sense of the Acts of the Apostles , in which Peter did not act alone without the college of the apostles .
In the post - conciliar era , however , the pope and the Curia have ignored this decree .
Just two years after the council , Pope Paul VI issued his encyclical defending the controversial celibacy law without the slightest consultation of the bishops .
Since then , papal politics and the papal magisterium have continued to act in the old , uncollegial fashion .
Even in liturgical matters , the pope rules as an autocrat over and against the bishops .
He is happy to surround himself with them as long as they are nothing more than stage extras with neither voices nor voting rights .
This is why , venerable bishops , you should not act for yourselves alone , but rather in the community of the other bishops , of the priests and of the men and women who make up the church .
4. Unconditional obedience is owed to God alone :
Although at your episcopal consecration you had to take an oath of unconditional obedience to the pope , you know that unconditional obedience can never be paid to any human authority ; it is due to God alone .
For this reason , you should not feel impeded by your oath to speak the truth about the current crisis facing the church , your diocese and your country .
Your model should be the apostle Paul , who dared to oppose Peter “ to his face since he was manifestly in the wrong ” !
( Galatians 2:11 ) .
Pressuring the Roman authorities in the spirit of Christian fraternity can be permissible and even necessary when they fail to live up to the spirit of the Gospel and its mission .
The use of the vernacular in the liturgy , the changes in the regulations governing mixed marriages , the affirmation of tolerance , democracy and human rights , the opening up of an ecumenical approach , and the many other reforms of Vatican II were only achieved because of tenacious pressure from below .
5 . Work for regional solutions :
The Vatican has frequently turned a deaf ear to the well - founded demands of the episcopate , the priests and the laity .
This is all the more reason for seeking wise regional solutions .
As you are well aware , the rule of celibacy , which was inherited from the Middle Ages , represents a particularly delicate problem .
In the context of today ’s clerical abuse scandal , the practice has been increasingly called into question .
Against the expressed will of Rome , a change would appear hardly possible ; yet this is no reason for passive resignation .
When a priest , after mature consideration , wishes to marry , there is no reason why he must automatically resign his office when his bishop and his parish choose to stand behind him .
Individual episcopal conferences could take the lead with regional solutions .
It would be better , however , to seek a solution for the whole church , therefore :
6 . Call for a council : Just as the achievement of liturgical reform , religious freedom , ecumenism and inter-religious dialogue required an ecumenical council , so now a council is needed to solve the dramatically escalating problems calling for reform .
In the century before the Reformation , the Council of Constance decreed that councils should be held every five years .
Yet the Roman Curia successfully managed to circumvent this ruling .
There is no question that the Curia , fearing a limitation of its power , would do everything in its power to prevent a council coming together in the present situation .
Thus it is up to you to push through the calling of a council or at least a representative assembly of bishops .
With the church in deep crisis , this is my appeal to you , venerable bishops :
Put to use the episcopal authority that was reaffirmed by the Second Vatican Council .
In this urgent situation , the eyes of the world turn to you .
Innumerable people have lost their trust in the Catholic Church .
Only by openly and honestly reckoning with these problems and resolutely carrying out needed reforms can their trust be regained .
With all due respect , I beg you to do your part – together with your fellow bishops as far as possible , but also alone if necessary – in apostolic “ fearlessness ” ( Acts 4:29 , 31 ) .
Give your faithful signs of hope and encouragement and give our church a perspective for the future .
With warm greetings in the community of the Christian faith ,

The second team to be drawn in Group C , Bob Bradley ’s United States squad will have high hopes ahead of this summer ’s tournament in South Africa .
Having finished comfortably top in CONCACAF qualification following some particularly impressive results against Mexico and Honduras , the USA will be looking to further improve its growing reputation in the game with a strong showing during the World Cup , the country ’s sixth consecutive appearance at the finals .
With a relatively young squad peppered with high - calibre footballing talent , Bradley ’s team has the ability to worry the world ’s best with an abundance of pace , skill and top - level experience .
Tending to favour a flexible 4 - 4 - 2 formation , Bradley has shown a preference for two holding midfield players – one of which being his hugely talented son , Michael – flanked by two wide players with a greater license to attack , Fulham ’s Clint Dempsey and LA Galaxy ’s Landon Donovan .
Up front Houston Dynamo ’s Brian Ching and Jozy Altidore of Villarreal partner each other in a 4 - 4 - 2 , although Donovan has also led the line on occasion or come from deep in a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 .
Although team USA appears to have a well - established group of players going into the World Cup , the squad has suffered its fair share of injuries in recent months .
Star striker Charlie Davies , who plies his trade with Sochaux in France , was involved in a car accident last autumn which tragically killed a fellow passenger and caused the player extensive injuries which have ruled him out of this summer ’s tournament .
On top of that , Stuart Holden , an adaptable midfield player who has proved his worth to the national team over the last twelve months , broke his leg in the 2 - 1 friendly defeat to the Netherlands in March and is in a race against time to get back to full fitness fitness before June .
However , with two friendlies against Turkey and Australia ahead of the USA ’s tournament opener against England , Bradley has plenty of time to refine his team ’s personnel and tactics before taking to the field in Rustenburg on June 12th .
Indeed , the game against Fabio Capello ’s side could well determine just how succesful the campaign will or will not be for the Americans .
A win or a draw and the team would be in prime position to spring a surprise and usurp the group favourites at the top of the pool , but a defeat could destabilise the side and , should they qualify as runners - up as many expect them too , would most probably lead to a difficult second round encounter with Germany .
It could all stand and fall on that opening game .
Probable starting XI : Howard ( Everton ) ; Cherundolo ( Hannover 96 ) , Bocanegra ( Rennes ) , Onyewu ( AC Milan ) , Bornstein ( Chivas USA ) ; Dempsey ( Fulham ) , Bradley ( Borussia Monchengladbach ) , Clark ( Eintracht Frankfurt ) , Donovan ( Los Angeles Galaxy ) ; Ching ( Houston Dynamo ) , Altidore ( Villarreal )
The Road to South Africa : 1st place in CONCACAF qualification
World Ranking : 14th
Odds : 80/1
Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 10 April 2010
Lucia de Berk is a Dutch nurse who has spent 6 years in jail on a life sentence for murdering 7 people , in a killing spree that never happened .
She will hear about her appeal on Wednesday , and there is now little doubt that she will be let off .
The statistical errors in the evidence against her were so crass that they can be explained in one newspaper column .
So will the people who jailed her apologise ?
The case against Lucia was built on a suspicious pattern : there were 9 incidents on a ward where she worked , and Lucia was present for all of them .
This could be suspicious , but it could be a random cluster , best illustrated by the “ Texas Sharp Shooter ” phenomenon : imagine I am stood in front of a wooden barn with a machine gun in each hand , maniacally firing off a thousand bullets into the wall .
I remove my blindfold , walk up to the barn , find 3 bullets which are very close together , and carefully paint a target around them .
Then I announce that I am an olympic standard rifleman .
This is plainly foolish .
All across the world , nurses are working on wards , where patients die , and it is inevitable that on one ward , in one hospital , in one town , in one country , somewhere in the world , you will find one nurse who seems to be on a lot when patients die .
It ’s very unlikely that one particular prespecified person will win the lottery , but it ’s inevitable that someone will win : we do n’t suspect the winner of rigging the balls .
And did the idea that there was a killer on the loose make any sense , statistically , for the hospital as a whole ?
There were 6 deaths over 3 years on one key ward where Lucia supposedly did her murdering .
In the 3 preceeding years , before Lucia arrived , there were 7 deaths .
So the death rate on this ward went down at the precise moment that a serial killer – on a killing spree – moved in .
Even more bizarre was the staggering foolishness by some of the statistical experts used in the court .
One , Henk Elffers , a professor of law , combined individual statistical tests by taking p-values – a mathematical expression of statistical significance – and multiplying them together .
This bit is for the nerds : you do not just multiply p-values together , you weave them with a clever tool , like maybe ‘ Fisher ’s method for combination of independent p-values ’ .
If you multiply p-values together , then chance incidents will rapidly appear to be vanishingly unlikely .
Let ’s say you worked in twenty hospitals , each with a pattern of incidents that is purely random noise : let ’s say p=0.5 .
If you multiply those harmless p-values , of entirely chance findings , you end up with a final p-value of p < 0.000001 , falsely implying that the outcome is extremely highly statistically significant .
With this mathematical error , by this reasoning , if you change hospitals a lot , you automatically become a suspect .
One statistician – Richard Gill – has held the Dutch courts ’ feet to the fire , writing endless papers on these laughable statistical flaws ( qurl.com / gill ) .
Alongside the illusory patterns he has identified , there was one firm piece of forensic evidence .
Some traces of the drug digoxin were found in one baby who died .
The baby had previously been prescribed digoxin , months previously .
Three court toxicologists now say the digoxin was not the cause of death .
In fact , even the Dutch state proseution now accepts that Lucia should be acquitted , and that there was no evidence for an unnatural death in any of the patients , though her convictions for stealing two library books from the hospital library – shamefully and bizarrely – will be upheld .
Lucia denies stealing these two library books .
Now living with her partner while she awaits the final judgement , Lucia is penniless , denied unemployment benefits because of her unusual status , and paralysed down one side following a stroke which she had , in 2006 , aged 44 , in the week she was told that her conviction would be upheld .
Watch what the Dutch legal system does next , because they owe this woman a great deal .

Desiree Dougherty was the overachiever of a modest family , the daughter of a sheet - metal worker and foreman and a nurse in Rockland County , about 30 miles north of New York City .
She was 5 - foot - 1 , with a wide , warm smile , a cascade of blond hair , blue eyes and a figure that turned heads .
She loved the color green ; Pink Floyd ; and sentimental books and movies , like Richard Bach ’s novel “ One , ” about life ’s choices , and “ Pretty Woman . ”
She met her future husband , Robert Pardi Jr. , on her first day of college at Stony Brook University .
She wanted to be a doctor ; he wanted to make money .
“ She was a hippie chick with blue eyeliner , ” her husband recalled of those carefree days , “ a far cry from the Ann Taylor woman she would later become . ”
She began an M.D. - Ph.D. program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan at age 24 .
In 1998 , she was halfway through when she decided to take a few months off to join her husband in the United Arab Emirates , where he was working as a portfolio manager .
‘ It Was Bad News ’
She needed a routine health screening to obtain a visa to remain in the country , and opted for a more thorough exam .
At the hospital in Dubai , she later explained , the custom was for doctors to talk to the husband , even when the wife was the patient .
So her husband came home early one afternoon , and instead of taking her out for Turkish coffee and sweets , sat her down and said , “ I ’m afraid it was bad news . ”
Further tests showed she had breast cancer .
She had just turned 31 .
She discovered that she liked having her husband act as a buffer between her and her doctors .
From then on , even when she was in the United States , her doctors were told that they should communicate only with him .
Image Dr. Desiree Pardi on duty , top , and with her husband about a month before she died .
She light - heartedly called herself “ the Queen of Denial , ” because she did not want to know anything about her disease .
Her husband gave her just enough information to enable her to make decisions , and she always chose the most aggressive treatment .
When a doctor in Dubai suggested she wait a bit before getting a mastectomy , she would not hear it .
“ Off , I want it off ! ” she insisted .

Large modern tuna boats have revolutionised the industry A proposal to ban international trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna , which is a sushi mainstay in Japan , has been rejected by a UN wildlife meeting .
Thursday 's decision occurred after Japan , Canada and many poor nations opposed the measure on the grounds it would devastate fishing economies .
Monaco tabled the plan at the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
Stocks have fallen by about 85 % since the industrial fishing era began .
Monaco argued that the organisation responsible for managing the bluefin fishery - the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( Iccat ) - had not implemented measures strict enough to ensure the species ' survival .
Scientists and campaigners working with conservation organisations were disappointed with the outcome .
" We think it is quite a blow , " said Glenn Sant , leader of the global marine programme with Traffic , the international wildlife trade monitoring network .
Today 's vote was a setback for the Atlantic bluefin tuna
Tom Strickland , US delegation Earth Watch : Tuna and hypocrisy
" Iccat has not been able to demonstrate that it is able to implement procedures that will lead to [ the bluefin 's ] recovery .
" There was really no question that it met the [ scientific ] criteria for listing , " he told BBC News from the conference in Doha , Qatar .
" Listing " is the technical term for imposing restriction on international trade through CITES .
Bluefin tuna was slated for listing on Appendix One - a complete ban .
Mr Sant was a member of the expert panel convened last year by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to examine whether the Atlantic bluefin 's plight was severe enough to meet Appendix One criteria .
A majority of the panel believed it did , though consensus was not achieved .
Earlier , Iccat 's scientific advisers had concluded a trade ban was justified .
UK defiance
The US , which supported and lobbied for the ban , also described the outcome as " disappointing " .
" Today 's vote was a setback for the Atlantic bluefin tuna , " said Tom Strickland , head of the nation 's CITES delegation .
" But we will keep fighting to ensure that the fishery is managed sustainably , so that future generations may see it return to health . "
US officials said they would be pressing governments to live up to promises to control fishing through Iccat .
CITES EXPLAINED
Threatened organisms listed on three appendices depending on level of risk Appendix 1 - all international trade banned Appendix 2 - international trade monitored and regulated Appendix 3 - trade bans by individual governments , others asked to assist " Uplisting " - moving organism to a more protective appendix ; " downlisting " - the reverse Conferences of the Parties ( COPs ) held every three years CITES administered by UN Environment Programme ( Unep ) Japan - the principal bluefin - consuming nation - had made its opposition to the proposal clear before the CITES meeting started .
It argues that commercial fisheries should be managed through bodies such as Iccat .
The debate - described by one observer as " passionate " - saw two votes .
The first , on an EU amendment that weakened the original Monaco proposal but still endorsed the ban , was defeated by 72 votes to 43 in a secret ballot .
( The EU is supposed to vote as a bloc in these negotiations .
Nations with active tuna fleets such as France , Italy and Spain had been unwilling to support an outright , immediate ban . )
The vote on the original motion then went down by 68 votes to 20 .
In theory , EU nations had to to abstain on the second vote as not all delegates had authority from their governments to vote for it .
However , some - including the UK - did support the motion , BBC News has learned - a move that potentially risks sanctions from the European Commission .
Bear facts
Sue Lieberman , director of international policy with the Pew Environment Group , suggested lobbying from the fishing industry was ultimately responsible for the defeat .
" This meeting presented a golden opportunity for governments to take a stand against overfishing , and too many governments failed to do so , " she said .
" The market for this fish is just too lucrative , and the pressure from fishing interests too great , for enough governments to support a truly sustainable future for the fish . "
CITES votes can be reviewed on the meeting 's final day , but the substantial margin of defeat suggests this one will not be .
Earlier in the day , a US - sponsored motion seeking to ban international trade in products made from polar bears was also defeated .
Opponents argued that the species ' main threat was not trade , but climate change .
Some conservation groups - including Traffic - did not support the proposal , therefore .
There were also concerns that banning the trade might hurt indigenous peoples around the Arctic who sometimes hunt the bears for meat .

April 5 , 2010  --
An initiative to legalize marijuana in California will appear on the November ballot and both sides of the debate are wasting no time trying to smoke out the opposition .
But in an interesting wrinkle , California 's pro-pot proponents are gaining support from some unlikely allies .
" We 're definitely getting more support every day from people who have n't supported us in the past , " says Richard Lee , the businessman and activist who led the effort that collected 690,000 signatures to get the initiative on the ballot .
A new nationwide poll by Pew Research Center suggests that opponents of legalized pot still comprise the majority ( 52 percent ) , and include the usual suspects : older Americans , conservatives and mothers of teenagers .
In California , the state Republican party and the California Police Chiefs Association are just saying No to the ballot initiative .
But supporters of the Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Act ( note the careful omission of language such as " legalize " and " marijuana " ) say that this could be one way to help solve the state 's crushing budget problems .
The initiative would make it legal for anyone 21 and older to possess an ounce of marijuana and / or grow whatever can fit in a 5 - by - 5 - foot plot .
It would permit cities and counties to decide whether to allow sales and tax the proceeds .
This detail has won over surprising bedfellows , including members of the organized labor community , the state 's chapter of the NAACP and some in the law enforcement community .
Lee credits the economy -- California 's debt is up to 37 percent of its economic output , according to one calculation -- with providing a boost to his campaign .
" It 's history repeating itself , " he tells ABC News .
" Like [ the repeal of ] alcohol prohibition during the Great Depression , we now have the Great Recession . "
Legalization Could Lead to Jobs for Organized Labor
Dan Rush of the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union is careful to point out that his organization has not yet officially endorsed the ballot initiative .
But after looking into the plan to tax and regulate the herb , Rush admits to liking what he sees .
" I believe it will create tens of thousands of sustainable , single - earner union jobs in the long run , " he tells ABC News .
" All the way from the agricultural process to the retail process to the food processing process to the transportation process . "
Rush points to a California Board of Equalization analysis that estimates legalizing and taxing pot in California could yield $ 1.4 billion in revenue .
" That $ 1.4 billion in sales tax goes directly into the general fund , " he says .
" And California is closing schools , fire departments , emergency rooms , laying off the nurses , firefighters and police we can't afford to pay because we do n't have any tax revenue . "
Rush predicts that organized labor across the board will come out in official support of the initiative " some time around September or October " of this year .
Marijuana as a " Civil Rights Issue "
One group that has already come out in official support for the first time ever is the California NAACP .
But instead of framing it as a jobs or revenue issue , California NAACP President Alice Huffman is painting it as a civil rights matter .
" In California African Americans make up 7 percent of the population , but 22 percent of the marijuana arrests , " she says .
" I see it as a civil rights issue because so many of our young people get their start in the criminal justice system over a joint . "
Huffman , who also is the chairwoman of the national NAACP 's criminal justice board , said the national leadership has n't released a position on her state 's impending vote .
But she adds that " if we want to rescue our young people and keep them out of prison , we have to not only attack the education system but also the dysfunctional parts of the system that 's criminalizing our children disproportionately and causing them lifelong harm . "
Marijuana possession arrests of teenagers of color rose from 3,100 in 1990 to 16,300 in 2008 -- an arrest surge that is 300 percent greater than population growth in that group -- according to the California Department of Justice .
In 1990 half of the state 's arrestees were nonwhite .
By 2008 that figure had surged to 62 percent .
Law Enforcement Breaking Ranks
Those arrests place a burden on the law enforcement system .
So , while the statewide police chiefs association has come out against the ballot initiative , there are many within the law enforcement community who are breaking with the official line .
Jeffrey Studdard , a former school district police officer and reserve L.A. County sheriff 's deputy , literally lends his voice in support of the initiative in its first radio ad .
Judge James Gray is a former presiding judge of the Orange County Superior Court , a former federal prosecutor and Navy JAG attorney -- a self - described " conservative judge in a conservative county appointed by a conservative governor " -- is a strong supporter of the initiative .
" Nobody today is selling Jim Beam bourbon to your high school student on their campus .
They 're selling marijuana and methamphetamines , " he says .
By keeping marijuana illegal " you give up everything having to do with its quality , its price , its place of sale and everything else . "
Gray says many of his former colleagues on the bench and the police force agree with him but fear political fallout if they were to speak out .
" The one thing we could do to make the job [ of policing ] less dangerous would be to legitimize and control the sale of these illegal drugs . "
The California Police Chiefs Association , however , argues that this is a mischaracterization of the work they do .
They just do n't spend their time on cases involving less than an ounce .
If someone is caught with less than an ounce of pot now it 's a citation with a small fine .
Pastor Ron Allen of Sacramento is one of the leaders of a coalition of cops and clergy who say legalizing marijuana will lead to the use of harder drugs and only cause more problems for society .
For Allen , this is also a personal crusade .
He was a crack cocaine addict for seven years , and he says it all started with marijuana .
Passage " would devastate California to the fullest extent .
...
This is the worst thing that California could ever try to do , " Allen said .
In an ironic twist , some of the more strident opponents to the legalization of marijuana are less likely to speak out -- the people who grow it illegally today .
Once the black market is made legitimate , growers stand to see their prices drop .
" It 's been disappointing to see people more concerned with their personal well - being than what 's good for society , " says Lee , the man behind the initiative .
" I got into it to stop the violence and get better law enforcement . "
Lee already makes his living from the weed .
The Oakland , Calif. , man 's business is pot , from his coffee house selling medical marijuana , to his trade school for marijuana growers , Oaksterdam University .
Though he spent $ 1 million getting the question onto November 's ballot , the fight is far from over .
Lee puts the odds at " 50 - 50 " for whether his state votes to legalize pot , or whether his dreams go up in smoke .
Few poets speak to my heart as Mary Oliver does .
Here ’s another one of her remarkable poems that has moved my heart .
It ’s called “ Spring , ” and it ’s from her collection of poems and prose poems called West Wind — highly recommended !
At the end of the poem I ’ve also posted some music I think you enjoy .
It called “ By the River , ” and it ’s performed by the immensely talented contemporary bassist and composer Edgar Meyer .
The album is called Uncommon Ritual , and it ’s one of my most treasured CDs .
For me , “ By the River ” catches something of spirit feel of the poem , as well as kind of timeless rhythm and flow that underlie our spiritual walk in this world .
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do !
Now , here ’s Mary Oliver ’s poem :
Spring
This morning
two birds
fell down the side of the maple tree
like a tuft of fire
a wheel of fire
a love knot
out of control as they plunged through the air
pressed against each other
and I thought
how I meant to live a quiet life
how I meant to live a life of mildness and meditation
tapping the careful words against each other
and I thought —
as though I were suddenly spinning like a bar of silver
as though I had shaken my arms and lo !
they were wings —
of the Buddha
when he rose from the green garden
when he rose in his powerful ivory body
when it turned to the long dusty road without end
when he covered his hairs with ribbons and the petals of flowers
when he opened his hands to the world

SQL Compare is one of Red Gate ’s most successful SQL Server tools ; it allows developers and DBAs to compare and synchronize the contents of their databases .
Although similar tools exist for Oracle , they are quite noticeably lacking in the usability and stability that SQL Compare is known for in the SQL Server world .
We could see a real need for a usable schema comparison tools for Oracle , and so the Schema Compare for Oracle project was born .
Over the next few weeks , as we come up to release of v1 , I ’ll be doing a series of posts on the development of Schema Compare for Oracle .
For the first post , I thought I would start with the main pitfalls that we stumbled across when developing the product , especially from a SQL Server background .
1. Schemas and Databases
The most obvious difference is that the concept of a ‘ database ’ is quite different between Oracle and SQL Server .
On SQL Server , one server instance has multiple databases , each with separate schemas .
There is typically little communication between separate databases , and most databases are no more than about 1000 - 2000 objects .
This means SQL Compare can register an entire database in a reasonable amount of time , and cross - database dependencies probably wo n’t be an issue .
It is a quite different scene under Oracle , however .
The terms ‘ database ’ and ‘ instance ’ are used interchangeably , ( although technically ‘ database ’ refers to the datafiles on disk , and ‘ instance ’ the running Oracle process that reads & writes to the database ) , and a database is a single conceptual entity .
This immediately presents problems , as it is infeasible to register an entire database as we do in SQL Compare ; in my Oracle install , using the standard recommended options , there are 63975 system objects .
If we tried to register all those , not only would it take hours , but the client would probably run out of memory before we finished .
As a result , we had to allow people to specify what schemas they wanted to register .
This decision had quite a few knock - on effects for the design , which I will cover in a future post .
2. Connecting to Oracle
The next obvious difference is in actually connecting to Oracle – in SQL Server , you can specify a server and database , and off you go .
On Oracle things are slightly more complicated .
SIDs , Service Names , and TNS
A database ( the files on disk ) must have a unique identifier for the databases on the system , called the SID .
It also has a global database name , which consists of a name ( which does n’t have to match the SID ) and a domain .
Alternatively , you can identify a database using a service name , which normally has a 1 - to - 1 relationship with instances , but may not if , for example , using RAC ( Real Application Clusters ) for redundancy and failover .
You specify the computer and instance you want to connect to using TNS ( Transparent Network Substrate ) .
The user - visible parts are a config file ( tnsnames.ora ) on the client machine that specifies how to connect to an instance .
For example , the entry for one of my test instances is :
SC_11GDB1 =
( DESCRIPTION =
( ADDRESS_LIST =
( ADDRESS = ( PROTOCOL = TCP ) ( HOST = simonctest ) ( PORT = 1521 ) )
)
( CONNECT_DATA =
( SID = 11gR1db1 )
)
)
This gives the hostname , port , and SID of the instance I want to connect to , and associates it with a name ( SC_11GDB1 ) .
The tnsnames syntax also allows you to specify failover , multiple descriptions and address lists , and client load balancing .
You can then specify this TNS identifier as the data source in a connection string .
Although using ODP.NET ( the .NET dlls provided by Oracle ) was fine for internal prototype builds , once we released the EAP we discovered that this simply was n’t an acceptable solution for installs on other people ’s machines .
Due to .NET assembly strong naming , users had to have installed on their machines the exact same version of the ODP.
NET dlls as we had on our build server .
We could n’t ship the ODP.
NET dlls with our installer as the Oracle license agreement prohibited this , and we did n’t want to force users to install another Oracle client just so they can run our program .
To be able to list the TNS entries in the connection dialog , we also had to locate and parse the tnsnames .ora file , which was complicated by users with several Oracle client installs and intricate TNS entries .
After much swearing at our computers , we eventually decided to use a third party Oracle connection library from Devart that we could ship with our program ; this could use whatever client version was installed , parse the TNS entries for us , and also had the nice feature of being able to connect to an Oracle server without having any client installed at all .
Unfortunately , their current license agreement prevents us from shipping an Oracle SDK , but that ’s a bridge we ’ll cross when we get to it .
3. Running synchronization scripts
The most important difference is that in Oracle , DDL is non-transactional ; you cannot rollback DDL statements like you can on SQL Server .
Although we considered various solutions to this , including using the flashback archive or recycle bin , or generating an undo script , no reliable method of completely undoing a half - executed sync script has yet been found ; so in this case we simply have to trust that the DBA or developer will check and verify the script before running it .
However , before we got to that stage , we had to get the scripts to run in the first place …
To run a synchronization script from SQL Compare we essentially pass the script over to the SqlCommand .
ExecuteNonQuery method .
However , when we tried to do the same for an OracleConnection we got a very strange error – ‘ ORA - 00911 : invalid character ’ , even when running the most basic CREATE TABLE command .
After much hair - pulling and Googling , we discovered that Oracle has got some very strange behaviour with semicolons at the end of statements .
To understand what ’s going on , we need to take a quick foray into SQL and PL / SQL .
PL / SQL is not T - SQL
In SQL Server , T - SQL is the language used to interface with the database .
It has DDL , DML , control flow , and many other nice features ( like Turing - completeness ) that you can mix and match in the same script .
In Oracle , DDL SQL and PL / SQL are two completely separate languages , with different syntax , different datatypes and different execution engines within the instance .
Oracle SQL is much more like ‘ pure ’ ANSI SQL , with no state , no control flow , and only the basic DML commands .
PL / SQL is the Turing - complete language , but can only do DML and DCL ( i.e. BEGIN TRANSATION commands ) .
Any DDL or SQL commands that are n’t recognised by the PL / SQL engine have to be passed back to the SQL engine via an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE command .
In PL / SQL , a semicolons is a valid token used to delimit the end of a statement .
In SQL , a semicolon is not a valid token ( even though the Oracle documentation gives them at the end of the syntax diagrams ) .
When you execute the command
CREATE TABLE table1 ( COL1 NUMBER ) ;
in SQL * Plus the semicolon on the end is a command to SQL * Plus to execute the preceding statement on the server ; it strips off the semicolon before passing it on .
SQL Developer does a similar thing .
When executing a PL / SQL block , however , the syntax is like so :
BEGIN
INSERT INTO table1 VALUES ( 1 ) ;
INSERT INTO table1 VALUES ( 2 ) ;
END ;
/
In this case , the semicolon is accepted by the PL / SQL engine as a statement delimiter , and instead the / is the command to SQL * Plus to execute the current block .
This explains the ORA - 00911 error we got when trying to run the CREATE TABLE command – the server is complaining about the semicolon on the end .
This also means that there is no SQL syntax to execute more than one DDL command in the same OracleCommand .
Therefore , we would have to do a round - trip to the server for every command we want to execute .
Obviously , this would cause lots of network traffic and be very slow on slow or congested networks .
Our first attempt at a solution was to wrap every SQL statement ( without semicolon ) inside an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE command in a PL / SQL block and pass that to the server to execute .
One downside of this solution is that we get no feedback as to how the script execution is going ; we ’re currently evaluating better solutions to this thorny issue .
Next up : Dependencies ; how we solved the problem of being unable to register the entire database , and the knock - on effects to the whole product .

LAST NOVEMBER , Christopher , a 30 - year - old expecting dad , updated his Facebook status : “ Those of you who had boys , did you circumcise him ?
If not , why ?
KTHANKS . ” The question elicited a flurry of responses : “ We think it ’s genital mutilation , ” replied one - half of a lesbian couple in Atlanta .
“ I ’d say it bothered him for a few days afterwards , ” responded a new mom in Texas , “ but I would not say he was in excruciating pain . ”
A New Jersey mother noted that the only intact boy she knew needed surgery due to chronic infections , warning , “ You have to be extra vigilant about keeping the cheese outta there . ”
“ The volume of discussion we ’ve had about this is really incredible , ” Christopher told me .
Circumcision has become the expecting - parent - obsession du jour , gaining ground fast on classic yuppie conundrums like cribs vs. cosleeping .
Authors and parents Michael Chabon and Neal Pollack have written about agonizing over the decision .
( Chabon calls circumcision “ the first of many betrayals that you will subject your kids to . ” )
Pundits Andrew Sullivan and Christopher Hitchens call the practice “ mutilation . ”
The vociferous anti-circumcision movement includes men trying to restore their foreskins ( by attaching small weights to what ’s left of the flap ) .
Julie Adler , a California rabbi who trains mohels to perform circumcisions , says Jewish parents are questioning the practice , even though their religion mandates it .
Just a few decades ago , circumcision was a virtual nondecision for new parents in the US .
In the late 19th century , doctors believed snipping foreskin could cure a laundry list of ailments , including hernia , epilepsy , and indigestion .
Early studies on the topic in the ’30s indicated that circumcision decreased a man ’s susceptibility to penile cancer , and by the late ’ 70s , 64 percent of newborn American males were cut .
By 2006 , that number had dwindled to 56 percent .
Immigration trends may be partially responsible for the drop - off : Worldwide , only a third of men are circumcised ( pdf ) .
Few modern doctors consider the procedure medically necessary :
The rate of penile cancer in the US is vanishingly small to begin with .
But Armin Brott , the author of a series of parenting books , says another factor was the natural childbirth movement that began in the ’ 70s , which advocated “ less medical intervention , fewer procedures , having your baby your way . ”
But the medical community may be poised to change its mind yet again .
Recent studies have found that circumcised adult men in Africa have lower rates of HIV and other STDs — as much as 35 percent lower in the case of HPV .
Researchers say this is because uncircumcised men are more vulnerable to infection — foreskin can tear and contains mucosal cells that easily pick up viruses .
In light of these studies , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is weighing recommending the surgery as part of its HIV / AIDS - prevention strategy .
But University of Michigan epidemiologist Divya Patel believes that because of differences in health care systems , modes of transmission of HIV , and age of sexual debut , the new data is not directly applicable to the US .
Sexual debut .
Right .
It ’s never too early to start thinking about your newborn ’s romantic career .
A 1997 study reported that circumcised men were 33 percent more likely to receive oral sex than their uncut counterparts .
But Debby Herbenick , author of Because It Feels Good : A Woman ’s Guide to Sexual Pleasure and Satisfaction , says her research shows only a minority of college coeds are skeeved by a hooded penis .
Anti-circ groups routinely claim that cut men feel less pleasure , since they lack about 15 square inches of sensitive tissue .
Adult film star Rocco Siffredi ( nom de guerre : Italian Stallion ) says he found that out the hard way when he was circumcised at 31 for hygiene reasons .
Siffredi , who calls his decision “ catastrophic , ” says that with a foreskin , “ you can feel much more fun . ”
Some recent parenting books suggest parents go with what dad looks like .
But Georganne Chapin , director of the anti-circ group Intact America , calls that advice “ freaking ridiculous ” : “ If your husband was missing an eye , would you poke his [ son ’s ] eye out ? ”
Which is one reason Christopher and his wife left their new son ’s foreskin intact , even though Christopher is circumcised .
“ You ’ve made all this preparation for your child ’s health and safety , and now you ’re thinking about amputating some part of his body , ” says Christopher .
“ We had a visceral and emotional reaction against it . ”
The Italian Stallion would be pleased .
“ The people who were circumcised since they were a baby , ” he warns , “ they can never understand . ”
President Obama has been a strong champion for an open , fast Internet .
He was a leader on net neutrality as a Senator , and he has pushed hard to create a National Broadband Plan to build the fast broadband infrastructure we need .
And his FCC chairman , Julius Genachowski , has been fighting hard to make President Obama ’s vision a reality , which is no surprise to those of us who knew Julius before he headed the FCC .
But not surprisingly , the industry is fighting back , with heavy artillery on their side .
Today , there ’s a vital hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee , and I need your help .
You could make an enormous difference if you take just a couple of minutes right now , call your Senators and urge them to support the President ’s push for net neutrality and a National Broadband plan .
You can just call the Capitol switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for your Senator .
It ’s helpful to bust wide open the convenient myth many in Washington buy into – the idea that it ’s only the industry and those with financial skin in the game who really care about these issues .
The travesty in the court system last week underscored the importance of you weighing in , and doing it in a hurry .
Just last week , the industry won a round in court , with a DC Circuit Court ruling that could block the FCC from protecting Net Neutrality , working for consumers , or making broadband available to all Americans .
The details get a little technical , but it basically boils down to this : back in the Bush Administration , the FCC classified the Internet as an “ information service ” rather than a “ communications service . ”
This limits what the FCC can do , which is , of course , just the way the big telecom companies want it .
But the FCC could reclassify the service and preserve its traditional role .
The telecom companies are giving it everything they ’ve got to keep this from happening , and if you do n’t speak up , they could win .
A win for them would mean that the FCC could n’t protect net neutrality , so the telecoms could throttle traffic as they wish – it would be at their discretion .
The FCC could n’t help disabled people access the Internet , give public official priority access to the network in times of emergency , or implement a national broadband plan to improve the deplorable situation where the United States – the country that invented the Internet – lags far behind in our broadband infrastructure .
In short , it would take away a key check on the power of phone and cable corporations to do whatever they want with our Internet .
The telecom companies try to say that only Congress can pass a law to make this better .
But having suffered through a year of record filibusters and procedural hurdles to grind the process to a halt , do you really think it ’s a good idea for Congress to try and do this , when the FCC can have the authority right now ?
Look , eventually we may need to build a new legal framework for broadband service , but the Internet is moving too fast , the economy needs the innovation of the Internet too badly , to wait .
Especially because we do n’t have to .
The FCC can act right now .
But they need the political support from the Senate , and the Senate needs to know that you care about this .
So call right now and let them know .
Especially if your Senator serves on the Commerce Committee ( here ’s the membership of the committee ) .
Bottom line is that this is the way politics work .
In the end , you pull the levers , but only if you use them .
The industry will fight for control , and they should fight – if you were advising them , you ’d give them that advice yourself .
But we need to show them that we ’re going to fight even harder to make sure the Internet stays in the hands of the American people , that we get to set the rules to benefit all of us , not just a few huge corporations .
Jealousy really is " blinding , " according to a new study by two University of Delaware psychology professors .
They found that women who were made to feel jealous were so distracted by unpleasant emotional images they became unable to spot targets they were trying to find .
The researchers suggest that their results reveal something profound about social relationships and perception :
It has long been known that the emotions involved in social relationships affect mental and physical health , but now it appears that social emotions can literally affect what we see .
The research appears in the April issue of the journal Emotion , published by the American Psychological Association .
UD psychology professors Steven Most and Jean - Philippe Laurenceau and their colleagues tested heterosexual romantic couples in a lab experiment .
The romantic partners sat near each other at separate computers .
The woman was asked to detect targets ( pictures of landscapes ) amid rapid streams of images , while trying to ignore occasional emotionally unpleasant ( gruesome or graphic ) images .
The man was asked to rate the attractiveness of landscapes that appeared on his screen .
Partway through the experiment , the experimenter announced the male partner would now rate the attractiveness of other single women .
At the end , the females were asked how uneasy they felt about their partner rating other women 's attractiveness .
The finding ?
The more jealous the women felt , the more they were so distracted by unpleasant images that they could not see the targets .
This relationship between jealousy and " emotion - induced blindness " emerged only during the time that the male partner was rating other women , helping rule out baseline differences in performance among the women .
The researchers do n't yet know what will happen when the roles are reversed ; in these experiments , it was always the women who searched for a target .
Future research might reveal whether men tend to be less or more blinded by jealousy .

Sherpas say they may find the body of well - known climber Rob Hall
The widow of New Zealand climber Rob Hall , who died on Mount Everest in 1996 , says it is too risky to retrieve his remains from the mountain .
A team of Nepalese Sherpas are planning a trip up Everest to clean up rubbish and bring back bodies of dead climbers .
Hall always said the " logistics of retrieving a body high on the mountain above 8,000 m was virtually impossible " , his widow Jan Arnold told the BBC .
The expedition is due to set off from Nepal 's capital Kathmandu this weekend .
It is expected to reach Everest 's South Col , just below 8,000 m ( 26,200 ft ) , by 1 May .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Jan Arnold , who was pregnant at the time of her husband 's death , says he died on the South Summit , at 8,700 m , but since then his body has fallen 3,800 m down the Kangshung face , towards Tibet .
" He did n't have a desire to have a grave on Mount Everest certainly , but he would n't want anyone to risk their lives to bring his remains down , " Jan Arnold told the BBC World Service .
" The chance of anyone a ) locating it and b ) then being able to retrieve it would be crazy - a needle in a haystack , so I think it 's unlikely .
" Rob did n't feel the risk to life was worth it , so in that way , that is why he would have preferred to stay . "
She says if the remains are found , the family would welcome the chance to bring them down and say farewell .
" But I have never thought that that would be possible , and I certainly do n't want people risking their lives because it 's too hard to get him off , " she adds .
Need to investigate Seven - times Everest climber Namgyal Sherpa , who is leading the expedition , said they would recover Rob Hall 's body only if his family agreed and if no risk was involved .
" We 're not sure where Rob Hall 's body is .
First , we need to go up there to see where it is .
We have to investigate .
We hear that it might be near the summit , but we do n't know for sure , " he told the BBC .
" If it has fallen down into China , we do n't have permission to go there , so wo n't be able to pick it up .
That will mean leading another expedition next year and we'd have to get permission first .
" If he 's fallen into a crevasse or fallen too far , it 's too risky and no - one can bring him back .
" But if we find his dead body near the trail , we will see if we can bring him back with the permission of his family . "
The Sherpa expedition aims to clean debris from the mountain to preserve the environment and make the mountain safe .
They will work above 8,000 m ( 26,240 ft ) , in what is known as the " death zone " because of the thin air and treacherous conditions .
They expect to bring back the bodies of at least two climbers , including American Scott Fischer , who died in 1996 , and Swiss mountaineer Gianni Goltz , who died in 2008 .

Israel and its Arab neighbours disagree over scarce water resources
A row about how to name the Israeli - occupied Palestinian territories has scuppered a 43 - nation scheme for managing Mediterranean water resources .
The Mediterranean Union conference in Barcelona had hammered out 99 % of a draft text , delegates said .
But the deal failed when Israel and Arab countries disagreed over how to describe the Palestinian territories .
Israel objected to " occupied territories " , while " territories under occupation " did not suit the Arab bloc .
The United Nations has warned that almost 300 million people in the Mediterranean region will face water shortages by 2025 .
The Mediterranean Union was launched by France during its EU presidency in 2008 , to foster co-operation between European states , and countries in the Middle East and North Africa bordering the Mediterranean .
In Barcelona on Tuesday the Union 's secretary - general , Ahmad Masadeh from Jordan , called for urgent action to guarantee access to water for all the region 's residents .
Spain , the conference host , warned that the Mediterranean was prone to cyclical floods and droughts that required a " common strategy for a scarce resource " .
Palestinians in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967 .
The settlements that Israel has built in the West Bank are home to around 400,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .
Israel evacuated its settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces , but Israel and Egypt maintain an economic blockade on the Palestinians living there .

Voters should support the Liberal Democrats in constituencies where Labour cannot win , Gordon Brown has indicated , further fuelling speculation that Labour expects to be unable to form a majority government after polling day .
In an exclusive interview with politics .
co.uk the prime minister gave his strongest signal yet that voters should consider tactical voting in order to prevent the Conservatives forming the next government .
The prime minister was asked whether he endorsed an appeal made by Peter Mandelson in March to voters in the south - west of England .
He suggested they should vote Liberal Democrat in order to stop Conservative candidates from winning seats in the region , as first reported by the Western Morning News .
" The Liberal Democrats have more in common with Labour than with any other party , " Lord Mandelson added .
When asked for his views on the comments , the prime minister told politics .
co.uk : " I do n't think we want a Conservative government , let 's be honest about that .
" But the choice is between a Labour government and a Conservative government .
You 're not going to end up with one of the minor parties running the government - no matter how keen you are to see their interests represented and no matter how interesting some of their policies may be .
" So I think what he [ Lord Mandelson ] is saying is if you do n't want a Conservative government make sure you do n't get one .
" I want everybody to vote Labour and I want people to vote for our party , and I want our vote to be the highest and I want our number of seats to be the highest .
" But if people do n't want a Conservative government then they must make sure they do n't allow the Conservatives in . "
The comments go even further than those made by the transport secretary Lord Adonis , who raised the sensitive issue of tactical voting in a provocative article in the Independent on Friday morning .
In an article for the newspaper he wrote : " To avoid a Tory government after May 6th , it is vital to grasp now the fundamental Labour - Lib Dem identity of interest .
This can best be served by Labour coming out of the election as strong as possible , able to form a government .
Lord Adonis added : " In Labour - Tory marginals , a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote which helps the Tories against progressive policies .
And in Labour - Lib Dem marginals every Labour MP returned is a seat in the Commons more likely to put Labour ahead of the Tories and therefore better placed to form a government . "
The comments are in direct contrast to the sentiments of Tony Blair before the 1997 general election .
During the 1997 campaign , activists who called for voters to vote Lib Dem to get the Tories out of power were expelled for breaking Labour party rules .
The Lib Dems have reacted furiously at being called a minor party as well as the suggestion that a vote for the Liberal Democrats would lead to another five years of a Gordon Brown - led Labour government .
The Tories are targeting a number of potentially vulnerable seats in the south - west including Somerton and Frome , Bristol North West and Taunton Deane , where the election contest is a straight fight between the Conservative and Lib Dems .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman and former leadership hopeful Chris Huhne 's seat in Eastleigh , where he is defending a majority of just 530 , is also highly vulnerable .
He is number 11 on the Tories ' overall target list .
The Lib Dems are also weakened in Cornwall .
Two seats with radical boundary changes in central Cornwall , Truro & Falmouth and St Austell and Newquay , will hit long - time incumbent Matthew Taylor 's vote , while Colin Breed is standing down in Cornwall South East .
A senior Lib Dem source said : " As the Independent 's front cover on Friday shows , Labour are sending out mixed messages on this all the time .
" Brown is more mealy mouthed than some of his colleagues .
But I think people will see it as the partisan posturing it really is .
" We 're not going to give a running commentary on the latest desperate tactic of Labour HQ , just keep campaigning for every vote for the Liberal Democrats ! "
• Rhone Group bids for 40 % stake in Liverpool • Under - pressure owners may be forced to accept
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Liverpool are in talks with a private - equity firm , the Rhone Group , over a £ 118.5 m deal to buy a controlling share of the club and halve their debts .
It is understood the investment group wants a 40 % stake at Anfield , which would considerably strengthen the club 's financial position .
The Rhone Group 's bid would give it the controlling interest , with the current joint - owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett reducing their shareholdings to 30 % apiece .
Hicks and Gillett were last year told to cut £ 100 m from the club 's £ 237 m debts .
The Royal Bank of Scotland gave the club a deadline of this summer to pay up .
The club 's chief executive , Christian Purslow , has been working to find investors and says he wants a deal by Easter .
The offer from the Rhone Group – which is the first real result of Purslow 's search – would be used to slash the club 's debt by half .
That would make Liverpool a more attractive option for further outside investment .
It would also improve the club 's credit - worthiness , which could lead to work finally beginning on the long - awaited new stadium in Stanley Park .
Details of the offer were received by Liverpool yesterday and the matter has yet to be discussed by the board .
There have been suggestions that the Hicks and Gillett are looking for a better price , but with the clock ticking it may yet prove viable .
The Rhone Group was founded in 1995 , has its headquarters in New York with other offices in London and Paris , and describes itself as " one of the world 's leading mid-market private - equity firms " .
Twitter CEO Ev Williams just delivered the keynote address at SXSW .
It did not go well .
( Remember Sarah Lacy 's horrible interview keynote with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2008 ?
This was worse )
The problem -- apart from the news out of Twitter being much less exciting than expected -- was the interviewer , Harvard Business Review 's Umair Haque .
Umair is in the " thought leader " business .
His writing generally draws more than its fair share of criticism for being heavy on buzzwords and light on substance , but he has a large base of supporters as well .
The reaction to his performance at SXSW was much more one - sided .
Numerous reports had a large portion of the audience walking out in the middle of the address .
And for many , the most entertaining part of the Umair / Ev event was the stream of insulting tweets that started almost as soon as the event began .
Meet Gabriel Wickbold , a young but super talented 25 year old artist from Brazil who takes the most colorful , sensual and expressive pictures you ’ve ever seen .
Judging by his pictures he is not only very creative but also cruel .
He could spill a whole bucket of paint on you just to get a perfect shot .
At first , we wanted to introduce him as a professional photographer but we soon found out it would n’t be 100 % correct .
Wanna know why ?
Read on !
“ I ’ve worked with many different artistic languages , started writing poetry , then became a musician .
Also , graduated in TV broadcasting , never actually studied photography but at the same time I believe the photographic technique is so basic that what truly makes the difference is feeling and composition .
Photography has so much to do with my personality , it is fast , interacts with people , and responds instantly giving results . ” ( from the interview )
Without further ado we present you 20 breathtaking photos by Gabriel Wickbold .

P.S. : do n’t forget to comment !
It only takes a few seconds to do so , while Gabriel spent hours doing these shots
I have to admit : I love being a Libertarian .
I get the same sense of smug satisfaction that Liberals must have enjoyed under George Bush -- not being in a position to really get their way , they could pontificate wildly about how they would do things differently , without fear of their views actually being put to the test .
Being a Libertarian is kind of like that , except we get to complain ( something readers of my Stimulus Maximus posts already know I love doing ) no matter who is in power .
The way things are right now , Libertarians are still on the fringe , with the Dems and the Reps fighting it out like two football teams from rival cities .
As a Libertarian , I get to laugh at the Democrats as they beg and bribe Northrop Grumman with tax credits and grants to move their headquarters to Maryland .
I get to be angry at the Republicans for not doing more to avoid the loss of BP Solar 's Frederick plant when they had the chance .
I even get to cheer the boondoggle of a Senate session that followed the passage - by - reconciliation of the ever - popular ObamaCare .
Why ?
Because , as a Libertarian , I do n't have to root for either team .
You 've really got to try this .
It 's sort of like going vegan , except you still get to eat at Five Guys .
If I side with the D's on one issue -- great !
If I side with the R's on another -- far out !
It 's a refreshing change from the Political Sports TeamTM mentality that has dominated America for so long .
There is one catch , though .
The libertarian vote is of becoming increasingly significant .
If more and more people hop on the bandwagon , we could actually find ourselves in a position to enact some real change , and then the pressure would really be on .
Luckily , libertarianism 's " kissing cousin " is known as Classical Liberalism -- something that served our country quite well during its early days .
So even with our feet to the fire , I still think we'd be sitting pretty .
Results Of RateBeer Rarest Beer Contest 2010
the beer had to actually exist
at least one person unaffiliated with the brewery had to have paid for a commercial sample of the beer
1. Polar Brewing Magnetic North Polar Bear Paw Stout
2. Odonata Shasta Sherpa Fish Gruit
3. Stone Consciously Conceited Clique - Only Cream Ale
April 1 , 2010
The First Annual RateBeer Rarest Beer Contest , despite constant public announcements and considerable funds spent on an ill - fated sky - writing campaign in Utah , received only 43 entries from 32 breweries worldwide .
Because of this low turnout , we 've declared only three winners .
If it 's not clear to the beer n00bs ( is anything ? ) , the purpose of this contest was to recognize the best rare new beers of 2010 .
The judges of the contest were from an assembled panel of mostly bearded , occasionally wise , elder RateBeer administrators .
The rules were very simple : Points were awarded for a ) creativity , b ) unattainableness , c ) scarcity , and d ) deliciousness .
Sadly , we had to remove 18 entries because these new beers were discovered to actually be bourbon aged in beer barrels .
More on that later ...
Without further ado , the winners !-
This was a unanimous winner ( but only because the aquatic release party for entry # 27 , Cigar City Shark Chum Bloody IPA , went over about as well as one would imagine ) .
It was also the only entry whose attainment required use of a submarine .
It was noted in a recent Scientific American article that foundering polar bears were not sinking to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean , as was originally expected , but instead sank to a depth of about 200 meters before coming to rest on a salinity barrier .
" That 's where we first got the idea for this beer , " said Alfonso Shackleton , Polar 's head brewer and assistant janitor .
" We 'd successfully used polar beer meat in our brews before , but we figured we 'd show those crazy Europeans how to really ice a beer ! "
Only 12 bottles were made , and contest - winner JK of Minneapolis had to eliminate two Greenpeace boats ( obviously thirsty competitors ) before he had a chance to dive down to retrieve a single bottle at 197 meters .
" Delicious ! " , John was heard to scream out upon regaining consciousness and cracking it open .
" I just ca n't get enough of the regurgitated lichen aromas in polar bear beers ! "
Words to live by .-
One of ten hopless entries and yet the only one to be spiced with the rarest Almas caviar .
The beer also utilized steam that only occasionally presented itself from a floor vent at the brewery and reportedly took years to collect .
More points were awarded when video evidence turned up at our headquarters showing the beer 's juniper tips being carefully harvested in hyperbaric chambers used to preserve volatile aromas .
" We also use tiny scissors to preserve the flavor , " said Rick Sellers , Sales Director .
" Dude , super tiny .
We 're talking extreeeeemely tiny . "
Besides being simply strange , the beer was also exceptionally hard to get .
Sherpa Day was only 20 minutes and held at the oxygen - deprived snow covered summit of Mount Shasta at more than 12,000 feet .
" We did n't want to make it easy " , added Brewmaster Peter Hoey .
" What 's the point of that ?
Really ? "
Still a remarkable 12 cases were sold , which were all grabbed by a guy who hired 13 pro mountain climbers ( one did n't make it ) and is said to have sold them all on eBay .
The winner , 31 year old Richard " Dick " " Wad " Wadowski of Portland , Maine , commented , " I 'm not sure how the beer tastes at all but I 'm sure it 's cool .
I am sure it 's very smooth . " -
Stone Brewing of San Marcos , California released a two pack of this rare beer in a posh LA night club
Hyde that was not known as a craft beer destination at all .
Burly bouncers turned away hordes of craft beer seekers who were n't dressed in suitable attire , were n't child actors and were n't heirs / heiresses to celebrity or tycoon fortunes .
After four weekends aging at the club , the beer 's only successful buyer was Tibeerious .
Roger 's successful entry involved an approach in drag and claiming to be the sister of washed up 80s rapper , Vanilla Ice , to whom he bore a girlish resemblance .
The beer gained scarcity points when it was claimed by head brewer Mitch Steele , to have been made from sweat scraped from the backs of Hyde patrons .
However the beer lost points for tasting like , well ... the sweaty backs of Hyde patrons .
" It tastes satisfyingly smooth , like I 'm tasting something no else can possibly have " , Roger bellowed .
" But the sweat factor , I must say is a bit disappointing .
People need to stink more like humans . "
And then he left , saving only the bottle cap , and with his makeup running like his American Apparel stockings .
Honorable mentions to Major Tom Space
Ale by Victory Brewing which is somewhere approaching Venus by now ; Ephemeral Gooseberry Lambic by Real Ales which may or may not have been released on Ephemeral Day ; and , Dong Qi Xiao Wild Ale by Casta which really , honestly , should never have been made , is insanely illegal , is immoral to most of the known universe but we 're sort of glad they did anyway and nonetheless is a hilarious inside joke that you probably can't appreciate the rarity of .
It 's that cool .

What is sound ?
You have heard the question " if a tree falls in a forest far from any sound detector ( human ear , microphone , etc. ) , does the tree 's fall make any noise ? "
If we define sound as waves that are carried by the air , the answer would be yes -- wherever there are sound waves there is sound .
What if we define sound subjectively as a sensation in the ear ?
Then the tree falling would make no sound if there is no ear to detect it .
We could go even further in the definition and say that sound is what a brain decodes using electrical impulses from the ears .
In this case , too , the tree makes no sound when there are no ears to detect it .
Since we are going to be relating sound to interactive game play , let 's consider sound to be whatever the game player 's brain decodes .
It will be helpful for us to keep the following overall goal in mind : Sound should communicate effectively what we want the listener to know or experience -- it should focus the player 's attention .
In order to meet this goal we must always approach sound from the player 's viewpoint .
The Physics of Sound
Sound is produced by vibrations that disturb the air , causing pressure waves that travel out in all directions from the source of the sound .
When the waves reach someone 's ear , they set up vibrations that cause electrical signals to be sent to the brain .
These electrical signals are perceived as sound .
Sound is one of the first sensations an unborn child experiences .
It brings us our first lessons of life while we are still in the womb .
We do n't have to learn to detect the vibrations of sound .
We take it all for granted from our earliest experiences .
Recording and Storing Sounds
In the early days of movie making it was discovered that the human eye is fooled into seeing lifelike moving pictures if the individual frames pass in front of the eye at 24 frames per second .
Similarly , the audio community experimented with sound to see how many snapshots of a sound must be taken per second to fool the ear into hearing lifelike sounds from digital signals .
It was decided that 44,100 audio snapshots would do the same trick for the ears as 24 frames per second does for the eyes .
These audio snapshots are called samples and they are the equivalent of a video frame in a movie .
The audio equivalent of the number of video frames per second is the sampling rate .
You have probably heard the term sample used for a complete sound .
It is also used to describe the smallest part of a digital sound .
Very few people can hear any fewer than 16 Hz or any more than about 22 kHz ( thousand cycles per second ) .
So , what sampling rate is required to record sounds from 16 Hz to 22 kHz ?
This question is answered in the Nyquist formula which states that the sampling rate of a sound must be twice the frequency of the highest sound to be sampled .
You might ask what will happen if you record something at too low a sampling rate , disregarding the Nyquist formula .
The answer is that the average person would not think that the sound was lifelike .
How do we store the digital samples of a sound ?
We take snapshots of the amplitudes of a sound at regular intervals and store the values .
We are merely storing values that represent the air pressure of a vibration at any one point in time .
So a digital sound file is merely a method of storing air pressure !
How much air pressure can be stored in one byte ?
One byte ( 8 bits ) can have a value from 0 to 255 decimal .
For this reason , 8 - bit digital audio can store 256 discrete air pressure levels .
16 bit digital audio can store air pressure much more precisely , allowing values from 0 to 65535 , or 65536 discrete air pressure levels .
As you can well imagine , 8 bit resolution leaves a lot to be desired .
Original waveforms are " squared off " as a result of using it .
The sound is not very clear .
But , maybe clarity is not what you are after .
A good way to visualize the difference in 8 and 16 bit audio is to consider a home stereo that has a volume knob with " detents " in it .
You know the type that clicks as you turn it ?
Imagine that you buy a tuner / amplifier that has a knob with positions ( clicks ) from 0 or , no volume to 65535 , or full volume .
The volume change from one click to an adjacent one would be indistinguishable .
Now take the same knob and give it positions ( clicks ) from 0 , or no volume to 255 , or full volume .
Now you have only 256 discrete volume settings .
You can see how coarse your volume changes will be from click to click -- you can hear each change .
Now imagine those changes taking place thousands of times a second .
You can hear the roughness of 8 bit amplitude changes .
Wolfenstein 3D
The sound effects for Wolfenstein were recorded directly into a 16 - bit sampling keyboard , using live actor voices , live Foley effects and effects recorded on a cassette recorder .
Foley effects are named after a man named Foley who created a way to add sound effects live during post - production using a recording studio .
Foley effects such as footsteps , rain , thunder , doors opening , keys rattling , etc. are recorded " live , " but are not necessarily actual recordings of " real " sounds .
Thunder can be made by wiggling a large piece of metal .
Fire can be made by crushing paper or plastic .
The imagination is the only limit when it comes to Foley effects .
The sound driver for Wolf 3D was designed for playback of 7 k samples at 8 bit resolution , so I had to start with high quality material for the voices .
That was the reason for recording directly into the sampler .
The cassette recorder was used when the microphone cable to the sampler was too short .
Digital Audio Tape Recorders ( DAT 's ) were still relatively new and not yet portable .
The human voices were recorded using compression .
Compressors bring up the low level sounds and hold down the high level sounds -- this makes the sound " meatier " and also helps to hide any noise .
You hear compressors at work every time you listen to an FM radio announcer .
That 's how they get the boom in their voices .
With the advent of digital recording equipment and sound editing software , there is not a lot of need for compressors .
It can be done in software .
The sound driver for Wolf 3D was capable of playing only one digital sound at a time , so priority of sounds was very important .
Some of the weapon firing sounds were recorded at a shooting range .
The explosions began as the crashing of the lid on a " Dempsey Dumpster . "
Scott Miller was the vocal talent for the word " Scheist ! " and he could not talk for several hours after doing 3 - 4 takes at full volume !
The other vocal " talent " was everyone with id Software at the time and me .
I generally do not suggest that local talent be used , but it worked well in this project .
The only software available at the time to move the effects from the sampler to the computer was Sample Vision by Turtle Beach .
Because it did not have any digital effects editing capabilities , I used several outboard processors on some of the final effects .
Thank goodness we do n't have to do that sort of thing any longer .
Hexxagon and Argo Checkers
What do you do for sound effects in board games ?
I had the fun of discovering just that when I worked on these two games .
I went to the toy store and the party supply store to buy every kind of noisemaker I could find -- whistles , clickers , horns , and other leftovers from Halloween .
They were each recorded with as many variations as possible so there would be a " palate " of sounds from which to choose .
One of the game pieces had to spin and fall to the playing surface .
To make this sound , a large coin was spun on a coffee table .
The final effect was a combination of a slide whistle and the coin spin .
Wave for Windows was available at the time I was doing these sounds , and it made mixing different sounds easy .
It also had the potential to change the timing of an effect without affecting its pitch .
This came in handy for getting the sounds to sync with the animations .
Doom
Early in the development of Doom , Tom Hall created what was called the Doom Bible .
It gave a lot of background information regarding the demons in the game .
It provided the information I needed to create raw material .
The game changed considerably between that time and the final version , but the raw material was still appropriate when it came time to complete the final sound effects .
The raw material consisted of many animal sounds , explosions , weapon sounds , etc .
To fatten these sounds up , I used my own voice .
The idea was to make a similar sound on the same pitch and mix it in at a lower amplitude .
The final sounds were completed in the last month of development .
The sound driver for Doom was a major change from Wolf 3D in that more than one digital sound could be played at once .
This made it easier to set the priority of play but it made it more difficult to get the relative volumes correct .
There were several classes of sounds in Doom .
One was general active sounds that were not attached to any one demon .
These were more or less ambient sounds , but they did n't play until demons close to the player " woke up " [ usually based upon the player making some noise in the area ] .
Then there were demon active sounds that were attached to individual demons .
These sounds let the player know what class of demon was around the corner .
Each type of demon had a sight sound that played when the demon " saw " the player .
There were also attack , hurt and death sounds particular to each type of demon .
Another helpful thing about the sound driver was that the volume of sounds depended upon the distance from the player to the source of the sound .
This helped keep the overall volume down during non-combat .
It also stood to help scare the pants off the player when a demon in a dark niche woke up and immediately screamed his attack sound .
I was at id Software for the month that the sound effects were finalized .
As I finished sounds , John Romero would plug them into the game so we could test them .
John was the evil voice at the end of Doom II .
One evening , he was playing the game with clipping off so he could walk through walls .
Something in the final level caught his attention .
It was his head on a stake !
The artists had digitized John for rough artwork and as a joke put him in the game .
Since he has a great sense of humor and a good ( wild ) imagination , John decided to put his own joke in the game .
We recorded him saying " In order to win the game , you must kill me , John Romero . "
After that , I put heavy flanging and echo on his voice and then reversed the whole thing .
It was fun to wait for the artists to discover this joke .
It was quite a while before we told them what was being said .
The software that I depended upon most during the development of the Doom sound effects was Wave for Windows .
The most helpful thing to come along between the two Dooms was a shareware program called Cool Edit .
It added significantly to the arsenal of digital effects and made it easy to mix sounds from different files .
I depended upon it heavily , and it is the reason that my outboard effects equipment has since gathered a good bit of dust .
Because so many of the sounds from Doom were familiar , it was decided to keep them in Doom II .
Several additional sounds were required , though .
The Archvile is an evil healer .
Anyone getting in his way is blasted with fire and disintegrated .
This includes other demons .
But , after he has wrought his destruction , he then goes around and reanimates all of the demons .
Because of this interesting dual personality , I decided to give him a very evil laugh as an active sound .
For his death sound , I recorded a young girl saying " why , " pitch shifted it down and mixed it with other sounds .
The Archvile just does n't understand why anyone would want to kill him as he sees himself as only doing good for his fellow demon .
Duke Nukem 3D
Another great piece of software came to my attention after Cool Edit .
Rob Wallace had been praising Sound Forge since he first began using it .
Because I was comfortable with Cool Edit , I did not consider using Sound Forge .
In looking for new tools to complete the sound effects for the latest in the Duke Nukem series , I tried it .
What a beautiful program !
It is much faster than Cool Edit for most operations .
The one thing that really made it handy was a pop and click removal tool .
I had some very old analog sound effects that would be excellent for use in Duke , but they had included a loud hum and some crackling every once in a while .
The hum was easily removed using both Cool Edit and Sound Forge .
The crackles were readily removed with Sound Forge .
The voice of Duke was recorded in California on DAT ( Digital Audio Tape ) and sent to me .
I then played the tape into a digital i/o board using either Sound Forge or Cool Edit .
The result was a wave file that I could edit to my heart 's content and send on to 3D Realms for a decision as to what was to be used in the game .
How much space is required to store the different types of samples ?
Audio CDs have stereo samples at 44.1 kHz , 16 bit resolution .
That resolution requires 2 bytes per sample .
At 44,100 samples per second , each taking 2 bytes ( 16 bits ) of precision , we need 88,200 bytes per second for storage .
Since stereo is two tracks we have to double that : 176,400 bytes per second .
Take that times 60 seconds per minute and you get 10,584,000 bytes per minute -- one minute of stereo 44.1 k 16 bit sound requires almost 10 megabytes of storage ( uncompressed ) .
Storage Requirements for One Minute of Sound
Type : Mono Mono Stereo Stereo Resolution : 8 bit 16 bit 8 bit 16 bit Sampling Rate 44.1 k 2646 k 5292 k 5292 k 10584 k 22.05 k 1323 k 2646 k 2646 k 5292 k 11.025 k 661.5 k 1323 k 1323 k 2646 k 8 k 480 k 960 k 960 k 1920 k 7 k 420 k 840 k 840 k 1680 k 6 k 360 k 720 k 720 k 1440 k 5 k 300 k 600 k 600 k 1200 k Figure 1
The table in Figure 1 indicates the different storage requirements for different types , sample rates and resolutions of one minute of digital sound .
The decision one makes regarding these variables should be based upon the balancing of sound quality and storage requirement .
If the sound effects we want to use have a large dynamic range ( amplitudes from very low to very high ) , we would probably want to use 16 bit resolution .
If all sounds are going to be about the same volume , 8 bit should suffice .
The Psychology Of Sound
We are assailed by sound constantly .
It is sometimes enough to completely disorient us .
Do you turn the car radio down when you are trying to concentrate on street names or when you stop to look at a map ?
Sounds can be very distracting .
This is something we have to keep in mind before we start throwing myriad sfx into our projects .
Our brains know how distracting sound can be .
To handle the distraction , the brain focuses attention on the more important sounds .
It blocks us from consciously hearing competing sounds .
In a computer game our mind can get very confused .
The brain gets befuddled and does n't know what sounds to focus on .
This is where proper game sound design comes in .
As in the movies , we decide for the game player 's brain what it is to focus on by making one sound predominant at a time .
Careful planning will ensure that this predominant sound is the most important one for the game player to hear .
What sounds do we hear each day ?
There are the sounds we remember well : voices , sirens , explosions , favorite songs , and the like .
There are also the sounds that were there but never caught our attention : a breeze rustling leaves , an airplane far off in the distance , general traffic noise , the sounds of animals , the sound of our computer fans , children playing , elevator music , someone making a presentation during a boring meeting , the sound of our boss droning on and on ; ) , etc .
We generally do not notice these sounds , that is until they stop .
That we would notice quickly .
Complete silence is neither normal nor realistic .
This brings us to two important aspects of sound in computer games .
Consider both of these as generalities .
First , we should have one predominant sound .
That sound can be one single sound or a cacophony of other sounds ( multiple explosions , screams , weapons fire , etc. ) -- either one serves to focus the player 's attention .
Second , we want to have the normal background sounds of life going on in our games .
Normal here means normal for the environment we have created within the game .
This is ambient sound that is not ordinarily used to focus attention -- just to make the gaming experience more lifelike .
Ambient sounds can be divided into two categories : the sounds that are constant in an environment and the sounds that occur on a random basis .
Listening to my environment at this very moment ( 02/10/96 14:26 ) , I hear : two computer fans on different pitches ( constant ) , insects ( constant - - I live in Florida ) , a powerboat passing by ( random ) , a small airplane overhead ( random ) , a lawn mower far in the distance ( random ) , my wife working in the other room ( random , but she says " constant " ) , my typing on the computer keyboard ( random ) , and a car passing by very slowly ( random -- I said that I live in Florida ! ) .
There is no one sound that my brain is having to focus on , thankfully , as I need to concentrate on what I am typing .
Until I consciously paid attention to the sounds around me , I did not even know they exist .
If I were immersed in a computer game and these same things were going on , I 'd not know what to focus on based upon sound cues alone .
This is not the best situation .
It breaks the general rule of having one sound keep the player focused on the game .
This does not mean that the focus sound must be invasive , intruding , loud or any other obvious attention - getting factor .
We could focus attention by playing random sounds more often than in real life ( maybe to keep a fear factor alive , or in a children 's game to make the child wonder what the heck is going on in the distance and how do I get to that action ) .
We could also focus attention by bringing up the volume of a constant sound ( remember how in movie swamp scenes the insect noises get very loud to let us know the terrible circumstances our hero is in ? ) .
Another " movie " method of focusing a viewer 's attention works well in computer games too .
You could have things get very , very , very quiet and then BLAM something exciting happens .
Whatever method is used , remember that we are trying to do the sound work the brain handles in everyday life -- we are trying to focus attention .
Of course , there are computer games where sound should always be ambient and never draw attention to itself or anything else .
Examples would be board games like chess and checkers .
Questions to ask when deciding what sounds to use in a project :
1 . What does the subject matter of the project suggest in the way of sound ?
Come up with some adjectives that describe the project and look for sound effects that bring these adjectives to mind .
2 . How much space is available for digital sound ?
If space is not limited , think in terms of high quality , but remember that lower sampling rates can be used to make effects sound more gritty , distant or muffled .
Sometimes that is desirable .
Do n't be afraid to mix effects at different sampling rates and resolutions if your sound drivers support them .
3 . How many sounds can be played at one time ( based upon sound driver or hardware limitations ) ?
If the number is limited , you will have to decide which effects will receive priority of play .
4 . What is the dynamic range of all of the sounds to be used ?
If it is great , use 16 bit resolution .
Otherwise , 8 bit resolution will suffice .
5 . What is the range of the sampling rates to be used ?
Using higher sampling rates with 8 bit resolution can increase the apparent volume of background hiss .
Since 8 bit sounds have more hiss and since hiss is generally higher pitched , a higher sampling rate will increase the volume of those higher pitched sounds ( hissing included ) .
Do n't be afraid to experiment with changing the resolution of noisy sounds to see if the noise can be reduced .
6 . Is there going to be intelligible speech ?
In general , it requires a higher sampling rate .
A female voice will usually require a higher sampling rate than a male voice .
For " full bodied " speech , use 16 bit resolution .
7 . Are the effects or voice - overs to be recorded professionally or are they to be recorded with less than professional equipment ?
Using less than professional equipment usually means more noise .
8 . Are the sound effects going to be processed ?
If so , what types of processing will be used ?
9 . What are the relative volumes of the different digital sounds ( music / voice - over / Foley ) ?
Decide which sounds should have priority in volume .
10 .
Where do you want sound to emphasize the action in your project ?
Remember that your goal is to focus the listener 's attention .
11 . Are ambient sounds needed ?
Do you ever want complete silence ?
Remember that ambient sounds can mask noise .
After answering these questions , where does one start in deciding which sfx to use in a project ?
A good place to start without having to reinvent the wheel is the movies .
State of the art movie sound is years ahead of computer games , so it would pay to take lessons from Hollywood in this respect .
Of course we must keep in mind the linearity of movies as opposed to the " random access " of a computer game .
In looking to Hollywood for lessons , I decided to make a list of all of the movies that have won Academy Awards for sound and / or sound effects .
The list in Appendix A is the result .
I have watched and listened to many of these movies and it is fascinating to see how Hollywood of years ago had many of the same technical problems that we in computer gaming face today .
Early Hollywood had a major advantage -- they controlled the theaters and the equipment contained in them .
Another advantage that Hollywood has always had with sound is that they control the whole movie experience and know what is going to happen next .
We can do that with cinematics , but it is a challenge in truly interactive gameplay .
What do award winning sound effects in movies have in common ?
1 . They focus the viewer 's attention .
2 . They are bigger than life .
3 . The sound effects and the music work together to focus the viewer 's attention .
4 . There is rarely complete silence .
Some background ( ambient ) sound is going on almost all of the time .
Otherwise , the viewer will be distracted by some sounds outside of the movie .
How many times in a completely silent part of a movie have you been annoyed by someone talking ?
It is very annoying because it causes a loss of focus .
This is not to say that silence cannot be used in a computer game .
But remember that there is always the drone of the cooling fan(s ) and the buzz of a sound card .
5 . They do not " get in the face " of the dialog .
6 . They do not " get in the face " of one another .
Usually one effect takes precedence over all of the others .
7 . They prepare us for what is to come .
8 . They set us up for what is to come .
9 . They distract us from what is to come .
10 .
They take the place of the senses that we can experience in a movie ( touch , taste , and smell ) .
We know that the cook has touched something hot when we hear his anguished cry of pain along with the sizzle of flesh .
We " feel " the pain with him .
We can smell the roses along with the beautiful princess when we hear her take a deep breath while a dainty , sparkling sound plays .
We can taste the bitter poison along with the murder victim as we hear him gag and froth at the mouth while a discordant sound effect plays .
11 . They help place the listener in another " reality . "
General rules for better sound effects :
1. Start with the absolute best raw materials -- samples / recordings/actors/sounds/etc .
2. Start with the highest quality digital data .
Record sound effects into a portable Digital Audio Tape ( DAT ) recorder at 44.1 k 16 bit .
This leaves nothing out of the recording and there is no tape hiss like you get on an analog tape machine .
Make sure that you recorded the hottest signal you can without pegging the record meter .
This will keep the " intelligent data " at a high enough amplitude to cover up much of the noise present .
3 . Use a high quality stereo microphone for foley effects .
Use a superior quality mono microphone for speech .
4 . With the possible exception of compression on vocals , do not use outboard effects during recording .
What is compression ?
It is a reduction in the dynamic range of a sound .
It can help to hide noise in a sample .
Digital effects , including compression , can be added via software .
5 . Use a digital sound interface card to transfer the data from the DAT to computer via fiber optic or coaxial cables .
All wave editing software will make this a simple matter .
6 . Edit the sound file before downsampling or converting to 8 bit format .
This keeps the noise out of the sample for as long as possible .
It is acceptable sometimes to convert a file before applying some type of digital processing .
The results can be interesting when the noise is used to make a sound less realistic .
7 . The experienced sound designer does not take sound for granted and realizes that the sounds we hear every day are pretty wimpy .
There is little expectation of getting usable sound effects by recording " real " sounds .
Instead , record similar , but greatly exaggerated , sounds .
8 . If you cannot help recording extraneous background noises , make sure to get a good sample of them for noise reduction when you get back to the digital editing software .
Also , there will often be noises that you fail to hear at the time of the recording because you are concentrating so hard on getting the sound effect .
You will want a recording of these by themselves also .
9 . But , never depend on noise reduction algorithms / equipment if at all possible .
10 .
There is often some type of background noise that will become objectionable when a 16 bit file is reduced to an 8 bit file .
And Speaking Of Noise --
What is noise ?
Instead of answering this subjective question , let 's ask one that can be answered more objectively .
What is silence ?
A scientific definition is that silence is the absence of rapid changes in air pressure .
Gordon Hempton , an Emmy - winning recordist , has searched the world over for quiet .
He defines a quiet place as " a place where , for a period of time , there is no human intrusion .
No chain saws .
No trail bikes .
No distant trucks .
A quiet place is a place where we 're able to hear the world as our ancestors heard it . "
Hempton feels lucky if he can record twenty minutes of noise - free sound , patched together from a week 's worth of work .
As a listener and a sound recordist , Hempton says that he has no control over the performance [ noise included ] , but he does have control over where the audience will sit .
" So that 's exactly what I do -- I find the best seats possible in nature 's amphitheater . "
Like it or not , even though you may prepare very carefully you will still face the problem of noisy raw materials for your sound effects .
Because this is a universal problem , it would be good to discuss handling the problem .
Let 's say that you have done everything to reduce noise when recording the raw material but when you get down to using it you hear noise .
The problem gets worse when you reduce the sample resolution to 8 bits .
So , what can you do ?
First of all , as was said above , always record a few seconds of live mike with nothing but ambient noise .
It is best to start the recorder , let it run a few seconds , record the sound effect , and then let the tape run for a few more seconds of ambiance -- all of this being one recording without turning the recorder off .
These seconds of " quiet " will be very useful as you will see .
Remember that it is very important to keep your recording volume maximized .
When you load the digital waveform into your digital editor , find a selection in the sample where there is only " quiet " ( noise ) .
Since you will always record a few seconds of ambiance , this is no problem .
Next , have the editing software analyze the selection .
Then use the noise reduction algorithm on the total sample .
You will probably have to work at this a while to get the feel for the proper settings , but the time you spend doing so will be well spent .
Cool Edit and Sound Forge have excellent noise reduction algorithms .
What digital editing software is available ?
A non-exhaustive list of software is in Appendix B .
Where can one purchase " raw sound effects " that have already been recorded ?
Most game development companies license a sound effect library on CD .
The library is generally purchased as a buyout , meaning that no other fees have to be paid to use the effects in a product .
This license is good for the life of the CD's , and you get to use the effects as many times as you wish for as long as you own the CD's .
There are differences in the sound quality of many of the libraries -- some use true man-made sound effects while others depend upon electronic sounds .
The important things to look for in a library are variety of sounds , quality of sounds , and ( probably most importantly ) a complete index with cross references .
If you cannot find the sounds on a CD set without resorting to browsing , you are no better off than if you had no CD 's at all .
The ideal situation is to have the index and cross reference in a database that will allow you to search for key words .
Track names are too limited in most cases , so the ability to search the descriptions of the effects on a CD becomes a requirement if you want to hear everything that resembles what you are looking for .
Additionally , a database would allow you to add comments so that you can make specific notes about each effect .
Many companies in the sound effect CD business offer a demo CD .
This should be your first step in researching what is available .
Upon purchase of a library , most companies will allow 30 day 's satisfaction guaranteed or money back .
Ask about this if the offer is not advertised .
Appendix C lists several companies offering buyout effects CD's .
Why not buy the sound effects CD 's offered in audio CD stores ?
You have to watch out regarding the licensing agreement on these .
Some state on the cover that they are " royalty free , " but the fine print states " royalty free for personal use . "
Read the agreement carefully .
Who can design good sound effects ?
Almost anyone .
Some of the common characteristics of designers of good sound effects : ability to hear the " sound effect " potential in sounds that others overlook ; above normal ability to hear pitch ; ability to visualize what would happen to a sound if it is altered by a sound editor without actually having to perform the alteration ; ability to visualize a sound from a description of the source of the sound ; ability to create a sound that is only heard in one 's head to begin with ; knowledge of proper recording technique and equipment ; fondness for gadgets ; patience ; good sense of humor ; good looks ; ) .
Two snow leopards were found among the private collection of exotic animals
A pair of snow leopards and two bear cubs were among the exotic animals found in the private zoo of ousted Kyrgyzstan President Kurmanbek Bakiyev .
A golden eagle , two falcons , four African peacocks and Indian ducks were also found in the zoo at the family home in the southern Jalalabad region .
Investigators found the collection when they raided the estate after Mr Bakiyev fled the country .
He is now in Belarus .
He has been charged in absentia with organising mass killings .
Mr Bakiyev was ousted in protests on 7 April in which more than 80 people died .
The interim government says his administration ordered troops to open fire on protesters .
It plans to seek Mr Bakiyev 's extradition from Belarus to face trial .
The former president also kept an African ostrich and Austrian white and black swans in his private menagerie , investigators said .
" The prosecutors are considering measures to evacuate those animals for their protection , " the prosecutor general 's office said .
Preston manager Darren Ferguson was left fuming with referee Phil Crossley following the 1 - 1 draw with Doncaster .
Whites chief furious after penalty decision
Complete disgrace
Fantastic save
Preston manager Darren Ferguson was left fuming with the performance of referee Phil Crossley in his side 's 1 - 1 draw with Doncaster at Deepdale .
Ferguson was angry with the official after he awarded the visitors a penalty following Sean St Ledger 's trip on James Chambers .
Billy Sharp saw his kick saved by Whites ' keeper Andy Lonergan as Neil Mellor secured a point for his side , but it did n't stop Ferguson from expressing his disapproval at the decision .
The former Peterborough boss was also unhappy with the decision not to send Chambers off in the second half as he felled Paul Coutts .
Chambers had already been cautioned three minutes before the interval - leading Ferguson to accuse the Rovers players of pressuring the referee .
" I was a long way away from it ( the penalty decision ) , but I was amazed , " said Ferguson .
" I 'd have to see it again but I think Sean was gobsmacked as well .
" I think the referee got put under a bit of pressure at half - time .
They ( Doncaster ) felt they should have had a penalty and he 's given one , but two wrongs do n't make a right .
The referees have got to stay strong . "
On the decision not to dismiss Chambers , he added : " How the lad 's not been sent off is an absolute disgrace , a complete disgrace .
It drives you mental .
" You do n't want to come out after games and keep talking about referees but it was a disgraceful decision .
" If he had n't have been booked already , the referee would have booked him and that would have changed the game .
" Counterpart Sean O'Driscoll was keen to take the positives from his side 's display - and refused to criticise Sharp for spurning the chance to take all three points .
Rovers had the better of the first half at Deepdale and took a deserved lead through James Hayter 's 28th - minute strike .
Mellor got Preston back on level terms three minutes before the interval before Sharp saw his 55th - minute spot - kick saved by Lonergan , who earned the praise of the Doncaster boss .
O'Driscoll said : " I 'm disappointed because we had the chance with the penalty to get our noses in front again but this is a difficult division and if everything happened as you would want it to it would n't be so tight . "
On Lonergan 's stop , he added : " He made a fantastic save in the first half from Gareth Roberts as well , so he 's earned his money .
" Billy will be disappointed with missing the penalty .
Goalscorers want to score goals so he 'll be a sulky boy on the way home .
But he 's been terrific for us .
He 's our top goalscorer , a bubbly character and he 'll bounce back on Saturday I 'm sure . "

By Rafeef Ziadah
April 12 , 2010 -- The Bullet --
In December 2007 , the Palestinian National Authority ( PA ) , in close consultation with donor states and institutions like the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank , proposed the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan ( PRDP ) , a program based on “ rebuilding the Palestinian national institutions ” and “ developing the Palestinian public and private sectors . ” [ 1 ]
To augment this plan , the PA further presented in August 2009 a program titled Palestine : Ending the Occupation , Establishing the State .
This latter program was much more explicit about a time frame for the declaration of a Palestinian state .
[ 2 ]
Salam Fayyad , current unelected PA prime minister and former World Bank employee , put forward this document ( henceforth the Fayyad Plan ) insisting that , despite the occupation , Palestinians need to be building the “ infrastructure for a future state ” .
The report calls upon “ our people , including all political parties and civil society , to realize this fundamental objective and unite behind the state - building agenda over the next two years ” .
Fayyad 's intention is to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in 2011 based on the June 4 , 1967 , borders .
The importance of the PRDP is signaled by the fact that international aid to the PA is contingent on implementation .
A specific bank account under the control of the World Bank was set up for this purpose .
In the Canadian context , the Canadian International Development Aid ( CIDA ) website explains that “ programming for the West Bank and Gaza is aligned with the requirements identified in the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan for 2008 - 2011 ” . [ 3 ]
Essentially , Fayyad 's PA must follow the dictates of the World Bank and Western powers to assure access to funds and , so far , it seems extremely willing to do so .
The boycott of Hamas by Western powers ( the Canadian state being the first to cut aid ) and the siege on Gaza serve as an example to the West Bank PA leadership of what would await them if they stray from this model of state building .
In an interview with Ma'an news in July 2009 , Fayyad explained :
The basic and fundamental objective is that two years from now , anyone , looking at us from any corner of the world ... it will be very difficult for him or her not to conclude that Palestinians are indeed ready for statehood , and if the occupation is still around then , that will be the only thing that is abnormal and that needs to end .
Understanding the logic of the Fayyad Plan is critical to assessing the current state of the Palestinian struggle .
Often the analytical emphasis is placed on Israeli action , while internal Palestinian politics are ignored .
However , the shifts taking place within the Palestinian Occupied Territories , such as the increased power of a Palestinian elite class , and the hand picking of Fayyad to implement neoliberal reforms , are vital to understand because they pose significant obstacles to Palestinian prospects for self - determination .
‘ Economic development first ’ , statehood Later
Palestine : Ending the Occupation , Establishing the State is a 54 - page report explaining Fayyad 's vision , peppered with every World Bank catch phrase imaginable from “ institution - building ” to “ efficiency ” leading all the way to “ human development ” .
Once the various layers of rhetoric are cleared , the basic idea is to have a fully functioning , neoliberal state apparatus in place before a Palestinian state is declared .
Fayyad 's program completely adheres to the World Bank paradigm of fiscal austerity , open markets for foreign investment and an emphasis on export - led development .
The neoliberal vision espoused by Fayyad works in tandem with the Israeli government 's plans for Palestinians and integrates the occupation in the planning for a future Palestinian state .
It was Netanyahu who announced in 2008 his intention to “ weave an economic peace alongside the political process which will give a stake in peace for the moderate elements in the Palestinian society ” .
[ 4 ]
This “ economic peace ” is one that guarantees security and access to Palestinian markets to Israel – without the need to take any responsibility for the population .
It is important to note that Salam Fayyad is not an elected primem inister , but was appointed by PA president Mahmoud Abbas ( whose own term in office has been extended without elections ) .
Fayyad 's first appointment , on June 15 , 2007 , was justified on the basis of “ national emergency ” after Hamas took over the Gaza Strip .
He has not been confirmed by the Palestinian Legislative Council , the Palestinian Authority 's parliament .
The neoliberal logic of the World Bank is not foreign to Fayyad .
He was a World Bank employee from 1987 –1995 .
He later was the IMF representative to the Palestinian National Authority until 2001 .
A good gauge of Fayyad 's popularity among Palestinians is the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections where he ran for a new party that he helped found called The Third Way .
At the time he received less than 3 % of the vote .
Although many have challenged the legality of his position , he is the individual that Western powers have chosen to implement their plan for Palestinian " statehood " .
He has been showered with praise from various leaders , including Israel 's president Shimon Peres who called him a “ Palestinian Ben Gurion ” .
The Fayyad Plan has gained tremendous support from the Western powers .
Shortly after the plan 's publication the US Obama administration announced a US $ 20 million grant to back the effort .
Congress approved a $ 200 million deposit into the PA treasury .
Since the treasury falls under Fayyad 's direct control he now has effective control over the West Bank economy and the political process .
It is increasingly evident he is being groomed to take over from PA president Mahmoud Abbas .
Fayyad is certainly a creative thinker .
He has come up with a one - of - a - kind model for achieving statehood : instead of resisting the occupation , the focus is placed on building state institutions and a functional neoliberal economy .
This will somehow make the occupying power grant Palestinians independence because they will realise that the colonised are civilised enough to have " good fiscal policy " and an " efficient public sector " .
This of course begs the simple question : a state over what territories ?
With the continued building of settlements by Israel , with the apartheid wall and its network of Israeli - only roads – all that is left are Palestinian bantustans .
Fayyad 's plan does envision development in areas of the West Bank that Israel fully controls : how this will be achieved without Israeli approval is not explained .
But , for the sake of argument , let us suspend the reality on the ground , pretend that there is n't an occupation , and analyse the logic of this Fayyad PA vision .
Less public welfare , more ‘ security ’
The Palestinian economy has been devastated by the continued Israeli occupation .
Israel 's control over borders and restriction on movement means that a viable Palestinian economy cannot grow .
Israel has also worked diligently to replace Palestinian labour in its own markets with migrant labour so it could sever any reliance on Palestinian workers ( as strikes were an effective form of resistance in the first Intifada ) .
The PA , as it emerged after the Oslo Accords in 1994 , was not designed to achieve economic independence from Israel by any means ; rather , the agreements cemented Israel 's control over the West Bank .
In the 1994 Paris Protocol , for example , an economic agreement signed between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government , the PA agreed to cede ultimate control over imports and exports to Israel .
After the election of Hamas and the cutting of aid from donor countries – it became glaringly apparent that as an entity the PA is fully reliant on outside funding for its survival .
Any talk of economic development for the West Bank that enables Palestinians to survive the reality of Israeli closures and to become self - reliant in order to sustain the resistance and remain on the land , would be more than welcome .
However , the Fayyad Plan has nothing to do with developing a sustainable Palestinian economy .
The economic development model put forward in his program is a normalisation model reliant upon persuading Israel and the international community that Palestinians could be both good trade partners and cheap labour .
More specifically , the Fayyad 's Plan is designed to cut back public - sector spending on welfare and social needs , while simultaneously strengthening the security apparatus of the PA .
One need only look at the economic reforms Fayyad 's PA has implemented thus far .
To illustrate , the World Bank presented in 2009 a progress report on the implementation of the PRDP titled , A Palestinian State in Two Years : Intuitions for Economic Revival .
The report explains that one of the most important reforms the PA has implemented is to “ control the public sector wage bill ” .
This component is essentially a wage freeze and slashing of the public sector , designed to “ maintain the 2009 public sector wage bill in line with the 2009 annual budget and reduce the wage bill to less than 22 percent of GDP ” . [ 5 ]
Another " reform " is to “ institute measures to increase collection of electricity bills from users and to continue to distribute at least 20,000 pre-paid electricity meters and reduce net lending to 6 percent of GDP ” .
This shift is designed to force a population – already impoverished due to the occupation – to live without electricity if they do not pay their bills .
It is worth noting that the West Bank depends on the Israeli Electric Company ( IEC ) to supply the majority of its power through three substations located in the Ariel settlement , the Atarot industrial settlement and the area C region near Hebron . [ 6 ]
Essentially , the PA is collecting the bills for the Israeli company .
The fact that the power stations are also located inside illegal settlements , means that the program is de facto accepting that settlements will exist in the future Palestinian state .
The PA has also introduced pension reform , where they will adopt “ an action plan to reduce PA short - term pension liabilities and begin to implement the plan by including measures in the 2010 budget that will reduce PA pension liabilities and put the PA pension schemes gradually back on a path to ensure their financial sustainability ” .
This measure is designed to reduce the pensions they are paying out to people who used to work for the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority .
Not only does this have a financial impact , but an accompanying political aim .
The Fayyad government is forcing many members of the different factions ( mainly Fatah with the largest share of PA jobs ) to take their pensions in lump sums and leave their current posts .
This is a political cleansing of the old guard of Fatah from the public sector , to be replaced by a younger generation of technocrats more in tune with World Bank standards .
The neoliberal program that the PA is pursuing thus promises severe cutbacks to the social provisions of the authority .
But , as with similar neoliberal programs around the world , this should not be interpreted as a cutback to the state itself .
Concurrent with the slashing of social spending , the budget for the repressive arm of the state is skyrocketing .
As the donors poured money into Fayyad 's plan , $ 109 million was committed in 2009 to finance an expanded training program for the PA security forces .
These security forces have been under Fayyad 's control since 2005 , supervised by US Lt. - Gen. Keith Dayton .
To make the point that what 's being created is by no means an independent security force for a future sovereign state , all the new personnel are vetted by Israel 's secret security apparatus , the Shin Bet , before being able to join the force .
According to the World Bank report , of the 2790 increase in employment in the Palestinian Authority in 2009 , there was a 1325 increase in members of the security forces .
In other words , nearly half of the number of jobs created in the Palestinian Authority were in the security sector .
Over the same period of time , the Ministry of Health lost 94 workers .
The same report stressed :
Undoubtedly , one most important recent developments in the West Bank has been the continued improvement in the security situation .
There have been few acts of large - scale violence in the past year and the PA is pushing forward with its efforts to professionalize its security forces and expand their operations throughout the West Bank .
With the help of the office of the U.S. Security Coordinator under the leadership of Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton , the PA has trained and equipped three new battalions of security forces and is currently training a fourth .
These new forces have been deployed in cities like Jenin , Nablus , Bethlehem , Ramallah , and parts of Hebron . [ 7 ]
In a speech to the Washington Institute of Near East Policy , Dayton explained :
What we have created are new men ... [ men who ] believe that their mission is to build a Palestinian state ...
Upon the return of these new men of Palestine , they have shown motivation , discipline and professionalism , and they have made such a difference – and I am not making this up – that senior IDF commanders ask me frequently : ‘ how many more of these new Palestinians can you generate , and how quickly , because they are our way to leave the West Bank ’ . [ 8 ]
In short , the Dayton - led security plan is designed to assist Israel 's military in controlling the population without a direct physical presence in Palestinian towns and villages .
The training for this force includes a four - month program at the Jordanian International Police Training Center , staffed by US and Jordanian personnel ( interestingly Jordan has become a base for training different security forces across the region , the main one being the Iraqi security forces ) .
Dayton explained that “ the US - developed curriculum focuses on human rights , proper use of force , riot control , civil disturbances , unit cohesion , and leadership ” .
There have been numerous reports of full security cooperation between the Israeli military and Fayyad 's Dayton - trained forces .
Recently , when there were calls for demonstrations in the West Bank against settlement activities in Jerusalem , the PA police warned that no demonstrations would be allowed without permits .
The idea of a population under occupation seeking permits from its own ( non-elected ) authorities to demonstrate against the occupiers speaks volumes to the nature and function of the PA .
The main security challenge Dayton boasts about in his speech though is " Operation Cast Lead " , Israel 's brutal war against the population in Gaza .
Hamas had called for " days of rage " across the West Bank during the war , but “ the professionalism and competence of the new security forces guaranteed a measured and disciplined approach .
They allowed demonstrations but prevented them from becoming violent , keeping the protesters away from Israelis " .
Dayton continues that “ the IDF even felt comfortable enough to deploy major units away from the West Bank in order to help in Gaza ” .
Dayton , was frank when speaking to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , that it is an international team leading the effort to build these security forces .
He explained that “ its ongoing work in the Israeli - Palestinian arena has been shaped by significant contributions from Canada , the United Kingdom , and Turkey ” .
The Canadian role , in particular , is disturbing , aside from recently shifting aid from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) to the Palestinian Authority for the purpose of strengthening the PA position , according to Dayton “ the Canadian contingent – which includes highly proficient Arabic linguists – travels about the West Bank freely ” and their work is invaluable to the mission .
Trade cooperation and border management
Explicit in Fayyad 's economic development program is an emphasis on setting up the West Bank infrastructure for trade with Israel .
The World Bank report on the Fayyad Plan is very clear about this point , noting that “ for the recent upturn in the West Bank economy to translate into a sustained economic recovery , the relaxation of movement and access restrictions within the West Bank must be supplemented by further opening that allows a vigorous revival of Palestinian trade with Israel and the rest of the world . ” [ 9 ]
From its side , Israel has completed construction of six commercial crossings between Israel and the West Bank .
Almost all Palestinian commercial goods are required to be shipped through these crossings using a " back - to - back system " .
The World Bank goes on to say that “ cooperation between the Government of Israel and the PA is critical in order for the PA to establish a presence at the borders of the West Bank and Gaza to ensure that it captures a high proportion of what is owed in value added tax and import duties ” .
[ 10 ]
Part of increasing " fiscal sustainability " , according to the report , is the PA 's ability to collect domestic tax revenues for the future Palestinian state .
The absurdity of the situation becomes even clearer .
The World Bank continues on to say that the “ PA is currently moving to establish a competent border management system that can be put in place at the commercial crossings and the borders of the future state ” .
The PA has even formed a border management authority .
As a dependent economy , the Palestinian Authority will be reliant on imports from Israel in order to sustain itself .
The role of the PA will not be to control its borders , but to " manage " them .
At the same time – because once a state is declared and " peace " is achieved , normal trade relations would commence between Israel , the PA and the rest of the Arab World – the PA - controlled West Bank state becomes an entry point for Israeli goods into the rest of the Arab world .
In this way , the Fayyad Plan is nothing but a normalisation mechanism , that evades the political and social conditions of the occupation .
It is a preparatory stage for establishing proper trade routes between Israel and the rest of the Arab world .
What kind of state ?
There is a growing consensus among the major powers around establishing a Palestinian state .
In his speech in Cairo in June 2009 , US President Barack Obama was clear about his objectives :
The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states , where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security .
That is in Israel 's interest , Palestine 's interest , America 's interest , and the world 's interest ... now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build .
The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern , with institutions that serve the needs of its people . [ 11 ]
Money has been dedicated to this project and " moderate " Palestinians have been chosen in order to achieve this goal .
While Israel has spoken out against unilateral declaration of a state , it too is happy to see an " economic peace " with Palestinians that guarantees it the territories and their resources without having to govern the people .
The real issue is what kind of state is being put forward ?
Looking at any other Arab dictatorship gives a strong indication of what awaits Palestinians if such a state is declared : failed economies , mired in debt to Western powers and the World Bank , with enormous security apparatuses to keep the " peace " .
The Fayyad Plan , instead of challenging the occupation , seeks to integrate its policies and infrastructure into a future state .
Fayyad 's effort to create normal economic life in the West Bank compliments the vision of the Israeli state .
It is aimed at silencing Palestinians with employment in a setting of economic desperation ( within joint Israel / PA industrial zones ) and no real national self - determination .
The Palestinian struggle for liberation , however , has never been an issue of simply statehood .
The Palestinian struggle is an anti-colonial , anti-racist one seeking justice for an indigenous population that was ethnically cleansed from their land in 1948 .
In all these discussions about a state , the right of return of Palestinian refugees is sidelined .
In PA documents , there is now only a referral to a " just solution " , and not a " right of return " .
Any proposed state or entity for Palestinians that actually ignores the majority of the Palestinian population , namely the refugees , cannot be a basis for a just peace .
This proposed state also does not address the discrimination that is faced by Palestinian citizens of Israel .
Some will claim that demanding the right of return or equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel is utopian , and that Palestinians should accept whatever they are being offered because of the so - called " consensus of the international community " .
What fuels anti-colonial movements though is not an acceptance of what colonisers have to offer – rather a defiance to demand the seemingly impossible and to fight for it .
While there is an attempt to narrow the Palestinian struggle to an issue of building state institutions in the West Bank ( while Gaza remains under a brutal siege ) , the Palestinian - led boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) movement speaks to the unity of the Palestinian nation .
The BDS campaign demands rights for Palestinian refugees , those living under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza , and Palestinian citizens of Israel .
We are witnessing the emergence of a Palestinian alternative to the failed paradigm of normalisation and neoliberal development that has come to animate the PA .
It will take some time for this new vision to crystallise , especially when the traditional Palestinian left is at its weakest point historically and seemingly more invested in being the go between for Hamas and Fatah than in being an alternative voice in the Palestinian political arena .
However , slowly but surely , new political formations are emerging calling for a return to the basic tenets of the Palestinian struggle for self - determination .
The normalisation process embedded in the Fayyad Plan stands in stark contrast to the growing BDS movement .
On the one hand , Palestinian grassroots movements are asking the world to boycott Israel until it complies with international law .
On the other , Fayyad promotes the normalisation of relations with Israel .
It is important to stress here that the BDS campaign did not come out of thin air – there is a strong history of anti-normalisation activity within Palestinian society .
The BDS campaign is not " leaderless " – it has a basis and structures within the Occupied Territories in the Boycott National Committee ( BNC ) .
It is certainly a young movement attempting to build some coherence within Palestinian ranks after the utter confusion of the so - called Oslo peace process .
It must be supported , not simply from a solidarity framework , but as part of the global struggle against neoliberal hegemony .
The Fayyad Plan for " economic development " currently faces the same problem Israel has faced for years : the Palestinian people .
No matter how hard the Palestinian Authority has tried , it is difficult to sell Palestinians this idea of a truncated state .
It is easy for Palestinians living in the West Bank to understand , just from looking out their windows , that Israel is creating facts on the ground that make a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders impossible .
Of course , there are those benefiting from neoliberal changes to the economy who will say that under Fayyad there is " order " and he is building " infrastructure for a future state " .
They will boast about the drivers on the streets of Ramallah now wearing seat belts .
Yes , our bantustan warden comes in World Bank garb and insists on " order " within the confines of our ever - shrinking ghetto .
But he remains an appointed prison warden , there to manage the implementation of apartheid .
And if Palestinian history tells us anything – it is that those who give up on basic Palestinian rights have a tendency to be ousted by the people .

How much information is out there ?
For most of us , " a crapload " is a sufficiently accurate answer .
But for a few obsessive data analysts , more precision is necessary .
According to a recent study by market - research company IDC , and sponsored by storage company EMC , the size of the information universe is currently 800,000 petabytes .
Each petabyte is a million gigabytes , or the equivalent of 1,000 one - terabyte hard drives .
If you stored all of this data on DVDs , the study 's authors say , the stack would reach from the Earth to the moon and back .
That 's a 62 % increase over the amount of digital information floating around the year before – but it 's just a down payment on next year 's total , which will reach 1.2 million petabytes , or 1.2 zettabytes .
If these growth rates continue , by 2020 the digital universe will total 35 zettabytes , or 44 times more than in 2009 .
It 's interesting to compare IDC 's study with a recent UC San Diego report on how much information Americans consume per year .
According to that study , media consumption in 2008 added up to 3.6 zettabytes and 10,845 trillion words , or about 34 gigabytes per person per day .
Much of the media we view ( TV shows , streaming video from YouTube ) is centrally stored , on internet - connected servers , so the totals for consumption are naturally higher than the storage requirements .
IDC notes that while data storage will increase 44 - fold by 2020 , the number of IT professionals worldwide will only grow by 40 % , which means each IT guy is going to have a lot more data to oversee .
Good luck with that , guys !

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Emails at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. released by a Senate subcommittee show just how much financial reform is needed , two leading senators said on Sunday .
The emails , released Saturday , show executives and other employees at Goldman Sachs knew that the firm was making money on the collapse of the housing market , largely by betting on the failure of mortgage securitizations and derivatives like the ones it bundled and sold to investors , whose failure led to the financial crisis .
The Republican National Committee spent more than $ 340,000 at a lavish party meeting in Hawaii , according to recently filed campaign finance reports .
The news comes on the heels of a report last month which revealed that the Party had reimbursed a staffer $ 2,000 for an event at a risque bondage - themed Beverly Hills nightclub .
Federal Election Commission reports , noted in the DC - insider website Hotline , show that the party spent a whopping $ 167,000 for “ facilities ” during their three day stay .
That comes to $ 56,000 per day , more than the average American makes in a year .

RNC officials spent another $ 90,000 for rooms and office space for party employees .
Hotline reports that at least 33 RNC staffers made their way to the Waikiki Beach party .
Another 168 members of the party ’s national committee also attended — meaning the cost per attendee comes to more than $ 2,000 each .
And the $ 340,000 total does n’t include airfare .
“ The $ 340 K documented in FEC filings does not include airfare for each staffer , which could amount to tens of thousands more , ” Hotline ’s Reid Wilson reports .
“ FEC rules require the party committees to disclose how they spent their money , including listing merchants who received payments , but it does not require the RNC to list destinations of air travel .
Given that the RNC spends thousands of dollars for air travel every month , that means there is no way to account for the staffers who flew to Honolulu . ”
Wilson adds , “ Only the top 3 RNC officials — chairman Michael Steele , co-chair Jan Larimer and Treasurer Randy Pullen — had their flights paid for by the RNC .
Every other committee member had to pay his or her own way . ”

RNC Chairman Michael Steele has come under fire from donors and outsiders alike who contend that he is n’t running a tight enough ship .
Steele has deflected the concerns , suggesting they have to do with his race .
An RNC spokesman did not return a call seeking comment on Wilson ’s piece .
I doubt that many inquiries are provided with documents in which the subject of the inquiry not only asks subordinates to delete documents subject to an FOI request , but also states in writing that he expects a subordinate to give an untrue statement to an official .
And even rarer that an inquiry would not clarify the subject ’s state of mind and knowledge when the expectation was issued .
Jones ’ request to delete emails is notorious .
His email saying that “ Keith should ” make an untrue statement to university FOI official Palmer has thus far not been analysed , but is obviously something that the Parliamentary Inquiry should have considered before purporting to blame UEA administration for CRU obstruction of FOI requests .
I ’ll start this backstory in early 2008 .
David Holland was offended by Briffa ’s seemingly highhanded dismissal of AR4 Review Comments .
Holland observed that IPCC procedures required Review Editors to ensure that authors responded adequately to Review Comments .
IPCC ’s procedures also stated that their procedures were to be “ open and transparent ” and that all review comments should be maintained in a public archive for 5 years .
However , the WG1 archive notably did not include any comments by Review Editors .
Holland began an effort to obtain these review comments , an effort that , despite one refusal after another , continues to this day .
One of the IPCC Review Editors of particular interest was then UK Met Office Chief Scientist John Mitchell , who was the Chapter 6 Review Editor ( and thus dealing with Briffa and the proxy reconstructions . )
As reported in a CA post on Jan 30 , 2008 , the Review Editor reports that Holland obtained from IPCC were perfunctory .
Holland sent an inquiry to Mitchell ( Holland MOD07 ) on Feb 22 , 2008 asking questions about his actions as Review Editor .
On March 14 , instead of seeking advice from Met Office officials on his responsibilities , Mitchell sought direction from IPCC WG1 Chair Susan Solomon ( copying Briffa and the other chapter 6 Review Editor , Jean Jouzel ) , stating in his email that Holland had “ links with Stephen McIntyre and his Climate Audit website ” .
Without cautioning Mitchell to determine his obligations under UK FOI legislation , Solomon advised Mitchell not to provide additional information .
Solomon :
“ The authors are responsible for the content of their chapters and responding to comments , not REs. [ Review Editors ] .
Further explanations , elaboration or re-interpretation of the comments or the author responses would not be appropriate .
All of the comments and all of the authors responses have been made available .
All of the comments and all of the authors responses have been made available .
These are the proper source for anyone seeking to understand what comments were made and how the authors dealt with them and it would be inappropriate to provide more information beyond the references to the web pages where this can be found . ”
Mitchell ’s reply to Holland about two weeks later ( March 27 , 2008 ) followed Solomon ’s instructions almost verbatim :
You should note that the review editors do not determine the final content of the chapters .
It is the authors that are responsible for the content of their chapters and responding to comments , not the review editors .
All of the comments and all of the authors ’ responses have been made available , and are the proper source for anyone wishing to understand what comments were made and how the authors dealt with them .
It would be inappropriate to provide more information beyond the web pages already freely provided .
The Climategate Letters subsequently showed that Solomon ’s assertion ( adopted by Mitchell ) that “ all of the comments and all of the authors ’ responses have been made available ” was untrue .
Mitchell ’s letter added the surprising comment that he had not kept any “ working papers ” , incorrectly saying that there were no such IPCC obligations :
I have not kept any working papers .
There is no requirement to do so , given the extensive documentation already available from IPCC
Jones had already been briefed on Holland ’s inquiry by March 27 , when emailed Trenberth , Overpeck , Mann , Santer and Solomon warning them that Holland had been “ hassling ” Mitchell .
Mitchell ’s March 27 letter to Holland ( following Solomon ’s language ) had said that “ review editors do not determine the final content of the chapters .
It is the authors that are responsible for the content of their chapters and responding to comments , not the review editors . ”
Following this lead , Holland pursued his inquiries with Keith Briffa on April 1 .
( Although CRU later took the position that they treated correspondence as confidential , neither CRU nor the Met Office treated Holland ’s inquiry as “ confidential ” ; in this case , Briffa immediately forwarded Holland ’s letter to Mitchell , Chapter 6 Coordinating Lead Authors Overpeck and Jansen , and , of course , Phil Jones , stating that he would send Holland a “ brief response ” when he “ got round to it ” .
Frustrated by Mitchell ’s implausible claim that he had “ not kept any working papers ” on his activities as IPCC Review Editor , Holland submitted a formal FOI request on Apr 4 to the Met Office , asking for release of all documents concerning the IPCC assessment of [ Historic Temperature Reconstructions ] held by the Met Office , referring specifically to the Hockey Stick controversy .
The Met Office responded to Holland ’s FOI request about threee weeks later ( May 1 , 2008 ) with a dossier of only 6 emails ( two of which were to or from Holland himself ) .
The other four emails in the dossier contained the interesting correspondence of March 2008 between Mitchell , Solomon and Briffa referred to above .
The Met Office stated implausibly ( and untruthfully ) that this was “ all the information held by Dr Mitchell , on behalf of the Met Office regarding all of your questions asked . ”
Their answer was so far from the truth that one of their later FOI excuses was that Mitchell ’s IPCC correspondene was so voluminous that searching it would exceed statutory costs limitations .
I had posted in January 2008 ( here here ) on Holland ’s efforts to that date .
As a result , Holland forwarded me the Met Office ’s response to his FOI request and the next day ( May 2 , 2008 ) , I published a post reviewing the situation .
To guard against the possibility that his request may have missed relevant documents by being too narrowly specified , Holland re-submitted a follow - up request on May 5 , this time asking for all Mitchell ’s correspondence as IPCC Review Editor .
On the same day ( May 5 , 2008 ) , Holland sent his first FOI request to CRU , in which he took note that his earlier letter to Briffa had gone unacknowledged and that Briffa ’s letter in the Met Office dossier said that his response to Holland would be “ brief when he got round to it ” .
He also expressed disagreement with Solomon ’s instructions not to disclose any information not already in the public domain .
Holland ’s FOI request specified “ all letters , facsimile and email correspondence to or from Drs Briffa and Osborn in connection with their work as an IPCC Lead Authors ” .
On May 8 , UEA FOI Officer Palmer met with Briffa to discuss Holland ’s request .
Following up the meeting the next day ( May 9 ) , Palmer notified Jonathan Colam of Holland ’s inquiry and of the potential for an appeal ; Briffa emailed Holland acknowledging receipt of his April 1 letter and promising a reply the following week ; and Jones ( 1210341221.txt ) notified Mann , Bradley and Ammann that CRU thought that “ they ’ve found a way around ” Holland ’s FOI requests , concluding his email by saying “ This message will self - destruct in 10 seconds ” .
Presumably prompted by his meeting with Palmer , Briffa responded on May 15 to Holland ’s questions – questions which had focused on IPCC ’s failure to accurately represent the actual state of controversy about temperature reconstructions .
The issue remains pertinent today .
Julia Slingo ’s testimony to the UK Parliamentary Committee , in which she reported that the disputes had been “ fully addressed ” and “ largely resolved ” , is an inaccurate impression that derived from the Briffa AR4 section that concerned Holland .
Meanwhile , I happened to be re-visiting Wahl and Ammann 2007 – the Supplementary Information was still unavailable and had been recently refused by Ammann .
On April 3 , I had asked Stephen Schneider , editor of Climatic Change , how an article that was supposedly “ accepted ” on Feb 28 , 2006 included citations to ( and relied on results from ) an article that was not submitted until August 22 , 2006 .
Schneider replied on May 20 .
Needless to say , there was n’t ( and could not be ) a valid explanation .
O posted Schneider ’s evasive reply on May 23 here .
The juxtaposed fresh looks at AR4 Review Comments and Ammann and Wahl 2007 caused me to notice striking parallels in language between in Briffa ’s Author Responses and Ammann and Wahl 2007 ( not Wahl and Ammann 2007 ) .
For example , the Second Draft Author Responses contained the following comment :
Finally , it does not take into account that some of the verifications seen as “ skillful ” are associated with very poor / exceedingly poor calibrations , which would be rejected on first principles in real world reconstruction applications .
..
which was an odd way to say things , but paralleled almost exactly in Ammann and Wahl 2007 :
Furthermore , the MM05 c proxy - based threshold analysis only evaluates the verification - period RE scores , ignoring the associated calibration - period performance .
However , any successful real - world verification should always be based on the presumption that the associated calibration has been meaningful as well …
Bishop
Hill wrote this up engagingly in Caspar and the Jesus Paper .
I had n’t noticed the parallels when the Review Comments became available ( in June 2007 ) for the simple reason that Ammann and Wahl 2007 was n’t published until September 2007 .
The interesting thing about the parallels is that the peculiar “ findings ” of Ammann and Wahl 2007 did not exist in any other literature and , as noted above , Ammann and Wahl 2007 was n’t even submitted until August 22 , 2006 – after the Second Draft Author Responses had been finalized .
Neither Ammann nor Wahl had submitted any on - the - record Review Comments for chapter 6 - Wahl had n’t even been nominated as an IPCC Expert Reviewer .
So how did language from a still unsubmitted paper get applied in Review Comments purporting to dismiss Mc - Mc results ?
On May 24 here , I surmised that , contrary to Mitchell ( and Solomon ’s ) representation that all the review comments were on the record , that Ammann must have been making surreptious off - the - record review comments to Briffa ( since Wahl was n’t an IPCC reviewer , the idea of Wahl making surreptious off - the - record review comments was overlooked ) .
I wrote :
Terminology from a then unsubmitted paper turns up in the Chapter Author replies to Review Comments .
Compare the terminology in the answer to Review Comment 6-735 ( which would have been final around Aug 4 , 2006 ) to the language in Ammann and Wahl , which , as we recently learned , was submitted on August 22 , 2006 .
Some language points track exactly and do not occur elsewhere in the literature .
So there is no doubt that Ammann made written comments to the Chapter Authors of Chapter 6 , but these are not on the record despite IPCC policy .
Climategate Letters later showed that it was Eugene Wahl that had been in intimate contact with Briffa in the preparation of the Review Comments – not Ammann .
Otherwise , my surmise was 100 % correct .
Climategate Letters in 2006 show voluminous correspondence between Wahl and Briffa about the Final Draft – entirely in violation of IPCC procedures .
The emails show great concern on the part of both Wahl and Briffa that this contact be kept secret and that any language “ stolen ” [ their words ] from then unsubmitted Ammann and Wahl not be traceable .
In one email , Briffa asked Wahl to assure him that his use of Ammann and Wahl language would “ not later be obvious ” :
please assure me that this OK ( and will not later be obvious ) hopefully .
I would n’t say that the connection would necessarily be “ obvious ” to most readers , but , as of May 24 , 2008 , it was clear to me that some sort of surreptitious connection had been made to Briffa ( though , as noted above , I presumed that it was Ammann , rather than Wahl . )
Holland appears to have read my post , as a few days later ( May 27 ) , he amended his FOI request , particularizing three items , one of which ( Item 3 ) was specifically mentioned Ammann ,
“ any emails or other documents from IPCC contributing author Caspar Ammann or the Journal Climatic Change that discuss any matters in relation to the IPCC assessment process . ”
While emails from
Wahl would fall outside this item , they would , of course , be included in the more general correspondence request of May 5 , 2008 .
Holland ’s FOI request ( Item 2 ) also included a list of articles submitted in response to the July 3 , 2006 request for “ additional papers that are either in - press or published in 2006 ” .
Holland received this information only a few days ago – this time in response to a request for an attachment to a Climategate Letter .
Holland ’s May 27 request initiated a flurry of activity at CRU .
At 6:30 pm , FOI officer Palmer wrote to the CRU Three , stating in no uncertain terms that he wanted to do as much as possible ‘ by the book ’ in this instance ” ( 888 .
1212009215.txt ) :
I just wish to ensure that we do as much as possible ‘ by the book ’ in this instance as I am certain that this will end up in an appeal , with the statutory potential to end up with the ICO .
Osborn was the first to respond ( late in the evening of May 27 ) , saying in respect to the Ammann correspondence :
we ’ll send the same enquiry to Ammann as we sent to our other colleagues , and let you know his response
The “ same enquiries ” to their “ other colleagues ” are not presently on the record .
Around midnight , Osborn sent an email to Ammann ( cc Jones , Briffa ) asking him whether he considered any emails as “ confidential ” :
In particular , we would like to know whether you consider any emails that you sent to us as confidential .
About a half hour later , Ammann ( who is in Colorado ) replied ( cc Jones , Briffa ) that he would answer the question of confidentiality “ in a couple days ” as he did n’t “ recall ” any specifics off the “ top of his head ” .
Oh MAN ! will this crap ever end ??
Well , I will have to properly answer in a couple days when I get a chance digging through emails .
I do n’t recall from the top of my head any specifics about IPCC .
At 5:13 pm the next day ( may 28 ) , Jones sent a remarkable email ( 888 .
1212009215.txt ) to FOI officer [ David ] Palmer ( copying Briffa , Osborn , McGarvie ) stating that “ Keith should say that he did n’t get anything extra that was n’t in the IPCC comments ” :
… Keith ( or you Dave ) could say that for ( 1 ) Keith did n’t get any additional comments in the drafts other than those supplied by IPCC .
On ( 2 ) Keith should say that he did n’t get any papers through the IPCC process .
either .
I was doing a different chapter from Keith and I did n’t get any .
What we did get were papers sent to us directly – so not through IPCC , asking us to refer to them in the IPCC chapters .
If only Holland knew how the process really worked !!
Every faculty member in ENV and all the post docs and most PhDs do , but seemingly not Holland .
So the answers to both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) should be directed to IPCC , but Keith should say that he did n’t get anything extra that was n’t in the IPCC comments .
What Jones expected Briffa to say was untrue ( I ’ll examine the 2006 exchanges between Briffa and Wahl in a separate post . )
The following day ( May 29 ) , Jones sent his now notorious email ( 891 .
1212063122.txt ) to Mann , asking him to “ delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4 ” , assaying that they will be getting Caspar [ Ammann ] to do likewise and asking him to get Gene [ Wahl ] to do the same :
Mike ,
Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4 ?
Keith will do likewise .
He ’s not in at the moment – minor family crisis .
Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same ?
I do n’t have his new email address .
We will be getting Caspar to do likewise .
…
Cheers
Phil
Mann replied immediately that he would contact Wahl about this ASAP :
Hi Phil ,
…
I ’ll contact Gene about this ASAP .
His new email is : enerwahl@yahoo.com
talk to you later ,
mike
Recently , Mann has reported his disapproval of the conduct requested by Jones and denied that he took any steps to further Jones ’ requests .
The Climategate letters , while voluminous , still only afford vignettes of CRU conduct .
Thus we do n’t know exactly how events played out after the “ Keith should say ” email .
Was FOI officer Palmer left in the dark about the extensive off - the - record correspondence between Wahl and Briffa , that Jones said did not exist ?
Did Briffa “ lie in the weeds ” allowing Palmer to run with Jones ’ false characterization or did Briffa immediately notify Palmer ( as he obviously should have ) that Jones ’ characterization of events was untrue ?
If Briffa did not inform Palmer that the “ Keith should say ” version was incorrect , Palmer ( who has been unfailingly polite to FOI requesters ) and other UEA officials must surely be bristling at being allocated a seemingly disproportionate amount of blame in the Parliamentary Committee report .
And what exactly did Jones know about Briffa ’s exchanges with Wahl ?
Given the extremely close contact between Jones and Briffa , it would be very odd , to say the least , if Briffa ’s exchanges with Wahl had been so secret that not even Jones was aware of them .
Either way , there ’s a problem .
If Briffa kept his surreptitious exchanges with Wahl secret even from Jones , this is very convincing evidence of Briffa ’s awareness that his exchanges with Wahl were in violation of IPCC procedures .
Alternatively , if Jones knew of the surreptitious contact , then his “ Keith should say ” email to Palmer is arguably even more damning than his “ delete all emails ” to Mann – perhaps even keeping his reputation “ intact ” though not in the sense intended by the Parliamentary Committee .
Edmonds , Washington ( CNN ) -- For Michael Reagan , the portraits always start the same way .
" I do the eyes first so I get this connection with the face , " he said .
" I am pretty exhausted after a picture .
Just try staring at a photograph for five hours without any distractions . "
Reagan , a professional artist for 40 years , is known for his vivid etchings of politicians , celebrities and athletes .
Today , he has a new subject : fallen members of the military .
It all started three years ago when the wife of a Navy corpsman who was killed in Iraq asked Reagan to draw her late husband .
Reagan insisted on doing the portrait for free .
Then he had a realization .
" I looked at my wife and told her what happened and said , ' Now we need to do them all , ' " Reagan remembered .
" Doing them all " meant closing his art gallery and reaching out to the families of fallen service members .
Most of the troops Reagan draws are U.S. service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He has recently started drawing portraits for family members of British and Canadian troops killed in those conflicts .
Many families were unsure why someone would offer to do a portrait for them at no cost .
They wanted to know why someone would volunteer to , as Reagan puts it , " participate in the worst time of their life . "
Slowly , word among military families spread and requests for portraits began pouring in .
Reagan , a Vietnam veteran , grew to know the faces of hundreds of troops lost to war .
" It breaks my heart to see young people who have died , " he said .
" It makes me proud that I get a place in their life . "
It is a punishing regimen .
Before Reagan puts pencil to paper , he researches the person by reading letters from his or her family and studying the pictures and videos that the family has provided .
A portrait takes between five and six hours , not including the research .
He tries to complete two each day .
So far , Reagan has done more than 2,000 portraits .
Keeping up with the requests wears down Reagan , 62 , at a time he thought he would be getting ready to retire .
A small volunteer group of military families and friends helps him coordinate the portraits and has set up a foundation to bear some of the costs involved .
Drawing celebrities and athletes allowed him to make a good living , he said , but with the military portraits , Reagan says he has found his " true calling . "
" I work with dead people every day , " Reagan said with a deep sigh .
" A different two every day who have stories , whose families love 'em , whose families are going to miss 'em forever .
" It 's what I have assumed as my task . "
More than 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan , and more than 4,300 have died in Iraq .
The portraits have a profound impact on the families that defies a simple explanation .
" It 's not for me , it 's for my daughter , " Astrid Santini said shortly after receiving Reagan 's portrait of her daughter and late husband .
" For her to have in her house someday . "
Sgt. Ed Santini was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad , Iraq , in 2007 , leaving behind Astrid and their 4 - year - old daughter , Nayomi .
The day the portrait arrived in the mail , Santini was overwhelmed with emotion .
" It 's magical , " she said while gazing at the picture with Nayomi .
" How can one picture make him look alive ?
Just for one moment , I thought he was here . "
Reagan said the impact of his portraits transcends the politics and controversy surrounding war .
He is reminded of that every Tuesday when Joe Colgan pulls into Reagan 's driveway in a truck decorated with bumper stickers calling for the pullout of troops from Iraq .
Reagan , on the other hand , supported the removal of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
Despite their political differences , the two men are friends and close collaborators on the portrait project .
Every week , Colgan drives 70 miles round trip to pick up and mail Reagan 's portraits .
He carries with him the framed portrait that Reagan drew of Colgan 's son Ben , an Army lieutenant killed by a bombing in Iraq in 2003 .
" Somehow , the spirit of the person comes through , the soul of the person is right there with the drawing , " Colgan said .
" I ca n't explain it . "
Reagan also can't explain the effect of his portraits or why a successful artist would suddenly decide to begin drawing pictures of an intensely painful subject , free of charge .
It is a journey , he says , that began years ago with his own experience on the battlefield as a young Marine in Vietnam .
" I love drawing pictures , I have always loved it , " Reagan said .
" In Vietnam , a lot of the pictures I drew came home when the soldiers and Marines did n't . "
He said his personal war experience changed his perspective on life .
" I think anybody who served in combat knows what that is :
You come home with the nightmares that never go away , " Reagan said .
" Doing this is finally allowing me to come home . "
CNN 's John Couwels contributed to this report .
RELIGIOUS leaders have used their Easter sermons and messages to condemn the rise of atheism , with Sydney Anglican Archbishop Peter Jensen describing the philosophy as an " assault on God " .
A day after Sydney Catholic Archbishop Cardinal George Pell criticised non-believers , Dr Jensen said in his Good Friday sermon at Sydney 's St Andrew 's Cathedral that atheism was a form idolatry .
" As we can see by the sheer passion and virulence of the atheist - they seem to hate the Christian God - we are not dealing here with cool philosophy up against faith without a brain , " Dr Jensen told worshippers .
" Atheism is every bit of a religious commitment as Christianity itself .
" It represents the latest version of the human assault on God , born out of resentment that we do not in fact rule the world and that God calls on us to submit our lives to him .
" It is a form of idolatry in which we worship ourselves . "
Cardinal Pell of St Mary 's Cathedral delivered a similar attack on atheism in his Easter message yesterday .
He praised government organisations " paid for by the Christian majority " for helping make the Australian way of life the envy of the world , but noted that atheists sponsored no community services .
The new Catholic Bishop of Parramatta , in Sydney 's west , Anthony Fisher , continued the attack in his Easter message .
" Last century we tried godlessness on a grand scale and the effects were devastating : Nazism , Stalinism , Pol Pot-ery , mass murder , abortion and broken relationships - all promoted by state - imposed atheism , " he said .
A spokesman for Dr Jensen denied it was a co-ordinated attack by the churchmen .
But he said the comments were likely to have been spurred by the recent Rise of Atheism conference held in Melbourne , which attracted 2500 non-believers and featured renowned figurehead Richard Dawkins .
Dr Jensen went on to say in his sermon that religion can be an " even more dangerous " form of idolatry than atheism if incorrectly interpreted .
" Here , too , religion can simply be the power game under a different guise ...
Atheist or religious person - we all need to be reconciled to God and give him our lives , " he added .
We are pleased to announce that we are beginning the beta of our new “ pools ” service .
Pools are a way to reserve memory and CPU power for one or more web sites .
This approach makes it possible to discard many of the limitations traditionally associated with our service .
Pool vs. VPS
I ’m really trying to avoid saying “ it ’s like a VPS ” although it shares DNA with that approach : isolation by virtualization , resource guarantees , and scalability .
Because despite those similarities , it ’s equally notable for its differences .
Like our traditional service , and unlike a VPS , pools take advantage of our core infrastructure : firewalls , HTTP accelerators , and high - performance file servers .
Also unlike a VPS , pools include our 24x7x365 operational monitoring and maintenance of the OS , network stack , and software environment .
It ’s not as cut and dried as saying “ Pools are better than VPSs , ” or the other way around .
In keeping with our “ we host web sites ” mantra , Pools are extremely optimized for awesome hosting of web applications ; they do n’t really do anything else .
For hosting the world ’s Ventrillo , Shoutcast , IRC bots and servers , and all that other stuff , a “ typical ” VPS is still the only way to go , and we ’re grateful that other people offer that service , because we have no interest in doing it .
There are a couple of key factors to look at to determine whether you ’re better off with a pool or with a VPS .
Is it a web ( port 80 ) application ?
Yes -> Pool No -> VPS
You want : Root access and maximum control over OS choice and tuning .
->
VPS
To focus on your site and leave the security updates , firewalls , and midnight outages to a team of experts . ->
Pool
You need a dedicated IP address or SSL support : Yes -> VPS No ->
Pool
Pool Pricing
( As with all things beta , the information here is subject to change as we refine what we can and ca n’t do . )
Pools are priced based on RAM , but include both a RAM and CPU component .
( The difference being that CPU usage is burstable and RAM is not . )
The specific CPU amounts are still be determined , but the minimum reservation will , somewhat obviously , be proportional to the ratio of Ghz to GiB in the standard blades we use .
We inevitably run out of RAM before CPU power , and we do n’t expect that to change , so the “ burst ” CPU amounts available should be substantial .
The base price for a pool is $ 3.43 / month .
Each gigabyte of RAM is $ 21.45 / month .
That means you can get a 1GB pool of dedicated RAM for less than $ 25 / month .
However , since this is NearlyFreeSpeech .
NET , all “ monthly ” charges are based on 31 - day months and calculated to the penny in real time .
Pool Sizing
There are no packages or bundles .
Pools can be configured at any memory size you desire between a minimum of 128 MiB ( $ 6.11 / month ) and a maximum of 3 GiB ( $ 67.78 / month ) in 4 mb increments , and the memory size can be changed at any time with a simple “ reboot ” that takes about 20 - 30 seconds .
There is one “ catch . ”
When sizing your pool , keep in mind that there is some overhead .
There is baseline OS overhead of about 40 MiB plus about 8 MiB per GiB .
( We could theoretically do a 64MiB pool , but the overhead would leave about 24MiB available for your web server .
So it ’s technically cool , but not terribly practical . )
If you ’re not sure how much memory you need , we recommend starting with 128 MiB ( $ 6.11 / month ) or 256 MiB ( $ 8.43 / month ) .
Storage Pricing Offset
As most people know , our charge for disk storage is how we have traditionally recovered the equipment costs ( including CPU and RAM ) .
Obviously pools represent a very different approach , and it would be “ double dipping ” to charge both fees at the same time .
Thus , at least for the first part of the beta , 90 % the storage charges that accrue for sites that are assigned to pools will be used to offset the cost of the pool .
For example , if you currently pay $ 5.00 / month for storage for your site example , and you convert it to a pool , you will get up to a $ 4.50 / month offset against the cost of the pool .
That ’s not the long term solution to making storage pricing more fair , it ’s more of a band - aid .
We will be adjusting this down the road .
Pools and Lanes
It ’s possible to run more than one site inside a pool .
Pools can be divided into multiple “ lanes , ” each of which can host a completely separate site .
( Picture competitive swimmers and the little floaty things that separate their lanes . )
Sites in different lanes of the same pool share the RAM and CPU of the pool , but have “ logical ” isolation ; they cannot interact or see each other and might be running completely different configurations or web servers .
Apache Lanes
We provide an Apache 2.2 build that works great with pools .
It comes with PHP 5.2 and 5.3 support available , both of which run with safe_mode off and at a significant performance boost over PHP Fast .
It ’s great for heavy frameworks like Zend and provides a particularly nice boost to hard - hit sites running CMS applications like Drupal .
But not only is it faster than PHP Fast , it ’s also more flexible than PHP Flex .
You get full control over your httpd.conf and php.ini files .
Need custom PHP extensions ?
No problem .
Want mod_ruby or mod_perl instead ?
No problem .
Add what you need .
Want mod_deflate or mod_dav ?
You can make it happen .
Arbitrary Server Lanes
What if you do n’t want to run Apache at all ?
Still no problem .
Inside a pool , it is possible to run any web server or application .
Zope , Rails , Catalyst , Tomcat ; pretty much anything that talks HTTP on port 80 will work .
The only restriction we impose is that it has to be able to run in “ foreground ” or “ monitored ” mode .
( That ’s just so that our system can keep an eye on it and make sure it stays running . )
How do I get in the beta ?
We have added an assistance request for the Pool beta .
The initial allocation of resources for the beta will be limited , and since pools represent a resource reservation , beta opportunities may be limited as well .
We will get as many people into the beta as quickly as we can , but we may have to delay some requests if it proves too popular .
The Future of Pools
Initially , at least for the duration of this beta , pools will be most suitable for larger sites due to the nontrivial per-pool overhead ; it ’s not shared hosting and ca n’t be priced that way .
However , part of the purpose of the beta is to help us finalize the development and testing of the underlying technology to get it to the level where we can offer a related option that will make it cost - effective for even very small sites to get the security , performance and flexibility offered by pools .
This is really exciting stuff for us , and we hope you ’ll check it out and help us make it even better , both by giving us beta feedback and by using it to do amazing stuff we never would have thought of .

Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Conflicting accounts of a botched NATO raid that killed five Afghans in February have led to a new investigation ordered by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , a NATO military spokesman said Monday .
Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale , a NATO spokesman , said Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who oversees all U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan , called for the review after receiving a briefing from Afghan officials in late March .
On Sunday , NATO acknowledged that its troops killed five Afghans in the nighttime raid in February , after initially saying the civilians may have been the victims of an " honor killing . "
Although civilian casualties at the hands of NATO troops have fallen off in recent months , such incidents have strained the relationship between Afghanistan and the Western nations that make up the International Security Assistance Force .
According to two U.S. military officials , in the March briefing , Afghan officials from the Interior Ministry told McChrystal that after the incident , they visited the compound where the Afghans were killed and found evidence of bloodstained walls being washed down and bullets being dug out .
McChrystal wants a thorough review now to see why U.S. and Afghan accounts differ so greatly , according to one of the sources , a senior U.S. official familiar with the briefing .
The senior U.S. official said that by the time the Afghan investigators got to the compound , the people who lived there may have been attempting to clean it up .
NATO officials believe the U.S. and Afghan troops may have dug some bullets out of the wall for purposes of the initial investigation , which is a common practice , the official said .
In March , the International Security Assistance Force released a statement denying a report by a British newspaper that NATO had covered up the involvement of troops in the incident .
U.S. officials continue to deny that there was any coverup of U.S. involvement .
" We have no evidence to date anything improper was done , " the senior U.S. official said .
At the time of the February 12 incident , NATO said its troops went to a compound in the village of Khatabeh in Paktia province , believing it to be a militant hideout .
A firefight ensued , and several insurgents died , NATO said at the time .
When soldiers entered the compound , they found the bodies of two men and two women who had been shot " execution - style , " a senior U.S. military official said then .
" It has the earmarks of a traditional honor killing , " the official said , adding that the women were found bound and gagged .
An honor killing is a slaying carried out by a family or community member against someone thought to have brought dishonor to them .
The senior U.S. military official said that at the time , it was n't clear whether dishonor in the case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperation with NATO forces .
But on Sunday , NATO made an about - face from its earlier claims .
" International forces were responsible for the deaths of three women who were in the same compound where two men were killed by the joint Afghan - international patrol searching for a Taliban insurgent , " NATO said in a statement .
There was no explanation given for the cause of the third woman 's death or why it was n't mentioned previously .
The two armed men whom troops killed were not insurgents , NATO said Sunday .
" The force went to the compound based on reliable information in search of a Taliban insurgent and believed that the two men posed a threat to their personal safety , " the NATO statement said .
" We now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families . "
NATO said a lack of forensic evidence made it difficult to determine how or when the three women died .
But it concluded that they were killed when troops fired at the men .
As for the initial report about the women being found bound and gagged , the NATO statement said it stemmed from a cultural misunderstanding .
" The statement noted the women had been bound and gagged , but this information was taken from an initial report by the international members of the joint force who were not familiar with Islamic burial customs , " the statement said , without elaborating .
NATO troops who went to the scene after the raid may have misinterpreted burial rites .
Muslims wrap their dead in clean white cloth before they are placed in the ground .
NATO said it will apologize to the victims ' family members and offer compensation in accordance with local customs .
The NATO admission follows the fatal shooting of five Afghan soldiers by troops in a friendly fire incident in northern Afghanistan on Friday .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has strongly criticized civilian deaths by international troops , and the deaths have bred resentment among many Afghans .
The numbers have fallen off in recent months since McChrystal took over as U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
" It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties , " McChrystal said in December .
" We can always target enemy leaders later .
We can't make up for the fact that we killed civilians . "

A while ago I had to deal with a broken exhaust manifold stud .
To say it was annoying is to seriously understate my feeling on the matter .
Rather than dwell in my own misery , I decided to come up with a do - it - yourself solution so some poor sap in the future may have an easier time than I did .
I spent about 6 weeks thinking about the solution that did not entail me removing the head , plunking down my $ 75 at the machine shop , and another $ 100 for all the gaskets to put the head back on .
So without further adue , my tutorial on how to fix a exhaust manifold stud disaster .
This post is about removing a stud without damaging your aluminum cylinder head .
Some may say it ca n’t be done with the head on the car , and in some cases , that may be correct .
However , I plan to show how to remove a broken exhaust ( or intake manifold ) stud without a trip to the machine shop and the cost of a new head gasket and headache and all that .
First , a parts list :
Electric or pneumatic drill
90 degree angle adapter for the drill , if necessary
1x 5/32 cobalt drill bit , Cobalt is the metal it is made of , not the brand .
1x internal pin-type concrete anchor , AKA concrete “ Strike Anchor ”
a bench grinder or other heavy duty metal grinder .
1x 5/32 square tapered screw extractor
small hammer
crescent wrench
First of all , some notes about the parts list .
You must have something to drill with , so obviously an electric or pneumatic drill is a necessity .
Unfortunately , most electric drills will not fit , so you will need to buy a right angle adapter for the electric drill , pictured below .
You may also be able to substitute a 90 degree angle die grinder if you can find cobalt metal bits that fit it , but in my experience , that is a chore .
Second , the drill bit is of the utmost importance .
Do n’t even bother with the wood / metal / all purpose drill bits , because they are just a waste of time .
You want to buy a drill bit that is made of cobalt metal , i.e. the chemistry element cobalt .
This is the most critical part you should buy .
Without this bit , it wo n’t happen .
I spent 5 hours , first with an “ all purpose ” wood / metal bit , then went to a “ titanium coated ” bit , then a carbide bit , all of which did n’t do the job in any way , shape , or form .
After 3 trips to the store , only a call to my master airline mechanic father - in - law , did I discover that Cobalt metal drill bits are the name of the game for things like this .
So seriously , do n’t even bother without one .
They are about $ 5 at sears .
Third , you need this particular style of “ Strike Anchor ” concrete anchor from whatever hardware store you can find :
Fourth , this method may not be possible without a bench grinder .
you may be able to get creative and use something else , but a bench grinder makes life really easy .
Finally , you are gonna need a cheap $ 3 screw extractor .
It is a square pin with serrations that bite when turned counter - clockwise .
Procedure :
Our first objective is to make a metal sleeve for the drill bit to force the bit to the center of the stud .
This is to ensure that the drill bit goes through the stud and not your cylinder head .
To do this , you need to take the concrete anchor described above , and remove the pin from the center of it , as well as the nut that may or may not be on it .
Then , using a bench grinder , or alternatively , a hack saw , cut the anchor in half .
We just need the top side of the anchor with the threads on it , the bottom side can be discarded .
Next , you need to grind down the outer shell of the anchor until it fits snuggly into the hole of the exhaust manifold .
If you have your exhaust manifold off , now would be a good time to attach it with as many studs as possible that are still intact .
This step is necessary , because without the exhaust manifold attached , the sleeve we made for the drill bit can not be used .
Below is an example of the sleeve , as well as how we plan to use it :
Next , if you have enough clearance to insert the drill bit into the bit guide we made from the anchor without the bit guide and the bit having to be put on at the same time ( test it out ) then lightly tap the drill bit guide into the exhaust manifold hole where the stud used to go .
If there is not enough clearance to insert the drill bit guide and then the drill bit separately , then simply put the sleeve over the bit and insert both at the same time , being sure that the drill bit guide is a snug fit into the exhaust manifold stud hole .
Now , as long as you are confident that the drill bit guide you made snuggly fits the exhaust manifold stud hole , then this is the moment of truth .
With your 90 degree angle adapter for your drill attached , and the cobalt metal drill bit , with the drill bit guide over the drill bit , make sure once again that the sleeve is inserted snugly into the EM .
If all of those things check
out , then start drilling a tiny test hole to verify the drill bit angle .
If the first pilot hole is successful , then set up the rig again and drill a hole through the stud .
This should take no more than about 45 seconds of drilling to get through the stud .
You should feel the drill bit sink in really fast ( since you are using the cobalt drill bit .. ) , which will then be your indication that you are through the stud .
At this point , keep the drill rotating in the clockwise ( drilling in ) direction and slowly remove the bit , as this will ensure that the bit does not break in the stud , and also evacuate most of the shavings created going through the stud .
Congratulations , you now have a relatively straight hole through the stud , thanks to the sleeve you constructed .
Now , remove the sleeve and use the screw extractor and the hammer to lightly tap the screw extractor into the hole we made in the stud .
Once it is securely in the stud , use a crescent wrench to wind the screw extractor in the counter - clockwise direction .
This is not the time for power tools , because we do n’t want the screw extractor breaking inside the stud .
If you did everything correct , then the broken stud should start to wind its way out .
If you suspect the stud might be rusted in or something , before using the screw extractor , spray some wd - 40 or rust eater or other penetrating oil into the hole and then come back the next day to do the screw extractor step .
If all goes well , you should have something that looks like this :
You will notice that in the image above , I managed to drill a nearly perfectly straight hole through the broken portion of the stud , thanks to the sleeve I constructed from the upper portion of the concrete anchor .
I did n’t even knick the cylinder head threads at all , and the new stud went in like nothing happened .
This method works only on studs that have broken off inside the head , with no portion exposed to the outside .
Good luck !

An Oregon teacher who announced his intention to " dismantle and demolish the Tea Party " has been placed on administrative leave until his school district finishes its investigation into whether his political activity crossed the line .
The state 's Teacher Standards & Practices Commission is also conducting an investigation into Jason Levin , a media teacher at Conestoga Middle School in Beaverton .
" Jason is on paid administrative leave , " Maureen Wheeler , the school district 's spokeswoman , told FoxNews.com .
She described the suspension as " standard practice during an internal investigation . "
Levin has come under fire for saying he'd do anything short of throwing rocks to bring down the Tea Party .
In the last two days , the Beaverton School District has received thousands of e-mails and phone calls from people across the country who said they were outraged at his behavior .
The school district is defending Levin 's right to free speech , but it 's investigating whether he used district computers to spread his political message or worked on his " Crash the Tea Party " Web site during school hours .
More On This ... Oregon Teacher Panel Probes Educator Determined to ‘ Demolish ’ Tea Party
Levin has said he would seek to embarrass Tea Partiers by attending their rallies dressed as Adolf Hitler , carrying signs bearing racist , sexist and anti-gay epithets and acting as offensively as possible -- anything short of throwing punches .
A source within the district said parents at Conestoga did not initially appear upset at Levin 's anti-Tea Party activism -- but that changed in recent days as controversial statements continued to emerge .
Now , the source said , parents have become outraged by the severity of his political activism , and many have told the school board members that it has no place in a public school system .
Parents supported teachers who wore Obama buttons during the 2008 presidential election , the source said .
But they say Levin has crossed the line .
Levin's
Web site has since been changed , and the calls to infiltrate the Tea Party have been removed .
The home page now simply reads : " Want to Show your support for Jason Levin ? BUY A TEA - SHIRT . "
In a recent interview with Talking Points Memo , Levin said of his plans , " Our goal is that whenever a Tea Partier says ' Barack Obama was not born in America , ' we 're going be right there next to them saying , ' Yeah , in fact he was n't born on Earth !
He 's an alien ! ' "
In a now deleted post on his " Crash the Tea Party " Web site , he called on his supporters to collect the Social Security numbers -- among other personal identifying information -- about as many Tea Party supporters as possible at the numerous rallies that took place on Thursday , Tax Day .
" Some other thoughts are to ask people at the rally to sign a petition renouncing socialism .
See just how much info you can get from these folks ( name address , DOB , Social Security # ) .
The more data we can mine from the Tea Partiers , the more mayhem we can cause with it !!!! " he wrote .
The state agency is investigating whether this is a hint at identity theft , and whether it is appropriate behavior for a public school teacher .
It also will investigate charges that Levin used school computers during school hours to work on his Web site .
Levin teaches 6th , 7th and 8th graders about computers and technology .
According to the school district laws regulating teacher conduct , which are posted online : " The Beavertown School District rules involving teacher use of the district 's electronic system clearly state :
The district 's electronic communications system shall be used for educational purposes consistent with the district 's mission , priorities and beliefs .
Educational purposes do not include commercial use , use for personal financial gain or political advocacy . "
The investigation will be assigned to a case agent who will compile a preliminary report that will be presented before the commission .
The commission members will then decide whether to charge Levin with misconduct or dismiss the case due to insufficient evidence , said Melody Hanson , the director of professional practices .
LONDON — For centuries , we have been told that without religion we are no more than egotistic animals fighting for our share , our only morality that of a pack of wolves ; only religion , it is said , can elevate us to a higher spiritual level .
Today , when religion is emerging as the wellspring of murderous violence around the world , assurances that Christian or Muslim or Hindu fundamentalists are only abusing and perverting the noble spiritual messages of their creeds ring increasingly hollow .
What about restoring the dignity of atheism , one of Europe 's greatest legacies and perhaps our only chance for peace ?
More than a century ago , in " The Brothers Karamazov " and other works , Dostoyevsky warned against the dangers of godless moral nihilism , arguing in essence that if God does n't exist , then everything is permitted .
The French philosopher André Glucksmann even applied Dostoyevsky 's critique of godless nihilism to 9/11 , as the title of his book , " Dostoyevsky in Manhattan , " suggests .
This argument could n't have been more wrong :
The lesson of today 's terrorism is that if God exists , then everything , including blowing up thousands of innocent bystanders , is permitted - at least to those who claim to act directly on behalf of God , since , clearly , a direct link to God justifies the violation of any merely human constraints and considerations .
In short , fundamentalists have become no different than the " godless " Stalinist Communists , to whom everything was permitted , since they perceived themselves as direct instruments of their divinity , the Historical Necessity of Progress Toward Communism .
Fundamentalists do what they perceive as good deeds in order to fulfill God 's will and to earn salvation ; atheists do them simply because it is the right thing to do .
Is this also not our most elementary experience of morality ?
When I do a good deed , I do so not with an eye toward gaining God 's favor ; I do it because if I did not , I could not look at myself in the mirror .
A moral deed is by definition its own reward .
David
Hume made this point poignantly when he wrote that the only way to show true respect for God is to act morally while ignoring God 's existence .
This YouTube video from a former Bank of America employee is a heartfelt tell - all on the credit card industry .
The credit card predatory practices have long been a problem .
Last spring , the Senate did pass legislation to restrict some of the worst practices .
The former BofA employee , Jackie Ramos , appeared on Jon Stewart ’s “ The Daily Show ” and her YouTube video has more than a quarter of a million views .
A couple weeks back , I did some digging and wrote a pretty lengthy piece on our current Jackets career stats .
Now that the franchise is getting older , we have a lot of players who have played their whole careers in Columbus .
This time , I want to look specifically at Columbus Blue Jacket franchise stats .
This will give you a pretty good idea of where the franchise has been on the scoresheet , and where its going .
Where do they stack up against the rest of their Jacket bretheren ?
Find out after the jump .
All - time CBJ Forward Records
Given the revolving door between Columbus and Syracuse I took our top 5 performing forwards from this past season to look at .
While three of these players have established their careers elsewhere , they have all put dents in the CBJ record book .
Player GP ( All - time rank ) G ( All - time rank ) A ( All - time rank ) P ( All - time rank ) PIM ( All - time rank ) PPG ( All - time rank ) SHG ( All - time rank ) SOG ( All - time rank ) Rick Nash 517 ( 2nd ) 227 ( 1st ) 195 ( 2nd ) 422 ( 1st ) 494 ( 3rd ) 71 ( 1st ) 12 ( 1st ) 1,667 ( 1st ) Antoine Vermette 99 ( 35th ) 34 ( 14th ) 44 ( T - 17th , M. Peca ) 78 ( 17th ) 40 ( 40th ) 7 ( T - 18th , D. Brassard ) 3 ( T - 4th , S. Fedorov , T. Wright , M. Sillinger ) 189 ( 27th ) Kristian Huselius 148 ( 21st ) 44 ( 10th ) 75 ( 8th ) 119 ( 8th ) 80 ( 23rd ) 13 ( T - 10th , T. Wright ) 1 ( T - 12th , 7 others ) 374 ( 12th ) RJ Umberger 164 ( 14th ) 49 ( 8th ) 52 ( 13th ) 101 ( 12th ) 93 ( 21st ) 17 ( T - 5th , M. Sillinger ) 1 ( T - 12th , 7 others ) 455 ( 8th ) Jakub Voracek 161 ( 15th ) 25 ( T - 19th , T. Letowski ) 63 ( 12th ) 88 ( 14th ) 70 ( 28th ) 4 ( T - 26th , J. Hrdina , T. Marchant ) 0 255 ( 16th )
Breaking it down :
Clearly Rick Nash has been the superstar of this team for years - that wo n't change .
He only ranks second in GP and assists to David Vyborny .
Both of those records should be shattered this upcoming season .
For Antoine Vermette , being ranked 14th all - time in goals is n't too bad for a guy who has n't even played 2 full seasons in Columbus .
Its very likely that Jake and Vermette jump into the Top 10 in goals scored at the end of this year .
Umberger is probably the most consistent player on the roster .
He 'll continue to shoot up the charts and be one of the all - time CBJ greats .
Juice can join Rick Nash and David Vyborny in the Top 3 in the assists category with 31 more .
All - time CBJ Defensemen Records
Top 3 defensemen of 2009 - 10
Player GP ( All - time rank ) G ( All - time rank ) A ( All - time rank ) P ( All - time rank ) PIM ( All - time rank ) PPG ( All - time rank ) SHG ( All - time rank ) SOG ( All - time rank ) Anton Stralman 73 ( 24th ) 6 ( T - 15th , J. Hejda , M. Methot , M. Timander ) 28 ( T - 11th , M. Commodore , L. Odelein ) 34 ( 13th ) 37 ( 27th ) 4 ( T - 9th , D. Westcott , A. Foote ) 0 121 ( 18th ) Fedor Tyutin 162 ( 9th ) 15 ( 4th ) 51 ( 4th ) 66 ( 4th ) 130 ( 13th ) 8 ( T - 4th , R. Klesla , J.

Looking at the franchise 's history of defensemen , its easy to tell why we 've been stricken with the bad luck we have .
Our defensive corps have never been anything to be feared .
Rusty Klesla leads almost every major category , and could go down as one of the top producing D-men .
As much as you may dispise him and his turnover ways , Fedor Tyutin is one of our best guys .
He 'll be worth keeping around in the long run .
Look for him to be 2nd or 3rd all - time in goals by seasons end .
Anton Stralman - I 'm really on the fence with him .
He put up solid numbers in his first year , but I question his toughness in a division we need need that .
He 'll be one we remember years from now , but not significantly .
Kris Russell will really stand out as a top franchise defenseman .
Like , Tyutin , he 'll be one of our top scoring defensemen after this year .
It 'll be a fight to see who ends up 2 and 3 behind Klesla .
All - time CBJ Goalie Records
The man , the myth , the soon to be legend , Steve Mason

His rookie season alone has told us what we need to know about Mase .
He will be the best goaltender the CBJ will ever have .
It will still take him 2 - 3 more seasons to jump ahead of Marc Denis in games played , shots against , saves , and time on ice .
He will challenge Denis for wins this year .
His 10 shutouts in his first year were enough for 2nd all - time .
Need I say more ?
This kid is special .
Lets hope for a huge bounce back this year .

On his Fox News program tonight , host Bill O’Reilly , and guest Bernie Goldberg continued Fox News ’ feud with The Daily Show host Jon Stewart by calling Stewart the point man for the left wing media in America .
Bill - O said , “ I believe that Jon Stewart has now emerged as the point man for the left wing media in America . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

Bill O’Reilly said , “ We ’re taking this not so seriously , but it is a serious issue because I believe Jon Stewart has now emerged as the point man for the left wing media in America .
With the decline of The New York Times and other liberal news papers , he is now the face of the left on television . ”
Bernie Goldberg both claimed victory and cried uncle , “ Let me first say that I do n’t have a problem with anything he did last night , all in bounds , all civil you know , no problem .
I ’m flattered as a matter of fact that he spent half his show talking about me .
Clearly I got to him by saying that he was n’t as gutsy as he thought he was , or courageous .
He played it safe too often , had a small audience and all that , but fine , I ’m not looking to continue any war with Jon Stewart .
I ’ve been on his show twice , and he was civil to me both times , but as to your question , he has a lot of influence , he does n’t have a big audience , but he has a lot of influence with young viewers who are very , very loyal to him . ”
Goldberg than called Stewart fans sewer dwellers , “ My website …it ’s a civil place .
People agree with me , disagree with me , it ’s always civil though until last night .
These people came out of the sewer that is the World Wide Web , and put the most vile , vulgar hateful stuff on mimicking stuff that Jon Stewart said about go F yourself , and I can handle that , but I do n’t think , I do n’t want to get too high fallootin here , but I do n’t think it ’s good for the culture when people get that angry . ”
In case you missed it , on Tuesday ’s The Daily Show , Jon Stewart called out both Bernie Goldberg and Fox News for their hypocrisy on the issue of balanced coverage .
Fox News , Bill O’Reilly and Bernie Goldberg want us to believe that Jon Stewart has a tiny audience of sewer dwellers who rose up to create havoc on Goldberg ’s website by telling him to go f**k himself , but this in itself is a contradiction .
If Stewart ’s audience , and by extension Goldberg , O’Reilly , Fox News are also generalizing about the left , is so small , then why is Bernie Goldberg whining ?
The truth is that Stewart ’s audience is n’t that small , and Goldberg is lying to make the right wing look bigger .
The obvious irony that Bernie Goldberg and Fox News are lecturing anyone about inciting anger , when Fox News is the anger inciting / propaganda arm of the GOP , is delicious .
O’Reilly and Goldberg managed to ignore Stewart ’s point that Fox News is a terrible news organization that can’t even follow its own slogan of Fair and Balanced .
Bernie Goldberg claimed that he got to Stewart all the while making it clear that he wanted no part of another beat down at the hands of The Daily Show host .
The reality is that Fox is jealous of The Daily Show because FNC skews demographically old , and Stewart has huge ratings among the 18 - 35 crowd .
This is an audience that Fox News would love to have but ca n’t capture .
Stewart is dangerous to Fox News because he is educating young people about Fox ’s misinformation disguised as news .
Every viewer that Stewart educates is another future viewer lost for Fox News .
This is the real reason why Fox News hates Jon Stewart .

The sexual and physical abuse of children and young people is a global plague ; its manifestations run the gamut from fondling by teachers to rape by uncles to kidnapping - and - sex - trafficking .
In the United States alone , there are reportedly some 39 million victims of childhood sexual abuse .
Forty to sixty percent were abused by family members , including stepfathers and live - in boyfriends of a childs mother ” thus suggesting that abused children are the principal victims of the sexual revolution , the breakdown of marriage , and the hook - up culture .
Hofstra University professor Charol Shakeshaft reports that 6 - 10 percent of public school students have been molested in recent years ” some 290,000 between 1991 and 2000 .
According to other recent studies , 2 percent of sex abuse offenders were Catholic priests ” a phenomenon that spiked between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s but seems to have virtually disappeared ( six credible cases of clerical sexual abuse in 2009 were reported in the U.S. bishops  annual audit , in a Church of some 65,000,000 members ) .
Yet in a pattern exemplifying the dogs behavior in Proverbs 26:11 , the sexual abuse story in the global media is almost entirely a Catholic story , in which the Catholic Church is portrayed as the epicenter of the sexual abuse of the young , with hints of an ecclesiastical criminal conspiracy involving sexual predators whose predations continue today .
That the vast majority of the abuse cases in the United States took place decades ago is of no consequence to this story line .
For the narrative that has been constructed is often less about the protection of the young ( for whom the Catholic Church is , by empirical measure , the safest environment for young people in America today ) than it is about taking the Church down ” and , eventually , out , both financially and as a credible voice in the public debate over public policy .
For if the Church is a global criminal conspiracy of sexual abusers and their protectors , then the Catholic Church has no claim to a place at the table of public moral argument .
The Church itself is in some measure responsible for this .
Reprehensible patterns of clerical sexual abuse and misgovernance by the Churchs bishops came to glaring light in the U.S. in 2002 ; worse patterns of corruption have been recently revealed in Ireland .
Clericalism , cowardice , fideism about psychotherapys ability to fix sexual predators ” all played their roles in the recycling of abusers into ministry and in the failure of bishops to come to grips with a massive breakdown of conviction and discipline in the post - Vatican II years .
For the Churchs sexual abuse crisis has always been that : a crisis of fidelity .
Priests who live the noble promises of their ordination are not sexual abusers ; bishops who take their custody of the Lords flock seriously , protect the young and recognize that a mans acts can so disfigure his priesthood that he must be removed from public ministry or from the clerical state .
That the Catholic Church was slow to recognize the scandal of sexual abuse within the household of faith , and the failures of governance that led to the scandal being horribly mishandled , has been frankly admitted ” by the bishops of the United States in 2002 , and by Pope Benedict XVI in his recent letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland .
In recent years , though , no other similarly situated institution has been so transparent about its failures , and none has done as much to clean house .
It took too long to get there , to be sure ; but we are there .
These facts have not sunk in , however , for either the attentive public or the mass public .
They do not fit the conventional story line .
Moreover , they impede the advance of the larger agenda that some are clearly pursuing in these controversies .
For the crisis of sexual abuse and episcopal malfeasance has been seized upon by the Churchs enemies to cripple it , morally and financially , and to cripple its leaders .
That was the subtext in Boston in 2002 ( where the effort was aided by Catholics who want to turn Catholicism into high - church Congregationalism , preferably with themselves in charge ) .
And that is what has happened in recent weeks , as a global media attack has swirled around Pope Benedict XVI , following the revelation of odious abuse cases throughout Europe .
In his native Germany , Der Spiegel has called for the popes resignation ; similar cries for papal blood have been raised in Ireland , a once - Catholic country now home to the most aggressively secularist press in Europe .
But it was the New York Times  front page of March 25 that demonstrated just how low those determined to bring the Church down were prepared to go .
Rembert Weakland is the emeritus archbishop of Milwaukee , notorious for having paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to satisfy the demands of his former male lover .
Jeff Anderson is a Minnesota - based attorney who has made a substantial amount of money out of sex abuse  settlements ,  and who is party to ongoing litigation intended to bring the resources of the Vatican within the reach of contingency - fee lawyers in the United States .
Yet these two utterly implausible ” and , in any serious journalistic sense , disqualified ” sources were those the Times cited in a story claiming that , as cardinal prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [ CDF ] , Joseph Ratzinger , later Benedict XVI , had prevented sanctions against Father Lawrence Murphy , a diabolical Milwaukee priest who , decades before , had abused some 200 deaf children in his pastoral care .
This was simply not true , as the legal papers from the Murphy case the Times provided on its
Web site demonstrated ( see here for a demolition of the Times  case based on the documentary evidence it made available ) .
The facts , alas , seem to be of little interest to those whose primary concern is to nail down the narrative of global Catholic criminality , centered in the Vatican .
The Times  descent into tabloid sourcing and innuendo was even more offensive because of recent hard news developments that underscore Pope Benedicts determination to root out what he once described as the filth in the Church .
There was , for example , the popes March 20 letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland , which was unsparing in its condemnation of clerical sexual offenders (  . . . you betrayed the trust that was placed in you by innocent young people and their parents and you must answer for it before Almighty God and before properly constituted tribunals ) and unprecedented in its critique of malfeasant bishops ( grave errors of judgment were made and failures of leadership occurred . . . [ which have ] undermined your credibility and effectiveness ) .
Moreover , the pope mandated an Apostolic Visitation of Irish dioceses , seminaries , and religious congregations ” a clear indication that dramatic leadership change in Ireland is coming .
In framing his letter to Ireland so vigorously , Benedict XVI succeeded in overcoming the institutional Vatican preference for the subjunctive in dealing with situations like this , and the pleas of Irish bishops that he cut them some slack , given the intense pressures they were under at home .
That the pope rejected both curial and Irish opposition to his lowering the boom ought to have made clear that Benedict XVI is determined to deal with the problem of sexual abuse and episcopal misgovernance in the strongest terms .
But for those obsessing over whether a pope had finally apologized  for something ( as if John Paul II had not spent a decade and a half cleansing the Churchs historical conscience ,  as he put it ) , these unmistakable signals were lost .
Then there was the March 25 letter from the leadership of the Legionaries of Christ to Legionary priests and seminarians and the Legion - affiliated movement , Regnum Christi .
The letter disavowed the Legions founder , Father Marcial Maciel , as a model for the future , in light of revelations that Maciel had deceived popes , bishops , laity , and his brother Legionaries by living a duplicitous double life that included fathering several children , sexually abusing seminarians , violating the sacrament of penance , and misappropriating funds .
It was Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger who , as prefect CDF , was determined to discover the truth about Maciel ; it was Pope Benedict XVI who put Maciel under virtual ecclesiastical house arrest during his last years , and who then ordered an Apostolic Visitation of the Legion of Christ that is currently being concluded : hardly the acts of a man at the center of a conspiracy of silence and cover-up .
While the Vatican has been far quicker in its recent response to irresponsible media reports and attacks , it could still do better .
A documented chronology how the archdiocese of Munich - Freising handled the case of an abusing priest who had been brought to Munich for therapy while Ratzinger was archbishop would help buttress the flat denials , by both the Vatican and the archdiocese , that Ratzinger knowingly reassigned a known abuser to pastoral work ” another charge on which the Times and others have been chewing .
More and clearer explanations of how the canonical procedures put into place at CDF several years ago have accelerated , not impeded , the Churchs disciplining of abusive clergy would also be useful .
So , of course , would elementary fairness from the global media .
That seems unlikely to come from those reporters and editors at the New York Times who have abandoned any pretence of maintaining journalistic standards .
But it ought not be beyond the capacity of other media outlets to understand that much of the Times  recent reporting on the Church has been gravely distorted , and to treat it accordingly .
George Weigel , Distinguished Senior Fellow of Washingtons Ethics and Public Policy Center , is the author of The Courage To Be Catholic : Crisis , Reform , and the Future of the Church ( Basic Books ) .
Petroleum was formed by the compression and heating of biomass over millennia .
Chemical engineers at the University of Michigan hope to do it in minutes .
They are applying heat and pressure on microalgae , exploring a method to create affordable biofuel that could replace fossil fuels .
They also hope to use the byproducts of bio-oil production as feedstock for more biofuel .
" The vision is that nothing would leave the refinery except oil .
Everything would get reused , " chemical engineering professor Phillip Savage said in a statement .
" That 's one of the things that makes this project novel .
It 's an integrated process .
We 're combining hydrothermal , catalytic and biological approaches . "
Savage and his team , funded by a $ 2 million National Science Foundation grant , are n't the only ones trying to make bio-petroleum .
California startup Sapphire Energy says it could produce 1 billion gallons of algal fuel annually by 2025 .
Blue Marble Energy creates fuel using algae found in polluted waters .
Chevron has joined San Francisco company Solazyme in developing algal jet fuel .
" This research could play a major role in the nation 's transition toward energy independence and reduced carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector , " Savage said .
Maybe .
Maybe not .
Such fuels are attractive because they are direct replacements for petroleum and compatible with existing infrastructure .
Proponents argue such fuels are carbon neutral because the emissions created by burning them are offset by the CO2 absorbed by the algae as it grows .
Although algal biofuels are feasible , there is some concern about the quality of the refined product and its performance in cold temperatures , said Spencer Quong , an automotive engineer and alt - fuels expert with Quong and Associates .
There also are questions about the carbon - reduction benefits because obviously it requires energy to produce and process the fuel .
" Just like when you are using a pressure cooker at home , their algae pressure cooker needs to be heated and if they are using electricity or natural gas to heat the system there will be carbon emissions that lead to climate change , " said David Friedman , research director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
Microalgae are , as the name suggests , microscopic algae .
They break down more easily than other biofuel feedstocks because their cell walls are n't as tough .
Algal fuel typically requires cultivating specific species of algae , drying it and extracting its oil .
The method Savage and his colleagues are exploring uses less oily types of algae and eliminates the need to dry the algae .
That simplifies the process and clears big hurdles to commercial scale production of algal fuels .
" We make an algae soup , " Savage said .
" We heat it to about 300 degrees and keep the water at high enough pressure to keep it liquid as opposed to steam .
We cook it for 30 minutes to an hour and we get a crude bio-oil . "
Using high temperatures and pressure lets the algae react with water and break down , releasing the native oil .
Proteins and carbohydrates within the algae also decompose , increasing the fuel yield .
" We 're trying to do what nature does when it creates oil , but we do n't want to wait millions of years , " Savage said .
" The hard part is taking the tar that comes out of the pressure cooker and turning it into something you could put in your car , changing the properties so it can flow more easily , and doing it in a way that 's affordable . "
With that in mind , Savage and his colleagues are looking at using catalysts to increase the energy density of the algal fuel .
They also hope to reduce its viscosity and cut its sulfur and nitrogen content .
The researchers clearly have a lot more work to do , and there many unanswered questions about algal fuels .
Can it be produced affordably ?
Can it be made fast enough , and with minimal environmental impact ?
" Until projects like this move out of the lab and into early production , it will be hard to know how realistic their claims are , " Friedman said .
" That is why we need to keep supporting projects like this over the long term .
We need cleaner , domestically produced fuels , but we should not expect miracles overnight .
Developing technologies like this take time and money . "

Original ad :
Need your lawn mowed ?
I own a Ride - on mower and offer professional mowing for an affordable price .
Price is generally $ 30 per hour based on services .
I offer discounts for larger plots of land .
E-mail or call me to discuss .
***************@gmail.com
( 302 ) -***-****
From Me to ***************@gmail.com :
Hey ,
My yard is 5 acres and I would like to work out some kind of regular mowing schedule .
How much will you charge for five acres ?
Do you come weekly ?
Please let me know .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Rob ***** to Me :
Hey Mike .
Where do you live ?
Yes , I come weekly .
I charge by the hour , but a rough estimate would be around $ 45 depending on if you want me to do trimming as well .
From Me to Rob *****:
Sounds good Rob .
I 'm located off of Naaman 's road , near the 202 intersection .
I would like you to trim around my sidewalk and patio , so I guess you should factor that into the price .
I just need you to sign a waiver before you mow my lawn for the first time .
Let me know when you would be able to do this .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Rob ***** to Me :
Why do you need me to sign a waiver ?
From Me to Rob *****:
The last couple of dumbass landscapers I had working for me sued me for injuries that were their own fault .
I am just covering my ass so I do n't have to deal with these damn settlements anymore .
As long as you use common sense , the waiver wo n't even have to come into play .
From Rob ***** to Me :
Forgive me for asking but how were they injured ?
I find it peculiar that you have been sued by landscapers .
From Me to Rob *****:
Well , let me just say that I inherited this property from my grandfather when he passed away .
He was a war veteran and a little bit eccentric when it came to guns .
Long story short , he buried a bunch of land mines in his backyard .
I had no idea until the first idiot mowing my lawn ran over one and it exploded .
He lost his right leg and then sued me like a little whining baby , claiming it was my fault .
The waiver pretty much says you wo n't sue me if you hurt yourself by detonating a mine .
From Rob ***** to Me :
Why would anyone in their right mind agree to that ?
He had every right to sue you .
There is no reason for land mines in Delaware .
From Me to Rob *****:
Like I said , just use common sense and do n't run over the mines .
They are Valmara 69 mines , so you can see a bunch of little prongs poking out of the ground .
Just drive your lawn mower around any if you see them .
There might not even be any left .
Some could even be duds - these are very old mines .
Just forget about the mines and sign the waiver .
I do n't work on Wednesday , we can meet then to sign the papers .
From Rob ***** to Me :
I will never agree to this .
Not in a million years .
I do n't know who you should call but it is definitely not a landscaper .
From Me to Rob *****:
You said you had a ride - on mower , right ?
These are anti-personnel mines , not anti-tank mines .
Meaning your mower can probably withstand the blast .
The mines were n't made to disable enemy German lawnmowers .
The jackass that blew his leg off was using a self - propelled mower .
How about this : you can just sign the waiver for personal injury .
I 'll cover the cost of repairs if the mine ends up damaging your mower .
From Rob ***** to Me :
I value my life , so no thanks .
If you ask me , I think you are the jackass for expecting anyone to mow your lawn given the circumstances .
From Me to Rob *****:
Apparently they just do n't make landscapers like they used to anymore .
I remember when landscaping was a real man 's job , and there was no lawn that could n't be mowed .
Now everyone is such a little bitch about everything .
" Waaaahhh !
I dont want my wittle wawn mower to bwow up ! "
Would you sue me if a bee stung you while you were mowing my lawn , or if you got mauled by fire ants ?
Do I have to go to court if you forget to wear a jacket and catch a cold while mowing my lawn ?
C'mon man , suck it up and do your job .
From Rob ***** to Me :
Dear Mike ,
Fuck you .

WASHINGTON : Hundreds of chronically ill residents of the US capital will be able to buy government - sanctioned marijuana by the end of the year under a measure unanimously approved by the District of Columbia Council .
Without debate , the council on Tuesday authorised five medical marijuana distribution centres throughout the city , a number that could grow to eight in coming years .
A patient who has HIV , glaucoma , cancer or a ' ' chronic and lasting disease ' ' will be able to receive a doctor 's recommendation to possess up to two ounces ( 56 grams ) of marijuana in a 30 - day period .
Medical marijuana ... legally grown in California .

Patients will not be allowed to grow marijuana but will be able to buy it from dispensaries licensed and regulated by the Department of Health .
Some may qualify to receive their drugs free or at reduced cost .
'' This legislation seeks to avoid problems while assuring the district moves forward with a medical marijuana program that is based on evidence and best practices , '' said David Catania , chairman of the council 's health committee .

We live by stories .
One could even argue that we are our stories .
Our stories connect past to future ; they relate our individual transient
experiences to larger themes of family , tribe , landscape , and cosmos .
Those who
survive the deepest horrors do so by means of a story that gives meaning to
their lives under the horrific circumstances they must endure .
Those who lose
their stories can lose the will to live .
Very little damages the human soul
more than a confused , broken , or lost story of meaning .
In the United States , our national story of meaning for the beginning of the
new millennium is broken , and this confused story has traumatized the nation
more deeply than any of the events the story relates .
We cannot understand what
happened — thus , we can not plan for the future .
This is our story : on September 11 , 2001 , our country was attacked , and a
pair of mythic icons in the New York City skyline fell ; we do n't know why ,
except that it was done by " terrorists " who " hate our
country " for reasons that we can't clearly articulate .
We went on a
vengeance hunt for the bad guy responsible for the attack — there 's a story we
all know and love .
But then we stopped looking for the bad guy and instead
invaded Iraq .
We do n't know why , but we were told it had something to do with
keeping a madman with weapons of mass destruction ( weapons that it turns out
everyone knew did n't really exist ) from vaporizing the United States ( which we
knew would n't happen ) , so that we could force his people at gunpoint to have
their own democratic elections .
The bad guy we were originally chasing got
away , but no one cares about that any more and , of course , we do n't know why .
There were no further terrorist attacks of any substance against the United
States ; we do n't know why .
In the five years between 2001 and 2006 , the US
government legalized torture of prisoners , indefinite imprisonment without
trial , warrant - less wiretaps , and a perpetual Condition Orange that means a
tube of toothpaste in my backpack on an airplane is a deadly threat to the
security of the country ; all this was done in the name of protecting our
" freedoms " as American citizens … .
Need I go on ?
The story we 've settled upon does n't make any sense .
None at all .
I have encountered a different story that I would like to share .
It is n't
satisfying — it is actually quite disturbing .
But it is at least coherent .
This story begins in the late 1940's , when a geologist named M. King Hubbert
started lecturing about " peak oil . "
He testified on the subject
before Congress in the early 1970's .
Hubbert 's tale is about the economics of
exploiting any non-renewable resource , be it oil , copper , or good quality
flints for spears .
In broad terms , production rises and prices drop : then
production drops and prices rise .
Somewhere in between , production reaches a
" peak " where availability is as high and prices are as low as they
will ever be .
After the peak , prices rise until the resource becomes too
expensive to use .
This arc of production is as inevitable as the trajectory of
a thrown stone .
There is no question whether this peak will occur for any given
non-renewable resource .
The only question is when .
Hubbert 's story predicted a production peak for petroleum some time in the
twenty - first century , and as worldwide consumption rose through the last half
of the twentieth century , the predicted peak moved earlier in time .
By 1990 , it
was clear that the peak would occur within the first two decades of the new
century .
In the absence of new sources of energy at least as cheap and
plentiful as oil , the consequences would be grim , according to this story .
Our
technological civilization would turn backward as cheap energy vanished —
depending on how the peak was managed , it might collapse completely .
The United
States , with its entire national infrastructure built around cheap oil , would
be especially vulnerable .
In 1990 , Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Kuwait .
He was driven out of Kuwait
during Iraq War I , and the war and subsequent economic sanctions damaged his
country so badly that it was unable to exploit its own oil fields for over a
decade .
As a result , Iraq now sits atop what are expected to be the last
producing oil fields of substantial size in the whole world .
Every other
untapped reserve is either small by comparison , or expensive to recover , or
both .
In early 2001 , Vice President Dick Cheney convened the National Energy
Policy Development Group ( NEPDG ) , composed of undisclosed participants ; in May
of 2001 , this group produced its final report .
Despite numerous lawsuits under
the Freedom of Information Act , former Vice President Cheney refuses to release
the contents of the report or the identities of the participants .
This report
certainly had something to say about peak oil , the dire consequences for
the US , and the existence and estimated quantity of the oil lying under Iraqi
soil .
I speculate that the report recommended that the US take control of the
Iraqi oil fields by force .
If that speculation is correct , the problem would have been how to start the
war .
The world was relatively quiet in early 2001 , the US economy — except for
the tech bubble collapse , which everyone seemed to view as an inexplicable
anomaly — seemed a final vindication of American Free Market Capitalism , and
the wave of the future was " globalization . "
To do something as
18th - century as invading another country for its resources would require — as
the Neoconservatives had been saying for at least a decade — that the United
States experience a " new Pearl Harbor , " a " Day of Infamy "
that would enrage the American public , unite a fractious Congress , and grant
the President nearly unlimited authority to make war .
In September , four months after the NEPDG report was completed , the World
Trade Center towers fell , the President proclaimed war on " terror "
with nearly unanimous Congressional support ( how much broader a charter could
one wish for ? ) , and the US invaded Iraq with no exit strategy .
In 2008 , we elected a new President who campaigned on a platform of getting
us out of Iraq .
You might remember that he went into office with the apparent
intent to pull all the troops out of Iraq by June of 2009 .
After his first 100
days , that plan was scuttled , and now the entire issue has vanished from the
news and the short - term memory of the American public .
The troops are still
there .
The fortified bases are still there .
The oil is still there .
So far this is n't a story , it is just a string of facts : Hubbert told a tale
about oil , Iraq did n't develop the oil the geologists believe is there , Cheney
convened a secret energy conference , the Twin Towers fell , the US invaded Iraq ,
Obama reneged on his promise to get us out of Iraq .
Let me turn these facts into a story .
In early 2001 , President George W. Bush and Vice - President Richard Cheney ,
both oilmen hailing from families deeply involved in oil for decades , decided
to act on the conviction that the Hubbert Peak was real , imminent , and spelled
a terrible doom for the United States .
Many others in the US government
believed this , perhaps ever since the 1970's when Hubbert first told his story
to Congress .
Oil companies certainly believed it , and were planning their
business strategy around it .
Cheney initiated the NEPDG , which recommended that
the US take control of the oil fields in Iraq as a national strategic
imperative — partly to buy breathing room for the US as global oil prices
rose , but also to prevent the Iraqi oil , presumptively the last cheap oil in
the world , from falling under the control of nations hostile to the US .
The
war - planning necessarily included the attack on the World Trade Center ; some
such public incident was needed to provide the political impetus for war .
On
September 11 , the WTC attack occurred ( as planned ) , the President was given a
blank check to pursue " terrorists " anywhere he wished ( as planned ) ,
and in March of 2003 the US invaded Iraq to establish control over Iraqi oil .
Mission Accomplished .
I wo n't say this story is true .
I do n't know if it 's true .
What I do know is
that it makes a whole lot more sense than the muddled " terrorist "
story commonly accepted regarding the Twin Towers .
This story explains why Vice President Cheney classified the NEPDG report
Top Secret , and still refuses to release it .
This story explains why the US almost immediately abandoned the hunt for
Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan .
This story explains why we invaded and occupied Iraq .
This story explains why 9/11 was not the first in a wave of attacks against
the United States , but continues to stand as an isolated incident .
This story explains the haunted look on Bush 's face in one of his last
interviews in office , when he said , " Do n't let it fail .
Do n't let Iraq
fail . "
This story explains what former Bush administration officials meant when
they admitted without elaboration that the Iraq war was about oil .
This story explains why Obama reneged on Iraq once he took office , and why
the next president ( be it Palin , Putin , or Joe the Plumber ) , will keep us in
Iraq as well , regardless of what he or she promises the public .
This story may even explain the attempt from 2001 through 2006 to turn the
US into a surveillance state with a drastically weakened Bill of Rights .
It was
never about " terrorists " — it was about an unruly American public
facing an end to their way of life in the coming years .
Cheney , in particular ,
never hesitated to express his belief that democracy was too weak to stand in
the modern world — by which I believe he meant a world without cheap oil .
That
also explains why the exiting Cheney warned the incoming Obama that the new
president would thank him in the years to come for all of the power he and Bush
had concentrated in the executive branch .
Most importantly , this story explains how planning , executing , and covering
up the WTC attack could be viewed an act of American patriotism .
This is
of critical importance .
There has been discussion on this site and others regarding how the standard
explanation of the WTC collapse does n't add up .
I 've been interested in this
subject since late September of 2001 , to the extent that I built my own
( inconclusive ) conservation - of - momentum models for the then - popular
" pancake theory " of collapse .
Personally , I think controlled
demolition of the towers is the simplest , most parsimonious physical
explanation ; that 's what the collapse looks like in video clips , and it easily
matches the kinetic energy , momentum , pulverization , seismic , and thermal
profiles of the collapse and the aftermath .
It explains the presence of
unburned explosives in the ash that settled over NYC .
No one has ever said that
demolition was physically impossible .
But there 's a major problem with the demolition argument .
As a human story ,
it is not credible .
You can not go far down the demolition road without
realizing that the US government had to be involved in at least a massive cover - up
after the fact , and likely the planning and execution of the attack as well .
This is an obvious and unavoidable sticking point .
It is why President Bush
ordered the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
( NIST ) 9/11 study to not waste time on " crackpot " theories of
controlled demolition of the towers .
It is why the 9/11 dissidents are viewed
as " conspiracy nuts . "
Both 9/11 and the Iraq
War involved casts of thousands : top tactical and
strategic levels of all branches of the military , the CIA , the NSA , the FBI ,
FEMA , members of Congress , the governor of New York , the mayor of New York
City , the NYC police and fire departments , the engineers who performed on - site
investigation of the WTC ruins , the salvage companies who carted the rubble
away .
Only a very few would have known everything , of course , but a lot of
these people are very bright and they have a lot of information at their
fingertips : many of them are , after all , the people who advise the President .
If it 's so obvious to us out here that there was a government involvement and
cover - up , then these people would have known .
Yet they played along and
still have n't come out to the public .
Why ?
I can think of only two possible kinds of motivation that would sustain a
conspiracy on this scale .
One is religious fervor , which would not seem to
apply here .
The other is patriotism .
We can point to any number of large - scale conspiracies committed out of a
sense of patriotism .
The Manhattan Project comes immediately to mind .
Operation
Valkyrie in Hitler 's Germany .
The entire Cold War , on both sides .
Such major
conspiracies based on a sense of patriotism do exist , and the players usually
take their secrets to their graves .
Most of them sleep well at night , secure in
the belief they are serving the greater good .
If you want to make a credible argument for US government involvement in
9/11 , you need a patriotic reason : a simple and extremely powerful patriotic
reason , easily communicated , easily understood .
An argument something like ,
" If we do n't do this , tens of millions of Americans will die and the
United States government will collapse .
There will be nothing left of our
nation , our people , our way of life .
The American ideals will be gone forever .
Doing this is worth the loss of 10,000 American lives .
They are making a
heroic sacrifice for the survival of the nation .
And you are doing your duty
for your country . "
That , or something very much like it , has to be the argument , and it must be
believed .
This is , of course , exactly what the worst - case Peak Oil scenario promises
us .
Unlike global warming , there is no controversy about Peak Oil itself , only
a question of when it will occur and how harshly the economic consequences will
play out .
Most projections
I 've seen range from grim to catastrophic ,
especially for the United States .
I 'd like to make it clear that I do n't agree with this argument at all .
Destroying the Twin Towers while people were still in them was an atrocity .
Using terror to manipulate the public and Congress for five years was an
atrocity .
Committing atrocities is not patriotic .
I also do n't agree with the
worst - case Peak Oil scenarios .
We may have inertial - confinement fusion within
the next year or two , something I did n't expect to see in my lifetime .
Scientists are learning how chlorophyll uses quantum interference to approach
ninety - percent efficiency in conversion of solar energy .
As oil prices rise ,
all kinds of strange technology will come out of the woodwork .
I do n't think
Peak
Oil will play out anything like what experts predict , other than the
general prediction that we wo n't be burning oil in another century .
That much
seems certain : it does not require a diminished society , however .
But none of this is about what I believe .
It is about what Bush , Cheney ,
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz believed in 2001 .
It is about what their advisers
believed .
It is about the real national story that guided the actions of
the United States from 2001 through the present .
I do n't know the real story .
I do know that the muddled mess about terrorists
and toothpaste is not the real story .
I invite any of you who have better stories to share them .

Rock - hard feces and oddly bitten bones are helping to flesh out one of the biggest crocs of prehistory , researchers say .
As long as a stretch limo , Deinosuchus — " terrible crocodile " — likely prowled shallow waters and hunted dinosaurs its own size , the evidence suggests .
Last week paleontologists announced their conclusions after analyzing pieces of 79 - million - year - old fossilized dung , or coprolites , that appear to be the first known droppings from Deinosuchus­ .
The discoveries offer the newest insights into the lives of the giant crocs , which roamed much of what is now the United States and northern Mexico .
Sand and shell fragments in the droppings , found within the last few years near a Georgia stream , suggest the croc preferred estuaries , where , at least in the Georgia — home to a great concentration of Deinosuchus remains — it probably dined mostly on sea turtles , researchers say .
Despite the Georgia Deinosuchus­ 's relatively docile prey , " we 're pretty sure it was the apex predator in this region , " said Samantha Harrell , an undergraduate at Columbus State University in Georgia , who presented her research March 17 at a Geological Society of America meeting in Baltimore .
The team also found a fossilized shark tooth embedded in the outside of a coprolite .
But because the tooth bears no signs of having been digested , the team suspects a shark left the tooth behind when scavenging on Deinosuchus droppings .
( Related : " Fossil Feces Is Earliest Evidence of North American Humans . " )
What the researchers did n't find in the feces are bone or other bits of undigested animals .
" That 's actually good , " Harrell said , " because both modern and ancient crocs have digestive juices that eat up bone , horns , teeth , and just about everything else " — so the " empty " dung supports the idea that the feces are from a croc .
Crocs vs. Dinosaurs
Outside Georgia , Deinosuchus­ apparently took on slightly more challenging prey , according to older bite - mark evidence , which Columbus State paleontologist David R. Schwimmer presented alongside Harrell at the meeting .
Deinosuchus­ tooth impressions in the bones of their prey tell the tale of titanic battles in which the 29 - foot - long ( 9 - meter - long ) crocs took down dinosaurs their own size — including the T. rex relatives Appalachiosaurus montgomeriensis and Albertosaurus ( see picture above ) .
" One of the marks shows signs that the bone was healed , which means that the animal survived the bite , " Schwimmer said .
" That proves that at least this one specimen was obviously [ indicative of ] predation and not scavenging . "
Schwimmer first noticed strange , dimpled , egg - shaped indentations in Georgia sea turtle fossils .
Later he saw similar marks in dinosaur bones in Big Bend National Park in Texas and in the New Jersey State Museum .
" I realized these bites were from something with really powerful jaws and lots of teeth , " he said .
" And it was pretty obvious that this big , blunt - toothed croc was the source .
" There was nothing else I 've found that could create blunt bite marks like these . "
Uncouth Eater
Tooth marks , though , can show us only part of the picture , said Stephanie Drumheller , an expert on ancient crocodile bites .
" Modern crocodilians " — crocodiles , alligators , and related extinct forms — " are more than capable of swallowing smaller prey whole and disarticulating larger animals into bite - sized pieces , " leaving little evidence behind , said Drumheller , a Ph.D. candidate in geoscience at the University of Iowa .
" We can infer that a giant like Deinosuchus would be capable of even more destructive feeding behaviors . "
The bite - mark evidence that does exist , though , raises a question :
Why would a croc capable of taking down big , meaty dinosaurs waste its energy on turtles ?
In a word : location .
Modern crocs , which hunt a wide range of prey , eat whatever 's available in their areas .
The same factor may have determined whether < i> Deinosuchus < / i > individuals feasted largely on turtles or dinosaurs or other prey , Drumheller said .
Giant Crocs Not Built to Last ?
North America - born Deinosuchus also underscores that giant crocs arose at different places and times , said University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno , who discovered 110 - million - year - old Sarcosuchus imperator — aka SuperCroc — in Niger .
" In Deinosuchus , and independently in SuperCroc , we have two lineages , one older than the other , that [ prove ] crocodile bodies grew to a gargantuan size — to dinosaur size , " said Sereno , a National Geographic Society explorer - in - residence .
Deinosuchus , which lived just before the close of the Cretaceous period , is more closely related to modern croc lineages than SuperCroc — yet still faded to extinction .
What happened to these prehistoric leviathans ?
A fully grown giant male croc likely would have had to commandeer miles of river territory to regularly find enough prey sustain itself , Sereno explained .
So space constraints likely kept population numbers low — making the giant crocs vulnerable to extinction in tough times .
Gizmodo reports that Apple has sent out media invitations for a preview event scheduled for this Thursday , April 8th , to show off iPhone OS 4.0 .
The event is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM Pacific Time in the Town Hall on Apple 's Cupertino , California campus .
Reports of iPhone OS 4.0 features began to surface in January ahead of the iPad media event , but the software was not included in that presentation .
At the time , claims of new multi - touch gesture support , multitasking , and a user interface refresh were making the rounds .
Multitasking has been the focus of a number of subsequent reports , with a recent one noting that iPhone OS 4.0 will carry an implementation similar to that of Expos in Mac OS X .
Other rumored features include a unified inbox for multiple email accounts and the ability to place contacts directly on the home screen .
Evidence of iPhone OS 4.0 in testing appeared late last year , and the new operating system is presumed to be introduced alongside new iPhone hardware sometime in the June - July timeframe .
For students who want to dig deeper into the dharma and its relationship to culture , societal beliefs , and philosophic ideas , I offer this thought - provoking essay by Thanissaro Bhhikku entitled The Roots of Buddhist Romanticism .
Buddhist Romanticism ?
Is there any such thing ?
Well , decide for yourself after reading this article !
Because the article is somewhat long , I ’ll only include some excerpts here , and then give a link to the whole document , which you can download for your own study .
But please do n’t think this article is theoretical or merely about intellectual or philosophical ideas in some abstract way !
What Thanissaro Bhikkhu points out is that our societal beliefs and ingrained world - views can make a huge difference on not only what we are looking for in Buddhism , but in how we practice it .
Buddhist Romanticism is not the same as the Buddhism of the early teachings .
As he says :
“ When these two traditions are compared point ‐by ‐point , it ’s obvious that — from the perspective of early Buddhism — Romantic / humanistic psychology gives only a partial and limited view of the potentials of spiritual practice .
This means that Buddhist Romanticism , in translating the Dharma into Romantic principles , gives only a partial and limited view of what Buddhism has to offer . ”
If the thought that one ’s unexamined cultural assumptions might keeping one from seeing all that Buddhism has to offer intrigues you , then you might want to read the whole article .
To pique your curiosity further , here are some more excerpts :
“ Many Westerners , when new to Buddhism , are struck by the uncanny familiarity of what seem to be its central concepts : interconnectedness , wholeness , ego‐transcendence .
But what they may not realize is that the concepts sound familiar because they are familiar .
To a large extent , they come not from the Buddha ’s teachings but from the Dharma gate of Western psychology , through which the Buddha ’s words have been filtered .
They draw less from the root sources of the Dharma than from their own hidden roots in Western culture : the thought of the German Romantics .
The German Romantics may be dead and almost forgotten , but their ideas are still very much alive .
Their thought has survived because they were the first to tackle the problem of how it feels to grow up in a modern society .
Their analysis of the problem , together with their proposed solution , still rings true . ” ~
“ When psychology and psychotherapy developed as disciplines in the West , they absorbed many of the Romantics ’ ideas and broadcast them into the culture at large .
As a result , concepts such as integration of the personality , self - fulfillment , and interconnectedness , together with the healing powers of wholeness , spontaneity , playfulness , and fluidity have long been part of the air we breathe .
So has the idea that religion is primarily a quest for a feeling ‐ experience , and religious doctrines are a creative response to that experience . ”
Taken broadly , Romanticism and the Dharma view spiritual life in a similar light .
Both regard religion as a product of human activity , rather than divine intervention .
Both regard the essence of religion as experiential and pragmatic ; and its role as therapeutic , aimed at curing the diseases of the human mind .
But if you examine the historical roots of both traditions , you find that they disagree sharply not only on the nature of religious experience , but also on the nature of the mental diseases it can treat and on the nature of what it means to be cured .
~
“ These differences are n’t just historical curiosities .
They shape the presuppositions that meditators bring to the practice .
Even when fully present , the mind carries along its past presuppositions , using them to judge which experiences — if any — should be valued .
This is one of the implications of the Buddhist doctrine on karma .
As long as these presuppositions remain unexamined , they hold an unknown power .
So to break that power , we need to examine the roots of the Buddhist Romanticism — the Dharma as seen through the Romantic gate . ”
~
“ Traditional Dharma calls for renunciation and sacrifice , on the grounds that all interconnectedness is essentially unstable , and any happiness based on this instability is an invitation to suffering .
True happiness has to go beyond interdependence and interconnectedness to the unconditioned .
In response , the Romantic argument brands these teachings as dualistic : either inessential to the religious experience or inadequate expressions of it .
Thus , it concludes , they can safely be ignored .
In this way , the gate closes off radical areas of the Dharma designed to address levels of suffering remaining even when a sense of wholeness has been mastered . ”

One method cells use to modulate the level of a gene 's expression is chemically attaching a methyl group ( - CH3 ) to cytosine residues in the DNA of a gene or in the regulatory regions surrounding it .
Cytosine methylation has been correlated with diminished gene expression , but it has also been observed in actively transcribed genes .
Most of our data about cytosine methylation has come from only four species : humans , mice , one plant , and one fungus .
Thus , its global significance has been difficult to determine .
A recent study in Science Express aimed to reveal the evolutionary history of DNA methylation by analyzing it in seventeen eukaryotic genomes : five plants ( rice , two land plants , and two green algae ) ; seven animals ( puffer fish and six invertebrate species ) ; and five fungi .
The authors found that methylation within the body of a gene is conserved between plants and animals , but methylation of mobile genetic parasites called transposons is not .
Transposons are pieces of DNA that can jump around within a genome — wreaking havoc if they jump into the wrong spot and disrupt an important gene .
Transposons were methylated in the plants and puffer fish , which will inactivate them and keep them from jumping .
Transposons were not , however , methylated in the invertebrates .
The authors conclude that the methylation of transposons evolved independently in plants and vertebrates .
Transposons can interfere with the recombination that takes place between chromosomes during sexual reproduction ; as fungi and unicellular animals often reproduce asexually , it is not as useful for them to suppress transposons .
But methylation for the regulation of gene transcription was used far more widely , indicating that it is ancient .
It predates the divergence of plants and animals , which occurred roughly 1.6 billion years ago .
These researchers did not try to explain the methylation of actively transcribed genes that has been found in mammals , plants , and one fungus .
Apparently that story will have to wait for another day .

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been protesting loud and long about the Obama administration ’s plans to increase financial sector regulation to try to prevent future banking crises .
Dimon apparently believes that anything that may hurt financial firms ’ profits is just asking too much and should be ruled out .
The public does not agree .
The public by an overwhelming 77 - 15 margin said in an early March ABC poll that banks have not yet done enough to make amends for their role in the financial crisis .
The same poll asked the public whether banks and other financial institutions owe it to the country to help Americans struggling with the economy .
Once again , an overwhelming majority ( 69 - 26 ) said it is banks ’ responsibility to help out .
Dimon ’s pleas to let banks off the hook are therefore likely to fall on deaf ears .
Perhaps it ’s time for financial firms to acknowledge their responsibility for today ’s economic problems and finally do the right thing : support long - overdue regulation of their activities .

Archie Comics — one of culture 's most enduring portraits of wholesome Americana — is introducing a gay .
A gay male Archie character .
His name is Kevin Keller and he is blonde .
Now I know some of you fellow Archie aficionados might be saying , " But Richard , is n't Jughead kind of gay too ? "
And yes , you 'd be right .
Though the comics do sort of vacillate between a Forsyth P. Jones who is a rabid misogynist and a Jughead who is just sort of shy around girls , the Jughead Is Gay read is a respected one in certain Archie circles .
But this Kevin character is the real deal .
Like an actual homosexual who says it out loud .
Here is the summary from the press release :
Kevin will appear in September 's VERONICA # 202 , in a story called " Is n't it Bromantic ? "
Kevin Keller is the new hunk in town and Veronica just has to have him .
After Kevin defeats Jughead in a burger eating contest at Pop 's Chocklit Shoppe , she desperately latches onto him .
Mayhem and hilarity ensue as Kevin desperately attempts to let Veronica down easy and her flirtations only become increasingly persistent .
Good for them .

Would n't you like to see a host who really knows the topics take a shot at running ABC's THIS WEEK for once ?
ABC is using a former Bushie Matthew Dowd as a host this Sunday :
Matthew Dowd , who worked as chief strategist for the Bush - Cheney ’04 campaign , is getting a shot behind the anchor desk on ABC's “ This Week . "
Since news broke that George Stephanopoulos was heading to “ Good Morning America ” in December , the network has had five different fill - in hosts while deciding who ’ll get the job permanently : Jake Tapper , Terry Moran , Barbara Walters , Jonathan Karl and Elizabeth Vargas .
Still , Dowd — who has been an ABC political contributor since 2007 , and regular on the Sunday roundtable — will be the first non-journalist to have a chance asking the questions .
Dowd 's just scheduled for this week , as the network continues looking for a permanent host .
Pretty soon they 'll be trying out right - wing talk show hosts .
I think it 's time Stewart gets a shot to host the Sunday show .
Hey , he may not want to do it , but he 's not afraid to step into the political arena and duke it out , so why not give this one a try ?
I bet you 'll see somebody that would have a clear understanding of the issues and not be worried about protecting his Villager image with the rest of the Beltway elites .
It would be a ratings bonanza for ABC as well .
We want Jon Stewart to host ABC's THIS WEEK .
You can email ABC here .
Un curioso progetto personale piuttosto ben riuscito quello proposto dal blog " Linux on the iPhone " .
Già il nome dice tutto : obiettivo ?
Far girare software open source su terminali Apple iPhone .
L'obiettivo di cui vi parlo è il porting di Google Android OS su Apple iPhone 2G .
Ecco il video !
" Planetbeing " , l'autore dell ' ultimo post di " Linux on the iPhone " , un blog della famiglia BlogSpot , afferma di aver lavorato silenziosamente dietro le quinte per realizzare il suo scopo : effettuare il porting di Google Android su iPhone 2G .
Sicurezza e ironia alla base di tutto : " Dovrebbe essere abbastanza facile adattare il porting all 'iPhone 3G , mentre nel caso del 3Gs sarà necessario più lavoro .
Si spera che questo lavoro possa rendere Android una reale alternativa o un supplemento agli utenti iPhone .
Almeno potremo godere di Flash " .
La mancanza del supporto flash da parte di Android è un aspetto ultimamente piuttosto criticato , Adobe ne ha assicurato la disponibilità soltanto a partire dal prossimo semestre .
Tanti , davvero tanti i commenti al post : tutti contenti , sia gli user della Mela che del Droide .
C'è chi si è già reso disponibile ad elargire una donazione per supportare il progetto , in seguito all 'appello lanciato dall ' autore .
Nonostante l'autore parli di qualche bug , incompatibilità , errori ed instabilità dovuti al progetto ancora poco maturo , in molti sono interessati a fare da beta tester con il proprio iPhone 2G e hanno già richiesto al " software porter " maggiori guide , dettagli ed un videotutorial .
Dal medesimo link che ho riportato all ' inizio dell ' articolo è già possibile scaricare un archivio compresso ( dal peso di 42 MB circa ) contenente immagini di pre-build , sorgenti ed un " readme " .
Un tutorial a tutti gli effetti .
L'avvio del sistema avviene tramite un boot manager apposito che carica il kernel Linux ; dopo pochi secondi tra le stringhe relative al bootstrap compare l'icona del pinguino : la Mela è stata " violata " ...
Al termine del boot Android è pienamente utilizzabile ; logicamente il tutto non è totalmente stabile e fruibile .
A partire dal tocco ( è necessario trascinare il polpastrello sul display ) .
E ' comunque interessante notare come sia già stato possibile abilitare il modulo wifi e la navigazione internet su iPhone .
Anche il player musicale è utilizzabile , le casse riproducono tramite il lettore musicale Android la musica senza alcun problema .
Skype " works great " .
Curiosi di vedere in azione un sistema operativo open - source su un prodotto Apple ?
Un contrasto difficilmente immaginabile , ora reso realtà .
Ecco il video :
Update : I 've written a followup to this post , which you may also find interesting .
Facebook just launched a super - easy widget called " The Facebook Like Button " .
Website owners can add a simple iframe snippet to their html , enabling a nice " Like " button with a count of other people 's " Likes " and a list of faces of people if any of them are your friends .
The advantage of this new tool is that you do n't need any fancy coding .
Just fill up a simple wizard , and paste the embed code in , just like you do with Youtube , etc .
However , this simplicity has a cost : Users can be tricked into " Like " ing pages they 're not at .
For example , try pressing this " Like " button below :
This is what happened to my Facebook feed when I pressed it :
I used BritneySpears.com as an example here to be work / family - safe ; you 're free to come up with examples of other sites you would n't want on your Facebook profile ! :)
Important note : Removing the feed item from your newsfeed does not remove your like -- it stays in your profile .
You have to click the button again to remove the " Like " relationship .
This works because the iframe lets me set up any URL I want .
Due to the crossdomain browser security , the " Like Button " iframe really has no way to communicate with the website it's a part of .
Facebook " Connect " system solved this using a crossdomain proxy , which requires uploading a file , etc .
The new button trades off this security for convenience .
An argument in Facebook 's favor is that no self - respecting webmaster would want to deceive the visitor !
This is true , the motivation to deceive is n't very strong , but if I am an enterprising spammer , I can set up content farms posing as humble websites and use those " Like " buttons to sell , say Teeth Whitening formulas to my visitor 's friends .
Or , if I 'm a warez / pirated movie site , I 'm going to trick you with overlays , opacities and other spam tricks and sell your click on an " innocent " movie review page to a porn site , similar to what is done with Captchas .
I 'm going to call this new form of spam Newsfeed Spam .
This is scary because any victim to this is immediately going to become wary of using social networking buttons after the event ; and will even stay away from a " Share on Twitter " button because " bad things have happened in the past with these newfangled things " !
I do n't have a good solution to this problem ; this sort of spam would be hard to detect or enforce since Facebook does n't see the parent page .
• One weak solution is to use the iframe 's HTTP_REFERER to prohibit crossdomain Likes .
I 'm not sure how reliable this is ; it depends on the browser 's security policies .
• Yet another solution is to provide the user with information about the target of the Like .
e.g. it can be :
Shown in the initial text , i.e. " and 2,025 others like this " now becomes " and 2,025 others like " Britney Spears " ... "
The downside to this is that it can't be shown in the compact form of the button .
Shown upon clicking , i.e. " You just liked BritneySpears.com "
( my favorite ) Shown on mouseover the button expands to show the domain , " Click to Like britneyspears.com /.... "
This problem is an interesting mix of privacy and usability ; would love to see a good solution !
The Invention of Hugo Cabret will be the director 's first children 's film , and his first venture into stereoscopic technology
Martin Scorsese 's next film , his debut foray into the field of children 's cinema , will also be his first venture in 3D , Variety reports .
The Oscar - winning film - maker will employ the new technology on his previously announced adaptation of The Invention of Hugo Cabret , Brian Selznick 's bestselling children 's book .
Its story centres on a 12 - year - old boy who lives in the walls of a train station in 1930s Paris .
Scorsese 's decision reaffirms the idea that 3D technology is rapidly moving beyond its traditional use in big - budget , special - effects - laden blockbusters .
Earlier this week , Werner Herzog announced that he will shoot a 3D documentary about the Chauvet - Pont - d ' Arc cave , a site in southern France that contains the earliest known cave paintings , dating back at least 30,000 years .
Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley were last month reported to be in talks to join the cast of The Invention of Hugo Cabret .
Baron Cohen would play a station inspector , with Kingsley starring as French film - making legend George Méliès , director of A Trip to the Moon , who has a pivotal role in the story .
Young British actor Asa Butterfield ( The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas ) will play the title role , while Kick - Ass 's Chloe Moretz will star as an eccentric girl who runs a toy booth in the train station .
According to Variety , shooting will begin in London in June , with the aim of a December 2011 release .
Unless it is amended , the Food Safety Modernization
Act will regulate our local food sources out of business .
As written now , the legislation is a big gift to the industrial food producers , and a drastic blow against small farms .
So please take steps , ASAP , to tell your senators either to amend the bill or vote against it .
Here , below Gianni Ortiz 's prefatory note , is all you need to know to take immediate action .
MCM
From Gianni Ortiz :
Hi All ,
This bill will be a disaster for small farms unless Tester 's amendment is included , which does not cover everything -- HACCP , etc. -- but does cover scale appropriateness for many small farm products and sales .
If you have never taken action before , please show up for this piece of legislation .
It is on the floor and will come to a vote probablyas soon as next week , as soon as the ' financial reform ' bill is voted on .
Please pass this on to anyone whocares aboutreal food , small farms or the environment .
This has to be a very big noise and we can't do it without you .
If you have never contacted your senator ,
it only takes a moment - and such calls and faxes are actually counted and do make a difference , please so do both .
I have been remiss in these communications of late - my apologies - also for any cross postings - very , very , verybusy .
The irony is that I am working on an exchange program between France and our Hudson Valley farmers / artesianal producers and it will not happen if the French farmers and artesianal food producers will need to meet our USDA / FDA standards in order to bring their products into this country .
They simply refuse because they know that the flavor and specialness of their ' place ' will be wiped out with required sterilization / pasteurization / irradiation (? ) / industrial standardby the US in order to get their acclaimed , safe , regionalfoods into the country in order to sharetheir success stories with us .
Coaching and talking points below for those who are new or not - totally - comfortable with the process .
It is very easy to use the fax or email option .
If you are part of an organization please consider signing on to the letter and passing along - and thanks very much !
Best ,
Gianni
Hi all ,
The timing of the food safety bill is still unclear , but it seems pretty certainthat it will NOT be heard this week .
We faxed the updated letter ( with 103 signatories ) to the Senators on Thursday .
Given the additional time , we will continue collecting signatures , so please continue to reach out to other groups and networks that you know .
Thanks !

The bill is expected to come to the floor early next week , so we are in the final push .
1 ) Please send out an action alert to your members .
We need calls coming in to the Senators all over the country .
CREDO has an auto - fax : http://act.credoaction.com/campaign/organic_tester/
2 ) Make sure your Senators ' staff have seen the letter - please email it to them and follow up with a call to make sure they notice that your organization is listed .
3 ) Attached is a Q&A sheet put together by WORC and FARFA , in response to the questions we 've heard most often from staffers .
Feel free to share it with your Senators ' staff .
http://tester.senate.gov/Newsroom/pr_041410_foodsafety.cfm
Senator Tester has put out an excellent press release about the amendments :
Sample action alert :
The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a sweeping overhaul of the food safety laws very soon !
As it is currently written , the bill , S. 510 , will actually make our food less safe .
S. 510 will strengthen the forces that have led to the consolidation of our food supply in the hands of a few industrial food producers , while harming small producers who give consumers the choice to buy fresh , healthy , local foods .
Please contact your Senators NOW to urge them to amend or oppose the bill !
Contact information and talking points are below .
Congress needs to solve the real problems - the centralized food distribution system and imported foods - and not regulate our local food sources out of business .
S. 510 is a " one- size - fits - all " approach that will unnecessarily burden both farmers and small - scale food processors , ultimately depriving consumers of the choice to buy from producers they know and trust .
TAKE ACTION :
Call both of your Senators .
You can find their contact information at www.Senate.gov , or call the Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121 or toll - free at 877-210-5351 .
Ask to speak with the staffer who handles food safety issues .
Tell the staffer that you want the Senator to support Senator Tester 's amendments to S.510 .
If you get their voice mail instead of the staff , leave the following message :
" Hi , my name is _____ and I live in ______ .
I 'm very concerned that S.510 , the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act , imposes unfair and burdensome regulations on local food sources , which are very important to me .
I urge the Senator to support the Tester Amendments to exclude small facilities and direct marketing farms from the most burdensome provisions of the bill .
Please call me back at ____________ . "

TALKING POINTS
More than 100 organizations sent a letter to the Senators urging that they amend S.510 to exempt small - scale and local producers from the more burdensome provisions of the bill .
You can borrow talking points from the letter , posted at http://www.farmandranchfreedom.com/sites/farfa/files/Amend-S510-Apri l-15.pdf , or use the points below :
1. The major foodborne illness outbreaks and recalls have all been caused by the large , industrial food system .
Small , local food producers have not contributed to the highly publicized outbreaks .
Yet S. 510 subjects the small , local food system to the same , broad federal regulatory oversight that would apply to the industrial food system .
2.Increased regulations and record - keeping obligations could destroy small businesses that bring food to local communities .
In particular , the reliance on hazard analysis and risk - based preventative controls , a concept similar to " HACCP " , will harm small food producers .
HACCP has already proven to be an overwhelming burden for a significant number of small , regional meat processors across the country .
Applying a HACCP - type system to small , local foods processors could drive them out of business , reducing consumers ' options to buy fresh , local foods .
3.FDA does not belong on the farm .
S. 510 calls for FDA regulation of how farms grow and harvest produce .
Given the agency 's track record , it is likely that the regulations will discriminate against small , organic , and diversified farms .
The House version of the bill directs FDA to consider the impact of its rulemaking on small - scale and diversified farms , but there are no enforceable limits or protections for small diversified and organic farms from inappropriate and burdensome federal rules .
4. Food safety and security both come from a diversified , vibrant local food system .
Local foods give consumers the choice to buy from producers they know , creating a transparent , accountable food system without federal government oversight .
State and local laws , which are often size - specific rather than one - size - fits - all , are more appropriate for local food producers .
**************************
Support Fresh , Safe Local Food in the Food Safety Bill
Dear Senator :
The undersigned organizations represent consumers , small farmers and ranchers , and local food producers who have serious concerns over the pending food safety legislation , S.510 , the Food Safety Modernization Act .
We urge you to support amendments so as to improve food safety without unnecessarily burdening and handicapping small - scale , local food producers .
All of the well - publicized incidents of contamination in recent years - whether in spinach , peppers , or peanuts - occurred in industrialized food supply chains that span national and even international boundaries .
The food safety problems in this system can and should be addressed without harming the local food systems that provide an alternative for consumers .
The growing trend toward healthy , fresh , locally sourced vegetables , fruit , dairy , and value - added products * improves * food safety by providing the opportunity for consumers to know their farmers and processors , to choose products on the basis of that relationship , and to readily trace any problems should they occur .
Farmers and processors who sell directly to consumers and end users have a direct relationship with their customers that ensures quality , safety , transparency and accountability .
In addition , small - scale food producers are already regulated by local and state authorities , and the potential risk their products pose is inherently limited by their size .
For these farmers and processors , new federal requirements are unnecessary and would simply harm both the food producers and their consumers .
Although the Committee - passed bill includes some provisions for flexibility for small and diversified producers , S. 510 still would establish new hazardous analysis and risk - based preventive controls for all facilities and authorize FDA to dictate growing and harvesting practices for produce .
These requirements will impose significant expenses and burdens on individuals and small businesses .
Hazard Analysis and Risk - Based Preventive Controls
We therefore urge you to support Senator Tester 's amendment to exempt small , local processing facilities from the bill 's hazard analysis and risk - based preventive controls requirements and traceability requirements .
1 ) With respect to the hazard analysis and risk - based preventive controls , add the following new section to Section 103 :
(l) EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN FACILITIES -
This section shall not apply to a facility for a year if the average annual adjusted gross income of such facility for the previous three - year period was less than $ 500,000 .
2 ) With respect to traceability , add the following new section to Section 204 :
( f) EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN FACILITIES -
The traceback and recordkeeping requirements under this section shall not apply to a facility for a year if the adjusted gross income of such facility for the previous year was less than $ 500,000 .
FDA Produce Standards
We also request that you consider an amendment to exempt direct - marketing farms from the FDA produce standards .
With respect to the produce standards , add the following new section to Section 105 :
(g) EXEMPTION FOR DIRECT MARKET FARMS -
This section shall not apply to farms whose annual value of sales of food products directly to consumers , hotels , restaurants , or institutions exceeds the annual value of sales of food products to all other buyers .
Food safety is a priority for us all .
We share the concerns that have led to this bill and appreciate Congress 's commitment to addressing these problems .
Thank you for your consideration , and for your support of a safer , more sustainable food system and consumer access to healthy , local foods .

Sincerely ,
Apple could be planning to expand its voice command capabilities on the iPhone thanks to the pending acquisition of Siri , which makes an iPhone app that lets users perform
Web searches by voice command .
News that the company was acquired first appeared in an FTC premerger notification ( PDF ) and was confirmed by Silicon Alley Insider and others .
For those who have already played around with Google 's search app for the iPhone , Siri 's voice search capabilities will appear quite similar , but it goes further than just showing search results .
With the app running , users can speak what they 're looking for ( " What movies are playing nearby ? " or " Make a reservation at Francesca Forno for two people at 6 pm " ) .
The app will then determine what service you need — a basic list of search results , a Yelp review page , a reservation through OpenTable , etc. — and list out your options along with maps and other data .
If Apple chooses to integrate Siri 's technology into the iPhone OS , Google 's Voice Search app would be redundant for many users — after all , if the OS can do it , why bother downloading an extra app that does less ?
That 's probably the point .
Considering that Apple may still have a Google Maps replacement in the wings , it certainly seems as if the company is making more of an effort to separate itself from Google , though both Apple and Google publicly insist that their relationship is still strong .
You are trying to boost your pc performance in some less conventional way and then , suddenly , there is only gray smoke what have left from your 1 TB heard drive and your enormous movie collection ?
Your ‘ puppy ’ buried your brand new tiny netbook in the garden and you will never find out where ?
Lost your music and last holidays ’ photos ?
You ’re crashed but you recall you had copied it to your Apple TV some time before .
Yes , coping files to the Apple TV is making a backup without knowing it .
The only question now is how to get it back .
Here is what you have to do to recover your priceless media files from your atv .
1. Enable SSH on your Apple TV
here is how to do it : Enable SSH & AFP on your Apple TV
2. Execute the following command :
$ > scp - 1 -r frontrow@ < APPLETV_IP>:/mnt/Media/<media_to_recover>/ /<Destination_local_machine >
example :
$ > scp - 1 -r frontrow@192.168.27.150 :/mnt/Media/Photos/ /tmp/
In this case all the photos stored in Apple TV will be copied to the local directory / tmp /
That ’s all .
Yes , it ’s that simple .
In case you want to recover all the data without specifying any subdirectory use the following command :
$ > scp - 1 -r frontrow@192.168.27.150 :/mnt/Media/ /myAppleTVfullbackup/
NOTE :
It will work on Mac , Linux as well as on Windows with openSSH
To enable SSH you have to have your Apple TV already hacked
The structure of directories and file names on Apple TV is the same like the one used in iPods
Enjoy and good luck !
I use gtask too .

Labor and progressives continued to warn against the danger of moves on Capitol Hill to weaken finance reform .
A variety of sources on the staffs of several senators , for example , say that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President Obama ’s economic adviser , Larry Summers , may be pushing to craft a bill with Republican assistance that does n’t strongly regulate derivatives .
Summers , as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration , blocked attempts to regulate derivatives and other parts of the so - called shadow markets .
Progressives are also concerned that the bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee , sweeping as it is , does not break up the megabanks , necessary , they say , to creating a less risky financial system .
Both Treasury and Federal Reserve officials have , thus far , rejected calls to do this .
All the Senate bill does in this regard is set up a procedure intended to allow big banks to fail with the cost borne by the banks , paid with a fee for a “ resolution fund ” that would bear the costs for the reorganization in the event of failure .
A progressive minority in Congress , and even in the Federal Reserve , has spoken out on the issue of bank size .
“ By splitting up these megabanks , we by definition will make them smaller , safer and more manageable , ” Sen. Edward Kaufman Jr. , Democrat of Delaware , said yesterday .
Last week , Richard Fisher , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , broke ranks with most of his colleagues by saying he favored the breakup of the megabanks .
The liberal economist , Mark Thoma , said yesterday that he agreed that the Senate bill , referred to as the Dodd bill , named after Senate banking chairman Sen.
Chris Dodd , the bill ’s main author , should be strengthened with the addition of clauses that would break up the big banks .
He said , however , that “ reducing size , by itself , is no guarantee of safety .
But limiting bank size is important , ” he said , “ because that would limit the political power of the financial institutions . ”
The resolution fund in the Dodd bill , intended to force banks rather than taxpayers to pay the cost of future bailouts , continued yesterday to be a target for attack by some GOP leaders .
House Minority Leader John Boehner described it as “ a slush fund for bailouts . ”
Progressives are also hoping that President Obama will continue to push hard on finance reform .
They would like him to do more than just a conventional speech in support of the Dodd bill .
They are hoping that , at the very least , he will lend the administration ’s weight to the fight against lawmakers who want to see it weakened .
They understand , however , that to do so he will have to reject advice he is getting from some in his administration .
For a while it has looked like Democrats dependent on Wall Street campaign donations , might be fearful of pushing too hard on finance reform .
Indications are , however , that the Wall Street titans may already have decided to ditch Democrats altogether .
This year , Wall Street firms have begun giving a larger share of their donations to Republicans , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
In January and February Citigroup Inc. Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley donated twice as much money to Republicans than Democrats , a shift from 2009 .
Republican Sen. John Cornyn is already bragging about the shift , “ The Democrats have demonized Wall Street , ” he said .
“ They ’re not happy with that and now they are answering our calls . ”

It 's not surprising that the editors of Fortune rejected cartoonist Chris Ware 's fantastic cover for the May 2010 issue .
It contains too much truth for comfort .
Also , it hearkens back to the golden age of Fortune as an exemplar of beautifully designed and illustrated magazines , and so would have invited unkind comments about the magazine 's typical current level of design aesthetics .
From Indie Pulp , reporting on the C2E2 panel that Ware participated in :
A hacker who calls himself Kirllos has obtained and is now offering to sell 1.5 million Facebook IDs at astonishingly low prices — $ 25 per 1000 IDs for users with fewer than 10 friends and $ 45 per 1000 IDs for users with more than 10 friends — according to researchers at VeriSign 's iDefense .
Looking at the numbers , Kirllos has stolen the IDs of one out of every 300 Facebook users .
Information for sale includes login credentials ; whether or not the e-mail addresses and passwords are legitimate is currently unknown .
Typically , this information would be sold for between $ 1 and $ 20 per account , according to data from Symantec .
Currently , around 700,000 accounts have been sold .
The threads where the accounts are being sold have been removed , as far as we are able to tell .
The users whose e-mail addresses and passwords have been compromised risk having their identities stolen , but they could also become targets of more insidious scams .
As always , we will keep you updated about any Facebook scams that come across our news desk .
Hacking Facebook is n't a new hobby for this person .
Here 's a screenshot of another offer the hacker previously made on a forum earlier this year ; then , he was then selling 100,000 hacked accounts from users around the world :
Kirllos also appears to have had an interest in iPhone applications at one point .
According to some Antichat .ru forum users , he was born in Russia , lives in New Zealand , is 24 years old and speaks both English and French .
It 's generally a good idea to change your password periodically .
It 's also advisable to ensure that your social networking passwords are all different and to generate difficult passwords that include numbers , capital letters and special characters , if at all possible .
Roboform , PassPack and KeePass are a few free or affordable resources to help you manage your online passwords in a secure fashion .
Additionally , our friends at Facebook recommend taking the following precautions :
Use an up - to - date browser that features an anti-phishing blacklist .
Some examples include Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.0.10 .
Choose unique logins and passwords for each of the websites you use .
Check to see that you 're logging in from a legitimate Facebook page with the facebook.com domain .
Be cautious of any message , post or link that looks suspicious or requires an additional login , even if it 's coming from a friend .

Zurich , Switzerland , June 23 , 2009 — In an effort to achieve energy - aware computing , the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ( ETH ) , and IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) today announced plans to build a first - of - a- kind water - cooled supercomputer that will directly repurpose excess heat for the university buildings .
The innovative system , dubbed Aquasar , is expected to decrease the carbon footprint of the system by up to 85 % and estimated to save up to 30 tons of CO 2 per year , compared to a similar system using today ’s cooling technologies .
1
Making computing systems and data centers energy - efficient is a staggering undertaking .
In fact , up to 50 % percent of an average air - cooled data center ’s carbon footprint or energy consumption today is not caused by computing but by powering the necessary cooling systems to keep the processors from overheating — a situation that is far from optimal when looking at energy efficiency from a holistic perspective .
“ Energy is arguably the number one challenge humanity will be facing in the 21st century .
We cannot afford anymore to design computer systems based on the criterion of computational speed and performance alone , ” explains Prof.
Dr. Poulikakos of ETH Zurich , head of the Laboratory of Thermodynamics in Emerging Technologies and lead investigator of this interdisciplinary project .
“ The new target must be high performance and low net power consumption supercomputers and data centers .
This means liquid cooling . ”
With an innovative water - cooling system and direct heat reuse , Aquasar — the new supercomputer , which will be located at the ETH Zurich and is planned to start operation in 2010 , will reduce overall energy consumption by 40 % .
The system is based on long - term joint research collaboration of ETH and IBM scientists in the field of chip - level water - cooling , as well as on a concept for “ water - cooled data centers with direct energy re-use ” advanced by scientists at IBM ’s Zurich Lab .
The water - cooled supercomputer will consist of two IBM BladeCenter® servers in one rack .
Each of the blades will be equipped with a microscale high - performance liquid cooler per processor , as well as input and output pipeline networks and connections , which allow each blade to be connected and disconnected easily to the entire system ( see image ) .
Water as a coolant has the ability to capture heat about 4,000 times more efficiently than air , and its heat - transporting properties are also far superior .
Chip - level cooling with a water temperature of approximately 60 °C is sufficient to keep the chip at operating temperatures well below the maximally allowed 85°C .
The high input temperature of the coolant results in an even higher - grade heat as an output , which in this case will be about 65°C .
The pipelines from the individual blades link to the larger network of the server rack , which in turn are connected to the main water transportation network .
The water - cooled supercomputer will require about 10 liters of water for cooling , and a pump ensures a flow rate of roughly 30 liters per minute .
The entire cooling system is a closed circuit : the cooling water is heated constantly by the chips and consequently cooled to the required temperature as it passes through a passive heat exchanger , thus delivering the removed heat directly to the heating system of the university in this experimental phase .
This eliminates the need for today ’s energy - hungry chillers .
“ Heat is a valuable commodity that we rely on and pay dearly for in our everyday lives .
If we capture and transport the waste heat from the active components in a computer system as efficiently as possible , we can reuse it as a resource , thus saving energy and lowering carbon emissions .
This project is a significant step towards energy - aware , emission - free computing and data centers , ” explains Dr. Bruno Michel , Manager Advanced Thermal Packaging at IBM ’s Zurich Research Laboratory .
Three - year collaborative research in emission - free high performance computing
From the industrial side , the project is part of IBM's First - Of - A - Kind program ( FOAK ) , which engages IBM 's scientists with clients to explore and pilot emerging technologies that address real world business problems .
It was made possible by the support of IBM Switzerland and the IBM Research and Development Laboratory in Boeblingen , Germany .
This liquid cooled supercomputer research is planned as a three - year collaborative research program called Direct Re-Use of Waste Heat from Liquid - Cooled Supercomputers : Towards Low Power , High Performance , Zero-Emission Computing and Datacenters , which is funded jointly mainly by IBM , ETH Zurich and the Swiss Competence Center for Energy and Mobility ( CCEM ) .
Part of the system will be devoted to further research into cooling technologies and efficiencies by scientists of ETH Zurich , ETH Lausanne , the Swiss Competence Center for Energy and Mobility , and the IBM Zurich Research Lab .
The computational performance of Aquasar is a very important part of the research .
Aquasar will be employed by the Computational Science and Engineering Lab of the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich , for multiscale flow simulations pertaining to problems encountered at the interface of nanotechnology and fluid dynamics .
Researchers from this laboratory will also optimize the efficiency with which the respective algorithms perform within the system , in collaboration with the IBM Zurich Lab .
These activities will be supplemented with algorithms of other research labs participating in the project .
With this supercomputer system , scientists intend to demonstrate that the ability to solve important scientific problems efficiently , does not need to have an adverse effect on the energy and environmental challenges facing humanity .
1 By making use of a physical carbon offset that fulfills criteria set forth in the Kyoto Protocol .
The estimate of 30 tons CO 2 is based on the assumptions of average yearly operation of the system and the energy for heating the buildings being produced by fossil fuels .
2BladeCenter® servers with a mixed population of QS22 IBM PowerXCell 8i processors as well as HS22 with Intel Nehalem processor .
In addition , a third air - cooled IBM BladeCenter® server will be implemented to serve as a reference system for measurements .

Depoimentos
Mais uma vez quero ratificar e elogiar nao só o Dr. Eduard Sitnoveter que arrasa e capricha no procedimento ( essa é minha 3 • lipo com vcs )
Como a Estela ( que parece mãe da clínica e mto eficiente ) , a Geise , o carisma da Suzana , e o cuidado , carinho e liberdade que me deixam super à vontade da Cris e do Fábio !!!!
Obs. : procurei outras clinicas que tinham um horário mais flexível pra mim , mas não adianta , não consegui " trair " a clínica .
A facilidade , o carinho e o bom atendimento da equipe não me deixam sair da clinica , minha confiança na equipe e no Dr. Eduardo prevaleceu , e nao mudou em nada minha opinião .

Quero deixar meu depoimento , fiz a lipoaspiração de abdômen completo , flancos e costas no dia 02 de março de 2011 , não moro no Brasil mas conheci a clinica pela internet , entrei em contato e conversei com a Suzana que me passo muita confiança me explicando todos os detalhes da clinica , eu moro na França e fiz os exames necessário aqui mesmo , chegando no Brasil já fui na clinica mostrar os exames para o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Eu já estava de jejum e logo apos as explicações do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter eu fiz o procedimento , sai andando do centro cirúrgico , a Suzana me acompanhou até o hotel e não senti nada , no dia seguinte fui trocar os curativos , somente no terceiro dia eu comecei senti um pouco de desconforto mas nada muito forte .
No dia 09 de março embarquei de novo para a França sem nenhum problema , estou usando a cinta que para mim não me incomoda e levando a vida normalmente , mas claro que já vi uma grande diferencia no meu corpo , estou com a cintura bem mais fina nada de barriga , agora sim vejo as curvas maravilhosas no meu corpo .
Adorei mesmo !
Quero agradecer a toda equipe e também a Suzana que é um amor de pessoa .
Muito Obrigada !

CARINHOSAMENTE ,

Oi pessoal , hoje dia 21/01 estou com 5 dias de operada , e sinceramente quase não sinto dores ... levo vida normal !
Tirando a fato que tenho que usar essa cinta em pleno verão do Rio !!kkk
Fazer a lipo foi uma experiência muito gratificante , estava muito desestimulada em me cuidar e precisava desta injeção de alto - estima !!
Fiz abdômen completo e mesmo inchada consigo visualizar novos contornos .. tenho consciência que resultado total não dá para ser visto em uma semana né ?!
Bem que eu gostaria !! rs !!
A cirurgia em si foi muito mais tranquila que poderia imaginar ... e Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter Sitnoveter me deixou muito segura e o Dr. Sérgio é um amor de pessoa .
Fiquei acordada TODO o procedimento conversando com o Fábio que é uma figura : super alto - astral e carinhoso !!
Com certeza voltarei para fazer a parte inferior e ser feliz de vez !
Lili
Sem dúvida foi uma das melhores atitudes que tomei a respeito do meu bem estar !
fiz abdômen completo , axila frente e braço há 3 dias e senti apenas um leve desconforto no dia seguinte ao procedimento .
Com a utilização da cinta e dos medicamentos posso dizer que a Lipo realizada pelo Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e sua equipe é o que há de mais moderno e tranquilo ...é claro que o resultado final só aparece com o tempo , mas a diferença é notória , mesmo com o inchaço natural das áreas tratadas .
Fui muito bem recebida por todos , a começar pela querida Estela , passando pelos meninos da equipe médica ... enfim ... nota 10 para vcs !
Foi muito bom me livrar definitivamente daquelas gordurinhas que não sumiam por nada , mas o melhor de tudo foi ter a oportunidade de conhecer profissionais tão competentes e humanos como vcs !
Parabéns !
Bjossss
Luciana
Olá , demorei a escrever meu depoimento , pois estou analisando meu resultado meticulosamente a cada dia que se passa ... Eu amei ! Rsrs ... Estou encantada com as mãozinhas abençoadas do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e sua equipe , desde o início deixei bem claro que eu sou uma pessoa extremamente crítica , e só tenho elogios a fazer a todos da Corporal Clinic , e por incrível que pareça não tenho mais medo de agulha ...rs .
Já estou imaginando quando meu abdômen chegar ao resultado final , aí eu acho que vou ficar bastante metidinha , rs .
Se no futuro eu quiser mexer em mais alguma parte do meu corpo , já tenho meu cirurgião elegido .
Beijos a todos , especialmente à Estela !
Alynne
Nem eu acredito !
Fiz o procedimento ( abdomen total , costas , quadril e púbis ) no dia 23 de outubro , já no dia 28 , 04 dias após , eu estava dando aulas para uma turma de , aproximadamente 80 alunos .
E... tudo bem .
Eu moro no município do Rio de Janeiro e trabalho em Duque de Caxias .
Não é pertinho .
Dirigi normalmente , nem parecia que eu tinha feito a lipo .
Bem ...e o resultado ?
Este sim , aparece MUITO .
Mesmo ainda inchada , o visual é outro .
Encontro - me na quarta sessão da drenagem linfática .
Estou acreditando muito na equipe , quando afirma que o resultado final ainda virá .
Agradeço a todos os profissionais da clínica pela atenção e ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Eu procurei a clínica a partir de um anúncio no jornal .
E , agora , eu recomendo para àqueles que queiram retirar o que está incomodando no seu corpo .
Estou com quinze dias de operada e estou maravilhada .
Não sinto dor , levo minha vida normalmente .
Viajei com menos de sete dias e não tive problemas .
Não usei analgésicos e recomendo a cirurgia , voltarei em breve para outra .
Agradeço a Ana , muito atenciosa , ao Dr Eduardo Sitnoveter e a sua equipe .
Beijos a todos .

Pessoal :
Gostaria de prestar meu depoimento quanto a Lipo de Beverly Hills que fiz em 10/10/2008 .
Não foi uma decisão muito difícil de se tomar , já que tive acesso à outros depoimentos , vídeos e entrevistas na Revista Plástica com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Excelente profissional e pessoa , assim como toda sua equipe .
Me trataram muito bem desde o primeiro contato que foi por e-mail com a Estela .
Cada dia que passa minha silhueta fica mais definida .
O uso da cinta eu julgo imprescindível para manter tudo no lugar .
Pretendo usá - la por um mês no mínimo , se eu aguentar o calor ....rss
A recuperação foi ótima , mesmo voltando pra casa com 6h30 min de viagem do Rio para Campinas - SP .
As áreas que fiz foram abdômen completo , cintura , flancos , costas inferior e gordura sacra .
Além disso fiz Smart Lipo no abdômen pois estava muito flácido .
Amei , amei tudo !!!
Já estou programando a próxima , da parte inferior .
Sinceramente , já passei por outra mini lipo ( HLPA ) antes , aqui em Campinas mesmo , mas não se compara em nada com a Lipo de Beverly Hills .
Meu resultado foi acima do esperado , nunca pensei que poderia ter essa cintura .... rsss
Obrigada Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e toda sua equipe !!!
Beijos e Abraços e até breve !!!!
Thaís .
Hoje faz 6 dias que realizei a lipo Beverly Hills com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter na Corporal Clinic .
Fiz \" abdomen total\ " e \" culotes\ " .
O procedimento foi super - tranquilo .
Fiquei conversando sobre amenidades o tempo todo com a equipe .
Minha recuperação também está sendo ótima .
Nem tomei remédio para dor em casa .
Até ser liberada para dança e ginástica pesada , tenho passeado hora e meia no calçadão com total conforto .
Vida normal .
Fiz a lipo porque engordei 10 kg após o falecimento do meu pai há 2 anos .
Passei de 58 para 68 kg .
Há um ano vinha tentando de tudo .
Pouca comida e muito exercício , Minhas pernas doíam de tanto exercício , e nada ... nem um kg a menos .
Tenho 56 anos e nessa fase o metabolismo queima pouco .
Até que cheguei à conclusão de que a lipo seria a única solução realista .
Só que eu tinha pavor da \ " cicatriz\ " da lipo tradicional .
Quando li sobre a técnica relativamente nova do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , que só faz \ " furinhos\ " nem pensei 2 vezes .
Marquei logo .
O resultado foi impressionante !!
Ontem mesmo eu me olhei sem roupa no espelho , ciente de que o inchaço só diminuirá gradualmente nos próximos meses , e o que vi me pareceu um milagre , porque MESMO INCHADA , eu voltei à antiga forma dos meus 58 kg .
E sabem , o que mais ?
acho que até melhor , porque ele tirou culotes que eu sempre tive , mesmo quando magra .
Pensei : \" Eu já devia ter feito isso antes ! \ "
Minha irmã disse : \ " É...ele te esculpiu bem !\ " .
Os furinhos da parte superior já estão quase imperceptíveis .
Estou muito feliz .
O resultado não poderia ser melhor .
Muito obrigada , Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Voltarei porque ADQUIRI CONFIANÇA .
Fui alertada com toda franqueza para o que poderia ou não ser feito .
Estou pensando em fazer um álbum de \ " ANTES E DEPOIS \ " no meu Orkut pessoal .
E parabéns à toda equipe da Corporal Clinic , vocês foram maravilhosos !!!
C. V.M.
Oi galera !!!
Ontem fiz papada e culote e olha ... só tenho elogios a fazer para essa equipe MA RA VI LHO SA !
Todos são umas graças !
Já estou recomendando para todo mundo !
Minha mãe já vai fazer mês que vem e com certeza irei fazer mais coisas também !!
Obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Estou impressionada !
Obrigada por tudo !!!!!!!!
L. P .
Olá , futuros felizardos em optar por fazer esta nova técnica de Lipoaspiração !
Eu tinha ouvido falar desta lipo , mas , como sou uma pessoa hiper desconfiada , e admito que insegura também , dei uma olhada no site , que antes continham fotos , e até mesmo vídeos dos procedimentos realizados ; Mas , como existem pessoas de sucesso , também existem pessoas de não sucesso .
E leis também que podem ser quebradas uma vez que não claúsas pétreas .
Não , não sou advogada .
( rssss )
Sou publicitária e trabalho muito , e por falar nisso , vamos ao que interessa .
Fiz meu procedimento a menos de 12 horas , fiz coxas , braços , e costas superiores .
E estou aqui deixando este depoimento , sabe pq ?
porque não sinto nada !
absolutamente nada .
nenhuma dorzinha sequer ! nem dolorida estou .
E esta é a segunda vez que faço lipo com o Fantástico Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e toda sua equipe .
( imagine - se chegando a casa de um amigo querido , que te trata super bem ...
Pois é assim que vc será recebido por todos ! )
Faço questão de minuciar cada detalhe , pois sei o quanto é complicado e difícil tomar uma decisão de fazer uma lipoaspiração ; O mercado deste procedimento é vasto , com todos os nomes possíveis e imaginários de lipo .
E eu li a respeito no mínimo de umas 8 técnicas diferentes , e optei graças a Deus por esta , e com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter . ( QUE ESPECIALIZOU -EM
Cirurgia Plástica no Serviço do Professor Ivo Pitanguy .
Vocês já ouviram falar neste artista em cirurgia plástica ? enfim ...)
Que vale ressaltar é o ÚNICO autorizado a fazer este procedimento , não se enganem !
tem outros por ai usando o nome desta lipoaspiração de Beverly Hills .
O sucesso incomoda , e falsas promessas existem ! ( não caiam nessa ; É a sua vida em jogo !
vai brincar com isso ? ) enfim ...
Não trabalho com ele , não tenho nenhum tipo de vínculo , moro em São Paulo , porém tenho família no Rio , e todas as vezes que venho , se eu puder fazer um novo tipo de procedimento com ele farei !
porque vale cada centavo pago !
deixo este depoimento , pois foi através deles que decidi por esta lipo .
Gente até malhar já estou malhando , fiz inclusive supino , e eu operei as coxas , costas e braços !
fico por aqui deixando um beijo e votos de sucesso para cada um da equipe do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , sempre que eu vier ao Rio , vou passar por ai !
vcs são um espetáculo !
Stella , pode aguardar minha ligação para fazer o rosto !
rsrsrs ...
BEIJOSSSSSS

VALEU A PENA !!!!!
Valeu demais ter feito esta lipo com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Tem 8 dias somente que fiz a lipo , sei que é cedo , pois o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter me explicou que o resultado final , dependendo da pessoa , deve demorar 2 meses , mas já vejo o resultado hoje .
Fiz lipo de braço e papada , meu braço era gordo , eu morria de vergonha de usar blusas de alça , justas então ... comprava por achar bonitas , mas quando vestia , elas ficavam horríveis para mim , e acabavam sendo guardadas .
Lógico que ainda não posso usá - las , pois ainda estou com um pouquinho de hematomas , mas já as experimentei em casa , e não é que estão ótimas em mim ....
Nada serve para descrever a minha felicidade .
Só posso dizer que VALEU A PENA , VALEU MUITO A PENA !!!
Obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter por ter me ligado logo após eu ter feito a lipo .
Fiquei surpresa pela sua ligação , e feliz por saber que me operei com um médico que se preocupou com meu bem estar logo após o procedimento .
Já fiz outras cirurgias e isto nunca me aconteceu .
Agora entendo o motivo de seu sucesso .
Parabéns ao sr. e sua equipe nota 10 .

Fiz abdômen completo , costas inferior , gordura sacra , púbis em 29 / AGO ( sexta ) .
Saí do procedimento andando e fui para um hotel , pois moro fora do RJ e meu marido achou melhor não pegar a estrada a noite .
Ontem , segunda ( 01/ AGO ) já estava trabalhando .
Sinceramente , tenho duas tatuagens , que doeram muito mais para fazer do que a lipo de Beverly Hills .
O resultado é impressionante !
Estou muito Feliz com meus \ " novos\ " contornos de mulher melancia !
Se o que vejo até o momento ainda não é o resultado definitivo ...
Imagine quando for o resultado final !
Tudo que li no site , traduz ao pé da letra o que vi , senti e estou vivendo .
Tenho algum inchaço , alguns poucos hematomas e os furinhos já estão todos fechados !
Estou me amando !
Ficou maravilhoso o contorno corporal .
Parabéns ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e equipe pelo excelente trabalho e profissionalismo .
Olá , Pessoal !
Hoje faz um mês que realizei minha lipo e vou contar como foi ....
Já havia feito uma lipo antes , foi tão dolorida que quando os hematomas que foram muitos desapareceram eu já havia engordado , pois não tinha como me movimentar devido a dor .
Me fez pensar duas vezes antes de fazer a segunda , mas ai conheci o site da clinica do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter pela internet ( procurando lipo em B.H. por que moro em Belo Horizonte ) .
Deus me guiou até a clinica , e conversando com a Estela , que além de ser um doce , e educada , é muito eficiente em convenceu sem sombra de dúvida a realizar o procedimento .
Amei todos da clinica mas a Estela ta guardada no meu coração .
Dores durante o procedimento - uma queimação no final .
Cicatrização - para mim que tenho tendência a ter quelóide , todas as puncturas fechadas .
Emagrecimento - fiz abdômen completo , flancos , cintura , costas .
Perdi em um mês sem regime e sem ginástica 11 quilos - é ou não é um milagre que o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e o Dr. Sergio realizam nas pessoas ?
Se vou voltar - sim vou fazer agora a parte de cima e tchau gordura para sempre .
Um grande beijo para a Ana que é um doce , para Fabio um lorde ( me tratou como princesa ) para os Drs. Eduardo Sitnoveter e Sergio ( os melhores ) , o anestesista que é super seguro e acaba com o seu medo e principalmente para a Estela .
Vocês são uma equipe maravilhosa .
Obrigada pelo novo corpo

Gostaria de declarar que tudo que vi no site , pude ontem constatar , desde á gentileza e simpatia de toda equipe , ao procedimento que foi mais simples do imaginava .
Não vejo a hora de fazer as outras que necessito fazer .
Em breve mandarei as fotos do depois , para que possam comprovar .
Estou feliz e até o momento não necessitei tomar nem analgésicos , isso mais de 12 horas após a procedimento .
Um grande abraço à Ana , que foi muito graçinha comigo o tempo todo , ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e a toda sua equipe

Realizei minha lipoescultura de abdomen completo , flancos , cintura , costas inferior e superior ontem , dia 16/07 e , além de uma equipe maravilhosa , tive o prazer de fazer a cirurgia com sedação mínima , consciente , e a única coisa que posso dizer é que não poderia tomar melhor decisão .
Tenho alguns hematomas mas todas a puncturas já estão fechadas com exceção de uma teimosa .
Sem dores , sem febre e com todo o apoio da Corporal Clinic , que inclusive atendeu a meu pedido de troca domiciliar de curativo por causa da punctura ainda não fechada .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter demonstrou- se um profissional de primeira linha desde a consulta dia 14/7 , quando tomei a decisão definitiva e agendei imediatamente .
O procedimento é rápido e seguro e o tratamento interpessoal pelos integrantes da equipe em geral é maravilhoso .
Já estou me preparando para a possível liberação para realizar a lipo de pescoço e papada .
Parabéns a todos da Corporal Clinic e parabéns a mim por ter eleito os serviços deles para redimensionar minha vida pessoal .
Só quem se ama de verdade é capaz de ousar .

Oi Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter
demorei para dar meu depoimento pois , não gosto muito de escrever no computador .
Agradeço ao sr e a todos pelo carinho e a certeza que dão aos clientes de que o procedimento é da forma como dizem .
Ainda estou dentro do período de 02 meses mas , já dá para ver como está ficando e , eu estou amando como estou ficando .
Já recomendei a algumas amigas e , reforço a todos .
FAÇAM POIS , É TUDO DE BOM !
um grande beijo a todos da clínica que tratam os clientes com muito carinho .

A maior obra da beleza feminina deve ter sido a Eva quando apareceu no Paraíso posto que fora uma obra da criação Divina e que ninguém podia concorrer .
Mas dessa , não há referência alguma .
Os quadros de pintores ou escultores famosos Leonardo Davinci .
Rafael e Michelangelo , não conseguiram fazer o que os médicos da Corporal Clinic fizeram na minha Rita , aprimorando m magistralmente o que já era belo .
E agradecemos ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e a Sra. Estela , entre outros , daquele estabelecimento de beleza .
Estou convencido que eles podem transmudar - numa verdadeira alquimia estética - o patinho feio que há em você no cisne de beleza incomensurável .
Agradecido L. I. H. C. ( Esposo )
Diariamente vejo meus pacientes tirando litros e litros de gordura .
Cada resultado mais fantástico do que o outro , minha esposa nem se fala , ficou totalmente sem o culote que tanta a incomodava .
Faltava eu tirar minha barriga de " grávido " .
Depois que meu amigo e assistente Dr. Sergio realizou mais de 100 procedimentos comigo , pedi que fizesse meu abdômen .
Infelizmente sou daquelas pessoas que qualquer coisa que come engorda .
A dieta apenas murcha as células de gordura , qualquer coisa que como faz ela voltar rapidamente .
Bem , agora tirei de vez e sem volta minha barriga - foram 6,5 litros de gordura que tirei !
Fiz meu procedimento numa 6 ª e na segunda já estava operando novamente .
Agradeço toda minha equipe pelo sucesso no meu procedimento .
A vocês meus clientes , só posso agradecer a confiança que depositaram em mim quando me deixaram realizar seus procedimentos .
A vocês meus futuros clientes , que estão lendo meu depoimento , só posso dizer que nossa técnica é , ao meu ver , um novo paradigma da lipoaspiração e R E C O M E N D O !!!.
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter
Oi Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter demorei para dar o meu depoimento , estou muito feliz com a minha lipo recebi muitos elogios e hoje com 3 meses cada vez mais elogios , já indiquei para minhas clientes e amigos sobre a clinica elas ficaram de boca aberta quando falei da lipo , quero agradecer a você , Estela , Tania que foram um amor comigo e todos da sua equipe , não posso esquecer do Fabio , recomendo a todos a fazer pois hoje eu me olho no espelho e vejo uma outra mulher FELIZ sem aquela barriga. gente vamos fazer .
Beijos e abraços a todos

Depois de engravidar da minha primeira filha nunca mais consegui me livrar das gordurinhas localizadas ou dos pneuzinhos e , um dia , ao navegar na internet , entrei no site e me empolguei com os depoimentos .
Conversando com amigas , descobri que duas haviam feito o procedimento com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e tomei coragem !
Fui à clínica num sábado , conversei com a Ana ( fofíssima ) , e marquei a lipo para a sexta - seguinte , dia 02/05 .
Da recepção , passando pelo Fábio fofíssimo , super tranquilo e carinhoso até o próprio Dr Eduardo Sitnoveter ( que me ligou no dia seguinte para saber como eu estava ) , são todos maravilhosos !
Não sentí dor alguma , apenas o famoso \ " incômodo dos abdominais\ " , cicatrização perfeita e super rápida !
Recomendo , sem sombra de dúvida !
C.D .
Fiz minha lipo na data de 16/05/08 e hoje é 19/05/08 .
Vou ser o mais sincero e honesto possível !
Viajei de SP para o RJ na manhã de 16/05 ( 11:00 ) cheguei e fui direto para a clínica .
Por volta de 13:00 h comecei meu procedimento e às 17:00 h estava no hotel .
Poderia ter voltado no mesmo dia para SP , porém , como fui sozinho , preferi permanecer 1 dia no RJ .
Na manhã seguinte fui a clínica e troquei meus curativos e , logo após , viajei de volta para SP .
Vamos ao procedimento ...
Prático , rápido e eficiente !
São as palavras mais adequadas !
Fiquei parcialmente sedado , não senti nada durante o procedimento , a não ser um pequeno incômodo perto do final .
Reclamei do incômodo e me sedaram um pouco mais .
Acabou o procedimento , me deram algo para comer , descansei um pouco e fui embora .
Pós-operatório ...
Somente incômodo ( Como se tivesse feito muitos abdominais ) .
Hoje vai completar 3 dias e não sinto praticamente nada !
Se faria de novo ?
Faria , não !
Vou fazer a parte superior !
Custo X benefício ?
10 ! O melhor investimento que já fiz !
Para finalizar quero agradecer a toda equipe da clínica !
São profissionais e atenciosos !
Doutor Eduardo Sitnoveter e equipe muito obrigado e parabéns pelo profissionalismo !
Estela muito obrigado por sua presteza e simpatia .
Fabio obrigado pelo carinho !
A todos os demais um beijo !

Sempre fui magra , mas nos últimos meses havia engordado mais de 10 kg por causa de estresse , trabalho e outros males da vida moderna .
Houvi falar da cirurgia de beverly hills com uma amiga e , confesso que ainda receosa , resolvi fazer .
Foi a MELHOR DECISÃO que já tomei .
A equipe ( todos , sem exceção , desde as recepcionistas ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter ) é extremamente profissional , te deixa completamente a vontade durante todo o procedimento e é super competente .
Não senti quase dor , o pós-operatório está sendo super tranqüilo ( e olha que fiz em quatro regiões ! ) e os resultados são realmente muito bons , mesmo com os inchaços .
Virei garota - propaganda para minhas amigas e familiares .
E devo fazer de novo .
Muito Obrigada por tudo .
Beijos , S.Z .
Estou muito feliz com minha Lipo .
Quando vi no site , fiquei ansiosa por fazer , é tudo como está descrito , você não acredita quando acaba .
É tudo muito bom , sem contar com toda a equipe que é realmente fantástica , toda , sem exceção , principalmente o profissionalismo do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , tanto antes , durante e após o procedimento .
Meu esposo se animou e vai fazer na próxima semana .
Quanto a mim não vejo a hora de fazer outra .
É incrível , só fazendo para acreditar que é tudo verdade ......
Muito obrigada por tudo .
Vocês são MARAVILHOSOSSSSSSSS

Olá !
Fiz a lipo de Beverly Hills e adorei !
Sempre tive uma recuperação lenta em cirurgias , além de ser alérgica a uma lista de remédios .
Supreendi -me com minha recuperação .
Nossa , está sendo muito rápida e não senti dores !
Nunca me recuperei tão rápido .
Fiz numa sexta e na segunda já estava pronta para o trabalho .
O procedimento é realmente muito bom e o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e sua equipe são muito legais e atenciosos !
Bjs a todos !

A decisão por fazer uma cirurgia plástica é muito séria , e tem que ser tomada com toda a responsabilidade .
Por mais que eu sempre tenha sonhado em me ver livre daqueles malditos culotes , ainda não tinha me sentido à vontade para fazê - lo - ainda mais depois de todas as histórias de terror que me contam todos os dias sobre lipos que deram errado .
Foi aí que , um dia , mudando os canais de televisão , passei por um programa em que havia um cirurgião plástico - hoje , o meu já conhecido e queridíssimo Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter - falando sobre uma técnica absolutamente inovadora em matéria de lipoaspiração , com uma série de benefícios em relação à anestesia , recuperação , preço , tempo , eram tantas vantagens que não dava nem pra contar !
Então , agendei uma visita à Corporal Clinic .
A conversa leve , divertida , mas super - profissional que eu tive com a Estela me deu uma segurança tão grande que eu só conseguia pensar \ "é agora ! \ " .
E olha que eu ainda nem tinha conhecido o resto da equipe !
Se eu soubesse que dava para fazer lipo acordada , rindo ( ok , reclamando na hora da xilocaína , hehe ) e ouvindo Roberto Carlos , eu já teria feito umas vinte .
No dia seguinte eu recebi ligação do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter - super - atencioso ! , para saber como eu estava .
Retornei à clínica hoje , quatro dias depois do procedimento , para exibir meus inchaços ( que estão diminuindo MUITO rápido ) e adorei reencontrar essa equipe maravilhosa que cuidou tão bem de mim .
Ainda ganhei novos curativos feitos pelo Fábio ( sou fã do Fábio , ele é um docinho !!! ) , bati papo com todo o mundo , e já estou com saudades .
Vocês são todos muito especiais , não sei nem como agradecer .
Beijos muito grandes !
A.H .
Sou carioca , mas moro fora a 12 anos .
Vi pela internet o site de Beverly Hills e me interessei em fazer o tratamento .
Bem , após a troca de alguns emails marquei e fui ao Rio fazer minha lipoescultura de abdomem .
ADOREI !
não somente pelo profissionalismo de toda a equipe , mas também pela atenção e o respeito dedicado ao paciente .
Recomendo a todos , pricipalmente pelo resultado obtido e quase indolor .
Um beijo e abraço especial para o Fabio ( um doce de pessoa ) e outro para o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter ( muito gentil e atencioso ) .
Ah , pretendo voltar em breve !
Descobri a Lipoescultura de Beverly Hills lendo o jornal O Globo , em janeiro deste ano .
Moro em Brasília e chegando aqui resolvi entrar em contato com a Corporal Clinic , desde o primeiro email fui super bem atendida , orientada e assim que pude voltei ao Rio e não tive dúvidas : fiz a lipo !!!
Hoje está completando uma semana e apesar de inchada já da pra notar a diferença , fiz flancos e pretendo voltar pra fazer o braço !!!
Quero agradecer a toda equipe e principalmente ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter pelo carinho e atenção que mesmo a distância não mediu esforço em me acompanhar .
Já fiz propaganda pra todos por aqui e em breve a clínica terá pacientes de Brasília !!!
Beijos
C.R .
Gostaria de parabenizar toda a equipe por seu carinho , bom humor e dedicação comigo .
Desde a chegada até o final , tudo foi impecável , inclusive o lanchinho carinhoso ao terminar a cirurgia !
Todo o procedimento foi um sucesso!!
O que mais me impressionou foi a ausência de dor no pós-operatório .
Fiz a lipoescultura nas áreas do abdomem , costas , braço e coxas .
Obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e Equip .
S.B .
Além do resultado que considero fantástico , fiquei muito a vontade no dia do procedimento pois a equipe é muito competente e nos passa uma serenidade impressionante .
Quero agradecer a todos , desde a primeira consulta com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , até a drenagem que já estou fazendo , parabéns a todos .
Até o fim do ano pretendo fazer outros procedimentos e passar o reveillon um verdadeiro manequim internacional .

Esperei fazer a segunda lipo para dar meu depoimento , pois desejo que o mesmo seja expressão da verdade absoluta que eu creio .
Quero que as pessoa se beneficiem com um depoimento isento e real .
Fiz as pernas primeiro ( tirei 7,5 l ) em 13/02 e agora em 13/03 fiz os braços .
Voltarei para fazer abdômen total no mês de abril .
Com esse procedimento deverei estar voltando ao manequim 42 .
Estou super feliz com o resultado , passei muito bem das duas vezes , sem problemas maiores que de uma recuperação comum .
Fui extremamente bem atendida por todos, e nem vou apontar nomes com medo de deixar alguém de fora da lista !
O procedimento mostrou - se eficaz , seguro , e sobretudo um sucesso total .
Saí de um manequim 52 e já estou usando 46 mas quero chegar mais baixo ainda .
E sei que vou chegar .
Aconselho a quem deseja um resultado rápido e eficaz , fazer a lipo de beverly hills na Corporal Clinic com Dr Eduardo Sitnoveter e equipe .
Obrigada mesmo pessoal !
nVcs se excederam em atenção e boa vontade para comigo !
Beijo a todos

Fiz a minha lipo ontem , mas já estou vendo os resultados .
É surpreendente !
Além da equipe do Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter ser fora de série .
Durante todo o procedimento me mantive acordado e , realmente , é quase que totalmente indolor .
Estou com o corpo ainda inchado mas a diferença é inacreditável !
Aconselho a todos que estão na dúvida que façam .
Vale a pena !!!

Sempre fui magra , mas tinha culotes que começaram a aumentar muito depois dos 35 anos .
Surgiram os acúmulos de gordura na barriga e flancos , o que tornou o contorno do meu corpo muito feio .
Mesmo não sendo acúmulos grandes , me incomodavam , porque eu não me reconhecia mais no espelho .
O pior é que eu não engordava mais em lugar algum , só nos acúmulos e cada dia mais , ficava difícil manter o regime .
Um regime rigoroso diminuía os culotes e a barriga , mas em compensação , deixava aparecer as costelas , dando aparência doentia .
Após a lipo , ganhei o contorno compatível com o resto do meu corpo , de uma maneira que nunca tive na vida .
Ficou perfeito e sem regime .
Valeu Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .

Bom !
sempre tive vontade de melhorar o aspecto do meu abdomem que depois da gravidez ficou muito grande e flácido .
Só agora pude realizar este sonho , foi quando através da internet conheci a clinica e fiz uma avaliação , confesso que muitas pessoas me chamaram de louca por confiar apenas na propaganda e não ter nenhuma indicação de alguém que tivesse feito algo na clinica .
Foi então , que fiz a lipo de Beverly Hills , gente vocês não tem noção da minha felicidade o resultado foi ótimo , sou outra pessoa , e com o passar do tempo ( fiz a 2 meses ) fica cada vez melhor .
Aconselho a todos que queiram fazer , que não tenham medo e que confiem no Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e em toda a sua equipe que é maravilhosa .
Agradeço a toda equipe pelo carinho e paciência !

Conheci a clínica pela internet , fazendo buscas para uma possível lipo .
De cara , como resultado , me veio o site da lipo de Beverly Hills , como o mais acessado .
" Opa ! " - pensei - " Esse cirurgião deve ser O CARA ! "
Pesquisei lipos em vários outros sites e , em todos os sentidos , que incluem todos os prós destacados neste site , a lipo de Beverly Hills é a melhor .
Sem falar no preço , que é ótimo .
Ao decidir por ela e , conseqüentemente , pelo Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , parti para as buscas do seu histórico profissional .
Foi quando tive convicção de que era com ele mesmo que eu faria a cirurgia ' !
A começar por toda a explicação - mais do que detalhada - que contém este site , tudo foi maravilhoso ... o atendimento das recepcionistas / telefonistas , a Sra. Estela , a enfermeira muito mais do que educada e paciente ( que eu não me lembro o nome ! ) , e a equipe da ' cirurgia ' em si .
E o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , claro , que é a gentileza e o profissionalismo em pessoa .
Foi tudo exatamente como relata o site !
O procedimento não é dolorido .
Para ser sincera , apesar de não acreditar antes , não senti absolutamente nada .
Minha cicatrização foi excelente .
No quarto dia , a maioria dos furos já estava fechada .
O dolorido na região tratada é mínimo .
No dia seguinte , fiquei extasiada ao ver a minha cintura como eu nunca tive !
Mas , como o próprio site explica , é comum inchar um pouco uns dias depois .
Eu inchei no 4 º .
Mas até agora não apareceu nenhuma mancha roxa .
Hj faz uma semana e ontem recebi meu 1 º elogio e hj pela manh ã o 2 º !
" Nossa !
Vc está magrinha ! "
Isso não tem preço !
Mesmo inchada , percebe - se a diferença na minha silhueta .
Não vejo a hora de desinchar e usar minhas roupas como sempre quis .
Muito obrigada pelo excelente trabalho desempenhado !

Oi pessoal , quero registrar aqui o quanto estou feliz por ter feito a lipo .
Quero agradecer ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e a toda a equipe pela atenção , carinho e cuidado dedicados a mim .
Sou de São Paulo , achei a Lipo de Beverly Hills pesquisando na internet , não conhecia ninguém , entrei em contato com a clinica , fui muito bem atendida , tirei todas as duvidas e fui com a cara e com coragem ... viajei a noite de ônibus , o meu procedimento estava marcado p/ as 8:00hrs , fiz a lipo sai da clinica andando ( apenas um pouco sonolenta ) e fui direto pra rodoviária , peguei o ÔNIBUS e voltei pra SP , cheguei as 21:00 hrs sem problema algum !
Sem dor , a recuperação tem sido boa , todos aqui não acreditaram ... que eu tinha feito uma lipo e estava tão bem , alem do fato de me acharem doida de ter ido pro RIO e voltado de ônibus ... e dizer que estava bem .
Tenho indicado pra várias pessoas , sem receio , É ÓTIMA , É SEGURA É TUUUUUUUUUUUUDOOooooo DE BOM !!!
Beijos pra todos ...
R.P.J .
Oi galera da Corporal , venho através desta expressar toda minha satisfação e alegria de ter conhecido vocês e fazer esta Lipo MARAVILHOSA , que mudou minha vida .
Mudou minha auto - estima , minha vontade de viver , meu comportamento .
Me sinto mais segura , confiante e muito mais sexy e bonita .
Obrigado a todos , desde a recepcionista até a moça do cafezinho , não preciso nem falar da equipe que AMEI .
Minha cirurgia ficou D+ e RECOMENDO de verdade tanto que já indiquei à várias amigas .
Um beijo no coração de cada um , em especial aos integrantes do centro cirúrgico e ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .

Fui muito bem atendida tanto pelo medico , Eduardo Sitnoveter , quanto pela equipe .
O resultado está ficando cada vez melhor .
O procedimento foi bem rápido e todos tiveram muita paciência comigo .
R.C .
Eu já estou impressionada com o resultado que ainda não é o final .
Fiz há 4 dias o procedimento , estou inchada , mas posso constatar que meu corpo é outro .
Já havia feito outras 2 lipos no culote e não fiquei satisfeita .
Acredito mesmo que o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter terá atingido as minhas expectativas .
Ele é um médico maravilhoso .
É bastante atencioso , prestativo , detalhista e carinhoso .
Não vim para a Corporal Clnic por indicação , mas estou segura e feliz com a minha escolha .
Toda a equipe está de parabéns e agradeço por toda a atenção e carinho .
E.C.L .
Eu , R.L.M. , gostaria de compartilhar com todas as pessoas que tenham alguma dúvida em relação ao procedimento desta Clínica .
Fiz minha lipo dia 22 de novembro e além de ser muito bem tratada por toda a equipe , tive uma recuperação maravilhosa .
Não tive dor nem reação nenhuma .
Estou me sentindo muito bem .
Todas as pessoas que queiram fazer , não tenham medo , estou me sentindo maravilhosa e minha auto estima voltou .
Estou adorando meu corpo .
Espero que possa ajudar , as pessoas que tenham dúvidas - não tenham !
Faz e verá o resultado .
Obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
R.L.M.
Só posso dizer que adorei .
A Lipoescultura é muito mais do que eu poderia imaginar ou acreditar .
Realmente é totalmente indolor e os resultados você já começa a ver no dia , quando você sai .
Quero fazer em outras regiões e diversas amigas também vão fazer .
Aconselho a todos que tenham tanto medo de anestesia quanto eu , uma vez que é com anestesia local seguida de leve sedação e você já sai andando .
Você vê nos olhos do Dr Eduardo Sitnoveter que ele trabalha com todo amor e carinho , a fim de que você consiga alcançar o máximo de seu objetivo .
Sem falar no pessoal , TODO , da clínica que são ótimos e muito carinhosos .
Beijos a todos e até a próxima ( em breve ) .

No início fiquei extremamente nervosa , principalmente porque sou diabética insulino - dependente .
Cheguei hipoglicemica e prontamente controlaram minha glicose e tive uma cirurgia muito tranqüila .
Esta foto que estão vendo foi tirada com menos de 1 hora da cirurgia feita .
Não tive dor .
Hoje , após 15 dias estou muito bem e já ganhei até um shortinho do meu marido !
Simplesmente MA-RA-VI-LHO -SO !Muita Obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter
C.P .
Não acreditei !
Realmente era tudo verdade .
O procedimento é muito tranqüilo .
Agente fica meio nervoso porque desconhece e não sabe , mais logo logo ficamos tranqüilos .
São muitos pacientes vindo para revisão e todos ótimos , aí vamos ficando tranqüilos .
Vemos também os pacientes que realizaram o procedimento antes do nosso saindo todos sorridentes .
O Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter é muto tranquilo .
Fantástico .
Recomendo a todos !!!

Quero deixar meu depoimento , de que era um sonho perder a gordura adquirida no decorrer dos anos , e quando tomei conhecimento , não pensei duas vezes , fiz , gostei e estou feliz com o resultado .
Agora vou dar continuidade me cuidando muito .
Após 16 dias , vivo novo momento da minha vida , mudar o guarda roupa e todo comportamento alimentar , porém quero deixar claro , como de tudo , só que o necessário .
Muito obrigado ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter !!!
Oi , realmente me surpreendeu o procedimento .
Já vi diversas pessoas realizando esta lipoescultura , vi os resultados obtidos , mas realmente eu não senti nada .
Nem parecia que estava sendo feita alguma coisa comigo .
Fiquei muito impressionada com a quantidade de gordura que saiu da minha barriga .
Eu sabia que tinha um pouco de gordura , mas 3 litros e meio de gordura , realmente !
A recuperação foi bem tranqüila .
Coloquei absorventes nos locais dos furinhos e pude trabalhar tranqüilamente no dia seguinte .
Realmente impressionante .
Recomendo .
Beijos para todos e ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .

Foi uma experiência ótima .
Se soubesse que seria tão tranqüilo , já teria feito há muito tempo !
Não senti dor , nem durante , nem depois do procedimento .
A recuperação foi magnífica e meu corpo ficou muito melhor do que eu esperava .
Atendimento excelente !
Os profissionais são educados , carinhosos , gentis e muito seguros no que fazem .
Confiança total e irrestrita !!!
Recomendo a todos !!!
Abs ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .

Querido Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e Estela , tive um dia bem diferente do usual .
Vocês todos foram tão legais e positivos .
Eu estava nervosa , mas foi muito mais fácil do que eu imaginava .
Eu fiz meus culotes e joelhos e pareceu como se fosse alguns minutos de distração e de repente tudo já tinha terminado .
Fiquei surpresa quando vi que fui cobrada exatamente como está no site de vocês .
Eu estava esperando que fosse ter algum extra de ultima hora , mas foi certinho como demonstrado no site .
Estou agora em casa , na internet , e amanhã já vou trabalhar .
Não precisei tomar nenhum remédio de dor .
Débora , você foi ótima , adorei a sua mãozinha quentinha .
Desculpe se apertei sua mão algum momento , eu nem me lembro direito , foi tão rápido e tranqüilo .
Eu nunca pensei que poderia fazer algo assim , mas vocês fizeram tudo ser muito simples .
Já estou pensando em dar um jeitinho agora no meu abdômen .
Beijos ,
M.C.C .
Querido Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , já se passaram 6 semanas desde o meu procedimento .
Eu voltei para a academia já no 2 º dia .
Estou ótima .
Não tenho palavras para dizer quanto feliz estou com minha cintura pequena e sem aqueles culotes .
Foi tudo perfeito .
Vocês fizeram um excelente trabalho e eu me lembro que senti cócegas e ri durante o procedimento , realmente não tive dor - impressionante .
Vocês todos foram fantásticos e muito positivos .
Muito obrigada ,
Beijos ,
D.C .
Nossa adorei !
Nunca pensei que fosse capaz de realizar a lipo .
Desde criança tenho medo de agulhas e injeções .
Quando tenho que fazer exame de sangue dou um vexame .
Vocês foram fantásticos , fiquei tranqüila e só me lembro bem quando já estava em casa .
Nossa , nem acreditei quando vi tanta de gordura que saiu da minha barriga .
O melhor de tudo é que já sinto as roupas mais folgadas .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter muito obrigada .
Oi pessoal , Só para avisar que a FASE DOIS esta indo muito bem .
Eu fiz meus braços , costas superior e gordura axila da frente há 20 dias e estou impressionada com os resultados .
Apesar de ainda um pouco inchada e dolorida , está ficando ótimo .
Eu tinha decidido manter segredo ( do abdômen que fiz no mês passado ) , mas não estou conseguindo mais .
As pessoas estão me achando diferente com o meu novo eu .
Minha irmã está doida e não pará de perguntar como é a dieta e exercício que eu estou fazendo .
Então acabei tendo que contar …
Eu já estou usando camisas menores ( e ficam ótimas ) .
Eu tive que comprar sutiãs novos , e isso era uma tarefa muito difícil , antigamente .
Aquela gordura de baixo do meu braço e nas costas tornava quase impossível achar um que caísse bem .
Eu estou muito , muito feliz com o resultado !
Eu não consigo acreditar como esta transformação mudou tanto a minha disposição .
Estou cheia de energia e fazendo exercícios regularmente .
Eu juro que me sinto uma pessoa muito mais simpática depois do procedimento !
Muito , muito obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e sua equipe !!!
A.L.
Oi Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter .
Oi pessoal .
Obrigada por me libertar da escravidão das camisas de mangas compridas .
Desde adolescente eu NUNCA tinha usado camisa de manga curta por causa do meu braço gordo .
Já se passaram 4 semanas desde o meu procedimento nos braços e estou muito bem .
Eles ainda estão um pouquinho roxos , mas praticamente não dá pra se notar .
Eu estive trabalhando nestas últimas 2 semanas e percebi que consigo ver os músculos dos meus braços - que eu pensava que não tinha .
Sua equipe é ótima .
Eles são divertidos e profissionais ao mesmo tempo .
Eu queria agradecer em especial a Estela , ela é ótima !
Eu ligava para ela pelo menos 1 vez por semana desde o meu procedimento , sempre perguntando coisas para ela .
Ela sempre me ajudou e dizia que eu podia ligar a qualquer hora .
Esta foi minha primeira experiência fazendo tratamento estético e estou muito feliz de ter encontrado vocês .
Tudo que vocês fizeram foi ótimo e estou super satisfeita .
Estou pensando , em novembro , em fazer meu abdômen e parte interna das coxas .
Mais uma vez , muito obrigada !
M.H.S .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , muito obrigada .
Foi incrível , resolvi e realizei o procedimento .
Eu sou assim decidida .
Foi tudo muito tranqüilo , vocês todos estão de parabéns .
Saí ótima e nem pude acreditar quando você me mostrou toda a gordura que saiu de minha barrica .
Muito obrigada .
Oi pessoal , eu gostaria de agradecer pelo carinho que tiveram durante minha cirurgia nas coxas , culotes e joelhos .
Vou recomendar vocês aos meus amigos .
Vou comprar um vestido bem bonito para realçar minhas curvas e estrear meu novo corpo .
Beijos e obrigada ao Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e equipe !
M.L.C .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e equipe , eu sou muito sortuda em ter achado vocês .
Meu novo
Eu está gatona , e não seria possível sem vocês .
Nunca vou esquecer de vocês , beijos e obrigada .
M.D.
Oi Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , eu só queria dizer , muito obrigada , muito obrigada , muito obrigada !
Sua equipe foi maravilhosa e me fez sentir muito bem e confortável .
É tão bom poder fazer este tipo de procedimento sob anestesia local ao invés da anestesia geral que me faz sentir tão mau no dia seguinte !
O procedimento foi realmente muito simples e nem levou muito tempo .
Eu fiz meu culote , cintura e flancos há 15 dias .
Me sinto ótima .
Comecei a caminhar na minha esteira e levantar pesos leves 5 dias depois do procedimento .
Fui a academia ontem ( mas sem correr - acho que vou esperar mais uma semana para correr ) , mais o resto , estou fazendo .
Não consigo acreditar , minha cintura ficou fina e minhas roupas já mudaram .
Mal posso esperar para tirar a foto de pós com vocês daqui há alguns meses e ver a diferença que ficou .
É impressionante como a minha pele retraiu depois de uma semana .
Eu estou muito pouca inchada e quase nada roxa .
Ontem comprei um biquíni .
Estou muito melhor agora , nunca tive esta cintura !.
O meu primo vai te visitar , ele quer uma consulta .
Obrigada de novo ,
S.E.L .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , valeu !
Há muito tempo que eu não tirava a camisa no vestiário masculino .
Eu morria de vergonha , diziam que eu era mulherzinha por causa da minha ginecomastia .
Não ficou nenhuma cicatriz aparente e quem me vê agora nem imagina que eu tinha aquele " peito " .
Valeu cara !
M.O.S .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , não tenho palavras para te agradecer .................. Já passaram quase 3 semanas e NOSSA , estou impressionada como meu corpo mudou .
Não consigo acreditar quanta gordura saiu de mim .
Se não tivesse aquela foto não acreditaria .
Ainda estou um pouco inchada , mas nem posso esperar para ver o resultado final .
Eu recomendo esta sua técnica a todas as pessoas que estejam lendo sua pagina na internet .
Eu também li e reli toda sua pagina antes de decidir .
MUITO OBRIGADA !!!!!!!!
E.C.R .
Oi Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , vocês são ótimos .
Já se passaram 23 dias do procedimento e eu perdi 10 cm na minha barriga .
Sua página da internet está espetacular , explica tudo , e os testemunhos me ajudaram muito a decidir fazer com você .
Então aqui esta minha história para aqueles que estão interessados : tenho 43 anos , e há 10 anos , 5 dias por semana , tenho comido comidas saudáveis e praticado exercícios , mas não conseguia me livrar da gordura do estômago de jeito nenhum .
Sou de São Paulo e decidi ir e voltar para o Rio no mesmo dia , sozinha ( sou corajosa ) .
Eu tinha meu horário marcado para as 13 Hs , peguei a ponte aérea das 9:30 Hs ( as informações em " pacientes fora do Rio de Janeiro " me ajudaram muito- está ótima ) .
Peguei um táxi no aeroporto Santos Dumont , e chegando na Clinica , fiz uma avaliação estética com a Estela e preenchi as fichas e consentimentos .
Conversei com o Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter e fiz o meu abdômen .
Sua Clinica é bonita e todos são atenciosos .
O procedimento foi simples e mais rápido do que eu pensava .
Todos foram super atenciosos .
Você e sua equipe conseguem nos relaxar e fazer tudo parecer muito fácil .
Não tive muito tempo para ficar descansando depois do procedimento , eu tinha que pegar meu vôo .
As 17 Hs a Estela chamou um táxi , desceu comigo , e me colocou no táxi .
De volta ao aeroporto , meu vôo saiu no horário e às 21 Hs eu já estava em casa são e salva .
Eu acho que fiquei um pouco mais inchada por causa do dia longo que tive ... mais sinceramente , foi muito tranqüilo e vale !
Eu cheguei a tomar 2 ou 3 vezes remédio de dor durante o fim de semana e na segunda feira , 2 dias depois do procedimento , fui trabalhar .
Eu só queria te agradecer pelo seu carinho e profissionalismo .
Eu só me arrependo de não ter feito este procedimento antes .
Muito obrigada !
Beijos ,
H.G.R .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , não tenho palavras para te explicar 0 quanto estou satisfeito .
Fiz a cirurgia há apenas 2 dias e já consigo ver a imensa diferença que fez .
Mal posso esperar para ver como vou ficar depois que o inchaço passar .
É a primeira vez na vida que não tenho " pneus " .
Minha mulher vivia dizendo que eu tinha 2 pneus nas costas .
Meu filho tem o mesmo problema , acho que vou levá - la para o Rio para fazer o procedimento .
Fiquei um pouco preocupado em voltar para Petrópolis dirigindo , mais foi tudo tranqüilo e sem problemas .
Gostei muito da consideração que teve , ligando no dia seguinte , para saber se tudo estava bem .
Vou agora programar meu abdômen completo .
Vou ver se meu filho quer fazer no mesmo dia comigo .
Muito obrigado a todos .
R.F.M.
Olá Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , primeiro , eu gostaria de dizer que você e sua equipe foram FANTÁSTICOS !
Infelizmente só me lembro do início do procedimento , depois acho que dormi .
Quando percebi vocês já estavam colocando a cinta .
Foi muito rápido e sem dor nenhuma .
Fiquei impressionado .
Da próxima vez não vou querer nenhuma sedação do anestesista , aí não preciso de carona e posso dirigir sozinho .
Já se passaram quase 1 mês desde o procedimento .
Estou usando calças antigas que estavam guardadas no meu armário .
Ainda estou um pouco inchado , mas já tem uma grande diferença na cintura .
Um grande abraço a todos .
J.S.C .
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter , fiquei muito satisfeito com o meu resultado .
Já se passaram 4 dias e me sinto ótimo .
Já consigo perceber uma grande diferença , não tenho mais aquele duplo queixo .
Me incomodava muito .
Minha namorada dizia que eu tinha 2 queixos , mas sempre fui assim , desde pequeno .
Agora que sei como é tão fácil e tranqüilo esta sua lipo .
Mês que vem vou voltar para fazer meu abdômen .
Mais uma vez , muito obrigado e um forte abraço .
R.S.S .
Já se passaram 2 semanas desde que eu fiz meu abdômen completo , flancos e culote - Minhas roupas estão todas caíndo .
Não fico mais desesperada procurando uma roupa que caia bem !
Maravilha !!!
Devo ser diferente , praticamente não tive nenhuma mancha roxa .
Vocês todos foram FANTÁSTICOS !
Dr. Eduardo Sitnoveter Muito , muito obrigada !

Researchers believe they have found a second code in DNA in addition to the genetic code .
The genetic code specifies all the proteins that a cell makes .
The second code , superimposed on the first , sets the placement of the nucleosomes , miniature protein spools around which the DNA is looped .
The spools both protect and control access to the DNA itself .
The discovery , if confirmed , could open new insights into the higher order control of the genes , like the critical but still mysterious process by which each type of human cell is allowed to activate the genes it needs but cannot access the genes used by other types of cell .
The new code is described in the current issue of Nature by Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and Jonathan Widom of Northwestern University in Illinois and their colleagues .
There are about 30 million nucleosomes in each human cell .
So many are needed because the DNA strand wraps around each one only 1.65 times , in a twist containing 147 of its units , and the DNA molecule in a single chromosome can be up to 225 million units in length .
