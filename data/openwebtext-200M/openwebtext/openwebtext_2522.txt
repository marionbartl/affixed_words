Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Thursday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown comments on a Massachusetts trooper who ticketed a pregnant woman seeking help .
( CNN ) --
A pregnant woman and her husband are rushing to the hospital in the breakdown lane of a Massachusetts highway .
The story comes from the Boston Globe .
Yes , the couple is going fast .
Yes , they 're in the breakdown lane .
But the woman is in labor , there 's a big traffic jam , and they 're in a considerable hurry for fairly obvious reasons .
So they pull up behind a state trooper to ask for his help in getting to the hospital .
Do they get his help ?
They do not .
They get a ticket instead , for $ 100 , and have to wait while the cop finishes the ticket he was already writing for someone else .
' No bias , no bull '

And after this woman in labor and her husband have been made to cool their heels and have been slapped with a $ 100 dollar ticket -- after all that -- the trooper tops it off by asking Jennifer Davis , the woman in question , to prove she was pregnant .
Watch Campbell Brown 's commentary »
According to Jennifer Davis , the trooper said , " what 's under your jacket ? "
She said , " my belly . "
To which the trooper responded , " okay , let 's see it . "
She was wearing a jacket , it seems , and so perhaps this intrepid law enforcer thought she and her husband were stealing a very large beach ball or something .
Anyway , Jennifer did make it to the hospital with time to spare , and our purpose here is not to heap scorn on the particular trooper who ticketed and slowed down and humiliated a woman while her contractions were three minutes apart .
That 's why we 're not using his name .
Just consider this a memo to the Massachusetts State Police .
You ought to check your troopers ' hats .
One of them is wearing one that 's way too small .

At least three rockets fired from Lebanon exploded in northern Israel today in the first such attack since Israel launched an assault in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip nearly two weeks ago .
Israel fired artillery shells into Lebanon to retaliate for the rockets , which landed after daybreak around the town of Nahariya .
Israeli medical workers said one of the rockets from Lebanon caused light shrapnel wounds to two women in a home for the elderly .
The Israeli military had been on alert for rocket attacks by Lebanon ’s Hezbollah militia , a Hamas ally , since starting the Gaza offensive Dec. 27 .
Police said the rockets were Katyushas , the kind Hezbollah used during its 34 - day war with Israel in mid-2006 .
No group claimed responsibility for today ’s rocket attacks .
Small Palestinian groups unaffiliated with Hezbollah also possess Katyushas .

In Gaza , Israel and Hamas scaled back their fighting Wednesday and weighed a cease - fire proposal from Egypt and France , even as Israeli leaders considered a deeper assault into the Palestinian group ’s urban strongholds .
Fighting on Wednesday in the air , land and sea offensive all but stopped for three hours during a unilateral Israeli pause .
Israeli officials said they wanted to give diplomacy a chance , indicating that a decision either to end or intensify the operation , aimed at halting rocket fire into Israel , could come by week ’s end .
“ From Israel ’s perspective , there ’s no contradiction between pursuing the military targets in Gaza and working in parallel on the diplomatic track , ” said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev .
He added that “ a weaker Hamas is a Hamas that ’s easier to contain ” under any negotiated cease - fire .
Tens of thousands of beleaguered Palestinians ventured into Gaza ’s streets Wednesday afternoon to stock up on food and fuel , flee to safer quarters , or simply unwind .
Fighting bracketed the lull , but the Palestinian death toll , 22 , was the lowest of any day since Israel launched its offensive .
Advertisement
Israel , responding to a worldwide outcry over the punishing toll on Gaza ’s 1.5 million people , suspended its offensive to allow humanitarian agencies to distribute relief supplies .
Israeli officials said such brief lulls would be declared daily .
Hamas largely respected the 1 - to - 4 p.m. pause , which brought calm except for a few reported attacks by each side .
It was the first letup in an Israeli assault that has killed about 700 Palestinians , of whom the United Nations says more than 400 are civilians .
Ten Israelis have been killed since the fighting began , three of them civilians struck by continuing Palestinian rocket fire into southern Israel .
Like Israel , Hamas said it was studying the cease - fire proposal , which is being fleshed out in talks among the United States , Israel , European nations , Egypt and other Arab states .
Egypt said it planned to hold separate talks with Israeli and Hamas representatives in Cairo starting today .
“ Given the diplomatic efforts , I am confident that we can agree within 48 hours on a formula both sides can accept , ” Ahmed Yusuf , a senior advisor to the Hamas government in Gaza , told Israel ’s
Ynet news .

French officials said they had received a commitment from Syrian leader Bashar Assad to urge Hamas to accept a truce .
Syria is a patron of the Islamist group .
Israeli leaders appeared to be seeking a way out of the bloodiest conflict in Gaza since Israel occupied the seaside enclave in 1967 .
Discussion on how to end the operation gained momentum after two events Tuesday : the cease - fire proposal offered by France and Egypt ; and the Israeli shelling of a United Nations - run school in Gaza that killed 43 civilians , raising international pressure on Israel to withdraw .
“ Israel has reached an undesirable point , ” Giora Eiland , a retired brigadier general who once led Israel ’s National Security Council , told Israel Radio .
“ We have become the isolated party . ”

Israeli analysts said the military believed its ground sweep had been well executed but had elicited far less resistance than expected from Hamas in open areas outside the cities , apparently leaving much of the group ’s 15,000 - man paramilitary force intact .
Although the goal of crippling Hamas ’ ability to fire rockets had not yet been achieved , the analysts said , the Israeli military is not eager to take its offensive inside Gaza ’s cities , where Hamas militants are believed to be waiting in a warren of booby - trapped hide - outs and tunnels .
“ That would seem to indicate that the current level of military engagement may continue for another day or two , but then a choice will have to be made between a rapid diplomatic resolution or an escalated military offensive , ” David Horovitz , editor of the Jerusalem Post , wrote Wednesday .
Israel indicated , however , that it would strike harder near the Egyptian border in southern Gaza , which has so far experienced less ground fighting than in the north .
Advertisement
Israel said it carried out 40 airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday , hitting Hamas rocket - launching sites , bunkers and tunnels .
Militants fired 14 rockets into Israel , a far lower number than on previous days .
No serious injuries were reported .
Palestinian medical officials said three sisters from the Abed Rabbu family -- Suad , 6 ; Amal , 4 ; and Samar , 2 -- were killed by an Israeli tank shell in Jabaliya .
Fifteen other civilians were among Wednesday ’s dead , the officials said .
For most Palestinians , the day brought a brief respite .
“ Thank God for this little bit of calm , ” said schoolteacher Yassir Faloje as he watched his five young children play in Gaza City ’s Barcelona Park .
“ My kids have been imprisoned at home for 12 days .
We live near a Hamas security compound and hear the bombing every day and night . ”
Advertisement
Israel allowed in 79 truckloads of relief supplies from international donors and industrial fuel for Gaza ’s power plant .
Palestinian medics sought to retrieve bodies from areas that had previously been too dangerous to approach .
International relief agencies said the lull was too short to even begin relieving Gaza ’s shortages of fuel , electricity , water , food and medicine .
The fuel - starved power plant remained closed , leaving more than a million Gazans without electricity .
Egypt and France called Tuesday for an immediate temporary truce to let in more assistance and give mediators time to arrange a durable cease - fire .
Advertisement
Hamas spokesmen have said they want Israel to withdraw its troops from Gaza and open Gaza ’s borders before they agree to stop shooting .
Israeli officials have said they wo n’t agree to a truce before Egypt , with international assistance , can devise a plan to prevent weapons from flowing through tunnels from Egypt .
The U.N. Security Council met Wednesday but adjourned without taking action .

Times staff writer Geraldine Baum at the United Nations and special correspondent Rushdi abu Alouf in Gaza City contributed to this report .
" And so , to all other peoples and governments who are watching today , from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born : know that America is a friend of each nation and every man , woman , and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity , and we are ready to lead once more . "
– Barack Obama , Inaugural Address , Jan. 20 , 2009
Well , it did n’t long to break that promise .
On Tuesday , Jan. 20 , President Barack Obama said that America , by which we can assume he meant the U.S. government , is a friend of every man , woman , and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity .
But just three days later , the U.S. government used drones to attack and kill at least 20 people in Pakistan , a country with which the U.S. government is n’t even at war .
Of course , President Obama could argue that the attacks were on " foreign militants . "
But some locals in Pakistan claim that four of the dead were children .
If that ’s true , there goes the " child " part of Obama ’s pledge .
Obama could argue that we should n’t be surprised .
After all , during the presidential campaign , he did say that he would be willing to attack Pakistan .
But then he should n’t have made such a pledge in his inaugural address .
The simple fact is that , although Obama wants to wind down the war in Iraq , he wants to escalate the war in Afghanistan and , as he has already shown , is even willing to continue the undeclared war on Pakistan .
In his inaugural address , Obama also stated , " And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty , we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders . "
Yet , according to the AP wire , " Obama has not commented on the missile strike policy . "
This seems to me like indifference to suffering .
Most Americans , I suspect , are indifferent to this suffering .
But Obama is worse than indifferent :
He could have prevented the attacks and chose not to .
Is it just possible that President Obama is a smarter , smoother , more eloquent version of pro-war George Bush ?
As The Who said in one of their famous songs , " Meet the new boss ; same as the old boss . "
And remember the name of the song from which that line comes : " Wo n’t Get Fooled Again . "
During the 2000 presidential campaign , I was fooled by George W. Bush ’s line that he wanted America to have a humble foreign policy .
I was n’t fooled enough to vote for him , but I was fooled , nevertheless .
In my view , to paraphrase Yogi Bear , George W. Bush had a lot to be humble about .
We ’re stuck with President Obama until Jan. 20 , 2013 .
Let ’s at least not be fooled by him .
Let ’s give him credit for his steps to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to end torture .
Also , his choice of Dawn Johnsen for the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel was first - rate .
But let ’s not kid ourselves into believing that he wants to have peaceful relations with peaceful people in other parts of the world .

I had no idea that it was that Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition time of year .
Maybe it ’s because I am not a jock or into sports and feel like the best place to find my masturbation material is on the internet searching “ gaping teen prostitutes with two dicks in their asshole ” , but I know a lot of guys get excited when already established bikini / lingerie models get into their bikinis and lingerie , have their nipples photoshopped out , all because it makes their subscription to this shit finally make sense and worth reading .
Sure SI adds a few athlete ’s and athlete wives into the bikini mix , they do the whole body painted shit , and I ’ve jerked off to the magazine before , but that was in 1988 to Elle Macpherson , when nipples and porn were n’t all that available to a good Catholic 18 year old boy like me , so SI needs to get with the program and start taking spread eagled vagina shots of these whores because we all know these model bitches will do it and still can’t believe how much they get paid to just stand there in a bikini and have there pictures taken , there waiting for the catch , because if it ’s too good to be true it usually is , they ’ve just never been asked .
So Bar Refaeli is the new cover girl … .
I guess Jews Really Are Taking Over the World … .
Here ’s the video… .
BONUS – Here ’s Some Brooklyn Decker Body Paint Pictures ….
And the Video …
I am sure a lot more pictures and videos are going to hit .
I have to decide whether to bother with another post or just keep feeding this one or maybe I ’ll just link you to the source , that sounds a lot easier and they have a staff to make these things better quality than I can , so even if those pieces of shit are n’t paying me to link , I ’m just gonna link them anyway .
See how complicated my life is ?

Vladimir Putin and seven other guests were at the gig , Bjorn Again says An Abba tribute band says it has performed a private concert for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Bjorn Again says it was paid £ 20,000 to play the gig 200 miles ( 320 km ) north of Moscow on 22 January .
Bjorn Again 's manager Rod Stephen and other band members said Mr Putin danced to Abba hits and shouted " Bravo ! "
The PM 's spokesman denied the claim .
Mr Putin - a former KGB spy who has a black belt in judo - is known in Russia and the West for his macho image .
' Paid by Kremlin ' Bjorn Again says that in January it was flown from London to Moscow and then driven north to a place on the shores of Lake Valdai .

The four - member group says Mr Putin and about seven other guests , including a woman , were present at the concert , but they sat on a sofa veiled by a curtain .
" It was the smallest audience we have ever performed to but Mr Putin was really enjoying it , shouting ' Bravo ' and clapping with the others , " Aileen McLaughlin , who performs as Abba 's blonde Agnetha Faltskog , was quoted as saying by the Times newspaper .
" He [ Putin ] was dancing along in his seat to Super Trouper and raised his hands in the air during Mamma Mia when we asked the audience to , " she said .
Bjorn Again says it performed 15 Abba songs during the private gig , claiming that it was paid by the Kremlin .
Mr Putin 's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that the prime minister attended any such concert .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , who succeeded Mr Putin last May , is a well - known fan of British band Deep Purple .
Last year , Mr Medvedev attended a concert by the British rockers to mark the 15th anniversary of the founding of Gazprom .

Liquiditi Solutions organisiert globales virtuelles Forum zur Reaktion auf COVID -19
SEOUL , Südkorea–( BUSINESS WIRE ) –#LiquiditiSolutions –Liquiditi Solutions und Unit Ventures haben erfolgreich das erste Liquiditi Solutions Forum mitveranstaltet , das Ärzte , Wirtschaftsführer und Gesundheitsexperten in den Mittelpunkt stellte , die die Reaktion auf COVID - 19 anführen .
Die virtuelle Konferenz bei Bitcoin Evolution brachte 25 Redner aus vier Kontinenten , darunter Afrika , Asien , Europa und Nordamerika , und Teilnehmer aus aller Welt zusammen .
Liquiditi Solutions bietet Regierungen und Unternehmen ein wichtiges Unterstützungsnetzwerk , indem es den Prozess der Beschaffung lebensrettender medizinischer Geräte und Ausrüstungen rationalisiert und gleichzeitig den Auftrag des Unternehmens erfüllt , die Menschheit vor den katastrophalen Auswirkungen der Coronavirus - Pandemie zu schützen .
Das Unternehmen arbeitete mit Unit Ventures zusammen , um eine einzigartige virtuelle Konferenz zu veranstalten , auf der die Aktionen , Erkenntnisse und Vorhersagen von Branchenführern aus den Bereichen Medizin , Forschung , Versorgungskette , Handelsfinanzierung , Technologie , Nachhaltigkeit und psychische Gesundheit im Zusammenhang mit COVID - 19 vorgestellt werden sollten .
Unit Ventures hat auftragsbezogene Technologielösungen und Netzwerke entwickelt , die sich der Beseitigung von Ungerechtigkeiten in der Welt widmen und gleichzeitig 180 Städte weltweit bedienen .
Das virtuelle Forum umfasste viele angesehene Redner , von akademischen und medizinischen Köpfen der Harvard University und des Columbia University Medical Center bis hin zu globalen Lieferkettenbetreibern und grenzüberschreitenden Technologieentwicklern .
In ihrem Schlusswort zum medizinischen Panel sagte Dr. Dara Kass , Notaufnahmeärztin aus New York City , dass sie hofft , dass Antigentests bald verfügbar und wirtschaftlich vertretbar sein werden , weil sie glaubt , dass dies „ wahrscheinlich unsere beste Chance ist , in eine Routinewirtschaft einzusteigen “ .
Im Panel zu Lieferkette und Logistik von PSA wogen die Experten ihre Gedanken zu den Belastungen , Lösungen und neu entwickelten Verfahren ab , die auf die steigende Nachfrage nach persönlicher Schutzausrüstung zurückzuführen sind .
Zu diesem
Thema sagte Oz Sultan , Chief Information Officer von PAC Global : „ Eine Sache , die wir mit Blockchain versuchen , ist die Integration der ‚rückverfolgbaren , transparenten ‘
Technologie von der Fabrik über die Lieferkette bis hin zu einigen der sekundären Ökosysteme , da in einigen der größeren Krankenhäuser , die an kleinere Krankenhäuser verkaufen und neue Lieferkettensysteme schaffen , ein Nutzen entstehen wird “ .
Hinsichtlich der Wiedereröffnungsstrategien für Unternehmen , die während der Pandemie ihre Türen geschlossen haben , wägte Dr. Karim Bendhaou , der Leiter für Afrika - Angelegenheiten bei Merck Corporation , ab und sagte : „ Der afrikanische Kontinent spiegelt ein breites Spektrum von Ansätzen in Bezug auf die Wiedereröffnung wider , von einem sehr konservativen Ansatz in Südafrika im Vergleich zu einem offeneren Ansatz in den nördlichen Ländern .
Das Problem ist , dass wenn die Abriegelung eine Entscheidung der Zentralmacht ist , dann sollte die Wiedereröffnung lokal erfolgen , weil sie an die reale Situation angepasst werden sollte “ .
Zum Abschluss der virtuellen Veranstaltung tauschten Sozialunternehmer ihre Ansichten über neue Möglichkeiten für zweckgerichtete Unternehmen aus , die sich aus COVID ergeben , gefolgt von Gesundheits - und Wellnessexperten , die über Gewohnheiten und Praktiken zur Stressbewältigung und zum Produktivbleiben diskutierten .
Auf die Frage nach der Veranstaltung sagte Jake Strom , Gründungsmitglied von TOMS und Geschäftsführer von Satori Ventures : „ Das Liquiditi Solutions Forum förderte kritisch wichtige Gespräche über die Chancen und Herausforderungen der heutigen globalen Wirtschaft .
Es war eine Ehre , das Social Impact Panel zusammen mit solch talentierten und leidenschaftlichen zweckgerichteten Unternehmern auszurichten “ .
Moderiert wurde die virtuelle Veranstaltung von Simon Bogdanowicz , CBDO von Liquiditi Solutions ; Michael Healy , Gründer von Unit ; und Alice Hlidkova , CEO und Gründerin von Through the Changing Glass .
„ Wir fühlen uns geehrt , dass es uns gelungen ist , eine so erstaunliche Gruppe versierter Persönlichkeiten zusammenzubringen , um viele wertvolle Informationen für unsere erste virtuelle Veranstaltung zum Thema COVID - 19 - Reaktion und Nothilfe auszutauschen “ , sagte Evan Klassen , Chief Visionary Officer und Mitbegründer von Liquiditi .

アミノ酸系育毛シャンプーとは
市販されているシャンプー剤は主成分によって種類分けされています。
例えば、一般的なもので言えば、石鹸系シャンプーです。
その名の通り石鹸がベースで作られているシャンプーです。
他にも高級アルコール系、石油系などがあります。
これらのシャンプーは安価で大量生産できるため、人気が高いです。
また洗い上がりがさっぱりすることから男性に人気があります。
しかし、端的に言うと、安いものは原価が安いということです。
シャンプーとはいえ、程度の低いものになると洗剤と主成分が変わらないものまであるほどです。
ですから主成分をよく考えシャンプーを選ぶ必要があります。
そこで主成分がよく、頭皮のことをしっかり考えて作っているシャンプーを利用することができます。
それがアミノ酸系の育毛シャンプーです。
特徴は主成分がアミノ酸でできているという点です。
アミノ酸がかたまり、タンパク質が形成されます。
私たちの体も当然、頭皮も、髪の毛もアミノ酸でできています。
ですから、とにかく頭皮にやさしいのです。
低刺激で、しかししっかりと頭皮を洗い上げてくれます。
これにより、頭皮の状態が良いものに保たれ元気な髪の毛が生えてきやすい土壌を作り上げてくれるのです。
成分がいい分、値段もしますが、頭皮のためには最高のシャンプーです。

Ladies , gentlemen : behold , an ECMAScript compiler for Guile !
$ guile scheme@( guile- user ) > , language ecmascript Guile ECMAScript interpreter 3.0 on Guile 1.9.0 Copyright ( C ) 2001 - 2008 Free Software Foundation , Inc. Enter ` , help ' for help . ecmascript@( guile-user ) > 42 + " good times ! " ; $ 1 = " 42 good times ! " ecmascript@( guile-user ) > [ 0,1,2,3,4,5].length * 7 ; $ 2 = 42 ecmascript@( guile-user ) > var zoink = { qux : 12 , frobate : function ( x ) { return random ( x * 2.0 ) * this.qux ; } } ; ecmascript@( guile-user ) > zoink.frobate ( " 4.2 " ) $ 3 = 37.3717848761822
The REPL above parses ECMAScript expressions from the current input port , compiling them for Guile 's virtual machine , then runs them -- just like any other Guile program .
Above you can see some of the elements of ECMAScript in action .
The compiler implements most of ECMAScript 3.0 , and with another few days ' effort should implement the whole thing .
( It 's easier to implement a specification than to document differences to what people expect . )
The " frobate " example also shows integration with Guile -- the random function comes from current module , which is helpfully printed out in the prompt , ( guile - user ) above .
In addition , we can import other Guile modules as JavaScript , oops , I mean ECMAScript objects :
ecmascript@( guile - user ) > require ( ' cairo ' ) ; $ 1 = #<< js-module-object > b7192810 > ecmascript@( guile-user ) > $ 1 [ ' cairo-version ' ] ( ) ; $ 2 = 10800
I could automatically rename everything to names that are valid ES identifiers , but I figured that it 's less confusing just to leave them as they are , and require [ ' % strange - names ! ' ] to be accessed in brackets .
Of course if the user wants , she can just rename them herself .
Neat hack , eh ?
what the hell ?
I realize that my readers might have a number of questions , especially those that have other things to do than to obsessively refresh my weblog .
Well , since I had myself at my disposal , I decided to put some of these questions to me .
So , Andy , why did you implement this ?
Well , I 've been hacking on a compiler for Guile for the last year or so , and realized at some point that the compiler tower I had implemented gave me multi-language support for free .
But obviously I could n't claim that Guile supported multiple languages without actually implementing another language , so that 's what I did .
I chose ECMAScript because it's a relatively clean language , and one that does n't have too large of a standard library -- because implementing standard libraries is a bit of a drag .
Even this one is n't complete yet .
How does it perform ?
Is it as fast as those arachno - fish implementations I keep hearing about ?
It 's tough to tell , but it seems to be good enough .
It 's probably not as fast as compilers that produce native code , but because it hooks into Guile 's compiler at a high level , as Guile 's compiler improves and eventually gets native code compilation , it will be plenty fast .
For now it feels snappy .
There is another way in which it feels much faster though , and that 's development time -- having a real REPL with readline , a big set of library functions ( Guile's ) , and fast compilation all make it seem like you 're talking directly with the demon on the other side of the cursor .
It actually implements ECMAScript ?
And what about ES4 ?
ES3 is the current goal , though there are some bits that are lacking -- unimplemented parts of the core libraries , mainly .
Probably there are some semantic differences as well , but those are considered bugs , not features .
I 'm just one man , except in interviews !
Well , there is one difference : how could you deny the full numeric tower to a language ?
ecmascript@( guile-user ) >
2 / 3 - 1 / 6 ; $ 3 = 1/2
And regarding future standards of ECMAScript , who knows what will happen .
ES4 looks like a much larger language .
Still , Guile is well - positioned to implement it -- we already have a powerful object system with multimethod support , and a compiler and runtime written in a high - level language , which count for a lot .
Awesome !
So I can run my jQuery comet stuff on Guile !!1 !!
You certainly could , in theory -- if you implemented XMLHttpRequest and the DOM and all the other things that JavaScript - in - a - web - browser implements .
But that 's not what I 'm interested in , so you wo n't get that implementation from me !
Where do you see this going ?
I see this compiler leading to me publishing a paper at some conference !
More seriously , I think it will have several effects .
One will be that users of applications with Guile extensions will now be able to extend their applications in ECMAScript in addition to Scheme .
Many more people know ECMAScript than Scheme , so this is a good thing .
Also , developers that want to support ES extensions do n't have to abandon Scheme to do so .
There are actually many people like this , who prefer Scheme , but who have some users that prefer ECMAScript .
I 'm a lover , not a fighter .
The compiler will also be an example for upcoming Elisp support .
I think that Guile is the best chance we have at modernizing Emacs -- we can compile Elisp to Guile 's VM , write some C shims so that all existing C code works , then we replace the Elisp engine with Guile .
That would bring Scheme and ECMAScript and whatever other languages are implemented to be peers of Elisp -- and provide better typing , macros , modules , etc to Emacs .
Everyone wins .
So how do I give this thing a spin ?
Well , it 's on a branch at the moment .
Either you wait the 3 or 6 months for a Guile 2.0 release , or you check it out from git :
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/guile.git guile cd guile git fetch git checkout - b vm origin/ vm ./autogen.sh && ./ configure && make ./pre-inst-guile
Once you 're in Guile , type , language ecmascript to switch languages .
This will be better integrated in the future .
Why have n't you answered my mail ?
Mom , I 've been hacking on a compiler !
I 'll call tonight ;-)
A study involving more than a million women found that drinking the equivalent of just one small glass of wine a day significantly increased the risk of common cancers
Women who drink a glass of wine a day are more likely to develop a range of cancers than are teetotallers , according to the largest study ever conducted into drinking and cancer .
A daily drink was found to significantly raise the risk of breast , liver and rectal cancer , and is estimated to account for more than 7,000 extra cases of cancer each year in the UK .
Researchers at the University of Oxford said the findings , which are part of the Million Women Study , make clear that even light , regular drinking can be a serious threat to health .
Naomi Allen , a cancer epidemiologist who led the research , used medical records to identify cases of cancer among a group of 1,280,296 middled - aged women .
Of the women who drank , the average intake was one unit per day , the equivalent to a small glass of wine or 8g of alcohol .
A pint of beer would count as two units .
Very few of the women consumed more than three drinks a day .
Over a seven - year period , 68,775 women were diagnosed with cancer .
While alcohol seemed to reduce the risk of some very rare cancers , such as kidney , non-Hodgkin lymphoma and thyroid tumours , it raised the risk of others .
For every 1,000 women , drinking regularly once a day was linked to 11 extra breast cancers , one more oral cancer and one additional case of rectal cancer each year .
Cases of oesophageal , laryngeal and liver cancer all rose by 0.7 extra cases per 1,000 women up to the age of 75 .
The increase in cancer risk was the same whether women drank wine , beer , spirits or a mixture .
" In the UK , cancers of breast , liver , rectum , mouth and throat together number about 118 per 1,000 women each year .
Having one drink a day would cause 15 extra cases of cancer per 1,000 women [ per year ] up to the age of 75 , " Allen told the Guardian .
Drinking twice a day would lead to a doubling of extra cases to 30 .
The research is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
Smoking is still by far the largest single cause of cancer , accounting for around one third of all diagnosed cases .
Diet and diet - related factors , such as obesity , are thought to explain a further third , with alcohol accounting for around 5 % of cancers .
" It 's for the government and Department of Health to make and change public health guidelines , but given that this is the largest study in the world to look at this , it 's clear that even at low levels of alcohol consumption , there does seem to be a very significant increase in cancer risk , and most women are probably not aware of that , " said Allen .
" Alcohol intake has less of an impact on cancer rates than smoking , but it 's still hugely significant and it's something people can modify if they want to .
People have to be informed that it increases their cancer risk so they can take responsible action . "
In an editorial published alongside the research , Michael Lauer and Paul Sorlie at the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute in Maryland , US , write : " From the standpoint of cancer risk the message of this report could not be clearer .
There is no level of alcohol consumption that can be considered safe . "
Sara Hiom at Cancer Research UK said : " We know that too much alcohol increases the risk of a number of cancers .
This latest study shows that even relatively low levels of drinking increase a woman 's risk ...
The more you cut down on alcohol , the more you reduce your cancer risk . "
• This article was amended on Monday 2 March 2009 .
We originally said a study had found that one alcoholic drink consumed a day causes 15 extra cases of cancer per 1,000 women per year .
This was wrong .
It caused 15 extra cases per 1,000 women up to the age of 75 .
This has been corrected
The Interior Department announced a controversial decision late Wednesday to double the rate of logging on 2.6 million acres of federally owned forests in southwestern Oregon .
In doing so , it brushed aside the objections of the governor and two federal agencies charged with guarding the quality of the area ’s water and the health of the fish that depend on it .
The decision , which was posted on the Web sites of the Bureau of Land Management ’s Oregon offices , has revived the battle lines formed during the fight over the extensive logging of old - growth timber in the 1980s , a practice blamed for the rapid decline in populations of the northern spotted owl .
The economies of the timber industry and Oregon ’s rural southwestern counties took a major hit when logging on federal lands in the area was cut back by 80 percent under the terms of the Northwest Forest Plan , which took effect about 15 years ago .
Representatives of both groups applauded Wednesday ’s decision , saying it would revive local mills and timber companies .
But environmental groups condemned the decision and gave notice that they would challenge the plan in federal court .
The group Earthjustice called the decision a “ massive giveaway at the expense of salmon spawning streams , healthy old - growth forests and habitat for rare birds such as the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet . ”
Last week 's jailing for six years of veteran dissident Wang Rongqing for " subversion of state power " was more than just another unpleasant instance of official vindictiveness , supporters and human rights groups say .
China is facing a turbulent year of deepening economic hardship , social unrest , and tense anniversaries .
The authorities are running scared .
And so they made an example of Wang .
The diagnosis seems to apply to other prominent dissidents , also feeling the heat as economic boom times fade and political jitters increase .
Liu Xiaobo , a noted literary scholar , has been held without charge since 8 December .
His apparent offence was supporting a new campaign for political and legal reform known as Charter 08 .
According to Amnesty International , Liu's family does not know where he is , he has no access to a lawyer , and he has yet to be charged or brought before a court .
" The use of such detention ... is arbitrary and in violation of international human rights standards , including the rights to liberty , security of person , and fair trial , " said Amnesty 's Roseann Rife .
Charter 08 was signed by 303 Chinese scholars , lawyers and officials , many of whom have reportedly since been harassed or placed under surveillance .
China expert James
Pringle says the campaign , modelled on Vaclav Havel 's Charter 77 in cold war Czechoslovakia , " is the first real opposition to the Communist leadership since Tiananmen Square " and is widely seen as " a threat to the party 's monopoly on power " .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Havel said more than 5,000 people had since defied official hostility and added their names to the charter .
He warned China against making the same mistake as the Czechoslovak authorities in choosing repression over the chartists ' offer of " engagement , dialogue and debate " .
Another leading dissident , environment and human rights activist Hu Jia , meanwhile remains incarcerated after being jailed last year for " inciting subversion " .
The European parliament awarded him the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought last month .
But concerns expressed to China 's president , Hu Jintao , by Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights about Jia 's health and treatment in prison have gone unheeded .
Hardening attitudes to dissent aside , rising official anxiety about challenges to Communist control also appear to form the subtext to a recent crackdown on internet websites .
The reimposition of censorship of foreign sites , such as the New York Times , has been followed by the closure of 91 sites and threats against search engines such as Google and Baidu .
While the authorities ' stated aim is to curb pornography and other " vulgar " content , online political criticism also seems to be a target .
One blogger , Luo Yonghao , said his site had been shut because the government said it contained " political harmful information " .
Analysts link these developments to a string of potentially disturbing anniversaries this year .
They include the 50th anniversary on 10 March of the Tibetan uprising , the 20th anniversary on 4 June of the suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests , the 10th anniversary on 22 July of the banning of the Falun Gong movement , and the 60th anniversary on 1 October of the founding of the People 's Republic .
All these events are controversial in their own way and all could become magnets for trouble .
In normal times , that might not matter quite so much .
But social conditions inside China are anything but normal as the global recession bites .
Official figures indicate up to 10 million rural migrants have already lost their jobs as southern factories close , annual growth falls , and exports decline for the first time in nearly a decade .
In July , 7 million new graduates will place additional pressure on a contracting jobs market .
Add to this standing grievances about party corruption , misgovernance , and the widening wealth gap between rich and poor , and commentators say the risk of widespread social unrest becomes significant .
" In 2009 Chinese society may face even more conflicts and clashes that will test the governing abilities of all levels of party and government , " Xinhua news agency reporter Huang Huo told the officially - sanctioned Outlook magazine this month .
" Without doubt we are now entering a peak period for mass incidents " ( meaning protests ands riots ) .
And these " incidents " , the magazine suggested , were becoming increasingly politicised .
Speaking on the record , Chinese spokesmen play down the prospect of spreading unrest .
" We have the ability and the confidence to ensure the economy 's relatively fast growth and to ensure social stability , " said the foreign ministry 's Qin Gang .
All the same , Outlook magazine 's unusually candid , public warning is seen as an alarm call directed at governing cadres .
The ( uncensored ) message : in a difficult year , persecuting dissidents and closing websites may not be enough to save China 's rulers from a painful reckoning with China 's over - pressured and under - represented masses .
Flying Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest
How did Marxist class warriors end up fighting for the bosses ’ right to fly ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 13th January 2009 .
It would be stupid to claim that environmentalism is never informed by class .
Compare , for example , the campaign against patio heaters to the campaign against Agas .
Patio heaters are a powerful symbol : heating the atmosphere is not a side - effect , it ’s their purpose .
But to match the fuel consumption of an Aga , a large domestic patio heater would have to run continuously at maximum output for three months a year ( 1,2 ) .
Patio heaters burn liquefied petroleum gas , while most Agas use oil , electricity or coal , which produce more CO2 ( 3 ) .
A large Aga running on coal turns out 9 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year ( 4,5 ) : 35 % more than the total CO2 production of the average UK home ( 6 ) .
To match that , the patio heater would have to burn for 9 months .
So where is the campaign against Agas ?
There is n’t one .
I ’ve lost count of the number of aspirational middle - class greens I know who own one of these monsters and believe that they are somehow compatible ( perhaps because they look good in a country kitchen ) with a green lifestyle .
The campaign against Agas – which starts here – will divide rich greens down the middle .
But it is even more stupid to dismiss all environmentalism as a middle - class whim .
It ’s the poor who live beside polluting factories , whose lives are wrecked by opencast mining , who ca n’t afford to move away from the motorways or flood zones .
They are hit first and worst by climate change .
Those who claim that all environmentalists are middle or upper class ignore the tens of millions of peasants and labourers who have mobilised on green issues in South Asia , Africa and Latin America ( 7 ) .
They indulge a transparent sophistry : some greens are aristocrats ; all green issues are therefore the preserve of toffs .
Nowhere is this class - branding more evidently wrong than in the debate over flying .
This week , the government is expected to announce that a third runway will be built at Heathrow .
MPs , airline bosses and rightwing newspapers have been trying to soften us up by insisting that this is happening for the benefit of the poor .
Those trying to stop new runways are toffs preventing working class people from having fun .
The group which has worked hardest to portray the issue this way is the weird cult which arose from the Revolutionary Communist Party .
This Trotskyist splinter , whose chief theorist is the sociology professor Frank Furedi , has spent the past 30 years moving ever further to the right .
The magazine it founded in 1988 , Living Marxism ( later called LM ) , celebrated power and demanded total market freedom .
It campaigned against bans on tobacco advertising ( 8 ) , child pornography ( 9 ) and the ownership of handguns ( 10,11 ) .
It denied that genocide had taken place in Rwanda ( 12 ) , or ethnic cleansing in Bosnia ( 13,14 ) .
It provided a platform for writers from the hard - right Institute for Economic Affairs ( 15,15a ) and Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise ( 16 ) .
Frank Furedi started writing for the Centre for Policy Studies ( 17 ) , which was founded by Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher .
He and the LM writer Tony Gilland wrote to the supermarket chains , offering , for £ 7,500 , to educate “ consumers about complex scientific issues ” ( 18 ) .
LM closed in 2000 , and was replaced by the web magazine Spiked ( 19 ) .
Edited by Brendan O’Neill , it concentrates on denying the existence of social and environmental problems , and attacking protest movements with a hatred so intense and disproportionate that it must contain an element of self - disgust .
O’Neill , who still describes himself as a Marxist , and occasionally blogs for the Guardian , calls environmentalism a “ death cult ” ( 20 ) run by “ fear - mongering , snobbish , isolationist puritans ” ( 21 ) .
The “ anti- flying squad ” is “ illiberal , irrational , parochial , narrow - minded and backward ” ( 22 ) .
Plane Stupid ’s recent protest at Stansted airport , he says , was motivated by “ unabashed , undiluted , unattractive class hatred . ” ( 23 )
If you understand and accept what climate science is saying , you need no further explanation for protests against airport expansion .
But if , like Brendan and his fellow travellers , you refuse to accept that manmade climate change is real , you must show that the campaign to curb it is the result of an irrational impulse .
The impulse they choose , because it ’s an easy stereotype and it suits their prolier - than - thou posturing , is the urge to preserve the wonders of the world for the upper classes .
“ Cheap flights ” , O’Neill claims , “ has become code for lowlife scum , an issue through which you can attack the “ underclass ” , the working class and the nouveau riche with impunity . ” ( 24 )
The connection seems obvious , does n’t it ?
More cheap flights must be of greatest benefit to the poor .
A campaign against airport expansion must therefore be an attack on working - class aspirations .
It might be obvious , but it ’s wrong .
The Sustainable Development Commission collated the figures on passengers using airports in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 ( 25 ) .
During this period , total passenger numbers more than doubled and the price of flights collapsed .
The number of people in the lowest two socio-economic categories ( D and E ) who flew rose , but their proportion fell , from 10 % of passengers in 1987 to 8 % in 2004 .
By 2004 , there were over five times as many passengers in classes A and B than in classes D and E .
Today , the Civil Aviation Authority ’s surveys show , the average gross household income ( ghi ) of leisure passengers using Heathrow is £ 59,000 ( 26 ) ( national average ghi is £ 34,660 ( 27 ) ) .
The average individual income of the airport ’s business passengers ( 36 % of its traffic ) is £ 83,000 ( 28 ) .
The wealthiest 18 % of the population buys 54 % of all tickets ; the poorest 18 % buys 5 % ( 29 ) .
O’Neill champions Ryanair , Britain ’s biggest low - cost carrier , as the hero of the working classes .
So where would you expect this airline to place most of its advertising ?
I have the estimated figures for its spending on newspaper ads in 2007 .
They show that it placed nothing in the Sun , the News of the World , the Mirror , the Star or the Express , but 52 % of its press spending went to the Daily Telegraph ( 30 ) .
Ryanair knows who its main customers are : second - home owners and people who take foreign holidays several times a year .
Who , in the age of the one - penny ticket , is being prevented from flying ?
It ’s not because they ca n’t afford the flights that the poor fly less than the rich ; it ’s because they ca n’t afford the second homes in Tuscany , the ski-ing holidays at Klosters or the scuba diving in the Bahamas .
British people already fly twice as much as citizens of the United States ( 31 ) , and one fifth of the world ’s flights use the UK ’s airports ( 32 ) .
If people here do n’t travel , it ’s not because of a shortage of runway .
At the core of the campaign against a third Heathrow runway are the blue collar workers and working - class mums of the village of Sipson , whose homes are due to be flattened so that the rich can fly more .
If wealthy people do n’t like living under a flight path , they can move ; the poor just have to lump it .
Through climate breakdown , the richest people on earth trash the lives of the poorest .
Yes , this is a class war ; and Brendan O’Neill and his fellow travellers have sided with the toffs .
These Marxist proletarian firebrands are defending the class they profess to hate .
Bosses of the world unite , you have nothing to lose but your planes .

As CO2 has a higher molecular weight than C , I exaggerated the difference between the Aga ’s emissions and those of the average home .
Sorry .
Homes in the UK produce an average of 1.6 tonnes C/year , which translates into 5.87 tonnes CO2 :

City Creek Mall - The Mormon Mall - Downtown Salt Lake City
I Stand All Amazed At The Mall Jesus Built For Me
06/24/2015 by Families r 4vr tithed
I stand all amazed
At the Mall Jesus built for me
Confused at the space .. and
new price Condo's offer me
I stand there and gaze
At the steel , stone and glass so grand
that deeply inside me I know it
it was built by his haaaaaaaaaaaand
Oh , it is wonderful that
He would know my needs
That he would care for me
enough to bring Tiffanys
Oh , it is wonderful
Wonderful to me
I marvel that He would
descend down to the one - true - Mall
to Bring Michael Korrs , Rolex
and Porcshe design
Oh , it is wonderful
that He should build for me
enough to fi ... nance this for me
Oh , it is wonderful
Wonderful to me
I think of pi ..o... neer hands ,
pierced , bleeding to pay the debt
So this gen-er-ation can shop and then soon forget
I cant help but ad - ore the sec-ur-ity on the Mall
to keep out tattoos , gays and homeless so after all
Such Mercy and Love and tith -- ing can I forget ?
No , No I will praise the 12 for No Corporate debt
Oh , it is wonderful that
He would know my needs
grant me prosperity
so I can shop in cool AC
Oh , it is wonderful
Wonderful to me
The City Creek Mall and What the LDS Church Said
10/14/2014 by presleynfactsrock
I made an attempt at poetry also to share how I felt when I finally gave in and visited The Mall .
The corridors were sparsely populated and not even the aroma of food seemed to invite me in .
I too , noticed the sad , sagging homeless close by .
The Mall
I had to view
Part did n't want to
But one drug the other in
To see this so - called mall of sin .
It was breath - taking
I agree
Built to impress
Entirely .
See the temple
See the mall
Do n't forget
We built them all .
But the homeless
Sitting near by
Said it all
With the blink of her eye .
I sit and sit
I wait and wait
Hearing the refrain
The mall is great .
Great to who ?
To me , to you ?
Hardly , why no ...
I dread the snow .
The City Creek Song to the tune of When Upon Life 's Billows
09/30/2014 by Cokeisiknowdrinker
When upon life 's billows and you need to shop
When you are discouraged at the parking lots
Come to CITY CREEEEK , ..... each and everyone
And it will surprise you what God 's corp - or - ation 's done
C.... ount your mone ...y , hundreds ... fives and ones
C.... ount your credit cards and see what sales are on
Ignore the home ....... less outside the temple walls
Count how endless tithing had .... no effect at all .
Are you ever burdened with the lines at Gap
Do your bags seem heavy as you shop at Mr. Mac
C...... ount your money ... and GAZE up in the sky
Ask yourself why Condo prices ... are so high .
When you shop at City Creek with diamonds and the gold
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth un .... told
C - o -u - n-t your many blessings , with Credit on your side
No reward in heaven , ... just this palace in the sky
So amid the conflict at the check out stands
Do not be discouraged at five billion spent
C...ount your many blessings at the tithing you sent in
Question not the leaders that would be co-mitt - ing sin
C..... ount your money , hundreds , fives and ones
C.... ount your money and scorn - those that cannot come
C.... ount the tithing ... sent in by me and you
Count the money and ignore Mormon 8 verse3 2
Are you ever burdened with a load of debt ?
Does the cross seem heavy when you 're tithed to death
Count your many blessings as your house is reposessed
And keep ever faithful in the state of most depressed .
So , amid the conflict whether great or small ,
Do not be disheartened , God is owner of the mall ;
Count ... your many blessings , angels will attend ,
Help and comfort give you till your shopping ends
Haiti vs. City Creek Center ( and the winner is ......)
02/16/2010 by Odell Campbell
( hit the links , the pictures speak for themselves , but I added commentary anyway )
I just read a story about the LDS church Õs efforts ( and back patting ) regarding its plan to distribute 600 Òtemporary housing kitsÓ to Haitian members before the rainy season starts in April .
The story contains a picture of the ÒkitÓ which is mostly several pieces of 2 x 4 lumber and a piece of corrugated tin .
( http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700009386/LDS-Church-to-build-temporary-housing-in-Haiti.html)
It would be nice if the LDS church could make a similar investment in Haiti as it is making in downtown Salt Lake City with the City Creek Center .
( http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/57379/Rising-on-schedule.html)
I guess the churchÕs position is that the expenditures in Haiti should be keep at a minimum as the money would only be helping the poor , hungry , homeless and needy .
However , its efforts in Salt Lake are more important as they embellish the churchÕs business image and headquarter environment , produce business income , and create job opportunities ( perhaps by running businesses through family connected contractors ) .
Update on City Creek Center –
Oh my , how the costs have grown
11/12/2009 by The Mighty Builder
The Mormon Church has now admitted that the cost of the City Creek Center Project is “ officially ” 3 Billion Dollars .
This is by no means the end of such announcements .
As I have revealed previously , the Mormon Church fully expects the cost of the project to reach 8 Billion Dollars .
Their feeling is that by making periodic announcements about cost increases no one will remember that Gordon B. Hinckley stated at the start of the project that the Projected costs at about 750 to 950 Million Dollars .
Also they believe that by incrementally announcing cost increases the increases can be blamed on economic conditions and / or contractor faults .
Thus keeping them from having to admit they knew the true cost in the beginning .
You guys are missing the biggest benefit of this project .
- by OlMan
The project completely blocks any view of the temple from the south .
You have to be directly west of the temple on the freeway before you can see it .
Just how much does it come to cost per member ?
- by Nebraska nevermo
Based on 8 billion dollars , and the LDS church 's long - stated membership of 12 million members , that works out to ... $ 666 per member .
The mark of the beast ?
Marriott Center for the Erotic Arts
11/12/2009 by 3X
Please , please , please tell me that there will be a Marriott Center for the Erotic Arts opening in the new City Creek Mall - I do n't feel like staying in a hotel every time I want porn , but I do want to make sure that the mormon ' church ' gets its ten percent : the ' prophet ' needs his cut .
Imagine how different the Christmas devotionals are going to be in the coming years
11/12/2009 by Peter
I can just picture it now .
Monson : Now , brothers and sisters as we commemorate the birth of our lord and savior Jesus Christ on this special holiday season , be sure to stop by Macy's in the City Creek Mall across the street for all your special holiday shopping where you can't beat their low low prices and get top dollar .
Right now they are offering a 50 % off special if you mention this talk .
In the name of Jesus Christ , Amen .

Despite the economy City Creek condos are selling well
04/17/2009 by bender and others from Recovery from Mormonism
You gotta admit the Mormon church sure knows how to make money off it 's members .
Rich Mormons are snapping up the condos to get that view of Temple Square and show how righteous they are .
Despite predictions of failure , City Creek Center will likely be a success due to the faithful members buying up everything the morg puts out .
LDS Inc. is a business before they are a church , they know how to make money .
www.sltrib.com/News/ci_12151266
" OK , so $ 2 million for a family loft downtown sounds steep .
So , too , does $ 1 million for a one - bedroom condo or a half - million for a stylish but teensy studio .
But maybe not -- for a moneyed Mormon who yearns to live across the street from the faith 's most iconic symbol : the Salt Lake Temple .
After all , how much would a Catholic pay for a condo view of the Vatican or an Orthodox Jew to live near the Wailing Wall ? "
The condos may do well , but the mall will fail by AxelDC
The 2nd largest Mall owner in the US just failed today .
The mall has been dying for some time , and a mall that is closed on Sundays is doomed in the best of circumstances .
The church is going to lose its shirt on this , and it also begs the question :
Why is a church building a shopping mall ?
Why is the Church building the big and spacious building .... Simple answer - by anon
There is no such thing as " non-tithing " revenue .
The church uses this canard to excuse all their abusive expenditures .
The church has 2 forms of revenue :
A ) Tithing
B ) Investment dividends from investing surplus tithing .
The fact that Group B is so large means that the church is receiving too much tithing from its members and spending too little of it on their welfare .
Members are not told that most of their tithing money is used to grow LDS , Inc. , not for the pastoral care of its members .
While any non -profit should wisely protect its resources , that money should be poured back into the primary mission of the organization , not for feathering the nests of its executives .
This is just a form of money laundering by LDS leaders , all done without any accountability to its membership .
You should ad C ) Gifts - by Guy Noir , Private Eye
lots of ( Well - to - do & other ) members are soooooooooooo enamoured of tscc ... that they give their accumulated wealth to ' The Morg ' rather than to family ....
I bet THAT makes a lot of otherwise TBM's ' thrilled '
I was sitting in a construction meeting yesterday - by elee
Here in SLC .
The project managers from the construction company ( Layton , one of the biggies ) , the architects , the electrical engineering sub , the mechanical sub , the estimators , etc .... bar none were discussing how busy things have gotten in the past month after several months of lay offs and other firms going out of business .
I would conjecture LDS , Inc. will be experiencing the same turn around , provided their bottom line is in order ( and I assume it is ) , I reckon they 'll get their mall built and sell most of the condos .
However , with enforced Sunday closures , even for non-mormon tenants , they are going to face steep competition from nearby venues which do open on Sundays .
Which is when I shop .
So I wo n't be spending my money at the Mormon Mega Mall of ' Merica .
Liquor licenses in the restaurants aside , if shopping there is n't conducive to my schedule , I wo n't be spending money there .
Condos are selling well - by LifeIsGreatNow
Yep , definitely seems like a move for the rich GAs to surround themselves with rich Mormons so the rest of the world can see how holy they 've all been .
You remember that their Book of Mormon clearly says that " the righteous will prosper in the land . "
Here 's proof that all these leaders / leaches will suck as much tithing money from struggling and poor members as possible to appear " righteous in the land " .
How pathetic , again , for the Church to build and sell full floor - to - ceiling window apartments that overlook their blessed church building to the Mormon rich while the Mormon poor unspeakably suffer to support it .
Oh !
I almost forgot !
Tithing money was n't used - it was just the investment returns seeded and used from tithing money !
I wonder if they ever considered using that money for the poor instead , including impoverished members ?
Oh !
I almost forgot again !
These poor members have n't been righteous enough to deserve what the rich church leaders deserve .
How silly of me to forget .
The restaurants will be allowed to file for a liquor license - elee
or tavern license , depending on which they prefer .
The current scuttlebutt is the church did not interfere with getting rid of the Private Club Law from Utah 's liquor statutes because it would impact their own bottom line .
If you 've ever worked in a restaurant , you know that the profits are made with liquor sales , and even then , profit margins are razor thin .
Without liquor , might as well not even open .
The LDS where money talks by ABCD@xyz.com
From what I saw , TSCC made sure the change would happen .
There were some legislators that were hell bent on stopping the change , but after the LDS meet with Utah Law makers , those that opposed the change were all on board , and they got very little if anything in return for their support .
Why the surpise ? - by Luman Walters
Both Joseph Smith in Nauvoo and Brigham Young in Salt Lake City established and made money from bars / the liquor business .
blind eye to liquor sales - by LifeIsGreatNow
Most likely they turn a considered blind eye to liquor sales , you know , like they do when mega tithe payer J. Willard Marriott shows porn in his hotel rooms .
After all , J. Willard Marriott has a two name , one initial name - just like the General Authorities !
Yep , if you pump enough tithing into the Church coffers you can get away with anything .
A non-paying Mormon doing the same would have his sorry ass kicked to the curb , probably by some self righteous Stake President .
Rich tithe paying Mormons are protected by the rich GAs with a vengeance .
Here 's the LDS statement on restaurants & liquor - by elee
" Will alcohol be available at any location in the project ? "
" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints has consistently made plain that in matters of public policy it is not opposed to responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages by informed adults . "
" Current state laws in Utah balance responsible consumption with measures to discourage alcohol abuse , reduce impaired driving and eliminate underage drinking . "
" In City Creek Center , a limited number of high - quality restaurant tenants who will operate on land not owned by the Church may apply for licenses to serve alcoholic beverages in accordance with existing state regulations . "
Restaurants will be open on Sundays - by forestpal
So , the rich Mormon condo owners will have a place to eat Sunday dinner , and the thousands of worthy tourists flocking to Temple Square will have places to nourish and strengthen their bodies .
I know some of the people who have bought a condo in the " New Downtown Salt Lake City " ( they do n't like to use the dirty word , ' mall ' )
Most families have bought more than one .
It is definitely IN to have one of those condo's .
I mean , anybody who is ANYBODY will have one .
I know that a lot of these people have been given a second anointing , and are HUGE contributors to the church .
The ones I know are in business together , employ relatives , marry their children to each other , employ only Mormons , and most of the originators went to high school together , and were in the same ward .
They are like family ( Mafia ) .
Talk about your priestcrafts to get gain .
- by badseed
LDS inc creates a demand for a belief system that supplies a sense of belonging and a steady flow of warm fuzzies .
Then it proceeds to cash in on that — tithing , GA book sales , education week fees etc etc .
I always fond it weird that Joseph Smith was usually in charge of land sales whenever the Saints gathered somewhere Now I see its the same thing .
Create the demand and then cash in .
I bet they will open Sundays eventually - by BYU Alum
When I was at the Y , the Orem mall was closed on Sundays .
I remember the mall manager writing an editorial in the Herald stating that the Orem mall would Never be open on Sundays .
Guess what ?
Yep , the mall eventually opened on Sundays .
My bet is that the greedy bastard in TSCC will eventually open the mall on Sundays .
Yep .
I remember when Dan's Foods & Smith 's Food King - by elee
were closed on Sundays .
Now several are open 24/7 .
It 's always about the bottom line .
If money is being diverted to Gateway and Fashion Place Mall due to Sunday closures , I reckon there 'll be a revelation - based business decision to change the schedule tout - suite .
Should n't it be " City CRICK Condos " in keeping with the Utah dialect ?

My condo is bigger than some of those , has more amenities and I got it for $ 130,000 .

Why anyone would spend that much to live downtown is beyond me .
Oh yeah , my furniture is better than that in the newspaper picture .
You can buy a lot with all that money you did n't spend on the City Creek Condo .
The Morg 's Financial Furture is not in God's Hands --
It 's in Nordstrom's !
03/28/2009 by Billion Shmillion and others from Recovery from Mormonism
From MSN MONEY :
IS THE AMERICAN MALL DYING ?
" Developers face the music
The slumping retail industry means a lot of worry for the people who build and own the malls .
The presence of anchor stores is written into lease terms at many malls .
Mall developers actually pay the anchor retailers –- from $ 2 million to $ 6 million per store -- to become shopping center tenants , Davidowitz explained .
Leases for smaller stores include guarantees that the anchors will be present .
If mall owners can't fill the anchor spaces vacated by Steve & Barry 's , Macy 's or other retailers , many other leases will be in jeopardy . "
________________________________________________
It 's a good thing that God is personally in charge of the Billion - dollar + City Creek Mall .
On the other hand , if the Mall brings the Morg down , how will our Prophets , Seers , and Revelators ever explain things ?
Church is gonna take a bath on this one - AxelDC
The LDS Church is gonna lose its shirt on the White Elephant Mall .
You do n't have to be a prophet to realize that shopping malls are a dying industry .
The church is in for $ 3 billion on the White Elephant Mall .
That 's up from original estimates of $ 2 billion .
The ZCMI Center failed because it was closed on Sunday , driving away customers and retailers .
The WEM will be closed on Sundays as well , further gimping the project .
The value of the land has plummeted with the real estate bubble .
The church has lost a fortune in the stock market crash .
The WEM will open under shaky economic times , if the recession has n't already cleared .
This investment is going to cost them dearly .
Why a church should be building shopping malls is beyond me , but as a capital venture , this mall just reeks of red ink .
This is not recession .
It 's a full on world - wide banking collapse .
- Rubicon
There is $ 1.5 Gazillion in outstanding derivatives worldwide .
Yes .
A Gazillion is a real number .
This makes every financial institution in the world practically insolvent .
They are trying to have governments buy up these bad assets but their are too many to buy up completely .
Plus the central banks are printing money like crazy which will bring in hyperinflation later .
They are trying to paper over this by using so called govt .
bailouts but this money has only gone to the desperate and broke bankers who are doing what they can to take over entire governments using fear and desperation as the excuse to empower themselves politically .
In other words , fascism is rearing it 's ugly head with a banking oligarchy engineering it because it 's the only thing they can do to keep power because they are broke and they know it .
In other words .
Paper assets are worthless so the smart people are grabbing for control of real assets .
But ... but ... the stock market is up 20 % this month !
- Jim Cramer
If prophets , seers , and revelators do n’t work , maybe Profits , Sears , and Realtors will .
- Robert Oh
It seems like Prophets , Seers and Revelators - CA girl
would have seen this coming .
Or were they talking as men when they got into this plan ?
You'd think the Lord , who may not tell his prophets everything , might mention to them that they were wasting his money and jepordizing his church .
Oh , wait .
None of it belongs to any Lord .
That 's right .
I figured that out months ago .

Developers elsewhere in the Salt Lake valley are facing reality .
- Watcher
Look at the old Cottonwood Mall .
Or try -- it 's gone .
And the developers who were going to come in with something better have basically left town .
Now there 's just acres of open dirt there .
It 's the same thing in Sugar house , that once - famous corner is now just open dirt behind a chain link fence .
AT least they finaly filled the hole .
Speaking of holes in the ground , there 's an old line that says : " When you find you 're in a hole , STOP DIGGING ! "
But the church is too proud to stop .
The church will pull assets in from where ever it can to finish Hinckleys bridge to nowhere .
- Rubicon
This banking crises is horrid and it 's worldwide .
Every major bank is basically insolvent and now governments have become the end creditor .
We are going to see whole countries evolve into something else .
Possibly trade unions like the European Union or melt down into anarchy with tyranny eventually replacing it .
It wo n't be pretty .
This being said , I wonder if the LDS Church can weather such a storm .
It 's members will look to it for help but will it be useful ?
Can it really help ?
To me , the people running the church seem more interested in waging political wars with the gay community , building luxery malls , and building temples nobody needs or really wants anymore .
You said it the best , Watcher ... - MRM
the church is to proud .
That sums up many of the problems of the mormon church .
They are to proud to say they are wrong .
I know Eric Nordstrom and I tried to tell him he was building too many stores years ago .
- Rubicon
Nordstroms fell into the same trap most retailers have .
It became a game of build more and when commercial real estate could be financed with zero money down the thought of saturating the market was appealing .
At the time The Mall of America store opened , Nordstroms only had $ 40 million in cash .
The rest was pure leverage .
When the economy started faltering it hit at the top first .
Many luxery stores are feeling the pain and even luxery real estate is getting hit .
I think we will see Nieman Marcus go out of business this year .
The only retailer that wo n't get hit hard is Wal - Mart .
The rest of them would start dropping and cities will be filled with empty big box stores with nobody to fill them other than homeless vagrants .
It 's going to be a mess .
They have n't been paying attention to modern urban planning theory .
- flattopSF
If they had created a desirable environment for a creative core to move in and take over , they would have redevelopment coming out their asses .
Look at San Francisco's SoMa , or Los Angeles ' downtown .
Too bad for the idiots running the cult they do n't like creatives .
Or feminists .
Or intellectuals .
Or gays .
A healthy combination of all of the above would have been all they needed to fix their dead dead dead downtown .
Pity .
Looks like they 're gonna lose their Jesus Jammies on Moroni's Mega Mall .
I hear that - Taddlywog
I talk to a lot of corp folk and they seem to like to unburden themselves on anonymous techs .
They are leaving California and you cant help but notice the isles in the retail stores are getting wider as the number of shelves are being reduced .
And still there is not enough inventory to keep the shelves filled .
Basic supply and demand would suggest high inflation is next .
Our government keeps giving money away like it is worthless .
Definately not a good time to build a mall .
Commercial real estate is the next round to fall , so we have n't ... - Sad Stuff
... even seen the worst of it yet .
This is no time to be building a high - end mall !
But they keep sinking their money in it , what will it take before they face the facts ?
Stock market UP 20 % , housing is bottoming , recession is OVER , happy times are back !
- Jim Cramer
Canadian Sam's club stores have all closed - 6 iron
I 'm not sure why but here in Canada , all of the Sam 's clubs have closed .
The one in my city is now empty .
The big mall that was built downtown became empty .
It has redefined itself and the big city library took over a department store , and the mall is barely surviving because of changing itself from usual mall type stores to whatever type stores .
Introducing the KOLOB Express Card !
01/26/2009 by Primus
Kolob lies many millions of trillions of light years away , but just imagine what exciting goods are created on the world where God lives .
It would have malls that make the Mormon City Creek Mall look like your local convenience store .
It would have golden paved streets and shine so brightly that Las Vegas would be like an outhouse in comparison .
The possibilities of goods available to consume are UNBELIEVABLE !
It 's quite something to think about .
But you can't just go to Kolob and purchase items using a simple Visa , Mastercard , or American Express .
Even the dollar would n't get you far .
That is why you need the Kolob express card !
With an unlimited credit limit , and an unlimited grace period , you can shop like you 've just won the lotto .
And since you are immortal , you will have plenty of time to pay back the expenses .
With a fair apy of 10 % , how can you lose ?
Just Imagine - sing to the tune : " If you could hie to Kolob "
If you could buy on Kolob from one of Eloheim 's wives ,
A purse , a scarf , an afghan , even cola , burger and fries ,
Do you think that you could ever , Through all eternity ,
Ever reach the spending limit , so you 'd never be debt free ?
Buy a house to live in , or your current space extend ?
Or buy some gold laced slipper , or some platinum plated Depends ?
Me thinks the Spirit whispers , Kolob is an awesome place !
How bout some brand new curtains , or a gazebo at your place .
The works of God continue , And worlds and lives abound ;
Improvement and progression
Have one eternal round .
There is no end to material goods ;
You can rent more storage space ;
There is no end to spirits ;
You can get yourself real blazed .
There is no end to spending ;
There is no end in sight ;
There is no end to buying ;
You can gamble through the night .
You could bribe a workers union ;
Or corrupt impressionable youth ;
There is no end to what you could do ;
There is no end to graft .
There is no end to whoring ;
But perhaps an end to love ;
There is no end to eating ;
You can almost weigh a ton .
There is no end to golfing ;
Or buying brand new Suns ;
There is no end to spending ;
Just pay back 2 % a month .
Yes my Gods and Goddesses , with the Kolob Express , you can be a high roller and have more apparent glory than the God standing next to you with our card .
Live the high life you thought you would have when you received your eternal exaltation and stick it to the lower Gods !
A Nordsrom executive see's the Mormon $ 1.5 billion mall as a huge fiasco
03/11/2007 by TRubicon
My wife is from Seattle and one of her relatives has worked for Nordstrom 's for years and now is a top executive in the company .
She started as a sale 's rep and worked her way up the ladder .
She helped Eric Nordstrom run the Mall of America store .
From selling merchandise , to being a buyer , to managing stores , to working at corporate , this person has seen every level of a higher end retail clothing chain .
My side of the family are contractors .
My dad built luxery homes and lodges in the Sun Valley area .
My uncle is a big industrial contractor in the Las Vegas area and knows a lot about large projects that are suppossed to attract people .
My uncle laughed and said the church is trying to build the Belagio in downtown Salt Lake City without the gambeling .
Of course he was joking because the new mall wo n't be anything close to the Belagio .
He says $ 1.5 billion is a lot of capital investment to recover and the new mall could become outdated before that happens or worse , be a big loser from the get go .
The Norstrom executive said large malls do well in very cold climates like Edmonton or Minniapolis but in a place like Salt Lake City with nice malls in the suberbs why would enough people go to make such a huge project work ?
She said Nordstroms wanted to get out of the Crossroads Plaza mall that the church owned to relocate to the Gateway Plaza Mall and the church was not nice to deal with and held them to their lease .
Now the church is going to demolish the Crossroads Plaza Mall .
She said how can little ol ' Salt Lake rent high end space with the Gateway Mall a few blocks west ?
Apparently the church is already hitting up Cartier and Gucci to be future tennants .
My uncle laughed and said they better pay the chuch employee better since the church is the largest employer in Utah .
He just sighed and said the church is building it 's Vatican since metropolitan SLC has evolved into a liberal city with a difersified minority base .
Mormons are actually a minority .
The church feels threatened by this and is willing to spend so much money in downtown Salt Lake , they make their presence known .
They are trying to make everything church owned bigger and better .
In short , the church is trying to compensate for it 's shrinkage by building another huge masterpiece across from Temple Square .
It 's not a wise use of the money , but since when has the church ever been wise with it 's money .
It 's been broke for most of it's history and almost went broke again in the late 1950 's due to overexpansion .
Amazing .
When the church caught flak for closing the old Hotel Utah , Gordon B. Hinckley told the saints the church was losing money on it .
He then addmitted the church was n't very good at running commercial enterprises and these were better managed by the private sector than the church .
So Gordo admitted the church does n't run businesses well .
Go figure .
Excellent observation - Cults in decline , from " The Guru Papers " - by John Corrill
Rubicon said : " In short , the church is trying to compensate for it 's shrinkage by building another huge masterpiece across from Temple Square " .
From " The Guru Papers : Masks of Authoritarian Power " , ( Kramer & Alstad ) : " When a [ spiritual leader ] realizes that most people are not going to acknowledge him , he often compensates ( if he can afford it ) by building monumental edifices that proclaim hes greatness .
This includes monuments or temples , buildings , model communities , and " learning centers . " ... This not only keeps disciples busy and distracted , but it is necessary because the flow of resources that came with expansion has greatly diminished .
This glorification of work always involves improving the leaders property , increasing his wealth or some grandiose project .
Oh my Mormon God , will Hinckley ever stop ?
Part 1
01/13/2007 by The Mighty Builder
I just came from a meeting at our corporate headquarters where the subject of instruction was the current building projects and projected projects in Utah and SLC and how we ( my company ) are going to meet the needs .
Some interesting facts that came from the meeting .
1. The City Creek Center :
a . Our company estimates that the true cost will be $ 6 – $ 8 billion dollars .
This is based on the following facts .
1 . This is a fast tract project .
The construction of one 22 story tower and two 18 story towers would normally take three to five years alone .
Add in all the auxiliary buildings , infrastructure ( sewer , waterlines , communication lines , etc. - oh yes and the mole people tunnels ) , street level improvements , etc .
It costs a lot of money to keep a project like this on track for the short amount of construction time available .
After all they are destroying two city blocks and replacing them new in 48 months ( project end date to be 2011 ) .
As the presenter stated “ Imagine if two city blocks in Manhattan were to be removed and replaced , oh that ’s right , the “ Freedom ” towers and complex are .
Could that be done in 48 months ?
NO WAY .
The “ Freedom ” tower alone is projected to take six to eight years . “ ( by the way , the Freedom tower is only one city block ) .
2. Competition from current construction projects for labor .
Legacy Highway , Draper Temple , South Jordan Temple , TRAX expansion , Commuter Rail , Housing projects like Kennecott Day Break , Retail and Commercial construction to service the current construction projects etc. , all have placed a demand on available man power and crafts .
To compete with these projects the City Creek Center construction companies ( Jacobson , Oakland and Big D ) are going to have to pay premium wages and salaries .
This means no more day labors at $ 5.25 per hour .
Our company projects that a helper is going to be paid $ 14.50 per hour .
Can you say Hurricane Katrina prices ?
3. Competition from current construction projects for materials .
To compete with the current projects the City Creek Center construction companies ( Jacobson , Oakland and Big D ) are going to have to pay premium prices for materials .
Even with the Mormon church buying direct from the manufacturers , the materials will be more expensive as the delivery dates will cause the materials to be rush orders .
The Mormon church is notorious for waiting until the last minute to purchase materials ( maybe they think that construction supplies will be found on - site every morning like “ manna ” from heaven ? ) .
This fact of delayed buying caused the conference center costs to rise from the projected $ 315 million estimate to the final cost of $ 1.1 billion .
4 . There currently is a shortage of qualified workers .
Our company estimates that when started City Creek Center will demand an extra 25 000 to 35 000 workers .
Our company estimates that mid project there will be over 100 000 construction workers needed .
These individuals will have to come from out of state .
( So , if you can swing a hammer and bend a nail , head to SLC , hell if you own a hammer come to SLC ) .
Funny side note , unless they make construction of the City Creek Center a mission calling , the influx of workers are not going to be Mormon .
So not only are they going to over pay for the workers , they will loose 10 % more of their money .
5 . The cost of just getting to “ zero dirt ” our company estimates will be between $ 450 - $ 650 million .
This includes demolition of the current buildings , moving and relocating ( breaking leases ) tenants out of the current buildings , removing all current utilities and replacing with new that meet up to date requirements ( seismic , materials , etc. ) .
One of the presenters expressed the biggest concern .
FAST TRACK = FAST CRAP .
What he means is that the City Creek Center will be built on 7 day cures for the concrete ( 7 days is the minimum allowed , whereas 28 day is the best cure ) , hastily constructed supports , minimum welds , and every other short cut that can be done to save time .
He pointed out that the Conference center was a fast track and it is already having major problems ( leaking roof , panels falling off , interior wall are wet , etc. ) .
Yes kiddies , believe it or not , there is more .
Part 2 is coming soon .
Church Office Buidling : crappy , sick building by substrate
Anyone who has worked in the COB as I have knows how poorly constructed that building is .
My friend , who is a structural engineer at the COB , told me that the concrete facade was not attached properly and will eventually come off .
Most interior walls are cheap vinyl dividers , and everything was obviously done " on the cheap . "
While I was there , they did a " peripheral unit retrofit , " wherein they replaced all the airflow vents with smaller vents .
This kicked up clouds of dust for weeks , and I have had allergies since then .
Also , while there I developed an infection of the cartilage between my ribs that would not go away until a few weeks after I quit .
Coincidence ?
Maybe .
Jeez , I sound paranoid , but it really was a crappy place to work .
How did you forget to mention the CARPETS !!! by Nom de Cypher
The same sick carpets that have been there since the building was built in the 70s , and it shows .
Just looking at the carpet made me a little queasy .
And I 'm sorry , but I had to laugh outloud when I saw that they were patching up rips with duct tape .
Seems like a fitting metaphor .
This is Just the Beginning of Cost Over rides by Construction Man
Anyone in the construction business knows that their are unexpected costs before you start the project .
So a certain amount is set aside .
In the project thsi big no - one nows what those costs are .
The owners miss something and their is another charge for that .
Given the fact that their is a concrete shortage in North America right now , it will be hard to predict how this affects the costs of a job .
Right now in Toronto constrction companies are out bidding each other just to get concrete and remember this mall has not even started a building yet .
How does this affect costs .
There is also a copper shortage so this affect the electrical work .
These shortages are caused by world wide demands .
As for 7 day cure vs 21 day curse its a big problem too .
Bottom line I think I will like to work on this project for all the overtime .
Plus seeing jsut how cheap this mall will realy be built .
Reminds me of the Bountiful temple .
I saw all these pictures and went wow .
Then went to temple to find what I thought was solid blocks of rocks and stones were only plastic .
Even inside what looked like plaster wwas plastic .
What a disappointment .
God 's house was made of plastic instead of solid materials , but it looks like marble and stone .
Oh my Mormon God , will Hinckley ever stop ?
Part 2
01/15/2007 by The Mighty Builder
2. Salt Lake Valley Temples ( Draper and South Jordan )
These are a fast track projects .
The construction of the two temples has been accelerated .
Reason – The Salt Lake City temple needs seismic up grades so the two new temples will be constructed on a fast track schedule ( one and a half years ) .
This means crappy construction , cost over - runs , construction delays , etc . I discussed in Part 1 of my posting .
Probable cost of each temple Draper – $ 450 million , South Jordan $ 385 million .
3. Ensign Plaza South
The Mormon church is concerned about the blight that surrounds the Ogden temple .
Therefore they are constructing a five story office tower named Ensign Plaza South .
The project is under construction at this time .
The cost is estimated at $ 75 – 125 million .
4. Church Office Building
As I discussed in another thread , the COB concrete facing is disintegrating because of rebar corrosion .
The Mormon church plans on re-facing the BIG PENIS starting about 2008 .
An announcement will be made that the structure is aging , needs seismic up grades and in order to preserve the continuity of Temple Square a new façade of Granite will be used to cover the steel framing .
At this same time true seismic up grading ( cross beam supports , shear planes , etc. ) will be done .
The costs will be between $ 350 – $ 750 million , depending on how much remodeling is done .
The COB was ( as noted in Part 1 ) built on the cheap .
Henry B. Moyle almost spent the Mormon church into bankruptcy with his building projects .
Being the faithful that he was , Elder Moyle conveniently had a heart attack and died while on vacation so the Brethren did n’t have to excommunicate him .
Faithful bastard .
5. Salt Lake City Temple
When conducting the seismic up grade to the Tabernacle , the Mormon church discovered several problems not found in the original evaluation of the structure .
The renovation of the Tabernacle has become more involved and costlier .
An investigation of the Salt Lake City Temple has revealed some of the same flaws .
Because of this the structure has to be renovated for seismic and other requirements .
Whereas the Tabernacle cost $ 175 million to renovate the estimates on the Temple is between $ 250 – 450 million .
Remember all these projects are to be completed by 2011 .
Total costs $ 10.1 billion .
If you include the Conference center ( $ 1.1 billion ) the total spending in Utah not to include chapels and stake centers $ 11.2 billion dollars .
Yeah , they need my money for feeding the poor , nurturing the needy , housing the homeless , etc .

Church Announces New Missionary Program
10/05/2006 by substrate
Salt Lake City ( UPI ) -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints announced today the inauguration of a new program to augment its already successful missionary program .
" We have long been gratified by the selfless service provided by church members over the years , not only among full - time missionaries , but in such church - service activities as extraction and genealogy , volunteer service at church historical sites , and church - service missions in areas such as construction and education , " said Presiding Bishop H. David Burton .
" In keeping with that spirit , we are pleased to announce a program of Mall Service Missionaries , beginning immediately . "
Burton explained that the costs of the two downtown malls in Salt Lake City have risen to unforeseen levels ( currently between $ 1.5 and 2.0 billion ) , and that members must be prepared to sacrifice of their time , talents , and everything with which the Lord has blessed them to help further this great project in building the kingdom .
" Through a partnership with Zion 's Securities , we will be able to ensure near - capacity occupancy in the mall by providing , free of charge , full - and part - time mall service missionaries to staff retail outlets and fast - food franchises .
Their much - needed service will lower costs for businesses leasing space and thus better ensure that the church will receive the expected income . "
A pilot program has been in place for several months at Provo Towne Center , where bright - eyed missionaries perform such vital work as preparing fast food and selling video games .
" I 'm so excited to be here , " gushed Amanda Smith of Sioux City , Iowa , sporting a Dillards badge reading " Sister Smith . "
" People ask me if I was a little disappointed when I received my mission call to sell housewares , but I take the Lord at His word , that there is no difference between the temporal and the spiritual . "
" Well , dude , I was kind of bummed at first , " said Elder Travis Johnson of Katy , Texas , as he dipped a corn dog into a deep fryer .
" I was kind of hoping for someplace like Russia , or something .
But you know , I 'll go where you want me to go and all that .
And besides , I still get to go tracting in the evenings . "
Some controversy erupted over the placement of mall service missionaries in businesses that may or may not be in keeping with church standards .
" I can tell you that President Packer was not happy with our decision to place sisters in Victoria 's Secret , but I assured the brethren that you can be in Victoria 's Secret without being of Victoria 's Secret . "
Burton also suggested that further cost reductions might come through having local wards take turns cleaning the mall each Saturday .
" Our members have done more than an adequate job cleaning meetinghouses for several years now .
I think they 've developed the expertise needed to take on a larger role at the mall .
After all , as the Lord said , ' Where much is given , much is required . ' "
New Missionary Program : Phase Two
10/05/2006 by Stray Mutt
As a companion to the new Mall Service Mission program , Presiding Bishop H , David Burton announced the Mall Patron Mission today .
“ Despite staffing the stores and restaurants of City Creek Center with unpaid volunteer Mall Service Missionaries , customers are staying away in droves , claiming it ’s too far to drive from suburbs like Taylorsville and Sandy , or even Sugar House .
So , in its infinite wisdom , the First Presidency has authorized the formation of the Mall Patron Mission , whereby faithful members of all ages — particularly in the prime 18 - 25 and 25 - 45 demographic groups — are called to shop .
As with all other Church missions , the Mall Patron Missionaries will pay their own way . ”
Comment Section
I 've never liked malls , myself .
It 's amusing to see Mormons scrambling to justify the erection of a soulless temple of consumption with charitable religious donations ( so - called ) .
" Our father , who art in Nordstrom , value be thy name .
Thy shoppers come , and spend till numb , in malls as it is in temples . "

I can't belive the negative comments I read regarding the city creek mall .
If you do n't like the mall , they you do n't .
What is wrong with an upscale mall ?
You do n't need to shop there if you rather .
So , if you have the money to build an infrastructure , you build a shabby one in the middle of the city ?
Or you want to build your house that look like garbage in your neighborhood and be proud of it that you are doing this because you want your money spent somewhere else to help others ?
What 's with Haiti and the mall anyway .
I bet the church welfare had helped enough to those that are in need every where .
And those that are being helped were appreciative .
Have you helped at all ?

some of these post are funny , but you TOTALY do n't have a clue .
The new mall brings new life into downtown - which was a dead slum ... they 've cleaned up the area and made it beautiful again ... generated tax revenue , brought in new businesses that will improve the area and yet you can not find the good ?
perhaps you should quit bad mouthing someone who has sucesseded where you have FAILED and start appreciating what is GOOD ... because you will always find what you are looking for .

The Jesus Mall has already had all the economic impact the GA 's intended transferring cleanly old tithing money ( with interest ) from church coffers into " favorite son " and " family connections " coffers .
Transaction complete .
The end result : a mall in downtown nobody will shop at , and a lot of construction workers scrambling for work .
The end .

The mall is being built on church land .
The church isnt building it .
The church owns bunches of lands and the investments it makes are so that their eggs are not in one basket .
They make investments to protect the church .
Any person with half a brain can understand that .
It is called the Nordstrom 's Mall .
Not the Mall of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints .
The Church is very good friends with Nordstrom 's because of their stance on modesty and the Modest fashion show they put on .
Everything , which should be obvious , will be modest and appropriate .
If you dont like the idea , dont use the Mall and stop being Biggots .
The Church is governed by a Prophet of the Lord .
Be like the people in Noah 's time ... the work will go forward with or without you .
We would love for you to join us or come back .

Ya know , you guys are all a bit harsh , and who put you in the position to judge the mormons ?
I have found from past experience from wirking for them in the Construction buisiness in southern california that they are more than fair when it comes to negotiating , and are very wise with economic , and financial decisions .
Most of the things i have read throughout this article are contridictory to the things i know from exprience .
Nest time , before you post some damn article bashing them , or anyone else , i would suggest that you think twice about what you are about to say , cause guess what , YOU DONT KNOW EVERYTHIN , SO STOP MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH YOU ARE GOD ALMIGHTY KNOW EVERTHING !!!!! -

In the mean time , I hope that you can find something more productive to do with your life than focusing on the negative aspect , and hopefully you can see the good in others and what they have done or are trying to do .
I will also try to take the same advice even if it takes me a lifetime to get there , and at least we will be trying and hopefully be part of the solution instead of contributing to the world 's problems .
Best wishes for a happier life .

These articles are absolutely mindless .
The church would NEVER have missionaries running shopping malls or anything of the sort .
Missionaries live under strict rules .
They are n't allowed to play video games , or listen to the radio , or watch television or anything of that sort while in the mission field .
This article itself discredits this entire website for what it really is , a bunch of made up anti-mormon literature from a crazy anti-mormon .

Editor 's Note : Hello James , those comments about missionaries running the Mormon Mall are parody and sarcasm .
Please stop going to Church and visit a few comedy clubs to widen your awareness .

WOW , this guy has relatives who he bases about all his " FACTS " / opinions on .
The title states " A Nordsrom executive see's the Mormon $ 1.5 billion mall as a huge fiasco " .
But who is the executive ?
Why do n't you name them and let them give you a direct quote .
Because your relatives here and there have said such and such you now have PROOF , EVIDENCE , FACTS that support your claim ???
My , oh my , how that SOMEHOW MAKES IT SO .
Many people in those industries have many different opinions .
SO WHAT ???
That makes your OPINION ONLY SUPPORTED BY THIRD PARTY comments SOMEHOW MORE CORRECT because you cite these OTHER relatives .
If they have this as a PROFESSIONAL take on the ISSUE , THEN LET THEM STATE the FACTS , NOT your CONDENSED VERSION / INTERPRETATION of conversations with your relatives and HOW you therefore have MADE THE CORRECT " Observation " .
I hate to say it but get a life .
If the best you can do is create an item like this and really cite nothing more than comments from your OWN relatives you might as well have made it a BLOG .
Because you say so DOES NOT MAKE IT SO , NO MATTER HOW MANY of your relatives you use to support your POINT OF VIEW .
I live in Santa Monica CA .
I just read an article about this construction project and wanted to see more about it .
So I did a Google search .
UNFORTUNATELY your TIRADE appears in the list as an article not as something more like a BLOG .
You might just put your rant on You Tube .
That is another place I would expect to find this type of thing , with NO REAL FACTS about MOST of it .
Here in the Los Angeles area there have been so numerous projects that were CONTROVERSIAL such as The Disney Concert Hall , The Kodak Center ( Oscars ) , Century City , Santa Monica Promenade , destruction of The Ambassador Hotel ( Robert F Kennedy shooting ) , and so on .
The same in NYC especially about rebuilding on the Twin Towers site .
You also mentioned the Bellagio and Las Vegas .
SO MANY projects there have ALSO been CONTROVERSIAL , including putting a Roller Coaster on the top of a skyscraper .
SO this is CONTROVERSIAL , it would have been nicer to see this as your opinion with no real citing of factual professional sources , instead of masquerading a a news article .
I guess I have just now come across some of the Internet JUNK .

The harder morons like you try to discredit the lds church and its leadership the more foolish you look .
The church has been assaulted by smarter , more politicaly connected , more ruthless more savoy people then your little group of loosers .
As history bears record the more the persicution of the lords church the stronger , bigger more supported the church becomes .
If your life is so meaningless that you have nothing better to do but waist your timeand seal your fate in alignment with the evil one so be it but dont kid your self all your doing is strenghtening the richous and embarrsing your self .

First off , I hope you were joking about the whole missionary training program thing because that was nothing more than a ridiculous concoction of yours attempting to deride the Mormon image .
Second , this entire site is completely opinionated to impose your own biased schema of the Mormons .
You know as well as anyone that this propaganda ( with a few strategically placed facts ) is nothing more than a brainchild playing on your Mormon - hatting whim .
" In short , the church is trying to compensate for it 's shrinkage by building another huge masterpiece across from Temple Square .
It 's not a wise use of the money , but since when has the church ever been wise with it 's money . "
Oh , is that it ?
That makes sense .
They want to scare all the non-mormons out of Utah .
Of course !
Why did n't I see that ?!
Explain to me how exactly an international church with almost 15 million members in over 160 countries worldwide , offering billions in humanitarian , educational , and social aid is able to function so well if its finances are in such disarray ?
I guess God really does bless his " chosen people " .
Now I bet you think I 'm some sheltered Mormon boy living in a Mormonized Utah suburb with nothing better to do than inform ignorants of their blatant stupidity .
As egregiously unaware you clearly are , I am not from Utah ; but the second part is true .
However , I am from the Bay Area - that 's right , as in the San Francisco Bay Area .
As in , that one really liberal city in California .
I am not Mormon , but happen to have come to greatly respect them .
Because , unlike Seattle , Arizona , or wherever you live , we here in the Bay ( and the Golden State in general ) have learned to live with each other peacefully ; completely not threatened by one another .
Gay , Lesbian , Balck , White , Brown , Mormon , Catholic , atheist , and Lizard - worshiper alike share the security of being able to live in harmony with one another .
This is why I HATE Utah - because there is an innumerable plethora of insecure Mormon - haters such as yourself .
I know you 're not from Utah , but you 'd fit right in .
Mormons over here in Cali have it really nice ; in that they can live in peace , without the bitting contempt of anti-mormons spewing at them from every direction .
Please do us all a favor and disconnect your computer from the internet right now !

Being that they have a new Mother - Ship and that the fueling strips they installed on Crossroads plaza during the 1990's cannot accommodate it 's new design .........
Plus , with all the new technology that " the Church " hoards from the masses , they have to redesign all the underground tunnels and everything else to make sure the landing pad will be safe and secure from the gentiles , when Christ returns for the Saints .............

Is Sin City In Need Of An Image Makeover ?
Total Pro Sports – During the current economic crisis many companies and cities are being hit harder than ever .
Las Vegas is no exception , but their problems go beyond the lack of money individuals and companies have to spend on vacation getaways .
Instead , the problem which “ the city that does not sleep ” is facing is one regarding their image .
With companies struggling to stay afloat , everyone is trying to get their hands on some of the ever so popular bailout money .
Unfortunately President Obama and other top government officials are not willing to spend it on Vegas vacations .
The President even questioned the motives of companies planing to fly off to Vegas while taxpayers help cover the bill .
This has resulted in several companies canceling meeting in Sin City that are said to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each .
During a town hall meeting in Indiana , President Obama had the following to say :
“ You ca n’t get corporate jets , you ca n’t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer ’s dime . ”
This has n’t been accepted favorably by Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman .
He voiced his displeasure with the messages that congress was sending companies in an effort to prevent them from visiting his city .
“ It ’s necessary , for us to thrive in this community , that folks come here and realize that this is not some stepchild .
This is a very important place for people to conduct very important business . ” [ MSNBC ]
This brings up an interesting debate on an issue that is bound to continue to receive more attention .
Tourism and spending can be beneficial to the economy and failure to endorse such actions can be quite damaging , but how do tax payers feel about their hard earned money being spent by wealthy corporate executives who want to go to Vegas , talk some business , party the rest of the time .
I think this is one that the people should decide , but unfortunately they only do that kind of stuff in democratic countries .

Money Morning / The Money Map Report
Think about Michigan or about Ohio ’s Mahoning Valley in the 1980s .
Both were famous for industries that were world leaders in their time .
Yet , once those industries decayed , large parts of both areas became wastelands of home foreclosures , crime and alcoholism .
The decline of the global financial services industry from its unsustainable 2006 peak may produce a similar effect in a once economically thriving country – Britain .
Thirty years ago , Britain had its own rust - belt problems .
The British automobile industry , a shining star until the Morris Motor Co. ’s Lord Nuffield died in 1963 ( remember 1959 ’s hot new model , the Mini ? ) , was subjected to a series of government - directed merger deals in the 1960s , and the resulting mess , British Leyland , was nationalized in 1975 , amid appalling losses .
The steel industry was nationalized in 1950 , denationalized in 1954 , and nationalized again in 1965 ; not surprisingly , the political football became a byword for high costs , strikes and inefficiency .
Even Rolls - Royce Ltd. , Brian ’s premier high - tech company and maker of both luxury automobiles and aircraft engines , was effectively bankrupted and forced into public ownership in 1971 .
In 1979 , however , Margaret H. Thatcher became prime minister .
Whereas her American contemporary , U.S. President Ronald Reagan , had little direct effect on U.S. industry , Thatcher had a huge direct effect on the shape of the British economy – she had little option , since the government owned so much of it .
She forced British Leyland to shrink drastically , privatized British Steel , British Telecom and Rolls - Royce , and dramatically downsized British Coal after a yearlong face - off with the miners union .
At the same time , she deregulated the City of London ’s financial - services business on a supposed “ level - playing - field ” basis , allowing foreign banks to dominate it and effectively putting the 200 - year - old London merchant banks out of business .
Thatcher ’s restructuring of British manufacturing , together with her tax cuts and government spending restraint , put Britain on a growth path that lasted a generation .
Even after her Labour Party political opponents under Tony Blair gained power in 1997 , growth continued , although government spending began creeping back upwards , and is now slightly above its 1970 ’s peak as a percentage of the economy .
Her restructuring of the City of London brought immense wealth to London itself , as huge global banks deployed increasing amounts of resources to growing their London - based international finance businesses .
By 2006 , London was rivaling New York as a financial center , even though the base of British domestic business was a fraction of that available from the giant U.S economy .
Traders , hedge fund managers , private - equity managers and dealmakers in general were paid fabulous sums .
Since London residents were not liable to British tax on their non-U.K. income , the city also attracted footloose glitterati of all kinds , from the Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal to the seedier but immensely rich top members of the Russian mafia .
In the United States , financial services doubled its share of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and trebled its share of Standard and Poor ’s 500 Index profits between 1980 and 2006 ; in London , the growth was even greater and its dominance of the economy more extreme .
House prices , too , became far more overblown in Britain than in any but the most speculative areas of the United States .
The 2006 celebrations of the twentieth anniversary of the Financial Services Act of 1986 , Thatcher ’s deregulatory bombshell , rejoiced in London ’s newfound wealth , sneered at the relative impoverishment of Britain ’s provinces and missed one key weakness of the economy :
Almost none of the major institutions generating such fabulous wealth were owned or headquartered in Britain .
When London - based “ masters of the universe ” wanted to speak to those controlling the huge amounts of capital they deployed , they had to pick up the phone to New York , Frankfurt , Paris , Tokyo or Dubai .
Now , the financial services business is in trouble .
What ’s more , the parts of the business in which London specialized are in most trouble .
Securitization and derivatives were the two immediate causes of the credit crisis , while the 50 % declines in the emerging - market stock markets have made the exorbitant fees of the private - equity and hedge - fund managers seem extortionate .
It is now abundantly clear that the financial services sector has incurred gigantic losses and that even when those losses have been subsidized by some unfortunate group of taxpayers , the sector is likely to end up being far smaller than it was .
In fact , as a share of the economy the sector will probably end up being only a little larger than it was back in the 1970s .
For Britain , this has three appalling costs .
First , the assets of its financial services sector are around 400 % of its GDP , below only the much smaller Iceland , Switzerland and Ireland and twice the U.S. ratio ( and most Swiss banks were notably cautious in the bubble ) .
Because of the importance of Britain ’s financial sector , its bank bailouts need to be nearly as large as those in the United States , yet its tax base is only one quarter the size .
Second , the downsizing of financial services will produce an immensely damaging decline in British asset prices , particularly those of London and southeast England housing , in which so many middle - class Britons have invested their entire life savings ( investing in the stock market is much less embedded there than it is here in the United States ) .
That will have a further unpleasant effect on bank loan portfolios , pension and insurance assets and the British tax base , which will deepen the economic downturn .
Third , and most serious , since the British financial services sector is almost entirely controlled from overseas , there is very little long - term reason why it should remain in Britain .
After all , it ’s not as if London ’s climate is particularly attractive except to aficionados , while its infrastructure is appalling .
The product areas in which London - based houses appeared to have a particular expertise have mostly been shown to be over - elaborate Ponzi schemes .
Even if the top management of a German , American or Japanese bank wishes to keep its stable of overpaid London financial whiz kids , it will have to deal with enormous shareholder and political opposition to do so .
The Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ( LEHMQ ) bankruptcy , in which money was remitted at the last moment to the United States , so that London - based employees and creditors fared far worse than those in New York , is symptomatic of the “ hollowing - out ” process that is likely to continue for several years .
Even the Russian mafia may find it prefers somewhere warmer .
Eventually , probably after a steep decline in the value of the British pound sterling and a major reorganization of the British economy , and at the cost of an enormous increase in British government debt , the inventive and entrepreneurial British will no doubt find new ways to make a living .
In the meantime , I would n’t put my money there .
[ Editor ’s Note :
As the financial crisis continues to sweep the globe , it ’s clear that “ uncertainty ” will continue to be the watchword for at least the first part of the New Year .
That 's really no surprise , given that the global financial crisis continues to whipsaw the U.S. financial markets in a manner that has n't been seen since the Great Depression .
It 's almost enough to make you surrender .
But what if you knew , ahead of time , what marketplace changes to expect ?
Then you'd be in the driver 's seat – right ?
You 'd know what to anticipate , could craft a profit strategy to follow , and could then just sit back , watching and waiting – and finally profiting from the very marketplace events you anticipated .
R. Shah Gilani – a retired hedge fund manager and a nationally known expert on the U.S. credit crisis – has predicted five key financial crisis " aftershocks " that he says will create substantial profit opportunities for investors who know just what these aftershocks are , and how to play them .
In the Trigger Event Strategist , the aftershocks actually create these so - called " trigger events , " which then serve as gateways to massive profits .
To find out all about these five financial - crisis aftershocks , and about the trigger - event profit strategy they feed into , check out our latest report . ]
Child Abuse and Neglect - Canada Statistics
Child abuse in Canada
Health Canada , Child Maltreatment Section states " Child maltreatment can be categorized into several broad types including physical abuse , sexual abuse , neglect / failure to provide , and emotional maltreatment .
Physical abuse ( child abuse ) is the deliberate application of force to any part of a child 's body , which results or may result in a non-accidental injury .
Physical abuse may include shaking , choking , biting , kicking , burning , poisoning , holding a child under water , or any other harmful or dangerous use of force or restraint .
Most child physical abuse is associated with physical punishment or is confused with child discipline .
Sexual abuse ( child abuse ) occurs when an adult or youth uses a child for sexual purposes .
Sexual abuse includes fondling , intercourse , incest , sodomy , exhibitionism , and commercial exploitation through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials .
Neglect / failure to provide ( child abuse ) occurs when a child 's parents or caregivers do not provide the requisite attention to the child 's emotional , psychological , or physical development .
Emotional maltreatment ( child abuse ) involves acts or omissions by parents or caregivers that cause or could cause serious behavioural , cognitive , emotional , or mental disorders .
Emotional maltreatment can include verbal threats , socially isolating a child , intimidation , exploitation , terrorizing , or routinely making unreasonable demands on a child . "

Criminal Code of Canada
PART VIII OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSON AND REPUTATION
Murder , Manslaughter and Infanticide
Infanticide
233 .
A female person commits infanticide when by a willful act or omission she causes the death of her newly - born child , if at the time of the act or omission she is not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child and by reason thereof or of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child her mind is then disturbed .
R.S. , c. C - 34 , s. 216 .
A mother who murdered her baby committed a lesser crime than if she had killed an adult ....
It does n't make sense .
The law has always treated the murder of an infant by the mother as a lesser crime than murder of an older child or adult .
Sections 216 and 590 of the Criminal Code of Canada are a reflection of a reluctance to find the mother guilty of murder of her baby .
Now , the Law Reform Commission of Canada and the Butler Committee has proposed abolishing sections 216 and 590 .
The author agrees that the abolishment of Canada 's infanticide provisions is the logical change to the law .
Mentally ill murderers will always have the legal defence of " diminished capacity " , whether they are male or female .
Depression after giving birth is a medical condition which is one of the mental illnesses that cause " diminished capacity " .
On October 4th , 2005 , The Public Health Agency of Canada released the report of the second cycle of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect Major Findings2003 ( CIS ) .
The study highlights a dramatic 125 percent increase in the incidence of substantiated child abuse and neglect cases in 2003 , the most recent period measured .

?? tude canadienne sur l'incidence des signalements de cas de violence et de n?? gligence envers les enfants - 2001
Canadian Statistics ( 1998 )
An estimated 135,573 child maltreatment investigations were conducted in Canada in 1998 .
This figure corresponds to an estimated incidence rate of 21.52 investigations per 1,000 children .
It is important to keep in mind , however , that this incidence rate includes all child maltreatment investigations , regardless of whether the report was substantiated or not .
Almost half ( 45 % ) of these reports were substantiated by the investigating worker .
The remaining investigations either had insufficient information to substantiate , but the worker maintained suspicion that maltreatment had occurred ( 22 % ) , or the worker determined on the basis of the investigation that the child had not been maltreated ( 33 % ) .
Of the estimated 21.52 investigations per 1,000 children in Canada in 1998 , an estimated 9.71 per 1,000 were substantiated , 4.71 per 1,000 were suspected , and 7.09 per 1,000 were unsubstantiated .
Categories of Maltreatment
Child neglect was the most common reason for investigation ( 40 % of all investigations ) , followed by physical abuse ( 31 % ) , emotional maltreatment ( 19 % ) , and sexual abuse ( 10 % ) .
The substantiation rate for emotional maltreatment as the primary reason for investigation was highest of all four categories of maltreatment ( 54 % substantiated ) , whereas the other three categories had similar levels of substantiation ( physical abuse : 34 % , sexual abuse : 38 % , neglect : 43 % ) .

A man has been charged with torturing his nine - year - old son by keeping him locked in a bedroom for much of the last three years , a surveillance camera tracking his every move , authorities said Thursday .
The home of Randall Warren Piercy , 41 , was like a prison that had cameras in almost every room , with the father monitoring the boy on television and computer screens , Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office Lt. Annie Smith said .

Role of CAS questioned after Barrie slayings
The Globe and Mail ( Canada 's largest national newspaper ) , ANTHONY REINHART AND CHRISTIE BLATCHFORD , October 12 , 2006
The mother accused of first - degree murder in the deaths of her two little girls last week was admitted to a psychiatric ward of a local hospital as a suicidal patient just five months earlier .
Frances Elaine Campione , The Globe and Mail has confirmed , was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie , Ont. , for an emergency assessment .
The 31 - year - old 's history in an active file at the Children 's Aid Society of Simcoe County raises alarming questions about why the agency returned her two vulnerable youngsters Serena , 3 , and Sophia , who was just a year old to her care and what workers and supervisors were doing to monitor her .
Ms. Campione was admitted to hospital early last June after taking an overdose of medication and leaving a suicide note .
She was discharged June 30 , and within a week or so , The Globe has learned , had managed to regain custody of the little girls and had them back living with her .
Ms. Campione was discharged the same day that another mother who was on the ward at the same time walked out of the Royal Vic but with a battery of support services in place .

Mother guilty of feeding cocaine to toddler
The Toronto Star , Peter Small Courts Bureau , April 02 , 2009
A 26 - year - old mother has been convicted of steadily giving her toddler cocaine over 14 months , finally administering a near - lethal dose that left him brain - damaged .
" It 's difficult to see what would motivate her to give him cocaine , possibly to stop his crying , or to get him to sleep , or to control him .
Was it to punish him or to get back at the father ? "
Justice Tamarin Dunnet said yesterday .

Mom Smoked Meth While Breast - Feeding Son
Pleads Guilty to Endangering 9 - Month - Old Boy
ABC News , U.S.A. , Aug. 17 , 2005
A Salem , Oregon , U.S.A. , meth - addicted mother pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges that she endangered her 9 - month - old son by smoking the drug while breast - feeding him .
Prosecutors say going after mothers who knowingly endanger their children by feeding them drug - tainted breast milk is another way of tackling the state 's problem with methamphetamines .
The drug is such a problem that Oregon Gov .
Ted Kulongoski signed a law Tuesday requiring people to get a prescription to buy cold and allergy medication containing pseudoephedrine , one of the key ingredients people use to make meth .

" Ontario woman convicted of son 's starvation death granted full parole "
Canadian Press .
Wednesday , May. 22 , 2002
KINGSTON , Ont. ( CP ) --
An Ontario woman who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in one of Canada 's stiffest penalties for child abuse will be released on full parole after serving less than half her term .
Lorelei Turner , 38 , and her husband Steven were convicted of manslaughter in July 1995 for beating and starving their three - year - old son John to death in a case that horrified Canadians who followed the trial .
But on Wednesday , a panel of the National Parole Board in this eastern Ontario city ruled Turner will be released but placed on probation until July 2011 .
Until then , she must remain within 25 kilometres of her residence , is not allowed unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 , and must continue to receive counselling .
" The board would have looked at the risk and obviously found a low risk to reoffend , " Carol Sparling of the National Parole Board said Wednesday .

Victims of abuse at the hands of Christian brothers at the Mount Cashel orphanage will receive between $ 20,000 and $ 600,000 in compensation .
But first they will have to agree to abandon all legal action against the province , police or the Roman Catholic Church -- a stipulation that angers some victims .
" The government has responsibility , liability for what went wrong , " said J.J. Byrne , a former Mount Cashel resident and spokesman for victims , in an interview yesterday .

Pair who caged sons get longer jail terms
Nine months `unfit ' sentence , court rules
Mother now gets 5 years , father 4 years
The Toronto Star , TRACEY TYLER , LEGAL AFFAIRS REPORTER , Nov. 5 , 2004
Nine months in jail is a " demonstrably unfit " sentence for a Blackstock couple who beat and caged their adoptive sons , crimes that were " shocking to the conscience of the community " and " cry out for a significant penitentiary sentence , " the Ontario Court of Appeal has ruled .
" The facts as found by the trial judge unequivocally establish the horrendous abuse of two young boys by their parents for more than a decade , " Justice Eleanore Cronk wrote on behalf of the court , which set aside the widely criticized sentences yesterday .

Found :
The end of the rainbow ... but there 's no pot of gold
Legend has it that at the end of every rainbow sits a leprechaun , hammering on a shoe , who will reveal the whereabouts of a crock of gold .
Just as well , then , that it 's only a legend - otherwise the little imp at the end of this rainbow would have found himself squashed by a 4x4 on a busy motorway .
While many of us have seen a rainbow , few have been lucky enough to witness where it actually ends .
Even fewer have caught the moment on camera .
Spectacular :
The rainbow leaps directly from the tarmac in Jason Erdkamp 's photograph
This rare picture was taken by amateur photographer Jason Erdkamp as he travelled along a freeway in Orange County , California , in the rain last Sunday .
And it does seem to have proved lucky for him .
' There was no pot of gold , ' he said yesterday .
But I did win $ 25 that night on a lottery ticket . '
Now the rainbow has moved .
Jason estimated that it was travelling at up to 30mph
Rainbows occur when sunlight is refracted through rain droplets to create an arc - shaped spectrum of colours in the sky .
This particular rainbow was caused by a storm last Sunday from a cold front moving through California 's Santa Ana mountains .
Mr Erdkamp photographed it using his Apple iPhone as he travelled along the 241 toll road in Orange County .
He even managed to estimate how fast the rainbow was travelling as it moved northwards .
Speaking from his U.S. home , he said : ' Rainbows seemed very dynamic in movement when you are near their base .
' The speed of movement across the ground was about 20 to 30 mph as the base of the rainbow moved with the storm .
It lasted for about five minutes . '
As I publish new ones I ’ll try to add them here also .
So without further ado , I give you the New World Order Family Circus master archive :
The “ we ’re the good guys ” comic above wo n’t make any sense to you unless you ’ve read Cormac McCarthy ’s The Road .
Special thanks to Comrade Denny for the two above .
The two above are mine .
Comrade Denny did these too .
3 more installments from Comrade Denny :
This Bus is an Athiest , Because It ’s Angry at God
[ Note : Postings have been light lately , because I ’m putting in long hours at work .
I hope things calm down later this week .
In the meantime , here ’s a quickie about a bus that worships Charles Darwin and Richard Dawkins . ]
Ron Heather and the bus that thinks the Earth is 4.5 billion years old .
I found an amusing title while browsing the blogs at OneNewsNow .
It ’s “ Bus Driver Refuses to Drive Atheist Bus ” .
I knew that this provocative title could only mean one of two things : ( 1 ) That a bus had achieved sentience and was already more intellectually sophisticated than the average fundie ( can cylons be far behind ? ) , or ( 2 ) that some fundie hack writer does n’t know how to construct a sentence that does n’t give the wrong impression .
I ’m going with number two here .
The article appears to be by somebody named Tasha Easterling , who writes :
A couple of months ago I blogged about the controversial atheistic ad campaign in Britain which state ‘ There ’s probably no God – Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . ”
Now a bus driver in Southampton who is a committed Christian is refusing to drive buses which contain these ads .
Ron Heather ’s bus company , First Buses , have put the ads on 20 of their buses , and Heather went on strike for three days to protest the ad campaign .
I do n’t know what the level of atheism is over in Britain , but I ’m sure it is way higher than our five or ten percent .
Let ’s just say it ’s 20 % .
That means there is a fair number of atheists employed as bus drivers .
Buses carry religious advertising all the time .
Have any atheists ever refused to drive such a bus ?
I ’ve certainly never heard of one .
So what we have here is yet another example of Christians professing to be tolerant , yet being far more intolerant than non-believers .
Heather says : “ I felt that I could not drive that bus , I told my managers and when they said they had not got another one I thought I better go home , so I did .
“ I think it was the starkness of the advert that implied there was no God . ”
It does more than imply .
It stops just short of saying it ’s a certainty .
Heather was called into a meeting with the managers of his company , and he agreed to work provided they would ensure that he would only have to drive a bus containing the atheist ad if no other buses were available .
A First spokeswoman said : “ As a company we understand Mr Heather ’s views regarding this atheist bus advert and we are doing what we can to accommodate his request not to drive the bus concerned .
Mr Heather accepts though that he may need to drive one of these buses if no other vehicle is available for him . ”
It sounds like it ’s working out the best it can for all concerned .
Heather keeps his job , and the bus company keeps the ads and does n’t have to hire a new driver .
I have no problem with a company trying to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee ’s beliefs , but what if those beliefs are unreasonable ?
The other way to look at it , though , is what would the fundies think if it were a Muslim driver who refused to drive a bus with Christianity , pork , or alcohol ads ?
Fundies and other conservatives got into a hissy when Tyson Foods let their employees trade Labor Day for a Muslim holiday .
The New York Times ‘
Travel section featured a February 8 piece by Ned Martel headlined , “ In Grenada , Leaving the Past Behind , ” where the reporter refers to the 1983 U.S. invasion of the tiny Caribbean nation .
A more accurate headline might have read , “ Leaving the Facts Behind . ”
Here ’s how Martel summed up the invasion story :
In 1983 , American satellites peered down on Point Salines , the southwest corner of Grenada , and detected a newly paved lane toward the sea , plus some nearby armaments and fuel tanks .
Cubans had arrived on the island , abetting some coup plotters who captured and then executed the prime minister , and the Reagan administration realized they were watching a hostile military base under construction , some 1,500 miles southeast of Miami .
That ’s a garbled version of the case for the invasion made by Ronald Reagan , who claimed that he was forced to invade because Grenada was building a military airport at Point Salines as a way station for Soviet planes , and because the coup was endangering U.S. citizens there .
The reality ?
Reagan loathed Grenada ’s popular and Cuba - friendly prime minister , Maurice Bishop , and had been planning an invasion of the island for some time .
When Bishop was deposed in an internal coup , Reagan used the event , the airport story and the danger to Americans on the island as pretexts for invading ( and imposing a “ friendly ” government ) .
Of course , Reagan was lying :
The airport was Grenada ’s new international airport , designed by a Canadian firm , financed by the British government and Grenada ’s neighbors , and no secret to anyone .
As far as the danger posed to Americans , the chancellor of the medical school that many of the Americans on the island attended charged that the greatest danger his students faced was from the the U.S. invasion .
And what of the Cubans Martel said were there to help topple Bishop ?
They were almost all workers , there at Bishop ’s invitation , sponsored by Cuba ’s pro-Bishop government .
Instead of referring to its own archives , where some of Reagan ’s Grenada deceptions were debunked years ago , the “ paper of record ” is adding new misinformation to its Grenada file .
Possible overdose victim left to die , cops say DUBLIN
A man whose body was found beside a backyard hot tub in Dublin may have overdosed on drugs during a party and been left to die by friends who " freaked out , " police said Thursday .
Officers learned of the body by happenstance after pulling over Douglas Campbell , 53 , of Lodi ( San Joaquin County ) for a registration violation about 2:15 p.m. Wednesday on Emerald Drive , said police Lt. Glenn Moon .
Police found the drugs GHB , or gamma hydroxybutyrate , and methamphetamine in the car , authorities said .
Campbell told officers that he had gotten the drugs at a home on the 6900 block of Doreen Court , a cul - de- sac about 2 blocks away and a half - mile east of Interstate 680 .
Campbell also made a startling admission , Moon said - there was a dead man in the home 's backyard .
Campbell told police that he was with three friends Tuesday night , using GHB and methamphetamine at a hot - tub party , and that one of the partygoers had apparently died , Moon said .
GHB , a depressant known to users as " liquid ecstasy " for its euphoric effect , can be deadly if taken in large doses .
It is frequently mixed in liquid , and police do not know whether the man took it intentionally or was given it without his knowledge , Moon said .
The Alameda County coroner is conducting an autopsy .
The man 's name has not been released .
Campbell and the home 's owner , Richard Shahan , 53 , along with a third man at the party , " freaked out " and left their friend beside the tub without calling for help , Moon said .
Before being pulled over , Campbell intended to stash the drugs somewhere so he and the other men would n't get in trouble when police were finally called about the body , authorities said .
Campbell and Shahan were both arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs for sale .
The other partygoer , whose name was not released , is considered a witness and is not wanted on charges , Moon said .

Sometimes the simplest technology is the best .
The Watercone , a solar - powered water purifier , is a testament to that .
The cone - shaped device turns salty or dirty water into up to 1.7 liters of fresh water in a matter of hours , according to Watercone .
Here 's how it works :
You pour the bad water into a black pan , and then you screw on a cone .
The black pan absorbs sunlight and heats up the water .
Then , the evaporated water condensates into droplets on the cone 's inner wall , and the droplets drop into a circular trough at the inner case of the cone .
After a few hours , you can unscrew the cap , tip the cone upside down and empty out the clean water into a receptacle .
The Watercone is due out this summer , and it should cost no more than $ 30 .
This will be a tremendous help for poorer , developing countries .
Check out a video of the Watercone in action below the jump .

Good liquor is surprisingly inexpensive if you cost it out .
A shot poured from an $ 85 bottle of ambrosial 18 - year - old Scotch comes out to less than you 'd pay for a pint of Bud Light in most bars around the country .
And that 's with more than 16 servings to the bottle .
But it should be noted that some cheap booze is very good provided you shop carefully and stay away from inexpensive tequila and liqueurs .
The latter will be nasty , and the former is unlikely in the extreme to be 100 percent agave .
There are principles .
But those things excepted , there 's great stuff carefully distilled , nuanced , and utterly respectable to be found in the $ 15 - a - bottle range ( or , if you prefer , the 94 - cents - a - shot range ) . *
These are our favorite bottles .
* All prices are from discount liquor stores , but in New York City , which pretty much evens out .

The Best : Evan Williams Black Label bourbon
$ 12 for 750 ml
Tight regulations , tough competition , and efficient , consolidated production have made American whiskey the best booze value on the planet .
Even in the $ 15 range , there are plenty of good choices .
Jim Beam falls in that range , and Jim Beam is a wonderful whiskey .
Even better , though , is Evan Williams , hands down the best cheap liquor we tasted ( and at 86 proof , the only one higher than the legal minimum of 80 proof ) .
A complex nose — we picked up things like yeast , dill , corn bread , ash , and toasted coconut — is only the overture .
On the palate , it 's impressively thick and chewy , with a grainy sweetness balanced out by tannins that only develop with long aging .
We must admit that we find this whiskey enormously comforting — not just what 's in the bottle but also the very fact that it exists .
Any country that can turn out something this serious at this price is in some fundamental way doing okay .
Moreover , aging bourbon is expensive .
In part , it 's because you 're not allowed to reuse the barrels .
But there 's also the warehousing cost and , worst of all , the shrinkage — not just theft and leakage , but also evaporation : 3 or 4 percent , year in and year out .
All of which makes good cheap bourbon that much more impressive .
Why it 's cheap :
High quality + low price = sales volume .
What it 's best for : Drinking .

By blending ( presumably ) cheap French cognac with American brandy , Paul Masson has somehow come up with something that more or less smells nutty and spicy , like real , pricier cognac , and goes down far more smoothly than anything from France in this price range could even aspire to .
Tasty stuff .

Why it 's cheap : American brandy gets no respect .

Brugal Añejo rum
( $ 14 for 750 ml )
There are plenty of acceptable white and gold rums available for about $ 15 .
( We particularly like Flor de Caña . )
Well - aged rums at that price are much rarer .
But if you want something cheap , brown , and sugarcaney to go with your cigar , Brugal 's blend of three - to seven - year - old Dominican rums works .
There 's enough flavor in this lightly sugary , nutty , and vanilla - tinged rum to make it a bargain .
Why it 's cheap : Brugal does n't spend a lot of money on TV ads .
What it 's best for : Rocks .
Daiquiris .

White Horse blended Scotch whisky
$ 15 for 750 ml
Blended Scotch is made by mixing a selection of single - malt whiskies with varying proportions of " grain whisky " ( essentially barrel - aged vodka ) .
So in the lower price range you do n't get a lot of malt in the mix .
The best you can hope for is a good grain whisky , and that whichever malts are blended in are good ones .
White Horse has both .
It 's light but clean and barley - sweet , with flashes of peat smoke .
Why it 's cheap : See above .
What it 's best for : Mixing with soda .

Gordon 's London dry gin
( $ 15 for a liter )
Almost any vodka more than $ 15 a bottle will be palatable ( we 're fond of Smirnoff ) , but gin is different .
This one is bright and piney , with a nose - crinkling shot of black pepper — a lot like Tanqueray , its imported stablemate .
It 's a bit watery , but there 's a bite to remind you you 're drinking gin .
Why it 's cheap :
It 's 80 proof , not the standard 94 that classic London dry gins are bottled at .
Less alcohol , lower price .
What it 's best for :
Any gin cocktail with citrus .
It 's a little too thin to make a great martini .

The United States does not have an official language at federal level
Voters in the US city of Nashville have defeated a proposal to ban the use of all languages apart from English in local government business .
Supporters said it would have saved thousands in translation fees , and provided an incentive to learn English .
However , critics argued that it would discriminate against the nearly 60,000 immigrants in the city who did not speak English as their first language .
The " English First " measure was defeated by 41,752 votes to 32,144 .
Had it passed , Nashville would have become the largest US city to take such a step .
But business leaders , academics and the city 's mayor said it would give the city a bad reputation .
They said the move could stop people who cannot read or write English from seeking vital help from social welfare agencies run by the city authorities .
Nashville has a big Hispanic population , and the largest community of Kurdish Americans in the US - about 11,000 - as well as immigrants from South East Asia , the Middle East and Africa .
The charter amendment was put forward by city councillor Eric Crafton , who collected enough signatures to force a referendum on the issue .
The United States does not have an official language at the federal level .
Thirty states , including Tennessee , and at least a dozen cities have declared English their official language , according to the ProEnglish advocacy group .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 17 ( UPI ) -- U.S. President - elect Barack Obama says he may be able to keep his beloved BlackBerry mobile communication device after being pressured to drop it .
Even though his lawyers and others have advised him to drop the e-mail device , Obama says he 's reluctant to do that and Friday told CNN " I think we 're going to be able to beat this back . "

The president - elect said he realizes privacy issues threaten his ability to maintain normal communications .
But he expressed optimism that , unlike President George W. Bush , he 's going to be able to find a way to keep using e-mail after he enters the Oval Office .
" I think we 're going to be able to hang onto one of these , " Obama told the U.S. network .
" Now , my working assumption , and this is not new , is that everything I write on e-mail could end up being on CNN .
So I make sure to -- to think before I press ' send . ' "
A Hollywood celebrity , a teenage death in a bathroom and the Church of Scientology is a toxic brew for global gossipmongers and , sure enough , the death of John Travolta 's 16 - year - old son , Jett , has triggered an orgy of internet chatter .
Some of the speculation is being driven in an organised way by critics of the Church of Scientology ( " Co$ " in internet parlance ) .
According to the Travolta family , Jett suffered from regular seizures ( around one a week ) and had been diagnosed with Kawasaki syndrome , a rare childhood condition with some life - threatening symptoms but rarely fatal .
Details of Jett 's death , in the bathroom of Travolta 's holiday home in the Bahamas after a reported seizure , are sketchy .
The postmortem results will almost certainly be kept private by Travolta and his wife , Kelly Preston .
For members of Anonymous , an online group of anti-Scientology activists , Jett 's death is an opportunity to repeat old allegations against Travolta and Scientology : that Jett suffered a form of autism but Travolta and Preston , who are Scientologists , were in denial about it because it is claimed that Scientology argues that autism is psychosomatic and must not be managed with mainstream medication or psychiatry .
It is alleged online that Travolta and Scientology may have somehow prevented the treatment of Jett 's condition and put him through " detox programmes " created by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard .
But in interviews Preston has described the " detox " only as being " 90 % organic " apart from " a little bit of junk food " .
Travolta 's lawyers , Michael Ossi and Michael McDermott , told the celebrity website TMZ.com that Jett took an anti-seizure drug called Depakote and it was only stopped on medical advice .
The British branch of Scientology did not respond to questions about its position on autism .
" Scientologists use medical drugs when physically ill and also rely on the advice and treatment of medical doctors , " said a spokesman .
The online speculation comes at a convenient moment for the anti-Scientology campaign , with worldwide protests planned this Saturday , but there may be a backlash if it is seen to be exploiting a private tragedy .
• This article was amended on Friday 9 January 2009 .
John Travolta 's son died during a family holiday in the Bahamas , not in Barbados .
This has been corrected .
When you buy a concert ticket on Ticketmaster , post something for sale on Craigslist , or poke an old friend on Facebook , you may not know it , but you ’re helping to put millions of books online in a vast free library .
To access these websites , you must decipher two squiggly words to prove that you ’re not a computer program designed to spam the site .
Once it knows you ’re human , the website lets you continue .
Those two decoded words do n’t disappear , however .
In fact , your brain has deciphered words that had baffled the scanning software used for an enormous project to digitize every public domain book in the world .
“ We can coordinate literally millions of people on the Internet to work together to do something that computers cannot do , ” says Luis von Ahn , an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
Mr. von
Ahn helped develop the first version of these security puzzles in 2000 , stringing together random combinations of words and numbers then distorting the text to make it impossible for automated spammers to decode .
Some 200 million of these words , dubbed “ Captchas ” for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart , are typed every day by people around the world .
“ At first , it made me feel good to look at the impact my research has had , ” says von Ahn , who grew up in Guatemala .
Then he did the math : “ It takes about 10 seconds to type each Captcha .
I realized that humanity as a whole is wasting 500,000 hours every day typing Captchas . ”
When von
Ahn compared that to the 7 million hours it took to build the Empire State Building or the 20 million hours spent constructing the Panama Canal , he wondered , “ Is there a way we can make good use of this time ? ”
In 2007 , he came up with reCaptchas .
Now , instead of frittering away their time typing random characters , Internet users spell actual words plucked from old books that computers have trouble reading .
The Open Content Alliance , a nonprofit group based in a San Francisco , has enlisted about 150 libraries and research centers to digitize as many printed works as it legally can and post them online for anyone in the world to read .
“ Everything on the Internet Archive [ archive.org ] is free to use and free to download , ” says Gabe Juszel , coordinator for the project ’s largest scanning center that occupies a dim office at the University of Toronto .
“ We want to make sure a person in China has the same resources as a grad student here at U of T .
After all , there are more Internet cafes than there are libraries in the world . ”
Mr. Juszel presides over 23 scanning machines , each shrouded in a black tent to keep out light .
Working in two shifts from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. , human operators manually turn pages as two cameras click every seven seconds .
The group copies up to 2,000 books a week , targeting volumes with expired copyright .
The scanned texts are sent to a server in California , where they ’re run through optical character recognition software .
But computer programs are only 80 percent accurate in older books .
They stump over blurry lines , places where the ink has bled together over time , and less uniform fonts .
Carnegie Mellon computers send the indecipherable words to more than 100,000 websites that use them in the reCaptcha security checks .

I ’M a sucker for a sale , the kind of shopper who tallies the amount “ saved ” rather than spent .
My arithmetic goes like this :
It makes more sense to buy the $ 125 cashmere sweater marked down to $ 95 than to pay full price for the $ 80 one .
Following this logic , when I heard on the radio that lobster prices were the cheapest they had been in 25 years , I decided that the sensible thing to do was to run over to the fish store and buy a couple for dinner .
So what if I spent nearly $ 30 on lobster for two on a weeknight when we were n’t celebrating anything ?
It cost a third less than it would have last year .
While fantasizing about ways to cook my bargain crustaceans , I asked Lewis Spada , the manager of Fish Tales in Brooklyn , why prices were so low .
US game - industry trackers the NPD Group provided GameSpot with an inside look at the Guitar Hero - Rock Band rivalry last month , revealing that the most recent edition of Activision 's stalwart is outpacing its Harmonix - developed rival by a margin of two to one .
According to the firm , Guitar Hero World Tour sold 3.4 million copies domestically in 2008 , compared to Rock Band 2's achievement of 1.7 million units .
As part of its year - end earnings announcement today , MTV Games ' parent company Viacom corroborated NPD 's findings , saying in a postearnings conference call that Rock Band 2 has sold nearly 2 million units worldwide on the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 2 , and Wii through the end of December .
Nevertheless , Viacom said that the tally came in below its internal expectations .
" The soft retail environment definitely weighed on sales of our consumer products , particularly during the fourth quarter , " said Tom Dooley , executive vice president and CFO of Viacom .
" This also impacted sales of Rock Band , which has a relatively high price point .
That , however , does not diminish the franchise 's great success so far .
Rock Band was the number - one game title for 2008 by revenue across all game genres , with more than 10 million units shipped worldwide since its launch . "
Dooley went on to say that a growing number of consumers are picking up Rock Band 2 as a standalone game , rather than springing for the game 's bundle that also includes a microphone , drum kit , and guitar .
" This shift will impact our revenue growth , but it will also improve profitability , " Dooley noted .
On the whole , Viacom 's Media Networks segment -- of which MTV Games ' Rock Band is a part -- saw revenues climb 8 percent during the fiscal year to $ 8.75 billion .
The media conglomerate attributed a portion of its climbing revenues to increased sales of the Rock Band franchise .
However , the division 's operating income slipped 10 percent compared to a year before , falling to $ 2.73 billion .

According to a recent study , broadband access in the U.S. has dropped to 19th place worldwide .
The recent passage of the stimulus bill will provide about $ 7 billion to improve it .
But why is U.S. broadband so crappy in the first place ?
And can government intervention improve it ?

For a little insight , I sat down with Emily Green , CEO of the Yankee Group , a Boston - based consultancy that specializes in connectivity .
They advise network providers , manufacturers , media companies and financial services companies , and also specializes in helping those companies deal with public regulations .
The Yankee Group recently wrote an open letter to President Obama about the need for an “ anywhere ” network .
In it , it argues that a Federally - motivated expansion of wired and wireless communications is one of the most vital components of economic recovery , community service , and improved health care and education .
Is broadband access in the U.S. really that bad ?
There was a note in The New York Times the other day that sent me around the bend .
There was a convocation of broadband industry folks a few days ago , and they came out and said that if you looked at the right metrics , the U.S. is actually number one in broadband access .
Anyone who says that is engaging with delusional metrics .
For a country that ’s as advanced as we are , and has provided so much leadership in the commercialization of the Internet , our deployment of broadband technology is pathetic and embarrassing .
What ’s the problem ?
We ’re not short on ideas .
We ’re short on people ’s understanding of the importance of a comprehensive , seamless , high - capacity digital network .
A lot of articles in the media discuss the stimlulus ’
“ shovel - ready ” projects .
But we need a network that is digital - worker ready .
If we had that , we could re-shore some of the jobs that are leaving the country .
We are moving to a service - based economy , away from a manufacturing economy .
The projects in the stimulus that will have the longest impact wo n’t be the bridges and roads .
advertisement
But to get that kind of economy , do we need the government to work with private companies ?
Many ISPs wo n’t even divulge maps of their coverage to regulators .
There is great economic benefit for the whole country if we have an expansive , higher capacity network .
But for these companies , holding information close to the chest is genetic ; it ’s an attitude born of long habit .
It ’s as if they ’re saying , ‘ I ’m not sure what will create my competitive advantage , but information is power–so I ’ll withhold as much as possible . ’
It ’s not a very Google - era perspective .
Do they have good reason to protect that information ?
This information is too critical to stay private .
Here ’s an exact analogy : Just because many highways in the U.S. are managed by independent companies , that does n’t mean we let them withhold information about where those roads go , or which facilities are at each stop .
We ’re at the stage now where information highways are just as important as our physical highways .
In your letter , you say we need a “ public safety broadband network ” for police and fire squads .
Do we really need to get the Federal government involved in things like this ?
Ca n’t states and municipalities hash this out , whenever the market can ’t ?
The Federal government should be setting examples and pioneering things .
What we really need is coherence , so that these networks –police , fire , emergency services–can talk to each other .
The Federal government needs to come in and say , ‘ there ’s too much risk involved here .
We need to provide leadership . ’
After they establish the model , the states and cities can refine it .
advertisement
But the government can’t even handle the transition from antenna TV to digital .
Delaying the DTV transition was a mistake .
Any change of this magnitude is never going to go smoothly .
The value of returning that white space to the American people is huge ; that space could be one of the vehicles for improving broadband access across the country , and I think that ’s a lot more important than television programming .
Broadband access is correlated to economic benefit in a way that TV is not .
Some studies have shown that rural residents without broadband express very little interest in getting high - speed Internet .
I understand there are people who do n’t think they need it .
There are also people that think they do n’t need to exercise or drink milk .
We should n’t let that make us self - satisfied about where we are in terms of connectivity .
Curricula in schools are devised by people given the authority to decide what ’s best for our children .
We should be mandating connectivity and skills development too .
Luckily , the stimulus package has funding for access points in communities and educational programs for broadband usage .
You say in your letter that the government should create some “ initial applications ” for the new white space being vacated by the broadcast TV stations , so serve as examples to private companies .
Ca n’t we just let the market do its work ?
Wo n’t Microsoft and Google build on that white space anyway ?
advertisement
The government needs to show some real leadership by moving its activities –health , education –onto an anywhere network .
The reason networks are so efficient is that they diminish the relevance of your physical location ; for example , you do n’t have to drive down to the DMV if you can do everything online .
If the government can challenge itself to move its governance online , that commitment will help our whole economy move onto the network .
The letter to President Obama talks about building public housing with fiber optic connectivity .
How do we mandate things like this and make sure that we ’re using the right technology ?
Is fiber , for example , definitely the best ?
It ’s not the only vehicle –you can get broadband over cable , telephone , power lines– but it ’s the best technology we have today .
When the government builds public housing , there are requirements for things like green space .
Why should n’t there be requirements for letting inhabitants participate in an anywhere network ?
This funding should be technology agnostic , but there are technologies out there today that we should be using .
Like femtocells ?
Femtocells dramatically increase connectivity in an economical way ; it ’s an extremely exciting technology that could expand the reach of wireless technology .
One of the biggest costs for network providers is mounting equipment around a city .
These operators are very excited about people using femtocells , but they ’re still trying to figure out how the business model works .
They ’ll be great for schools and hospitals .
Does Obama understand the need for an “ anywhere ” network ?
advertisement
He certainly was great during the campaign about promulgating broadband for all , but less than 1 % of the stimulus package is for broadband .
Maybe we do n’t know how to use any more than 1 % responsibly at this point .
But over the next eight years , we need to tip the balance in favor of service economy investment .
A “ car czar ” is an imprecise title .
It conjures up a romantic era of Russian tyrants and Faberge eggs .
No , the control economy that Congress is slopping out these days is begging for a “ car commissar , ” not a czar .
Nancy Pelosova has floated the idea of a national auto czar who would oversee the restructuring of the American car business .
She would like to see this person appointed as soon as Congress approves the $ 15 billion ( or is it $ 34 billion ? ) industry bailout plan , which may include a partial nationalization of the industry .
The U.S. government is an enterprise of massive incompetence and waste , with a $ 3 trillion yearly budget and $ 10 trillion — give or take a few billion — in outstanding national debt , according to the Treasury Department .
Who better to run a failing industry ?
And who better to oversee a top - down economic plan than someone with a razor - sharp mind like Barney Frank and his cronies , with their vast experience administrating multibillion - dollar corporations and insight into the needs of the American consumer ?
In the Soviet era , central planning would dictate which industry could exist , what products the economy could create , how many units could be produced , what the wage of each worker could be and the amount of fuel each citizen would be allocated .
It all sounds familiar .
Congress is demanding Detroit build so - called “ green ” cars , even though Americans show little inclination to buy them willingly .
Congress wants to determine executive pay , yet it wo n’t allow extravagant union benefits to be renegotiated through bankruptcy .
Now , according to The Wall Street Journal , the government also may receive warrants for stock equivalent of at least 20 percent of the loans these companies receive — or , in other words , nationalization .
Many people are asking :
Why ca n’t these companies go bankrupt and reorganize like everyone else ?
In bankruptcy court , the process allows the auto industry to negotiate with creditors , stakeholders and unions .
Well , the auto industry spent nearly $ 50 million lobbying Congress in the first nine months of this year while unions spent hundreds of millions to put Democrats in Washington .
Those are two reasons .
The Big 3 continue to float the myth that civilization will collapse should they fail .
Yet , there are no assurances these companies will emerge from under the massive debt , mismanagement and legacy costs that drove ( or is it “ flew ” ? )
CEOs to Washington to beg in the first place .
Does anyone believe that the $ 40,000 - plus electric
Volt is going to save General Motors when gas costs $ 1.50 a gallon ?
( Then again , it should be noted that when cap - and - trade legislation kicks in so will the control energy economy .
Congress can then get gas prices back where they belong : really high . )
“ We do n’t want government to run companies , ” Barack Obama , who supports a bailout , recently said on “ Meet the Press . ”
“ Generally , government historically has n’t done that very well . ”
Generally ?
Washington is now ready to sign off on the business plan of auto companies and buy into industry .
If that ’s not “ running ” the economy , then what is ?
Not long ago , incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel claimed that we “ never want a serious crisis to go to waste .
This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before . ”
Does this mean a czar for every sector of the economy ?
Because this brand of economic planning has been tried , and it has failed — not “ generally , ” but every time .

I ’m telling you this because on Tuesday I was talking with a high - ranking Obama administration official about the stimulus plan .
“ There will be a dead tree planted , figuratively speaking , ” he said somberly .
“ That will happen . ”
How could it not ?
Much of the stimulus money is being channeled through state and local governments , through tens of thousands of governors , mayors , county executives , transportation commissioners , parks superintendents and so on .
Try to imagine the person in that pyramid with the lowest I.Q. , and you ’ll understand that there ’s a dead - tree planter hidden in there somewhere .
The White House is trying to overcome this problem with a Transparency and Accountability Board , overseen by Vice President Joe Biden .
It is supposed to reassure the public that the stimulus money is n’t being wasted .
But some people within the administration are arguing that that is n’t enough , that the government needs to bombard people with examples of what ’s being done right  like holding big rallies for all the schoolteachers whose jobs are saved by the stimulus .
Or  and I swear to you this is a real idea  inventing a kind of stimulus logo , like the old National Recovery Administration blue eagle , that could be posted on every federally funded project , as one official explained , “ to show the public exactly what we ’re doing . ”
Let us skip over the fact that the National Recovery Administration is best remembered as the part of the New Deal that did n’t work .
Because we are instantly fascinated by the idea of designing that logo .
How about :
Erp the Economic Recovery Portuguese Water Dog  Sasha and Malia ’s incoming White House pet , setting a good example by taking on a second job to help support the family .
Isadore the Infrastructure Improvement Iguana
Arnie the Ant and Ginny the Grasshopper 
Both wearing overalls and carrying shovels , symbols that troubled times fall equally hard on the party animals and the serious guys who saved their money and invested it with Bernie Madoff .
Petey the Penguin 
Do n’t want to go with another eagle .
But everybody likes penguins .
They march ; they do n’t fly into airplane engines ...
Joe Biden  Dressed like a penguin .
Or , if all else fails , they could just get Bobby Jindal a prime - time program .
Editor 's note : Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School .
He is completing a book on the history of national security politics since World War II , to be published by Basic Books .
Zelizer writes widely on current events .
Julian Zelizer says it 's not enough for Republicans to oppose Obama 's plans , they must offer their own ideas .
PRINCETON , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
One of the best Marx Brothers movies , " Horse Feathers , " played in movie theaters at the height of the Great Depression in 1932 .
In the film , the comedian Groucho Marx played the new president of Huxley College , Quincy Adams Wagstaff .
During one of the most memorable scenes , Groucho introduces himself to faculty and students by singing about his philosophy of governance : " Your proposition may be good / But let 's have one thing understood /
Whatever it is , I 'm against it !/ And even when you 've changed it or condensed it , I 'm against it / I 'm opposed to it / On general principle .
I 'm opposed to it . "
If Republicans want to rebuild their party after the calamity of 2008 , the party leadership needs to avoid the Quincy Adams Wagstaff approach to politics .
When Obama proposed his economic recovery bill last week , the first words to come out of House Minority Leader 's John Boehner 's mouth sounded a bit like Wagstaff .
With the economy imploding and the international economic crisis worsening , Boehner said : " Right now , given the concerns that we have over the size of the package and all of the spending in this package , we do n't think it 's going to work .
And so if it 's the plan that I see today , put me down in the ' no ' column . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been more restrained in his response , leaving open the door to compromise .
If Boehner is simply acting as Dr. No to get a better deal , Republicans can come out of the negotiations over the economic recovery bill as partners , planting the seeds for a new Republican approach toward dealing with economic matters .
But if Boehner 's plan is for his party to act as an oppositional force -- trying to block , delay and prevent legislative action -- then the GOP could find itself in big trouble .
If the Republicans do n't agree with Obama 's approach , given the severity of the crisis , they need to offer an alternative rather than just sitting still .
To be sure , there is the possibility that if the economy continues to deteriorate after a bill has passed and the public loses faith in Obama , the House GOP could reap the benefit from their opposition .
They could say " we told you so . "
But even that would be a high - risk maneuver , particularly given the state of public opinion about the Republican Party .
Even if a bill passes and the economy continues to struggle , voters would be looking at a Republican Party that did n't have anything better to offer .
The public likes hard - working politicians .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal ideas did n't always work -- some like the National Recovery
Act were downright failures -- but voters valued a president who tried to offer arguments about how to end the crisis and who rolled up his sleeves to make the nation better .
The election of 2008 revealed that the Republican Party lacks the kind of big ideas that Ronald Reagan used in 1980 to bring the conservative movement into power .
The various factions of the conservative movement came together around the themes of anti-communism , deregulation and tax cuts .
Reagan did n't just sell tax cuts for the wealthy as good in themselves , but connected them to supply - side economics , which claimed that cuts would stimulate investment , generate economic growth and ultimately bring more revenue into the coffers of Treasury .
Even after the Soviet Union collapsed , Republican leaders found ideas to sell their movement to the public .
Newt Gingrich and a cohort of young Republicans focused on sharp attacks about the dangers of government intervention and corruption of government .
For a short time it seemed that under George W. Bush , the war on terrorism would provide a new thematic focus to Republican efforts .
But this was not to be .
The controversies over Iraq and the continued dangers in countries such as Afghanistan undermined Republican claims of superiority on national security policy .
Controversies over the erosion of civil liberties and due process in the pursuit of terrorism also weakened their claims .
When the economy collapsed in fall 2008 , Republicans ' arguments about the wisdom of tax cuts and deregulation were made suspect .
Americans might not always like government , but they dislike being broke even more .
Sen .
John McCain struggled in his campaign , not just because of the weaknesses of his campaign , but because his party seemed to lack any answers as Wall Street and Main Street spun out of control .
Furthermore , the fact that the federal government continued to expand under Bush -- both when Republicans and Democrats controlled Capitol Hill -- made it difficult to sell Republican arguments about the dangers of big government .
Back in the 1970s , when Republicans felt as if they were in the political wilderness , they invested a great deal of their resources into the market of ideas .
Conservatives built think tanks like the CATO Institute , established talk radio shows , and financed academic scholarship about conservatism so that when opportunities arose in the elections of 1980 and 1994 , Republicans had something to say .
At some point , Republicans have to tap into the 1970s enthusiasm about generating ideas if they want to rebuild their party and win over the hearts and minds of voters .
Simply reviving the philosophy of the 1970s wo n't work .
Rather the GOP needs to offer new arguments and new policies to achieve economic recovery .
If they repeat what happened in the 1930s , when Republicans sounded a lot like Groucho Marx and just said no as FDR rebuilt the nation , they are likely to remain on the outskirts of power for decades to come .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer .

UK news organisations are becoming increasingly frustrated by the continuing ban preventing foreign correspondents from crossing into the Gaza Strip , more than two weeks after Israel 's military offensive against Hamas began .
After months of attempting to limit access , the Israel Defence Forces are still refusing to open the Erez crossing they closed on 27 December , when the bombing campaign began , to anything other than humanitarian aid – despite a supreme court ruling ordering the government to allow members of the international press into Gaza .
David Mannion , the ITV News editor - in- chief , branded the Israeli media ban " disgraceful " , while Dominic Wagthorn , the Sky News Middle East correspondent , said the " unprecedented " level of interference was " very frustrating " .
However , a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London responded that his government was only limiting media access to a war zone as other countries , including the UK , would do in the same situation .
Mannion accused the Israelis of censoring the war .
While pictures were coming out of Gaza from news agencies Reuters and Associated Press , having his crews stuck on the border , he said , meant events were increasingly difficult to verify .
" If Israel is saying that Hamas fired rockets from inside a school complex then let us in to verify that .
It is frankly disgraceful for any democracy to prevent us from entering an area to report .
It is up to us , not them , to decide if it is too dangerous to enter , " he added .
Channel 4
News , similarly blocked from entering the territory , is using a local Palestinian team of cameramen and producers to report on the effect of air strikes and fighting on the Palestinians .
" I imagine that the Israelis are calculating that the longer they keep people out , the more interest will wane , " Ben dePear , Channel 4 News foreign editor , told MedianGuardian.co.uk .
Sky News , along with other international news groups , was prevented from filming in areas on the Israeli side of the border as the IDF created a closed military zone and moved reporters on to a specially designated hill overlooking the territory , but away from the fighting .
" The hill was full of experts and spokesmen from various Israeli departments and agencies .
They are able to spin it .
Meanwhile there is a terrible loss of life going on that we can't cover .
It 's very frustrating , " said Wagthorn .
He added the level of interference was " unprecedented " in the region .
" They have made the calculation : what makes them look worse ?
Being banned together with Zimbabwe and Burma in restricting press freedom or letting us go in there ? " he said .
However , the BBC's head of world newsgathering , Jon Williams , was not convinced the Israeli PR machine had any greater effect than normal .
" This is not like the Georgian / Russian conflict where they were putting waves of people forward .
The Israeli government has always been smart and smooth about getting its message across .
The trick is for us to then get other people in to make it fair and balanced , " Williams said .
The Israeli Embassy spokesman said Gaza was now a war zone and Israel was only limiting media access in the way other countries involved in wars , including Britain , had previously done .
" We urge everyone to understand that it is a war zone , that is why we do n't allow free access to Gaza , " the spokesman added .
" Gaza is not hermetically sealed ... there is a direct border between Gaza and Egypt .
I wonder whether journalists applied to the Egyptian authorities for access to Gaza ? " he said .
Complaints about the Israeli authorities blockade came because Israel was an open - minded , pluralistic and liberal society , he added .
" They did not apply to Egypt because they know Egypt would automatically refuse but we do n't see similar complaints [ against them ] . "
Tim Butcher , Daily Telegraph Middle East editor , told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the Israelis were unwilling to give the foreign media access as they were seen as a propaganda tool for the other side .
Last week Daniel Seaman , director of Israel 's government press office , said any foreign journalists in Gaza would become a " fig leaf and front for the Hamas " .
Despite this damning assessment , Butcher added , journalists were powerless to do anything other than wait for access .
" There is no other option .
You can't just jump the fence , You have to play their games , " he said .
David Munk , Guardian deputy editor for international news , said Seaman 's comments were outrageous .
The Guardian is also using a local stringer to supply stories and information , alongside a variety of sources which includes non-governmental organisations in Gaza and traditional wire services .
" Just because you happen to be in a place that Israel does n't like you operating does n't mean we 'll be swept along by their [ Hamas ] propaganda , " Munk added .
" It is a deeply depressing situation when a country like Israel that prides itself on openness is not providing access to people from outside Gaza to see the full picture . "
Richard Beeston , the Times foreign editor , said that given the difficult conditions he had been pleased with the paper 's coverage .
However , Beeston conceded that his operation had been hampered by the blockade and had placed greater reliance on local stringers to gather information .

After Five Years Of Fighting , Lafayette Gets Their Fiber Symmetrical 10 Mbps ( $ 28.94 ) , 30 Mbps ( $ 44.95 ) and 50 Mbps ( $ 57.95 )
We 've been tracking the deployment of municipally - owned fiber in Lafayette , Louisiana for years , the project being particularly notable for some of the sleazy efforts made by Cox and AT&T ( then SBC ) to kill it .
Those efforts , back in 2005 , included everything from hinting at exporting local support jobs if the deal was approved , to hiring push pollsters to try and convince locals that the government - controlled project would result in politicians rationing consumer TV viewing .
Needless to say , Cox and Bellsouth lost .
A few weeks ago , Lafayette Utilities System ( LUS ) unveiled their pricing for the service , offering triple play bundles ranging from $ 84.85 to $ 200 , with downstream broadband services ranging from 10 M bps to 50 Mbps ( all symmetrical ) .
LUS offers standalone symmetrical 10 Mbps for $ 28.95 , 30 Mbps for $ 44.95 , and 50 M bps for $ 57.95 .
There 's no caps , no contracts , and no installation fee .
Those prices handily beat not only local competitors Cox and AT&T ( it 's now pretty clear why they fought so hard ) , but carriers in other markets too .
Comcast offers a 50 M bps tier in select markets for $ 139.95 ( when bundled ) , but its upstream speed is 5 M bps .
Verizon 's 50 Mbps / 20
Mbps service costs $ 144.95 / month standalone , or $ 139.95 when bundled .
The fastest speed AT&T currently offers customers is 18 M bps / 1.5 Mbps , which is $ 65 a month if you bundle TV service .
According to the Lafayette Daily Advertiser , LUS began officially offering service yesterday after five years of debate .
The service is being rolled out in four phases , with all customers expected to be able to receive service by 2011 .
The first customers were supposed to be online in January , but the launch was delayed by negotiations with broadcasters over channel lineups and prices .
Phase I involves wiring two areas on opposite ends of the city .
" This infrastructure will allow Lafayette to continue making great enhancements to our city during a time when many areas are experiencing a slowdown in development , " City - Parish President Joey Durel , said in a prepared statement " Beyond these initial services , the LUS Fiber infrastructure will favorably position Lafayette for economic development and other opportunities to move our community forward . " update : Joey Durel , Lafayette City - Parish President , stops by our comment section to leave a note : quote :
Thank you all for your comments .
We are excited by the possibilities this brings to our community .
We put together a very conservative business plan and should easily be able to sustain our pricing .
Of course as programming costs go up , our prices will go up , and so will the competition .
One thing not mentioned is the fact that we are also giving 100MBS peer to peer , for FREE .
And , if this initiative does n't live up to the expectations , my neck is on the chopping block .
I think it is worth the minimal risk .
And , by the way , this is not backed by the government , so taxpayers are not at risk .

There is more ...
Thank you all for your comments .
We are excited by the possibilities this brings to our community .
We put together a very conservative business plan and should easily be able to sustain our pricing .
Of course as programming costs go up , our prices will go up , and so will the competition .
One thing not mentioned is the fact that we are also giving 100MBS peer to peer , for FREE .
And , if this initiative does n't live up to the expectations , my neck is on the chopping block .
I think it is worth the minimal risk .
And , by the way , this is not backed by the government , so taxpayers are not at risk .
These are revenue bonds backed by our utilities system , and while there is some risk it is actually very low .
Thanks again ,

Jennifer Jones Is Heating Up The Curling Rinks
Total Pro Sports -
In case you did n’t know , one of the biggest curling tournaments of the year is being held right now in Victoria , British Columbia , and its called the Scott Tournament of Hearts .
Normally I would have very little interest all things curling , but that is before I became familiar with Jennifer Jones .
Jennfier Jones is the skip ( captain ) for Team Canada and is currently the world curling champion .
We here at TPS just wanted to take moment to let her know that she # 1 in our hearts .
We would also like to thank her for giving us a reason to watch curling on television .
Let ’s be honest she ’s not super hot , but compared to her colleagues she ’s Angelina Jolie .
When you think about it , curling has all the ingredients to be an entertaining sport .
It features women grunting and screaming , while they are sweeping , the only problem was the lack of attractive competitors .
Now , that has changed thanks to Jennifer Jones , Cheryl Bernard and others who can make the ice melt .
Thank you women of curling for looking so darn good on the ice , what ’s next ?
Attractive female power lifters ?

An investigation into an alleged plot by secularist ultranationalists to overthrow the Turkish government deepened with last week 's arrest of senior military officers and the discovery of several weapons caches .
At the same time , there is growing concern that the probe – aimed at tackling longstanding , antidemocratic forces in Turkish politics – could lead to increased tension between the government and Turkey 's powerful military .
" If the prosecution continues as we have seen it , we can have an extremely dangerous situation , " says Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul - based expert on Turkish security issues .
" You now have extreme distrust between the government and the military .
What we do n't want is a situation where the military believes the government is out to get it . "
The investigation into the coup plot , which started in June 2007 and is known as " Ergenekon , " has already resulted in the arrest of some 100 people , among them retired four - star generals and prominent politicians , journalists and academics .
According to an indictment , the plotters were hoping to bring down the Islamist - rooted Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) by sowing enough chaos , through terror attacks and high - level assassinations , that the military would be forced to intervene .
Weapons caches found
In recent days , following sketches found in the homes of some of the suspects , police have uncovered two weapons caches buried on the outskirts of Ankara .
Among the weapons were hand grenades , plastic explosives , and ammunition .
For many Turks , the investigation and the arrests – particularly of high - level military personnel – offer a chance to expose and unravel some of the work of the " Deep State , " a phrase used to describe a shadowy zone where state interests intersect with lawless and corrupt elements of the bureaucracy , military , and the security establishment .
" I think this is a historical case .
This is a good chance for the Turkish political system to put a stop to military interventions and to clean its ranks of these illegal affiliations between state authorities and gangsters and mafia types , " says Sahin Alpay , a professor of political science at Istanbul 's Bahcesehir University .
But the case , started in June 2007 after grenades were found in the Istanbul home of a retired military officer , is also creating new tensions between the AKP and the military , which sees itself as the ultimate guardian of Turkey 's secular tradition and which has forced out of power four governments in the past .
The arrest last week of three retired generals and nine active officers led to the armed forces chief Gen.
Ilker Basbug to call Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a surprise meeting .
Other parts of Turkey 's secularist establishment , including the judiciary , are also crying foul over the course that the Ergenekon investigation is taking , saying the government is using it to silence its opposition and settle scores .
" We are witnessing a confrontation against the Republic 's core values .
This is a regime change , like in the Khomeini and Hitler eras , " Deniz Baykal , leader of the main opposition Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) said at a press conference after last week 's arrests .
The Judges and Prosecutors Association ( YARSAV ) and the Istanbul bar association have also strongly criticized the way the investigation has been unfolding .
" We are concerned about the rule of law [ in Turkey ] , as these people were detained because of their works and sensitivity over the democratic order , constitutional regime , secularism , and integrity of the state , in a way that could be assessed as revenge , " Muammer Aydin , head of the Istanbul Bar , said recently .
But criticism of the case has not been limited to hard - line secularists .
Investigation tainted by politics ?
The large number of arrests , which include some of the AKP 's most vocal critics , and the dubious nature of the some of the evidence in the investigation have some observers asking if the Ergenekon case has become tainted by politics .
" I do not perceive Ergenekon as an empty investigation and I do n't want to see it that way .
In no way am I underestimating it .
But if not put on the right track soon , I think it might turn into a big fiasco , " Mehmet Ali Birand , a leading Turkish commentator , wrote recently .
Adds Jenkins , the military analyst : " [ The Ergenekon investigation ] started as a kernel of truth , but the AKP has seized on this as an opportunity to undermine the military and its secularist opponents and try to destroy their public reputation .
With every step , it has become more politicized and anti-democratic . "
Government officials have rejected claims that the probe has gone off track , saying its critics are simply not accustomed to seeing the rule of law extending to what had previously been untouchable figures .
Still , observers say that the enormity and importance of the case requires the government to move carefully .
" There really needs to be a scrupulous investigation .
Everything has to be done by the book and in the right way , " says Emma Sinclair - Webb , a Turkey researcher at the New York - based Human Rights Watch .
" On the other hand , you can't just caricature this whole process as simply being about a power struggle , " she says .
" It 's just too important of a chance for Turkey to grapple with a very dark history and get rid of a criminal apparatus within the state . "
if
It is now reported that about 40 % of the expected Obama fiscal stimulus plan will come in the form of tax cuts .
Or at least , what is labeled as tax cuts , as some of the tax cuts he proposed during the campaign were n't really tax cuts , they were more like government transfer payments .
Anyway , ( with emphasis on " if " ) we are to have some kind of Keynesian " stimulus " , then tax cuts are preferable to active efforts to achieve monetary inflation and spending increases .
That is because first of all , tax cuts ( at least genuine ones ) improve incentives for productive efforts .
And secondly , because they leave the decision of ultimate spending to private households , in sharp contrast to direct government spending ( though this is also true of government transfer payments ) .
I now see that Harvard economics professor Ed Glaeser also favors tax cuts as the preferred method of stimulus .
However , he appears to favor targeted tax cuts just for low income earners , because they are more willing to spend it , similar to the plan Obama presented during the campaign .
There are two problems with this : first of all , if you phase out tax cuts with rising income , you increase the marginal rate of taxation and so reduce incentives for productive efforts .
And secondly , higher private savings is not a bad thing .
Indeed , a key problem in the U.S. economy is that household savings remain too low and household debt remains too high .
By boosting private savings and enabling a reduction in the level of private debt , firms will feel safer that households will be able and willing to buy their products in the future and so increase investments .
The large deficits that this plan presupposse will of course counteract this effect , as the fear of future tax increases will limit investment spending , which is why it is not a cure per se .
But at least the negative effects of the deficit will be counteracted by the positive higher private savings .
If the deficit is used for spending by contrast , the effect will be lower long term investment and so lower long term growth .
So , while " socializing " debt by increasing private savings through higher government deficits may not solve the problems , at least it wo n't aggravate them .
If by contrast the deficit is used for spending , the problem with a too low savings rate will only be aggravated .
Guile によるスクリプティン グ
C と Scheme を強化する拡張言 語
Scheme は Lisp を簡易化して派生させた言語で 、1958 年に初め てJohn McCarthy によって紹介されました。その Scheme 言語のインタープリターとして 1995 年に Guile は登場しました 。Guile はインタープリターである一方で 、Scheme を組み込み可能な言語にします。このことから 、Guile は組み込みスクリプトに最適なインタープリターとなっています。Guile は単なる拡張言語の 1 つではなく、GNU プロジェクトの公式拡張言語です。gEDA CAD ツールから ( Scheme スクリプトを利用した動的な構成が可能な ) Scwm ( Scheme Constraints Window Manager ) に至るまで、多数のオープンソース・アプリケーションで、スクリプティングに
Guile を使用しています ( 「参考文献」セクションのリンクを参照)。これまでスクリプティングによるアプリケーション拡張は、GNU
Emacs、GIMP、そして Apache Web Server など、大きな成功を収めてきましたが 、Guile もそれに続いています 。
Guile の背後にある鍵は、拡張性です。図 1 を見てください 。Guile では 、Scheme スクリプトを解釈したり、コンパイル済み の
C プログラムに動的にバインドしたりできるだけでなく、コンパイル済み
C 関数を Scheme スクリプトに統合することもできます。この貴重な機能が意味することは、ユーザーがアプリケーションを調整、あるいはカスタマイズして、それぞれに固有の付加価値を与えられるということです。
図 1 . Guile を使用したスクリプティング・モデル
アプリケーションをカスタマイズする代表的な例の 1 つは、ビデオ・ゲーム業界です。ビデオ・ゲームは、スクリプティングによって大々的なカスタマイズを行っています。さらに、多くのゲーム・プログラムでは、コア設計にもスクリプティングを利用しており、ある特定の側面
( ノンプレイヤー・キャラクターの振る舞いなど)
では実装をスクリプトで行っているほどです。
単純な例
まずは 、Guile を C 言語プログラムに統合する単純な例を見てみましょう。この例では、Scheme スクリプトを呼び出 す C プログラムを使用します。リスト 1 とリスト 2 に、この最初の例のソース・コードを記載します。
ゲームにおけるスクリプト 最近のゲームには、スクリプト言語が組み込まれているのが一般的です。これには、従来の
Python や Ruby などといったインタープリターで解釈される言語から、UnrealScript といった特殊用途のスクリプト言語まで含まれます
( 「 参考文献」セクションのリンクを参照)。ゲーム・システムでは、ノン・プレイヤー・キャラクターの振る舞いや、さらにはゲームに現れる物の動きを実装するためにもスクリプト言語を使用することができます。ゲーム開発は、スクリプトで行ったほうが便利です。その理由は、新たな振る舞いや動きを導入する際に長時間に及ぶコンパイル・サイクルが不要になるからです。PC
で動作するお気に入りのゲームのサブディレクトリーを調べてみてください。大抵は、スクリプトが見つかるはずです。
リスト 1 は、Scheme スクリプトを呼び出 す C アプリケーションです。最初に目に付くのは、libguile.h ヘッダー・ファイルがインクルードされていることです。これによって、必要な
Guile シンボルが使用できるようになります。次に、 SCM という新しい型が定義されていることに注目してください。この型は、Guile 内に含まれるすべて の Scheme オブジェクトを表 す C の抽象的な型です。このリストでは、後で呼び出す Scheme 関数を示しています 。
Guile を使ったスレッドで常に最初に実行しなければならないことは、 scm_init_guile の呼び出しです。この関数 は
Guile のグローバル状態を初期化するので、他の
Scheme 関数を呼び出す前に呼び出さなければなりません。次に、呼び出す
Scheme 関数が含まれるファイルをロードする必要があります。そのために使用するのは、 scm_c_primitive_load 関数です。この関数の名前で注意する点として、 _c_ は、この関数 が Scheme 変数ではなく、C 変数に渡されることを示します 。
このリストでは続いて scm_c_lookup を使用して、シンボル ( モデル内の Scheme 関数 ) によってバインドされた変数を見つけて返します。その後、この変数は scm_variable_ref で逆参照されて
Scheme 変数 func に格納されます。そして最後に 、Scheme 関数を呼び出すために scm_call_0 を使用します。この Guile 関数は、事前に定義された Scheme 関数を引数なしで呼び出します 。
リスト 1 . Scheme スクリプトを呼び出す C プログラ ム
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h > int main ( int argc , char ** arg ) { SCM func ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " simple - script " ) ) ; scm_call_0 ( func ) ; return 0 ; }
リスト 2 に記載するのは、C プログラム内から呼び出され る Scheme 関数です。この関数は display プロシージャーを使ってストリングを画面に出力します。この関数に続いて呼び出されるのは newline プロシージャーです。このプロシージャーによってキャリッジ・リターンが出力されます。
リスト 2 . C から呼び出される Scheme スクリプト ( script.scm )
( define simple - script ( lambda ( ) ( display " script called " ) ( newline ) ) )
ここで興味深い点は、このスクリプトが
C プログラムに静的にバインドされていないことです。スクリプトは動的にバインドされます。Scheme スクリプトは変更可能で、事前コンパイル済みの
C プログラムが実行されるときには、このスクリプトに実装された新しい振る舞いが実行されます。これこそが、組み込みスクリプトの威力です。つまり、コンパイル済みアプリケーションの処理速度を落とすことなく、動的スクリプティングが持つ拡張性という機能をもたらすことができます。
単純な例を理解したところで、今度はもう少し踏み込んで、C
言語内での Scheme スクリプトの他の要素について探ってみましょう。
Scheme の概要
Scheme に馴染みがない読者のために、この言語の特徴を示す具体的な例をいくつか見てみましょう。ここに紹介する例は、変数、条件構文、ループ、そして
Scheme の重要ないくつかの機能を説明するものです。この記事では、Scheme についての完全な説明はしませんが、「参考文献」セクションに参考となる資料へのリンクを記載しています。
以降の例では 、Guile インタープリターを使用することで 、Scheme をリアルタイムで操作して Scheme コードを提供し、その結果を即座に確認します。
変数
Scheme は動的型付け言語です。そのため通常は、変数の型は実行時までわかりません。Scheme 変数は単なるコンテナーであり、その型は後から定義することができます。
変数は define プリミティブを使用して作成します。作成した後は、 set !
プリミティブによって変更します。以下はその一例です。
guile > ( define my - var 3 ) guile > ( begin ( display my - var ) ( newline ) ) guile > ( set ! my - var ( * my - var my - var ) )
プロシージャ ー
当然のことながら 、Scheme ではプロシージャーを作成することも可能です。プロシージャーを作成する場合も、やはり define プリミティブを使用します。プロシージャーは匿名にすることも
( ラムダ・プロシージャー ) 、名前付きにすることもできます。名前付きプロシージャーの場合は、以下に示すように変数に格納されます。
( define ( square val ) (* val val ) )
Lisp を使い慣れている方にとって、上記の構文は従来の
Lisp の構文とは異なりますが、いくらか読みやすくなっています。このように定義した後は、この新規プロシージャーを他のあらゆるプリミティブと同じように使用することができます。以下はその一例です。
guile > ( square 5 ) 25
条件構文
Scheme には、条件分岐を行う方法がいくつかあります。そのうち最も基本的なのは、単純な if 条件です 。if 条件で指定するのは、テスト条件、真の場合の式、そしてオプションで偽の場合の式です。以下の例を見ると、Scheme でのリスト処理の方法がわかるはずです。このリストは if で始まり、 ( display " less " ) で終わっています 。Scheme は Lisp から派生していることから、リストで構成されることを思い出してください。Scheme はコードとデータの両方をリストとして表すため、コードとデータとの境界があいまいになります
( データとしてのコード、コードとしてのデータ ) 。
guile > ( define my - var 3 ) guile > ( if (> my - var 20 ) ( display " more " ) ( display " less " ) ) less
ループ
Scheme では、再帰によってループを実装します。そのためループを実装するときには特定の観念が必要となりますが、繰り返し処理に再帰を使うのは自然なことです。以下の例に、0 から 9 を繰り返し処理してから 「 done 」と出力す る Scheme スクリプトを記載します。この例では 、Scheme で末尾再帰と呼ばれるものを使用しています。ループの終わりで、引数を毎回
1 ずつインクリメントして同じ関数を再帰的に呼び出すことによって、ループの繰り返しを実装している点に注目してください。このような再帰は、従来の言語では呼び出しの履歴を保持するスタックを消耗させることになりますが、Scheme の場合は違います。最後の呼び出し ( 末尾 ) が、プロシージャー呼び出しやスタック保守のオーバーヘッドをもたらすことなく、関数を単純に呼び出します。
( let countup ( ( i 0 ) ) ( if ( = i 10 ) ( begin ( display " done " ) ( newline ) ) ( begin ( display i ) ( newline ) ( countup (+ i 1 ) ) ) ) )
Scheme にはもう 1 つの興味深いループ方法として、 map プロシージャーを使用するという方法もあります。これは、以下の例に示すように、単にプロシージャーをリストに適用 ( つまり、マップ ) するという概念です。この方法は、読みやすさと単純さの両方の点において優れています。
guile > ( define my - list ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) guile > ( define ( square val ) (* val val ) ) guile > ( map square my - list ) ( 1 4 9 16 25 )
Scheme スクリプトによる C プログラムの拡 張
リスト 1 から明らかなように 、Scheme では比較的簡単 に C プログラムを拡張することができます。今度は別の例で、C を Scheme に結び付けるために使用できる、その他のアプリケーション・プログラミング・インターフェース ( API ) について検討します。ほとんどのアプリケーションでは、Scheme を呼び出すだけでなく、引数を Scheme 関数に渡し、戻り値を受け取って、変数を 2 つの環境で共有しなければなりません 。Guile には、この機能を可能にする関数が豊富に用意されています。
Guile は 2 つの環境の境界を越え て Scheme の機能を C にまで拡張しようとしています。この点に関しては、動的な型、継続、ガーベッジ・コレクションなどの
Scheme の概念が Guile API によって C に拡張されていることがわかるはずです 。
Scheme の概念を C に拡張している一例には 、C 環境で動的に新し い Scheme 変数を作成する機能が挙げられます 。Scheme 変数を作成するために使用す る C 関数は、 scm_c_define です。前述のとおり、 _c_ は、C の型を引数として提供していることを示しています 。Scheme 変数 ( scm_c_lookup 関数によって提供された変数 ) が既にある場合には、代わりに scm_define を使用することができます。C で Scheme 変数を作成できるだけでなく 、Scheme 変数を逆参照して 2 つの環境の間で値を変換することもできます。リスト 3 に、この一連の例を示しています 。
リスト 3 とリスト 4 のそれぞれに、C と Scheme との相互作用を表す 2 つの例を示します。リスト 3 の最初の例では、C から Scheme 関数を呼び出し、引数を渡して戻り値を取得する方法を示しており、2 番目の例では引数を渡すため の
Scheme 変数を作成しています。リスト 4 に示す 2 つの Scheme 関数は同じ振る舞いを実装しますが、最初の関数では引数を使用し、2 番目の関数では静的変数を使用しています。
scm_call の制約事 項
Guile には、 scm_call の 5 つのバリエーションが用意されています 。Scheme 関数を呼び出す際の引数の個数が 0 個の場合 ( scm_call_0 ) から、最大 4 個の場合 ( scm_call_4 ) までがあります。これによって 、Guile から渡される Scheme 変数の数が 4 個までに制限されます。また、引数の個数が可変の関数はサポートされません。引数が
4 個を超える場合、あるいは引数の個数が可変の場合には 、Scheme リスト・オブジェクトを必要な引数の数で構成するという方法を使うことができます。
リスト 3 の最初の例では、単純に scm_call_1 関数を使用して、引数が 1 個の Scheme 関数を呼び出しています。この場合、関数には
Scheme の値を渡す必要があることに注意してください。従って、C の整数値を Scheme の数値データ型に変換するために、 scm_int2num 関数を使用します。逆に 、Scheme 変数 ret_val を C の整数値に変換するには scm_num2int を使用します 。
リスト 3 の 2 番目の例では最初に、 scm_c_define を使用し て Scheme 変数を新規に作成します。この関数を識別する C ストリング変数 ( sc_arg ) は、型変換関数 scm_int2num によって自動的に初期化されます 。Scheme 変数が作成されたら、あとは単 に
Scheme 関数 square2 を呼び出して ( この場合は引数を使用しません)、同じプロセスに従って戻り値を取得し、逆参照することができます。
リスト 3 . C における Scheme 関数と Scheme 変数の扱い 方
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { SCM func ; SCM ret_val ; int sqr_result ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; /*
Calling the square script with a passed argument */ scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " square " ) ) ; ret_val = scm_call_1 ( func , scm_int2num ( 7 ) ) ; sqr_result = scm_num2int ( ret_val , 0 , NULL ) ; printf ( " result of square is %d
" , sqr_result ) ; /*
Calling the square2 script using a Scheme variable */ scm_c_define ( " sc_arg " , scm_int2num ( 9 ) ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " square2 " ) ) ; ret_val = scm_call_0 ( func ) ; sqr_result = scm_num2int ( ret_val , 0 , NULL ) ; printf ( " result of square2 is %d
" , sqr_result ) ; return 0 ; }
リスト 4 に、リスト 3 の C プログラムが使用する 2 つの Scheme プロシージャーを記載します 。1 番目のプロシージャー、 square は、引数を 1 つ取って結果を返す従来 の
Scheme 関数です 。2 番目の square2 プロシージャーは引数を取りませんが、代わりに
Scheme 変数 ( sc_arg ) を扱います。最初のプロシージャーと同様、この変数も結果を返します。
リスト 4 . リスト 3 から呼び出される Scheme スクリプト ( script.scm )
( define square ( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) ) ( define square2 ( lambda ( ) (* sc_arg sc_arg ) ) )
C 関数による Scheme スクリプトの拡 張
最後に紹介する例では 、Scheme スクリプトか ら C 関数を呼び出すプロセスを見ていきます。まず始めに取り掛かるのは、Scheme から呼び出し可能な関数です ( リスト 5 ) 。このリストで真っ先に気付くことは、これは
C 関数でありながらも 、Scheme オブジェクトを引数として受け取り、応答で Scheme オブジェクト ( SCM 型) を返すという点です。プログラムではまず、
SCM 引数を取得するために使用する
C 変数を、 scm_num2int 関数 ( Scheme 数値型を C int に変換する関数 ) を使って作成します。その上で、引数を二乗し、別の scm_from_int を呼び出して結果を返します 。
リスト 5 のプログラムの残りの部分では 、Scheme で起動するように環境をセットアップしています 。Guile 環境を初期化した後、C 関数を Scheme にエクスポートするために scm_c_define_gsubr を呼び出します。この関数が取る引数は 、Scheme での関数の名前、引数 ( 必須、オプション、その他 ) の数、そしてエクスポートする実際の
C 関数です。あとは前に説明したとおりで 、Scheme スクリプトをロードし、特定の Scheme 関数への参照を取得して、引数なしで関数を呼び出します。
リスト 5 . 環境を Scheme 用にセットアップするための C プログラ ム
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h> SCM c_square ( SCM arg ) { int c_arg = scm_num2int ( arg , 0 , NULL ) ; return scm_from_int ( c_arg * c_arg ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { SCM func ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; scm_c_define_gsubr( " c_square " , 1 , 0 , 0 , c_square ) ; scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " main - script " ) ) ; scm_call_0 ( func ) ; return 0 ; }
リスト 6 に 、Scheme スクリプトを記載します。このスクリプトは、リスト
5 の C プログラムでエクスポートされた関数、 c_square の呼び出しに対する応答を表示します 。
リスト 6 . C 関数を呼び出す Scheme スクリプト ( script.scm )
( define main - script ( lambda ( ) ( begin ( display ( c_square 8 ) ) ( newline ) ) ) )
平凡な例ですが、この例から、2 つの言語環境の間でコードと変数を簡単に共有できることがおわかりでしょう。
まとめ
静的なソフトウェアや製品を作成して配布する時代はもう終わりました。今やユーザーは、動的で、しかも簡単にカスタマイズできる製品を期待しています。この進化には新たな複雑さが伴いますが、最終的にはユーザーが、私たちが作成するアプリケーションに新しい価値を生み出す方法を教えることになるはずです。この記事を読んで、読者の皆さんが
Guile の威力を少しでも理解していただけたことを願います。Scheme は現在使われているプログラミング言語のなかでも最古のものの
1 つかもしれませんが、未だに最強を誇るプログラミング言語の 1 つでもあります 。Guile が、この Scheme をさらに協力かつ有益なものにすることに成功したからです。

My local newspaper editor , as he does regularly , once again attacked unions as the problem in America .
This is the same editor who once said " all the laziest goof - offs and goldbricks in the newsroom " where he began his career were union officials — and that the unionized New York Times editorial writers are nothing more than " limousine liberals . "
For this most recent attack , two days after Thanksgiving , he combined the economy with what he believes are greedy unions .
" [ L ] abor unions and their leaders are . . . distorting the truth about the American workplace , " wrote the editor .
First he set up Andy Stern , president of the Service Employees International Union , who said that " Tens of millions of Americans are working harder than ever just to stay afloat .
The latest Census Bureau report shows that wages are dropping and more people lack health insurance . . . a greater percentage of the economy is going to profits than to wages . "
Then , he cut apart Stern 's statement by gleefully citing data from the pro-business pro-management U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The Chamber said that wages , adjusted for inflation , for workers rose 30 percent from 1967 to 2007 .
Now , 30 percent seems good — unless you do the math .
That 's about three - quarters of one percent per year , far less than any executive compensation .
The editor then added in about 30 percent for benefits .
Of course , these benefits also include federally - mandated deductions , like social security , Medicare , and unemployment taxes .
As an afterthought , the editor claimed the " poverty rate dropped from 22.4 percent in 1959 to 12.5 percent in 2007 , " mysteriously trying to connect a reduced poverty level with reduced union influence .
What he did n't point out was that 1959 was a recession year , and that between 2000 and 2007 , according to the Census Bureau , the poverty rate actually increased from 11.3 percent to 12.5 percent .
About 37.3 million Americans are living below the federal poverty level ; about 40 percent of all Americans fell beneath the poverty line at least once in the past decade .
Sounding the alarm , the editor tied together Democrats and unions .
" [ T ] he plight of the American worker will grow more dire in the new year , as Democrats push to pass their legislation .
. . .
The danger is that their union - friendly legislation will hurt rather than help the American economy . "
To wrap everything up , the editor of a newspaper with the median circulation of all dailies in America concluded by asking his readers to " consider the current state of the once mighty American auto industry , and ask yourself :
What role did the powerful United Auto Workers play in its downfall ? "
It 's the workers — and those pesky liberal Democrats — who the editor blames for America 's economic crises .
Unfortunately , this editor is n't alone in his contempt for the workers .
Dozens of columnists and TV pundits spread the myth that the average auto worker at General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler earns $ 70 an hour — about $ 146,000 a year .
That figure , supplied by executives at the Big Three , reflects every cost associated with labor , including " legacy costs , " which are are costs of pensions and health benefits for retired workers .
Thus , the automakers added up every conceivable cost and divided it by hours worked ( pensioners , of course , do n't work ) to get the inflated numbers .
The reality is that the average UAW member earns about $ 28 an hour , about $ 58,000 a year , according to the impartial Center for Automotive Research .
What the news media fail to report is that the UAW made significant concessions over the years , including wage cut - backs at Chrysler and a 2007 contract for all three auto makers that created a " second tier " wage level of $ 14.50 –$ 16.23 per hour ( $ 30,160 –$ 33,758 per year , still below U.S. average wage of $ 40.405 , according to the Census Bureau ) , reduced benefits , and a retirement plan now administered by the UAW not the Big Three .
Others who attack organized labor claim that UAW worker earn far more an hour than their counterparts at non-American non-unionized auto manufacturers in the U.S. , and that 's a reason why the Big Three are failing .
However , the reality is that the average wage at the international automakers is estimated at $ 24 – $ 25 an hour , less than a $ 3 differential an hour for UAW first tier workers , according to Jonathan Cohn in The New Republic .
Even the most casual observer understands that it costs more to live in the Detroit area than the rural areas where foreign auto makers established their plants .
In contrast to the concessions given up by the workers , Big Three executives still earn multi-million dollar incomes .
Alan Mulally at Ford earned $ 2 million last year , plus additional compensation totaling about $ 21.7 million , according to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Ford lost $ 2.72 billion last year .
At GM , Rick Wagoner earned $ 15.7 million last year , according to the Wall Street Journal , while his company lost $ 38.7 billion .
Chrysler 's Robert Nardelli earned $ 1 in salary last year , but has significant compensation package that is not publicly disclosed .
Chrysler lost about $ 2.9 billion last year .
But , much of the media and the American public still blame workers and liberal Democrats who are favorable to the union movement for the economic crisis that led the Big Three to rev up their corporate jets and descend upon Congress to beg for a $ 25 billion taxpayer - funded bailout .
Are the workers and those liberal Democrats to blame for car sales being down 45 percent in October for GM , 35 percent for Chrysler , and 30 percent for Ford from a year ago ?
Are they to blame for the auto industry going for the quick profit by pushing gas - guzzling minivans , SUVs , and trucks , while foreign automakers began looking at more energy - efficient cars ?
Are they to blame that demand for autos has fallen off because Americans were unable to get financing in an economic crisis caused by greed of investment companies , banks , and almost every corporation that issues public stock ?
Are they to blame for the auto industry executives opposing public transportation and alternative energy cars ?

Many popular diets emphasize either carbohydrate , protein or fat as the best way to lose weight .
However , there have been few studies lasting more than a year that evaluate the effect on weight loss of diets with different compositions of those nutrients .
In a randomized clinical trial led by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) and Pennington Biomedical Research Center of the Louisiana State University System , a comparison of overweight participants assigned to four different diets over a two - year period showed that reducing calories achieved weight loss regardless of which of the three nutrients was emphasized .
The study , which was funded by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) of the National Institutes of Health , appears in the February 26 , 2009 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine .
“ This is important information for physicians , dieticians and adults , who should focus weight loss approaches on reducing calorie intake , ” said Frank Sacks , professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at HSPH and lead author of the study .
The NEJM issue includes an accompanying editorial on the study ’s findings .
The trial included 811 men and women who were randomly divided into four diet groups with different target nutrient compositions :
* Low - fat , average protein : 20 % of calories from fat , 15 % of calories from protein , 65 % of calories from carbohydrate
* Low - fat , high - protein : 20 % fat , 25 % protein , 55 % carbohydrate
* High - fat , average protein : 40 % fat , 15 % protein , 45 % carbohydrate
* High - fat , high - protein : 40 % fat , 25 % protein , 35 % carbohydrate
The participants were diverse in age , sex ( 62 % women , 38 % men ) , geography and income .
The diets followed heart - healthy principles , replacing saturated with unsaturated fat and were high in whole cereal grains , fruits and vegetables .
Each participant received a diet prescription that encouraged a 750 - calorie reduction per day , however none were less than 1,200 total calories per day .
Participants were asked to do 90 minutes of moderate exercise each week .
They recorded their daily food and drink intake in a food diary and in a web - based program that provided information on how closely they were meeting their dieting goals .
Individual counseling was provided every eight weeks over two years and group sessions were held three out of four weeks during the first six months and two out of four weeks from six months to two years .
The results showed that , regardless of diet , weight loss and reduction in waist circumference were similar .
Participants lost an average of 13 pounds at six months and maintained a 9 - pound loss at two years .
Weight loss primarily took place in the first 6 months ; after 12 months , all groups began to slowly regain weight , a finding consistent with other diet studies .
However , the extent of weight regain was much less , about 20 % , of the average regain in previous studies .
Waistlines were reduced by an average of two inches at the end of the two - year period .
Most risk factors for cardiovascular disease improved for dieters at six months and two years .
HDL ( “ good ” ) cholesterol increased and LDL ( “ bad ” ) cholesterol , triglycerides , blood pressure and insulin decreased .
The metabolic syndrome , a group of coronary heart disease risk factors including high blood pressure , insulin resistance and abdominal obesity , also decreased .
The main finding from the trial was that diets with varying emphases on carbohydrate , fat and protein levels all achieved clinically meaningful weight loss and maintenance of weight loss over a two - year period .
“ These results show that , as long as people follow a heart - healthy , reduced - calorie diet , there is more than one nutritional approach to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight , ” said Elizabeth G. Nabel , M.D. , Director , NHLBI .
Another important finding was that participants who regularly attended counseling sessions lost more weight than those who did n’t .
Dieters who attended two thirds of sessions over two years lost about 22 pounds of weight as compared to the average weight loss of 9 pounds .
“ These findings suggest that continued contact with participants to help them achieve their goals may be more important than the macronutrient composition of their diets , ” said Sacks .
Support for this study was provided by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health and NIH General Clinical Research Center .

Welcome to TypePad !
This is a sample post you can edit or delete later .
Continuing our review of FiveThirty Eight 's election forecasting model visualization ( link ) , I now look at their headline data visualization .
( The previous posts in this series are here , and here . )
It 's a set of 22 maps , each showing one election scenario , with one candidate winning .
What chart form is this ?
Small multiples may come to mind .
A small - multiples chart is a grid in which every component graphic has the same form - same chart type , same color scheme , same scale , etc .
The only variation from graphic to graphic is the data .
The data are typically varied along a dimension of interest , for example , age groups , geographic regions , years .
The following small - multiples chart , which I praised in the past ( link ) , shows liquor consumption across the world .
Each component graphic changes according to the data specific to a country .
When we scan across the grid , we draw conclusions about country - to - country variations .
As with convention , there are as many graphics as there are countries in the dataset .
Sometimes , the designer includes only countries that are directly relevant to the chart 's topic .
***
What is the variable FiveThirty Eight chose to vary from map to map ?
It 's the scenario used in the election forecasting model .
This choice is unconventional .
The 22 scenarios is a subset of the 40,000 scenarios from the simulation - we are left wondering how those 22 are chosen .
Returning to our question : what chart form is this ?
Perhaps you 're reminded of the dot plot from the previous post .
On that dot plot , the designer summarized the results of 40,000 scenarios using 100 dots .
Since Biden is the winner in 75 percent of all scenarios , the dot plot shows 75 blue dots ( and 25 red ) .
The map is the new dot .
The 75 blue dots become 16 blue maps ( rounded down ) while the 25 red dots become 6 red maps .
Is it a pictogram of maps ?
If we ignore the details on the maps , and focus on the counts of colors , then yes .
It 's just a bit challenging because of the hole in the middle , and the atypical number of maps .
As with the dot plot , the map details are a nice touch .
It connects readers with the simulation model which can feel very abstract .
Oddly , if you 're someone familiar with probabilities , this presentation is quite confusing .
With 40,000 scenarios reduced to 22 maps , each map should represent 1818 scenarios .
On the dot plot , each dot should represent 400 scenarios .
This follows the rule for creating pictograms .
Each object in a pictogram - dot , map , figurine , etc. - should encode an equal amount of the data .
For the 538 visualization , is it true that each of the six red maps represents 1818 scenarios ?
This may be the case but not likely .
Recall the dot plot where the most extreme red dot shows a scenario in which Trump wins 376 out of 538 electoral votes ( margin = 214 ) .
Each dot should represent 400 scenarios .
The visualization implies that there are 400 scenarios similar to the one on display .
For the grid of maps , the following red map from the top left corner should , in theory , represent 1,818 similar scenarios .
Could be , but I 'm not sure .
Mathematically , each of the depicted scenario , including the blowout win above , occurs with 1/40,000 chance in the simulation .
However , one expects few scenarios that look like the extreme scenario , and ample scenarios that look like the median scenario .
So , the right way to read the 538 chart is to ignore the map details when reading the embedded pictogram , and then look at the small multiples of detailed maps bearing in mind that extreme scenarios are unique while median scenarios have many lookalikes .
( Come to think about it , the analogous situation in the liquor consumption chart is the relative population size of different countries .
When comparing country to country , we tend to forget that the data apply to large numbers of people in populous countries , and small numbers in tiny countries . )
***
There 's a small improvement that can be made to the detailed maps .
As I compare one map to the next , I 'm trying to pick out which states that have changed to change the vote margin .
Conceptually , the number of states painted red should decrease as the winning margin decreases , and the states that shift colors should be the toss - up states .
So I 'd draw the solid Republican ( Democratic ) states with a lighter shade , forming an easily identifiable bloc on all maps , while the toss - up states are shown with a heavier shade .
Here , I just added a darker shade to the states that disappear from the first red map to the second .
According to TV Guide Magazine , Tim Allen and wife Jane Hajduk will welcome their first child together , into the world sometime this spring .
The couple is said to be is “ thrilled about their new addition . ”
Reports are that they know the sex of the baby but are not willing to leak the big surprise .
Allen has a daughter Katherine , 19 , from a previous marriage .

Stonewalling in Style : Bank of America Subpoenaed NY Attorney General says Ken Lewis refuses to say who got bonuses .
Feb. 27 , 2009  --
In just one day , the president of Bank of America , Ken Lewis , managed to defy both President Barack Obama and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
On Thursday , Lewis refused to provide a list of bonus payments to the New York Attorney General , after arriving in New York in his $ 50 million corporate jet .
Earlier this week , President Obama said the days of bank executives flying corporate jets " were over . "
Not for Bank of America .
Click here to watch Lewis arriving in one of Bank of America 's luxury corporate jets .
After Lewis refused to disclose just who got what out of $ 3.6 billion in bonuses given to Merrill Lynch employees before the banks merged late last year , the AG 's office responded harshly in the latest saga in the brewing legal battle .
" Bank of America has made the decision they do n't want to turn that information over to us and we , therefore , tonight served Bank of America with a subpoena to turn over that information , " said Special Assistant to the New York Attorney General Benjamin Lawsky Thursday evening , " and we intend to get that by whatever means is necessary going forward . "
Lewis met with the attorney general 's office for four hours , and he claimed afterwards that he fully cooperated .
Watch what Lewis had to say after the meeting .
But New York officials told ABC News the session with Lewis was ugly and combative .
They accused Lewis and the bank of stonewalling , saying they refused to provide a list of which executives got what of the billions in bonuses .
Watch the attorney general office 's response to the meeting .
Lewis Flew in Luxury Corporate Jet
The CEO arrived in style for the meeting , first traveling from the bank 's headquarters in Charlotte on a $ 50 million G - 5 corporate plane , and then in a premium SUV from a private jet airport in New Jersey to the Manhattan office .
Lewis flew back to Charlotte Friday morning on the same jet .
Congressman Elijiah Cummings , ( D - MD ) , decried such " outlandish activity " by the CEOs , telling ABC News ' Good Morning America today that he thinks " these folks are on another planet " and " just do n't get it . "
" To be very frank with you , " Cummings added , " I do n't really think they care . "
Click here to watch Congressman Cummings denounce luxury perks for CEOs of bailed - out firms .
The bank , which has received $ 45 billion in federal bailout money , defended the use of the luxury private plane for the hour - and - a - half flight , saying it was justified for efficiency and timing reasons .
It cost at least $ 5,000 an hour just for gasoline and pilots .
According to travel Web sites , a scheduled commercial flight on US Airways would have cost $ 440 .
The immediate issue for Lewis , say investigators , is whether he has told " the whole story " about the huge bonuses paid shortly before Merrill Lynch merged with Bank of America .
Appearing before Congress earlier this month , Lewis said he had " no authority " over the bonuses .
John Thain Testified Early This Week
Corporate merger documents read to ABC News , however , say the bonuses would be awarded " in consultation " with Bank of America .
Merrill Lynch 's John
Thain testified before Cuomo's investigators earlier this week and provided a list of bonus recipients and amounts .
Investigators say 696 employees received bonuses of $ 1 million or more .
Four top employees were given bonuses totaling $ 121 million .
Thain , in his first deposition Feb. 19 , had initially refused to answer questions regarding the bonuses , according to a partial transcript of that session .
On Monday , he was ordered to reappear after the attorney general 's office sought and received a court order compelling him to answer the questions .
The bonuses became a subject of the investigation into Merrill 's merger with Bank of America by Cuomo 's office after the attorney general raised whether the two banks -- which together received about $ 45 billion in taxpayer dollars -- worked together to arrange the early bonus plan just weeks before the merger was completed .
The bonus package , called the Variable Incentive Compensation Package , provoked outrage when it was revealed that Merrill Lynch lost $ 25 billion in 2008 .

Where others fear to tread , a 20 - year - old college student from Tequesta , Fla. , boldly stepped forward Tuesday to ask Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a question he did not like during a public appearance in West Palm Beach .
" That 's a nasty , impolite question , " said Scalia , himself an expert on tough questioning , and he at first refused to answer it .
Sun-Sentinel , Jeck asked whether the rationale for Scalia 's well - known opposition to cameras in the Supreme Court was " vitiated " by the facts that the Court allows public visitors to view arguments and releases full argument transcripts to the public , and that justices go out on book tours .
So what did Sarah Jeck ask that caused the volatile justice to erupt ?
According to her own notes and this account in today 'sJeck asked whether the rationale for Scalia 's well - known opposition to cameras in the Supreme Court was " vitiated " by the facts that the Court allows public visitors to view arguments and releases full argument transcripts to the public , and that justices go out on book tours .
It 's that last part that probably grated , because Scalia could , at that precise moment , have been said to be on a book tour .
He was speaking before the Palm Beach County Forum Club and Bar Association , while his book -- Making Your Case : The Art of Persuading Judges , co-authored by Bryan Garner -- was for sale at a table outside the hall .
Jeck , a political science major , is taking a judicial process class and is looking at the issue of cameras in the courts as her thesis topic .
So when she learned Scalia was coming to town , it seemed like a reasonable question to her and her prof Martin Sweet .
By tradition , the club invites local university students to forum events and lets them ask questions .
" We knew it was a little jab , but his response was unanticipated , " she says .
Palm Beach Post .
Scalia said he originally supported the idea of camera access in the courts , but came to oppose it because the inevitable " 30 - second takeouts " would not give a true picture of what is going on .
" Why should I be a party to the miseducation of the American people ? "
According to Jeck , Scalia made no reference to his book tour as a possible contradiction to his views on public access to the Court .
After Scalia made his comment to Jeck , he took several written questions and then circled back to Jeck 's query , according to this story in the .
Scalia said he originally supported the idea of camera access in the courts , but came to oppose it because the inevitable " 30 - second takeouts " would not give a true picture of what is going on .
" Why should I be a party to the miseducation of the American people ? "
According to Jeck , Scalia made no reference to his book tour as a possible contradiction to his views on public access to the Court .
We asked Jeck two more questions in our brief phone interview this morning .
First , is she planning to go to law school ?
" Yes , " she said without hesitation .
And second , did she buy Scalia 's book ?
Just as definitively , she said , " I 'm a college student .
I do n't have $ 30 . "
Footnote : Sweet , Jeck 's professor and pre-law advisor , told us today he is " incredibly proud " of her questioning and demeanor .
" It was certainly a pointed question , but not designed to be impolite or nasty , " said Sweet , a Supreme Court scholar in his own right .
" The point of learning is not to stroke somebody 's ego . "
This morning we tracked down student Sarah Jeck , the Florida Atlantic University honors college junior who incurred Scalia 's wrath , and she seemed a little stunned , but not cowed , by his reaction .
" He can dish it out , but he can't take it , I guess , " she says .
" I 'm generally a very polite person .
I 'm really surprised the way it turned out .
It was not a preposterous question . "
Once again , the ecological doomsday bell has been set to tolling , this time by folks fearful of the imminent demise of our favorite fruit , the banana :
Local radio station reported that bananas as we know them will not be in existence in 5 to 15 years .
The bananas has been genetically altered so much that new plants can not be grown as there are no seeds and the existing plants are slowly being destroyed by a parasite .
In January 2003 , a report in New Scientist suggested bananas could well disappear within ten years thanks to two blights : black Sigatoka , a leaf fungus , and Panama disease , a soil fungus which attacks the roots of the plant .
Bananas are n’t about to be swept from the face of the earth by a deadly pestilence poised to wipe them out ( and more than ten years has elapsed since that original report , yet bananas are still with us ) .
There are several hundred different varieties of the fruit , and the reported fear applies to only one of them , the Cavendish .
Granted , the Cavendish is our banana of choice and accounts for the overwhelming pronderance of banana exports and purchases , but it is n’t the only banana out there .
Even if the Cavendish were lost to us , we would still not be singing “ Yes , We Have No Bananas . ”
The Cavendish , the banana American consumers are most familiar with , has been threatened in some Asian countries by a strain of fusarium wilt known as Panama Disease or Tropical Race 4 ( TR4 ) .
This soil - borne fungus attacks roots and cannot be controlled by fungicides ; and if Race 4 were to reach Cavendish plants in large - scale commercial plantations , it could have a devastating impact on the species .
Bananas stand in greater peril from disease and insect damage than the majority of other fruits because they are sterile , seedless mutants .
New plants are created from cuttings of existing ones , making them little more than clones of one another .
Without the natural diversity resulting from sexual reproduction , bananas continue on generation after generation with the same genetic makeup .
Their inability to mutate and adapt leaves them vulnerable to species - wide disaster , because what fells one of them will prove the undoing of every plant within that particular variety .
In the 1960s the Gros Michel , then a hugely popular variety of banana , was wiped out by another strain of Panama Disease .
The loss of the Gros Michel promoted the Cavendish into the # 1 spot .
Lack of genetic diversity does place the banana in a precarious position , and the danger posed by Race 4 to the Cavendish is real .
( Sigatoka , while serious , provides less of a threat in that it can be successfully combated . )
According to scientists and banana experts who attended the three - day seminar on conventional and alternative handling of common banana diseases held 7 - 10 August 2003 in Guayaquil , Ecuador , bananas were still far from global extinction .
Disease control alternatives such as the development of “ plants resistant to the main diseases , ” the employment of “ friendly - bacteria , fungi and other micro-organisms , ” and the increasing use of organic practices have contributed greatly to the successful control of feared banana plagues , they said .
This echoes what was reported in February 2003 by a plant pathologist with the American Phytopathological Society ( APS ) in response to the controversial New Scientist article that brought the plight of the Cavendish to the public ’s attention :
“ Diseases are , and will remain , major constraints to both export and subsistence production of banana , and there is no doubt that Black Sigatoka and Panama Disease constitute the most important threats , ” said Randy C. Ploetz , Professor at the University of Florida ’s Tropical Research and Education Center .
“ However , it is unlikely that these problems will cause production to decrease greatly in the next decade , let alone that the crop will become extinct . ”
For Race 4 to spread into the large plantations , either infected banana suckers or infested soil would have to be introduced into the growing fields .
There was hope that forbidding practices that allowed this type of spread in banana export - producing countries , along with the starting of new plantations from pathogen - free , tissue cultured plants , would stop TR4 from reaching those plantations .
However , news from mid-2015 indicated that TR4 was still spreading , and that some of those perilous growing practices were still in place among banana farmers :
“ [ TR4 ’s ] recent discovery in the Middle East and in Nampula , Mozambique , indicates that the disease is spreading and threatening bananas worldwide , ” George Mahuku , Senior plant pathologist for the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture ( IITA ) , said .
Even though the disease appears to have spread to just two plantations in Mozambique , the impact on the local economy is already severe :
“ The disease has already cost Matanuska , the company that owns the plantations , about $ 7.5 million .
A total of 230,000 plants have been affected and destroyed .
At the current rate of infection , the farm is losing 15,000 plants per week , translating to $ 236,000 per week , ” said Mahuku .
The disease is not more virulent than the one that killed the Gros Michel , but it ’s spreading because the bad practices from 50 years ago are still in place :
“ The banana industry is in denial about this , and standard agricultural quarantines like fencing the crops and cleaning the equipment are not enough , ” added [ author Dan ] Koeppel .
The only solution would be to burn the plantation down and start over , but with a different crop .
Restarting with bananas does n’t work because the fungus stays in the soil .
Still , argiculturalists hope that even if TR4 ca n’t be eradicated , it can at least be contained :
In Africa , a 12 - month emergency project funded by FAO is underway to tackle TR4 , and Mahuku is optimistic that the disease can be contained to the areas where it has been observed : “ To achieve this , financial resources are needed , otherwise inaction due to lack of resources will be catastrophic , especially for small farmers who depend on bananas for their livelihoods , ” he said .
According to Joao Augusto , a plant pathologist working with IITA in Mozambique , there are n’t many options to effectively control the disease : “ It can not be eradicated , but it can be limited if a wide range of strong preventive and mitigation initiatives are put in place and rigorously implemented .
In countries where the disease is endemic , the banana growers have learned to live with it . ”
Ultimately , history could well repeat itself and prompt banana growers to look for a new alternative .
There is no good candidate at the moment , but hybrids and GMOs are being considered .
Bananas are a nutritional gold mine .
At only 110 calories per 4 - ounce offering , they contain a mere trace of fat .
They are high in vitamin B6 , which helps fight infection and is essential for the synthesis of heme , the iron - containing part of hemoglobin .
They are also rich in potassium ( more than 400 mg per banana ) and are a great source of fiber .
In recent years , a number of claims about their healthful benefits have surfaced , including that they combat warts , depression , and morning sickness .
Although the jury is still out on those benefits , this humble yellow - skinned fruit could lower the risk of heart attack and stroke as part of a heart - healthy diet and could potentially even lower the risk of cancer .
Or at least so says the FDA .
Bananas , by the way , grow on plants , not trees .
One last bit of banana trivia : a bunch of bananas is properly styled a hand , and a single fruit a finger .
So I ’ve been playing around with Erlang for a little while now and decided to create a small client for one of my favourite mini blogging services ( Twitter ) , which I ’ve decided to share with all , both to help other noobs and for myself a personal reference .
So we want to be able to retrieve a REST like response from twitter , where do we start ?
First thing was to start up erl from the command line erl - pa ~/erlware / packages / 5.6.3/lib/*/ebin " $ @ "
I had installed erlware to my local directory & linked it into erl by running the above command .
Now that we are in erl , I started inets inets : start ( ) .
Now we are ready to start playing with http : response , I want to be able to retrieve the HTTP body response and do some XML parsing with it http:request ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss " )
which returned me something simular to
{ok , {{ " HTTP /1.1 " ,200 , " OK " } ,
[ {" cache- control " , " max- age=1800 " } ,
{ " connection " , " close "} ,
{ " date " , " Mon , 01 Dec 2008 10:46:06 GMT " } ,
{ " server " , " hi"} ,
{ " content - encoding " , " UTF - 8 " } ,
{ " content - length " , " 9251 " } ,
{ " content - type " , " application / xml " } ,
{ " expires " , " Mon , 01 Dec 2008 11:16:07 GMT " } ,
{ " set - cookie " ,
" JSESSIONID=2C9CFD77A4EF365B46884168D089FD4A ; Path= / " } ] ,
[ 60,63,120,109,108,32,118,101,114,115,105,111,110,61,34,49 ,
46,48,34,32,101,110,99,111 | ...
]}}
With a little digging , we come to find out that the following pattern matches pretty nicely {ok , {_Status , _Head , Body}} = http:request ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss " )
Typing Body .
in the erlang shell returns a list simular to the following : [ 60,63,120,109,108,32,118,101,114,115,105,111,110,61,34,49 ,
46,48,34,32,101,110,99,111,100,105,110,103,61 | ... ]
Now this is our HTTP body response , now we can fire up emacs or your favourite text editor and create our first method .
- modules ( twitterl ) .
- compile ( export_all ) .
retrieve_response( Url ) ->
{ok , {_Status , _Head , Body}} = http:request( Url ) ,
Body .
Make sure you save this file with the same name as the module ( or Erlang will complain ) & make sure the file is in the same directory that erl is running in .
c( twitterl ) .
Will compile our piece of code .
Now we should have the following command available twitterl:retrieve_response ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss " ) .
Which will give u the same result as the previous commands passed to erl .
Now the Body term still has our HTTP body so well play with this for the time being , if not then just do the following : Body = twitterl:retrieve_response( " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss " ) .
Now for the next piece , we actualy want to parse this body and retrieve all its descriptions ( which stores our actual twitters ) .
xmerl_scan:string ( Body )
Give us a result simular to the following : xmerl_scan: string ( Body ) .
{ {xmlElement , rss,rss , [ ] ,
{xmlNamespace , [ ] , [ ]} ,
[ ] ,1 ,
[ {xmlAttribute , version , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , 1 , [ ] , " 2.0 " , false} ] ,
[ {xmlText , [ {rss, 1} ] , 1 , [ ] , "

" , text} ] ,
[ ] , " /home/baphled/projects/erlang/status_managerl " ,
undeclared} ,
[ ]} This returns our XML and the rest of the HTTP body , we only want the XML so { Xml , _ Rest} = xmerl_scan : string ( Body )
Will store our XML within the Xml term .
Now we have the data we want to parse , we can use the following command to retrieve a list of tuples , containing our descriptions in XML format simular to the following .
[ {xmlText , [{description,4} , {item,12} , {channel,2},{rss,1} ] ,
1 , [ ] ,

Now we go back to our source file and create a method for our discovery : latest_twitters ( ) ->
Body = retrieve_response(? PubTimeUrl ) ,
{ Xml , _ Rest} = xmerl_scan: string ( Body ) ,
Twitters = xmerl_xpath : string ("//item/description/text ( ) " , Xml ) ,
Twitters .
This method will use our previously created method to retrieve our response and then we parse XML searching for the description element within the item element , this then stores each of the enteries in Twitters , which is then returned .
Save and recompile the file .
We can now use our latest_twitters method to returl a list of our results .
Twitters = twitterl:latest_twitters ( ) will store our list to our Twitters term .
Now we now we have a list so we will manipulate it as follows to see how we can deal with our results .
[ H|T ] = Twitters .
gives us the first term in the list , something simular to the following : {xmlText , [ {description,4} , {item,12} , {channel,2},{rss,1} ] ,
1 , [ ] ,
[ 107,105,114,105,108,108,95,121,117,114,105,58,32,228,187 ,
138,229,185,180,227,129,174,231,180 | ... ] ,
text}
Lets break this down a little so we can deal with the specific data we are interested in , now our term is a tuple containing an atom , a tuple , another atom , an empty list , followed by our text , proceeded by an atom .
We only need the text string so the following pattern will do us .
{_ , _ , _, _ , Title , _} Lets give it a try .
{_ , _ , _ , _ , Title , _} = H .
io:format( Title ) .
We get a result simular to : kirill_yuri : \344\273\212\345\271\264\343\201\256\347\264\205\347\231\275\343\201\257\347\264\205\343\202\222\345\213\235\343\201\237\343\201\233\343\201\237\343\201\204\351\233\260\345\233\262\346\260\227\343\201\214\345\205\205\346\272\200\343\201\227\343\201\246\343\202\213\346\260\227\343\201\214\343\201\231\343\202\213\343\202\223\343\201\240\343\201\214\343\201\251\343\201\206\343\201\213\343\201\255\343\200\202
The above is our actual twitter , now armed with this piece of information & a little tinkering we can add another method to our source file .
loop_twitters ( [ Twit|Twitters ] ) ->
case is_tuple ( Twit ) of
true ->
{_ , _ , _ , _ , Title , _} = Twit ,
io :format ( " ~s~n " , [[ Title ] ] ) ,
loop_twitters ( lists:reverse( Twitters ) ) ;
false ->
{error , " Unable to read twitter " }
end ;
loop_twitters ( [ ] ) ->
ok We ’ll need to do a little refactoring to make everything play nice .
Namely refactor our latest_twitters method to pass our twitters on to loop twitters .
I guess we ’ll want to only export one method now also , which in this case will only be the latest_twitters method .
This is done by removing the line - compile ( export_all ) .
and replacing it with - export ( [ latest_twitters / 0 ] ) .
Our source file should look like this :
- module ( status_managerl ) .
- compile ( export_all ) .
- export ( [ init/0,stop/0,latest_twitters /0 ] ) .
- include_lib ( " xmerl/include/xmerl.hrl " ) .
- define ( PubTimeUrl , " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss " ) .
init ( ) ->
inets : start ( ) .
stop ( ) ->
inets : stop ( ) .
retrieve_response( Url ) ->
{ok , {_Status , _Head , Body}} = http:request( Url ) ,
Body .
latest_twitters ( ) ->
Body = retrieve_response(? PubTimeUrl ) ,
{ Xml , _ Rest} = xmerl_scan: string ( Body ) ,
Twitters = xmerl_xpath : string ("//item/description/text ( ) " , Xml ) ,
loop_twitters ( Twitters ) .
loop_twitters ( [ Twit|Twitters ] ) ->
case is_tuple ( Twit ) of
true ->
{_ , _ , _ , _ , Title , _} = Twit ,
io :format ( " ~s~n " , [[ Title ] ] ) ,
loop_twitters ( lists:reverse( Twitters ) ) ;
false ->
{error , " Unable to read twitter " }
end ;
loop_twitters ( [ ] ) ->
ok .
Now finally we 'll compile our source file and run using the following commands c( twitterl ) .
twitterl:latest_twitters ( )
Will produce our list of latest twitters simular to the following : timetoleadfr : @otromundo merci d'avoir relay \303\251 le message :)

WASHINGTON ( JTA ) — Hillary Clinton said the Obama administration would not negotiate with Hamas unless it meets certain conditions .
" I think on Israel , you cannot negotiate with Hamas until it renounces violence , recognizes Israel and agrees to abide by past agreements , " said the nominee for secretary of state on Tuesday at her confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
" That is just for me , you know , an absolute .
That is the United States government ’s position ; that is the president - elect ’s position . "
In her opening statement , Clinton said that " as intractable as the Middle East problems may seem , " the United States " cannot give up on peace . "
" The president - elect and I understand and are deeply sympathetic to Israel ’s desire to defend itself under the current conditions and to be free of shelling by Hamas rockets , " she said .
" However , we have also been reminded of the tragic humanitarian costs of conflict in the Middle East and paid by the suffering of Palestinian and Israeli civilians .
This must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement . "
Clinton also deflected a question from committee chairman Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) on whether the United States would send an ambassador back to Syria and set up an interest section in Tehran .
" These are matters that are part of our policy review , and we will turn to them with great diligence and attention as soon as we are able to , " Clinton said .
Reuters reported that about a half - dozen pro-Palestinian protesters sat quietly through the hearing , holding signs urging a Gaza cease - fire and shouting " What about the people of Gaza ? " and " Stand up , Hillary , we need your voice for the people of Gaza " when the session adjourned for lunch .
Clinton did not acknowledge the protesters .

Vitamin D- Rich Mushrooms : A Research Success !
By Marcia Wood
November 12 , 2008
Now there 's an even better reason to add fresh mushrooms to your breakfast omelet , noontime burger , or dinner salad .
Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) scientists in Albany , Calif. , have teamed with Monterey Mushrooms , Inc. , of Watsonville , Calif. , to boost the vitamin D content of white , brown and portabella mushrooms .
Thanks to UV - B light like that in sunshine the company 's new Sun Bella line of fresh mushrooms offers at least 100 percent of the recommended intake of vitamin D in each 3 - ounce serving .
An estimated 40 percent of Americans do n't get enough vitamin D .
The nutrient is essential for strong bones , properly functioning liver and kidneys , and a robust immune system .
Some research suggests that vitamin D may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease , certain cancers , and Alzheimer 's disease .
The idea of using UV - B light to enhance mushrooms ' vitamin D levels is n't new .
But Tara H. McHugh , a research leader and food technologist at the ARS Western Regional Research Center in Albany , and colleagues at Monterey Mushrooms are likely the first to determine exactly how to best use UV - B rays for commercial - scale production of vitamin D- rich mushrooms .
McHugh did much of the work under terms of a research and development agreement with the company .
Monterey Mushrooms recently introduced Sun Bella mushrooms in supermarkets nationwide .
An article in the June 2008 issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistrydocuments some of the ARS mushroom studies .
ARS is a scientific research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Re : What were arcades like ?
Oh , holy shit , I 'm old .
I 'm not old enough to be old yet , but I 'm old if you 're too young to remember arcades .
Okay , let me see if I can brush the Alzheimers cobwebs off of my steam - powered brain and remember what Arcades were like .
In arcades , you queued up for popular or new games , usually .
You set down a quarter or a button or something on the machine ( quarters were the popular choice ) , and you watched , and when the next round came up ( in fighting games , this was when someone lost , but in other games , it was when they ran out of quarters ) , you jumped in .
This usually meant you were playing against someone else , so you got to know everyone who was a regular quick .
The ' no throwing ' rule was kind of a house - rule for a lot of places .
See , the older fighting games had really wonky response and collision detection , and in some of 'em ( Mortal Kombat , for one ) , a throw did pretty decent damage and could n't be interrupted in a lot of cases .
If you wanted to , you could just drain down the other guy 's health like that , and since everyone was paying to play , it was a dick move to do so .
I know in our arcade , there was a little sticky on the Street Fighter machine , reading , " M.Bison is an automatic forfeit of next turn " , which meant that , if someone chose Bison ( who , in the older Street Fighters , was dangerous as hell in an experienced player 's hands ) , they got to play one round with him , and , win or lose , they had to hand the controls over to the next player in line .
As for the cost ?
I once dumped twenty - five bucks worth of quarters into Golden Axe : Revenge of Death Adder so that my buddy and I could beat it .
If you were going for a High Score , you better bring a roll along , or know exactly what you were doing .
On the plus side , if it got around that you were going for a high score , people would usually stop putting markers down for next play and stand by and watch ( and cheer you on , if you got a good crowd ) until you got the score you were shooting for or ran out of money .
Hell , I once had people paying for me because I was going for High Score on a game and wound up running out of coins just a few thousand points short .
Look over the quarterly server reports from IDC and Gartner , and you almost never see an mention of NEC .
That company is part of the " other " category  all those vendors outside of IBM , HP , Dell , Sun and Fujitsu  that comprises around 10 percent of the market .
To make matters worse , NEC is far better known on the other side of the Atlantic .
So what is it doing to gain greater penetration in the United States ?
Server Snapshot : NEC may not have a big market presence in the United States , but for enterprises seeking high fault tolerance at a relatively low price , it 's worthy of being a serious candidate .
" Our U.S. growth strategy is centered around strengthening channel relationships and expanding our reseller partner base by targeting our competitively priced product line and incentive programs at select enterprise - class channel partners , " said Michael Nixon , director of midrange and high - end enterprise server platform product groups at NEC Corporation of America , based in Irving , Texas .
" NEC is also focusing efforts on market verticals with unique integrated solutions that leverage other NEC products and strengths . "
1000 Series Enterprise Servers
Recent Server Snapshots
Dell
HP
Lenovo
IBM
Sun
Unisys
In September 2008 , NEC introduced what it calls its Monster Xeon server as part of its new enterprise server line , the NEC Express5800 / A1160 .
It is tuned specifically to take advantage of the performance and functionality of new expandable 4 - and 6 - core 7400 Series Xeon CPUs from Intel .
" As recorded by the TPC standards body , the Monster Xeon server , which scales from 24 to 96 processing cores , was the first to achieve 1,400 tpsE performance result running a SQL database and executing the TPC- E benchmark , a record for SQL databases , " said Nixon .
" The A1160 is designed for the most demanding enterprise database environments and line - of - business processing requirements . "
Typically , the Monster Xeon competes against competitive offerings from HP and IBM .
Nixon stressed , in particular , the A1160's higher level of scalability , with support from 4 up to 16 sockets , or from 16 to 96 - core scalability compared to HP .
Compared to IBM , on the other hand , he emphasizes serviceability .
Pricing for the NEC's Express5800 / A1160 enterprise server begins at $ 29,849 for a 4 - socket , quad - core Intel E7440 CPUs ( 2.4 GHz ) with 16 MB cache , 8 GB memory , and a 3 - year limited warranty .
The other major development in this line is some recently earned Microsoft certifications .
The Express5800 1320 Xf server became the first enterprise server solution in the industry that certified dynamic partitioning capabilities for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 .
" This enables a single - system , always - on , 24x7 , platform for mission - critical windows environments , " said Nixon .
100 Series Blades
Over the past year , NEC has brought a range of blade servers onto the market .
It assimilates the latest high - density mounting technology in tandem with reliability and availability .
" NEC blades have more DIMM memory sockets and I / O ports than any other blade server , thereby making them ideally suited for virtualization applications , " said Ken Hertzler , director of marketing for volume servers and system software for NEC America 's IT platform and solutions group .
The NEC Express5800 / 120 Bb - d6 is a diskless blade designed for virtualization solutions .
It has a memory capacity of 48 GB , up to six I/O GbitE ports , and two Fibre Channel ports .
" The introduction of this 4 - socket blade positions NEC 's blade server family as one of the most comprehensive available , " said Hertzler .
300 Series Fault Tolerant Servers
Fault tolerant models are probably what NEC is most known for in the United States .
It is a system that continues to run applications even though a hardware fault occurs that would normally interrupt application processing .
Based on Xeon processors , NEC 's 300 series servers have two completely identical server modules running in parallel that operate as one server .
The two modules run in what is called ' lockstep , ' which continuously checks processing results to ensure the application is running identically on both servers .
If a hardware fault occurs in one of the servers , the non-failing server will continue to run the application while the failed server will 'red light ' and notify IT that a failure has occurred so it can be fixed .
In this way , there is no interruption of the application availability .
NEC Express5800 300 series fault tolerant servers start at $ 17,000 .
The most recent addition to this product line , beyond incremental component upgrades , is that the company now offers its fault - tolerant server with VMware ESX as a platform for application consolidation , particularly where continuous operation is paramount .
" NEC 's Fault Tolerant server is a highly proven , cost - effective technology deployed in over 10,000 installations worldwide , " said Hertzler .
" When protection against server hardware failures is required , NEC 's fault - tolerant servers deliver a substantial reduction in the overall total cost of ownership by avoiding costly downtime , reducing the time and cost required for IT staff to achieve high availability . "
He feels this approach is sounder than the adoption of sophisticated software clustering techniques , as it provides substantial operational savings and simplicity .
As the faulty components are isolated at the module level , this simplifies the troubleshooting process .
" Unlike software cluster solutions , only a single logical copy of the operating system and application software is required on the NEC Express5800 , since redundancy is achieved at the hardware level , " said Hertzler .
" As a result , savings are achieved on software licensing fees for operating systems and other popular applications . "
The search is on for Britain 's oldest working lightbulb , still glowing after many decades - and possibly beating what are claimed to be the world 's oldest working bulbs in the US , both allegedly still burning after a century .
It will pain the Royal Society of Chemistry if there is n't an older bulb somewhere among Britain 's estimated 903.6 m domestic bulbs , given that it was a British scientist and inventor who first demonstrated a working lightbulb , at a Literary and Philosophical Society lecture in Newcastle upon Tyne , on 3 February 1879 .
On Monday , the 130th anniversary , the chemists will present a Chemical Landmark plaque to the Newcastle society , where a replica of Joseph Swan 's pioneering design will be lit .
Although the American Thomas Edison is generally credited with inventing the incandescent light bulb , in fact Swan and Edison were working neck and neck on opposite sides of the Atlantic , and after bitter patent battles , eventually joined forces to form what became the Swan and Edison corporation .
By late 1879 Swan was installing light bulbs in homes and institutions across England , and at the time of his death in 1914 millions of buildings were lit by electricity .
The Society of Chemistry has heard anecdotes of ancient working bulbs , but is now offering a £ 500 reward for the oldest authenticated one in Britain .
In the US a lightbulb at Livermore fire station in California is said to have been donated and installed in 1901 , and is still burning .
Another bulb , installed at the Fort Worth Palace theatre on 21 September 1908 , is now in a museum , but still working .
I love Christmas time !
Not for any religious reasons , but the fact that it ’s so wonderfully festive and colourful and people come together and all the nifty cute projects people get up to are so wonderful .
I went to an early Christmas dinner and I decided to bring a fancy dessert .
I wanted to do something spectacular and not just a cheesecake or a pavlova .
So looking through the interwebs the truffle - tree sounded like a great idea !
And so I decided to make truffles with fruit cake ( inspired by the cake bites / pop craze ) but I did n’t add frosting – just brandy and it made the mixture pliable enough to roll into balls .
Anyway this project is super easy , just a bit time consuming .
Very fun though !
I had a ball … hah
I did n’t make my own cake , I bought a dark fruit cake to save time and normally I do n’t do that , but the cakes around this time are actually quite delicious .
Feel free to make your own cake though !
Christmas Truffle Tree
Makes a 25 cm ( 9 ″ ) high tree
800g dark fruit cake ( or make your own 8 ″ cake )
1/2 cup brandy
500g good quality white chocolate
Chocolate sprinkles , blue sugar , coconut etc
Ferrero Rochers , Lindt balls etc
25 cm polystyrene cone ( 9 ″ )
Toothpicks
Decorative ribbon
Fondant ( to make a star for the top , or you can use chocolate etc )
To make the christmas cake truffles – process the fruit cake into crumbs and slowly add 1 /2 cup of brandy and mix well .
The mixture should be nice and sticky .
Put into the fridge to firm up for about 1/2 hour .
Line a tray with baking paper and roll 1 tsp of mixture into a ball .
This stage can get quite messy and you will need to wash your hands and start again at various points .
It ’s fun though !
When you have finished rolling into balls , place in the fridge for about an hour so the balls firm up .
Melt the white chocolate and fill some small bowls with sprinkles of your chosen colour , coconut that has been left white or tinted and any other decoration to coat your truffles with .
I wanted to use white chocolate for mine but I ran out and did n’t realise so I stuck with chocolate sprinkles and blue sugar .
Carefully coat the balls in the white chocolate then quickly roll them in your chosen coating or leave them plain .
Take your cone and starting from the bottom , insert a toothpick on a 45 degree angle and attach your truffle to it .
Working your way around the cone , keep adding in rows until the cone is covered .
It is a good idea to have your cone resting on something , I used a 10 ″ silver cake board ( just a thin one ) that I spread with a bit of melted chocolate first then stuck the cone on that .
I also used some Ferrero Rochers and left some truffles uncoated with chocolate for texture and colour ; I love the look of all the different varieties .
You could use all sorts of pre-bought chocolates for this project like Lindt balls , and it gives guests a non-alcoholic option too .
When you have finished building your tree , decorate it with ribbon and I made a star from fondant that I inserted into the top with a toothpick .
Enjoy !

WHAT was your mother up to before you were even a twinkle in her eye ?
You might not think it matters , but it seems that in mice at least , mothers that receive mental training before they become pregnant can pass on its cognitive benefits to their young .
Previous studies in both people and animals have shown that a mother ’s experiences while pregnant can affect her offspring ’s gene expression and health , even years later .
However , it was not known if experiences prior to pregnancy had an effect .

A major Indian - German geoengineering expedition set sail this week for the Scotia Sea , flouting a U.N. ban on ocean iron fertilization experiments in hopes of garnering data about whether the process actually does take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and sequester it in the deep ocean , a technique that may help reverse global warming .
The LOHAFEX experiment will spread 20 - tons of iron sulphate particles over a 115 - square - mile section of open ocean north of Antarctica — that 's about 1.7 times the size of Washington , D.C.
The initiative has drawn fire from environmental groups who point out that 200 countries agreed to the moratorium until more evidence was available about its efficacy .
But that has n't stopped the LOHAFEX team , composed of Alfred Wegener Institute and Indian National Institute of Oceanography scientists , who say they need to conduct experiments to get such data .
“ If the LOHAFEX iron dump goes ahead , it will be a clear defiance of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity , ” Jim Thomas of ETC Group , said in a press release .
It 's becoming clear that when it comes to global warming reversal schemes , deciding who will control the global thermostat is as complex an issue as how such schemes could actually be accomplished .
Ocean iron fertilization is considered one of the more promising options for global - scale geoengineering , which aims to slow or reverse the effects of climate change caused by man 's burning of fossil fuels .
While Thomas expressed outrage , Jamais Cascio , a futurist who has written about the geopolitical repercussions of geoengineering for the journal Foreign Policy , took a more measured tone .
" ETC is right that we need international standards and safeguards for these experiments , and hopefully this attempt will spur action in that regard , " Cascio said .
" I think they 're wrong , however , to suggest that any look at geoengineering is inherently problematic . "
Importantly , iron fertilization would deal directly with the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere , as opposed to , say , blocking out some of the sun 's rays with a global molecular parasol .
By providing plankton with iron in water where iron is lacking , the marine creatures grow in tremendous numbers , incorporating carbon into their bodies .
When the plankton die and sink , the carbon goes with down with their skeletons .
It is unknown , however , how much of that carbon actually makes it deep into the ocean , where it would be sequestered for decades , not days .
At a panel at meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science last year , marine geochemist Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute said that somewhere between 2 and 50 percent of the carbon the plankton eat could actually make it to the depths of the ocean , which is basically like saying that we do n't know if the process works .
" The efficacy of iron - induced sequestration of atmospheric CO2 to the deep sea , however , remains poorly constrained , " he summarized .
" We do not yet understand the full range of intended and potential unintended biogeochemical and ecological impacts . "
The voluntary U.N. ban included language to allow countries to do tests near their shores .
But it 's the open seas , particularly in the southern hemisphere , that would allow in - situ testing of the LOHAFEX scientists ' hypotheses .
" The fate of carbon from the bloom could not be adequately determined in earlier experiments , " the LOHAFEX website reads .
" LOHAFEX will now study the entire range of processes determining the partitioning of carbon between atmosphere and deep ocean in the experimental bloom . "
Cascio said that it 's likely that further geoengineering experiments or actual efforts will be made .
" This comes as absolutely no surprise to me , " he said .
" The confluence of desperation as we see climate disruption hit faster than anticipated , inaction on the carbon emission front , and the ease with which geoengineering can be undertaken means that this wo n't be the last time that a sub-national group tries something like this . "
Already , two ocean - iron - fertilization companies , Climos and Planktos , have been founded .
They 've met different fates , though .
Last year , Planktos went belly up , while Climos pulled in $ 4 million in venture capital .
* UPDATE 11:10 am PST : Climos CEO , Dan Whaley , notes in our comments section that there was a clause included in an October resolution of a separate U.N. organization , parties to the London Convention , in which 88 countries voted to allow " legitimate scientific research " on ocean iron fertilization , without restrictions to coastal waters .
It was under this ruling that the researchers proceeded .
The full text of that resolution is available at Climos ' website .

The next edition of the atlas could feature revitalised languages
The Cornish language has been branded " extinct " by linguistic experts , sparking protests from speakers .
Thirty linguists worked on Atlas of the World 's Languages in Danger , compiled by United Nations group Unesco .
They also said Manx Gaelic was extinct .
Cornish is believed to have died out as a first language in 1777 .
But the Cornish Language Partnership says the number of speakers has risen in the past 20 years and there should be a section for revitalised languages .
The Atlas of the World 's Languages in Danger , published by Unesco , the cultural section of the United Nations , features about 2,500 dialects .
There are thought to be about 300 fluent speakers of Cornish .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But Jenefer Lowe , development manager of the Cornish Language Partnership , said there were thousands who had a " smattering " of the language .
" Saying Cornish is extinct implies there are no speakers and the language is dead , which it is n't , " she said .
" Unesco 's study does n't take into account languages which have growing numbers of speakers and in the past 20 years the revival of Cornish has really gathered momentum . "
Last year the partnership agreed a single written form of Cornish which brought together several different forms of the language .
It is among a group of languages that turned out not to be extinct but merely sleeping
Christopher Moseley
Editor - in - chief of the atlas
UN declares Manx Gaelic ' extinct '
Mrs Lowe said : " There 's no category for a language that is revitalised and revived .
" What they need to do is add a category .
" It should be recognised that languages do revive and it's a fluid state . "
Christopher Moseley , an Australian linguist and editor - in - chief of the atlas , told BBC News he would consider a new classification .
He said : " I have always been optimistic about Cornish and Manx .
" There is a groundswell of interest in them , although the number of speakers is small .
" Perhaps in the next edition we shall have a ' being revived ' category .
" [ Cornish ] is among a group of languages that turned out not to be extinct but merely sleeping . "

BRITISH atheists have been celebrating the appearance of flippant slogans on London buses this week but atheists in Australia have been barred from launching a similar advertising campaign on the nation 's public transport systems .
The Atheist Foundation of Australia was knocked back by Australia 's biggest outdoor advertising company , APN Outdoor , on its proposal for a nationwide campaign featuring atheist slogans .
The campaign - with slogans such as " Sleep in on Sunday mornings " and " Celebrate reason " - follows successful attempts by the British and American Humanist Associations to raise awareness for atheism in London and Washington .
APN Outdoor cited no reason for rejecting the $ 16,000 public transport campaign , and declined to comment .
Expectancy of riots leads authorities to prepare for mass civil unrest
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , February 23 , 2009
Urban warfare training drills are taking place across the country as top analysts as well as officials predict a potential “ summer of rage ” across Europe and America as civil unrest from the economic fallout builds .
Earlier this month , 150 U.S. troops from the U.S. Special Operations Command whizzed around the streets of New Orleans in military helicopters and even dropped bombs in what officials described as a “ training event ” .
An Iowa National Guard training exercise in Arcadia , Iowa , scheduled for April was originally billed as an “ invasion ” before public opposition caused the drill to be scaled back .
The exercise included Guard troops patrolling streets , searching houses and confiscating firearms .
No less than 2,200 U.S. Marines were also involved in urban operations training in Richmond , VIrginia , throughout January , drills that involved landing troops in populated areas , allowing military pilots to “ familiarize themselves with the area . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Military choppers hovered precariously low over parking lots as citizens were acclimated to seeing active duty military assets engaged in law enforcement style activities .
Watch a clip filmed by a startled Richmond resident who was n’t even aware that Marines were conducting drills due to scant forewarning on behalf of authorities and the media .
Are such drills really for the purpose of preparing troops for foreign combat zones ?
Undoubtedly – but other factors indicate that the drills may very well also be aimed at preparing troops for dealing with mass civil unrest as the economic crisis worsens .
There ’s no question that U.S. authorities have been closely observing riots that have toppled governments in Iceland and Latvia and also threatened to do so in several other European countries .
The fact that they have contingency plans in place to deal with such scenarios should they unfold in America can not be disputed .
Indeed , before a media exposé forced them into a denial , Northcom revealed that one of the duties of at least 20,000 active duty troops that are being placed inside the United States would be dealing with “ civil unrest and crowd control ” .
Meanwhile , millions of dollars that were set aside as part of the so - called bailout have in fact been handed over to local police departments and spent on military tools like armored vehicles , unmanned aerial surveillance drones and high - powered firearms for SWAT teams .
In addition , with many predicting that Mexico is on the verge of collapse as a result of the economic crisis and the out of control drug war , Texas officials have already established contingency plans to deal with an influx of immigrants , a program that would only address “ law enforcement concerns ” and not humanitarian needs .
HR 645 , otherwise known as the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act , would mandate the expansion of FEMA detention camps which would likely to be used to detain illegal immigrants as well as rioting American citizens .
The prospect of widespread rioting at some stage this year is a scenario feared by many .
Police in the UK are preparing for a “ summer of rage ” and mass protests against the mishandling of the economic crisis by the government .
The U.S. Army War College in November released a white paper called Known Unknowns : Unconventional ‘ Strategic Shocks ’ in Defense Strategy Development .
The report warned that the military must be prepared for a “ violent , strategic dislocation inside the United States , ” which could be provoked by “ unforeseen economic collapse , ” “ purposeful domestic resistance , ” “ pervasive public health emergencies ” or “ loss of functioning political and legal order . ”
The “ widespread civil violence , ” the document said , “ would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security . ”
Numerous other public figures , including Senator Christopher Dodd , leading economist Nouriel Roubini , top trend researcher Gerald Celente , the head of the International Monetary Fund , the head of the World Trade Organization , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , former national security director Zbigniew Brzezinski , and Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair have all warned of coming civil unrest and global instability .
Considering the expectancy for riots , it would be naive to dismiss the notion that the increasing amount of urban warfare drills taking place across the U.S. are not at least partially to prepare troops to undertake law enforcement duties should civil unrest as a consequence of the economic fallout threaten a collapse in social order .

By the end of WWII , 11 Colossus machines were in use
Bletchley Park is best known for the work done on cracking the German codes and helping to bring World War II to a close far sooner than might have happened without those code breakers .
But many believe Bletchley should be celebrated not just for what it ended but also for what it started - namely the computer age .
The pioneering machines at Bletchley were created to help codebreakers cope with the enormous volume of enciphered material the Allies managed to intercept .
The machine that arguably had the greatest influence in those early days of computing was Colossus - a re-built version of which now resides in the National Museum of Computing which is also on the Bletchley site .
Men and machine The Enigma machines were used by the field units of the German Army , Navy and Airforce .
But the communications between Hitler and his generals were protected by different machines : The Lorenz SZ40 and SZ42 .
The German High Command used the Lorenz machine because it was so much faster than the Enigma , making it much easier to send large amounts of text .
" For about 500 words Enigma was reasonable but for a whole report it was hopeless , " said Jack Copeland , professor of philosophy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand , director of the Turing Archive and a man with a passionate interest in the Bletchley Park computers .
Bletchley employed thousands of code breakers during wartime The Allies first picked up the stream of enciphered traffic , dubbed Tunny , in 1940 .
The importance of the material it contained soon became apparent .
Like Enigma , the Lorenz machines enciphered text by mixing it with characters generated by a series of pinwheels .
" We broke wheel patterns for a whole year before Colossus came in , " said Captain Jerry Roberts , one of the codebreakers who deciphered Tunny traffic at Bletchley .
" Because of the rapid expansion in the use of Tunny , our efforts were no longer enough and we had to have the machines in to do a better job . "
The man who made Colossus was Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers , who had instantly impressed Alan Turing when asked by the maverick mathematician to design a machine to help him in his war work .
But , said Capt Roberts , Flowers could not have built his machine without the astonishing work of Cambridge mathematician Bill Tutte .
" I remember seeing him staring into the middle distance and twiddling his pencil and I wondered if he was earning his corn , " said Capt Roberts .
But it soon became apparent that he was .
" He figured out how the Lorenz machine worked without ever having seen one and he worked out the algorithm that broke the traffic on a day - to - day basis , " said Capt Roberts .
" If there had not been Bill Tutte , there would not have been any need for Tommy Flowers , " he said .
" The computer would have happened later .
Much later . "
Valve trouble Prof Copeland said Tommy Flowers faced scepticism from Bletchley Park staff and others that his idea for a high - speed computer employing thousands of valves would ever work .
Colossus kept valves lit to ensure they kept on working " Flowers was very much swimming against the current as valves were only being used in small units , " he said .
" But the idea of using large numbers of valves reliably was Tommy Flowers ' big thing .
He 'd experimented and knew how to control the parameters . "
And work it did .
The close co-operation between the human translators and the machines meant that the Allies got a close look at the intimate thoughts of the German High Command .
Information gleaned from Tunny was passed to the Russians and was instrumental in helping it defeat the Germans at Kursk - widely seen as one of the turning points of WWII .
The greater legacy is the influence of Colossus on the origins of the computer age .
" Tommy Flowers was the key figure for everything that happened subsequently in British computers , " said Prof Copeland .
After the war Bletchley veterans Alan Turing and Max Newman separately did more work on computers using the basic designs and plans seen in Colossus .
Turing worked on the Automatic Computing Engine for the British government and Newman helped to bring to life the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine - widely acknowledged as the first stored program computer .
The work that went into Colossus also shaped the thinking of others such as Maurice Wilkes , Freddie Williams , Tom Kilburn and many others - essentially the whole cast of characters from whom early British computing arose .
And the rest , as they say , is history .

Will Smith Gay According to Madame
is gay and has employed the services of a notorious Hollywood madame to provide him with male prostitutes .
According to the madame , who has since moved her operation to Manhattan , Smith was a client for years .
She claims the first time she ever spoke with Smith she had to " reassure him over and over that I could guarantee discretion . ”
“ Once I convinced him I could , he placed his order .
It was for a man .
I had 14 women working for me and two guys .
You ’d be surprised at how many Hollywood stars requested the services of the guys . ”
Yeah , how ' bout that discretion ?
If you can't trust a notorious madame to be discreet , who the hell can you trust ?
Gay rumors have plagued Smith for years , but until someone more credible than an anonymous madame comes forward with photos or video , we are n't biting .
Organizers have revealed that Hideo Kojima , Corporate Officer , Executive Producer and Director of Kojima Productions , will deliver a keynote address at next months 2009 Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) in San Francisco .
Known for giving rise to the stealth action game genre with his creation of the acclaimedseries more than two decades ago , Kojima 's keynote will focus on conquering various development obstacles with creative game design , using the driving game design philosophies behind theseries as reference .
The address , " Solid Game Design : Making the ' Impossible ' Possible , " marks Kojima 's debut appearance at the GDC .
The Game Developers Conference takes place March 23 - 27 at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco .
Kojima joins a host of notable speakers at this year 's GDC , including Nintendo president Satoru Iwata , Lionhead 's Peter Molyneux , creators Mark Healey and Alex Evans , Epic 's Rod Fergusson , and a host of others .
Renowned as one of the world 's most influential contemporary game developers , Hideo Kojima first decided to get involved in the game development business while studying economics .
Driven by the hardware limitations of the MSX personal computer , he pursued a fresh approach to the action game genre - and thus the stealth genre was born with
The debut title was then ported to the Famicom , known Stateside as the Nintendo Entertainment System , and received an unofficial sequel titled
The global breakthrough for Kojima 's career took place in 1998 whenwas released on Sony 's PlayStation platform , and it has been followed by multiple new titles in the franchise , including the critically acclaimed , and 2008 's multi-million sellingKojima also produced the mech action game , and also created , a Game Boy Advance game which contained a photometric sensor in the cartridge that charged a vampire 's solar weapon , sending gamers outdoors to catch some fresh air .
This type of idea is something that Kojima has become known for -- breaking the " fourth wall " and forcing the player to interact with the game in ways outside of traditional gameplay .
" The Game Developers Conference has invited Hideo Kojima to keynote every year for as long as I can remember , so we could n't be more excited that , at long last , he feels that it is time for him to address the game development community , " said Meggan Scavio , event director of the GDC .
" The anticipation is already huge to see how one of the community 's most revered and elusive creators will inspire attendees to further push the limits of game development .
" Hideo Kojima 's keynote , " Solid Game Design : Making the ' Impossible ' Possible , " is scheduled for Thursday , March 26 , 2009 from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. PST in the Esplanade Room of the Moscone Center 's South Hall .
The 2009 Game Developers Conference ( part of Think Services , as is this website ) takes place March 23 - 27 , 2009 , at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco .

( CNN ) -- Germany 's Catholic bishops are calling for the expulsion of a bishop , recently brought back into the church by Pope Benedict XVI , after new reports that Richard Williamson denies the Holocaust .
Bishop Richard Williamson , shown in a recent Swiss interview , says he 'll recant " if I find this proof . "
In statements to Spiegel Online , the Web site of the German news magazine , Archbishop Robert Zollitsch said the church should part ways with Bishop Williamson , a member of an ultra-conservative group that split off after Pope John Paul II excommunicated him and three other bishops in 1988 .
" Mr. Williamson is impossible and irresponsible , " Zollitsch , chairman of the German Bishops ' Conference , told the magazine in an article published Saturday .
" I now see no room for him in the Catholic Church . "
The Vatican has faced criticism since Benedict lifted the excommunication of the four men January 21 and announced the move three days later .
The announcement came days after a Swedish Public Television interview in which Williamson said Germany 's systematic murder of millions of Jews during World War II never happened .
In the Saturday article , Spiegel quotes Williamson saying that he will not recant his theories and that he would need more evidence to believe the Holocaust really happened .
Watch Argentines respond to ex-bishop 's statements »
" If I find this proof , then I will correct myself , " he said .
" But that will require some time . "
On Wednesday , the Vatican ordered Williamson to " distance himself " from his views " in an absolutely unequivocal and public manner . "
The Vatican 's secretary of state , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , has said Williamson will not be allowed to perform priestly functions if he does not recant .
He said the pope was unaware of the comments when he rehabilitated the men .
Williamson apologized last week for the " distress " he has caused the pope but did not retract his comments .
Williamson , a Briton who now lives in Argentina , and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 .
The society was founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve , who rebelled against the Vatican 's modernizing reforms in the 1960s , and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies .
Williamson 's reinstatement and comments have been fiercely criticized by Israel , American Jewish groups and political leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The pope -- who was born in Germany and was a child during the Nazi era -- rejected Holocaust denial in public statements January 28 .
At the end of his weekly audience that day , the pope discussed his trips to the former concentration camp at Auschwitz and the images of " the heinous slaughter of millions of Jews , the innocent victims of a blind racial and religious hatred . "

' Zero ' Arrests , Secured Obama Inauguration Rolls On Despite investigation into possible threat , events stayed largely under control .
Jan. 20 , 2009  --
As Obama has been President Obama watches the inaugural parade from the White House reviewing stand and prepares to attend numerous inaugural balls , law enforcement officials confirm that the the crowds that turned out for the day 's festivities remained in check .
" Zero .
There have been no inaugural - related arrest [s ] reported by any of our law enforcement partners today , " the Secret Service said , as of 5 p.m. ET .
With the crowds dissipating now that Obama has been sworn in , law enforcement officials are breathing a sigh of relief that the headline event of the day passed without major incident .
A government official gave an unofficial estimate that the crowd topped 1.8 million , with 1.4 million on the Malland up to 400,000 in nearby streets .
The government does n't give official crowd estimates , but it uses internal approximations to help dispatch resources .
Law enforcement officials had closed down public access to the parade route around 12:30 p.m. ET because it had begun to near its estimated capacity of up to 350,000 .
And it was the massive crowd that presented a huge variable for law enforcement , though law enforcement sources said they do not have any information that there is an imminent threat to the inauguration festivities .
But out of caution , the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a bulletin last night , expressing concern about " the threat individuals affiliated with al - Shabaab -- a radical Islamic extremist group active in Somalia -- may pose to the homeland , including locations and events of political significance , such as the upcoming presidential Inauguration . "
The information , however , is " of limited specificity and uncertain credibility , " the spokesman said , but " authorities at all levels are vigorously pursuing any lead relating to this threat information . "
The DHS statement pointed out that large gatherings make for an attractive target for those looking to cause disruptions , but that officials " encourage the public attending inauguration events to go about their normal plans . "
Noting that there is an " unprecedented level of security " for the inauguration , a DHS spokesman said that numerous federal law enforcement authorities are investigating and analyzing " recently received information about a potential threat on Inauguration Day . "
ABC News recently reported that officials suspect that a group of men of Somali descent , who lived in the Minneapolis area , returned to Somalia for terror training .
Officials have confirmed to ABC News that some of the individuals have returned to the United States .
The FBI and DHS bulletin notes that the men might have been associated with Shirwa Ahmed , a naturalized U.S. citizen who is believed to have blown himself up in a suicide attack in Somalia last October .
The bulletin states that officials released the information in an attempt to raise awareness and possibly obtain more information .
It also notes that " a threat to the inauguration does not necessarily mean that the target would be the Washington D.C. , area , but could be elsewhere within the United States , " but that past attacks attributed to the group have " focused on targets in Somalia . "
But it continues , adding that " the organization possesses an international support network it may be able to leverage for international operations . "
Huge Inauguration Crowds , Unprecedented Security
Inauguration activities are being protected by an army of police and military in one of the largest - scale security operations in U.S. history .
Heavily armed U.S. Coast Guard boats patrolling the rivers .
SWAT teams at the ready .
Military jets canvassing the restricted airspace surrounding the nation 's capital .
A brand - new , fortified presidential limo ready for Obama .
Just after 9 a.m. , the U.S. Park Police closed the entrances to a packed National Mall , directing the public instead to the Washington Monument grounds .
The monument is just more than a mile away from the U.S. Capitol , where the swearing in took place .
The Metro subway system broke its ridership record , with trains shuttling 873,000 passengers to and from events by early evening .
Around 9:25 a.m. , a 68 - year - old woman at the Gallery Place - Chinatown Metro station fell onto the tracks , and was taken to a Washington Hospital Center with non-life threatening injuries to her arm .
The station reopened after police investigated the scene .
D.C. and U.S. health officials said that as of early evening , there had been reports of more than 670 patients from the Mall and inauguration event areas , and that paramedics transported 44 to the hospital .
The injured suffered mostly minor injuries from falls , hypothermia , and symptoms of cardiac stress .
Stepped - Up Security
Security for this inauguration promises to be the most expensive in the nation 's history .
And make no mistake , federal officials are deadly serious .
More than 8,000 police officers and an estimated 11,000 military personnel -- in addition to thousands of federal agents and undercover teams -- are looking for any hint of trouble in the huge crowd .
Inauguration Security : ' No Room for Mistakes '
Joseph Perssichini Jr. , the assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Washington field office , said he 's conveyed the importance of the day 's events to his agents .
" I just met with all the intelligence teams that 'll be out on the street being our eyes and ears .
and I told them that the American people are depending on you , and that 's what we look at every day , " he told ABC News before Inauguration Day .
" We can not let our guard down , we have to give it 100 percent .
There is no room for mistakes , and that 's the motto we look at , " he continued , noting that the agents understand that many variables could affect the security situation .
U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said no resource would be spared .
" Whether it has to do with human resource asset [s ] , technology asset [s ] -- there 's no asset that we 're not going to use to make this a safe event . "
Sullivan added that the security preparations have been " very , very collaborative , " a massive undertaking that involves " 58 different federal , state and local law enforcement agencies , " military and public safety entities .
" Everyone [ is ] working together to make this an event , an event that is not about security but an event that is about the president and our country , " he added .
" It is going to be an interesting time here and no one is sparing any expense or holding back any capabilities that they have , " Col .
Dave Miles , the Air Force liaison to the Department of Homeland Security for the National Capital Region , said .
" Everyone understands you do not want to be second - guessed .
...
But the measures in place , he said , should allow them to address " any contingency that 's going to arise . "

I looked at the lady 's MySpace site - I always look before I click - and saw she was a publicist of what is pejoratively know as " Texas Music " in some circles - OK , well , mine mostly .
No problem .
I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed that maybe there was no hidden agenda , that maybe she is just a very literary woman desiring to expand her mind by hanging onto my eloquent prose .
Click .
She 's my " friend . "
I sent back that I could maybe help out her clients ' budget by saving postage if I thought what she was going to mail might not be something I was interested in , or within the genre bounds of what I mostly write about for money .
Who are the artists ; what are the album titles ?
" I 'm not a receptacle for whatever crap anyone wants to mail me .
Like I said , who is the artist and what is the title ? "
Reply : " Where is all of this aggression coming from ?
You 're being very aggressive and I do n't think I like this .
I may not talk to you anymore . "
Type .
Fast .
" YOU friended me , I did n't seek you out .
Looked at your site .
Saw you have photos with some Texas music hacks .
If that 's what you 're trying to mail me , like I said , I 'm not a receptacle for any crap anyone wants to mail . "
Send .
And back came the message : I had been BLOCKED .
She never even got my last message .
MySpace , you bitch .

Dream lightweight ace Shinya Aoki has agreed to move back up to welterweight to compete in Dream ’s 168 - pound tournament , which begins on April 5 at the NGK Insulators Hall in Nagoya , Japan .
The announcement was made by promoter Fighting and Entertainment Group on Thursday .
Aoki ( 19 - 3 ) , who still holds the Shooto world 168 - pound title , had quite a run in the lightweight ranks in 2008 with victories over Gesias “ JZ ” Cavalcante Caol Uno , and Eddie Alvarez Hayato " Mach " Sakurai ( 34 - 8 - 2 ) will join Aoki as the second marquee name to enter the tournament .
The seasoned veteran last saw action at K - 1 Dynamite ’s year - end extravaganza , where he dispatched Katsuyori Shibata with strikes at the seven - minute mark .
A source close to the situation has told Sherdog.com that FEG is hoping to pit Aoki against fellow star Sakurai in April 's quarterfinals .
Sakurai and Aoki met in August 2005 , where a then - unknown Aoki took Sakurai to a hotly competitive decision .
In addition , it was announced that another welterweight tournament slot will be filled on Feb. 20 , when Deep 40 Impact takes place at Korakuen Hall .
The bill will feature the first title defense of unlikely welterweight champion Seichi Ikemoto as he risks his belt against Hidetaka Monma Ikemoto , 33 , has been inactive since his upset of Hidehiko Hasegawa in July to win the title .
The 35 - year - old Monma last saw action in November , where he took a thrilling victory over Andre Mafetoni , the cousin of standout heavyweight Gabriel " Napao " Gonzaga .
Monma and Ikemoto first met at Deep 13th Impact in January 2004 , where Monma took a second - round submission win .
Go - to guy Ikuhisa Minowa ( 41 - 29 - 8 ) has also been added to the night ’s festivities in a non -tournament bout .
The eccentric “ Minowa Man ” submitted Errol Zimmerman with a toehold in 61 seconds at K - 1 Dynamite on New Year ’s Eve. Minowa ’s opponent has not been named .
Teenagers in love may be less likely to get mixed up in crime and substance abuse , according to new UC Davis research .
But while romantic love seems to help keep teens law - abiding , casual sex can mean trouble .
UC Davis sociology professor Bill McCarthy and graduate student Teresa Casey found that teenagers in romantic sexual relationships had the same low rates of criminal behavior and substance abuse as celibate teenagers .
But when compared with their celibate peers , teenagers who had sex with nonromantic partners were up to 20 percent more likely to have been involved in criminal behavior -- and as much as 58 percent more likely to have engaged in substance use .
" Romantic love may fill a void that occurs in adolescence between the weakening of parental control and the onset of a marital bond , " McCarthy and Casey write .
" Romantic love might discourage offending by strengthening adolescents ' social bond . "
The study used advanced statistical techniques and data drawn from the nationally representative Adolescent Health Survey .
It is published in the latest issue of the American Sociological Review .
What is Ruby Enterprise Edition ?
Ruby Enterprise Edition ( REE ) is a server - oriented distribution of the official Ruby interpreter , and includes various additional enhancements .
REE ’s main benefits are the ability to reduce Ruby on Rails applications ’ memory usage by 33 % on average , the ability to increase applications ’ performance and the inclusion of various analysis and debugging features .
The lower memory usage and increased performance are possible because REE includes – among other enhancements – a copy - on - write friendly garbage collector , as well as an improved memory allocator .
REE has been out for several months now and is already used by many high - profile websites and organizations , such as New York Times , Shopify and 37signals .
“ We switched to enterprise ruby to get the full benefit of the [ copy - on - write ] memory characteristics and we can absolutely confirm the memory savings of 30 % some others have reported .
This is many thousand dollars of savings even at today ’s hardware prices . ”
— Tobias Lütke ( Shopify )
And just like Phusion Passenger , Ruby Enterprise Edition is 100 % open source .
Sponsorship results
We are pleased to announce REE version 1.8.6-20090113 to the world .
This version is sponsored by the following people and organizations :
We were pleasantly surprised with the speed at which the second sponsorship campaign ’s goal was reached .
Thank you sponsors !
Changes
The sponsored improvements are :
Tcmalloc support for 64 - bit operating systems .
REE ’s copy - on - write optimizations work on 64 - bit operating systems .
But the improved memory allocator that REE includes , tcmalloc , was disabled on 64 - bit platforms for various reasons .
It would be more efficient if tcmalloc is enabled on 64 - bit platforms because it would allow one to save more memory and to gain more performance .
In this release , tcmalloc now properly integrates into Ruby on 64 - bit platform .

Ported and incorporated the RubyProf GC patches .
These patches add the ability to measure the number of objects in Ruby and to measure the amount of allocated memory , which is very useful in various debugging scenarios .
RubyProf automatically uses this functionality for GC profiling if the Ruby interpreter is properly patched .

Better documentation .
A lot of cool new features , e.g. caller_for_all_threads and the RailsBench patches , had been added to REE lately .
These features are n’t very well documented , and the existing documentation was scattered all over the Internet .
We ’ve written a unified manual which teaches developers how to effectively use these new REE features to debug applications .
We ’ve also added a number of improvements which are not sponsored :
Fixed –no - tcmalloc on OS X Running the installer with –no - tcmalloc did n’t work on OS X .
This has been fixed .
Fixed more bugs in GNU readline integration on OS X Requiring “ irb / completion ” causes REE to crash when running on OS X .
This has been fixed .
Also , GNU readline has been added as dependency , so the installer will now check for it .
Pass ‘- r ’ to ‘ gem install ’ when installing gems
The REE installer will now pass ‘- r ’ when installing gems .
This fixes gem installation for people who have specified ‘- l ’ in their ~/.gemrc .
Fixed a crash when using REE to install REE
This is caused by the fact that we overwrote tcmalloc without unlinking it first .
This has been fixed .
Fixed Debian package
The Debian package for the previous release contains a mysterious folder called ‘ / home / hongli ’ .
This bug has been fixed .
Download & upgrade

To upgrade from a previous version , simply install into the same prefix that you installed to last time .
Please also refer to the documentation for upgrade instructions .

Java does not allow duck typing out of the box .
This library helps to overcome this limitation .
Given an arbitrary object and an interface , this library lets you get an object that implements the interface by delegating to the object .
Duck typing is a style of dynamic typing where the type of an object is determined by its set of methods rather than by a defined class it belongs to .
Example
Let us assume we have to implement an interface ( MyInterface ) , but only want to implement the method bar ( ) , because the other methods will not be called .
This can be done like this :
interface MyInterface { void foo( ) ; int bar ( int x , int y ) ; int baz ( int x ) ; } public class Delegate { public int bar ( ) { return 42 ; } }
Now we can create an object that implements MyInterface :
DuckPrxy duckProxy = new DuckPrxyImpl( ) ; Delegate delegate = new Delegate ( ) ; MyInterface prxy = duckProxy.makeProxy(MyInterface.class , delegate ) ; prxy.bar ( 2 , 3 ) ; // Will return 42 .
Note : the DuckPrxy implementations are thread safe , so one instance can be safely shared / injected .
The created proxies are thread safe iff the delegate is thread safe .
There is one limitation though :
You can use anonymous classes for the delegate , but the methods called via duck typing must be made visible by implementing an interface or by extending a class that has these methods .
Otherwise Java 's reflection API will not be able to see the methods .
Everyone knows what a world - renowned , French intellectual looks like .
There is the older sort , now rare , who has a squint and smokes cigarettes and haunts the cafés of the Paris Left Bank .
There is the newer kind , who has flowing hair and an open - necked shirt and haunts television studios .
Wrong and wrong again .
The new face of the world - leading French intellectual is a brisk 36 - year - old woman with the pleasant but no -nonsense look of a primary school teacher , who climbs mountains in her spare time .
She is Esther Duflo and was recently named one of the 100 most influential thinkers in the world ( she came 91st ) .
She begins a season of lectures this week at the Collège de France , the Everest of French intellectual life : a kind of PhD - level OU with no students and free lectures for all .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mme Duflo is the youngest woman ever to be asked to lecture at this prestigious , 500 - year - old institution at the heart of the Left Bank .
Her introductory talk was the hottest ( free ) ticket in town .
Several hundred people , including the former prime minister , Dominique de Villepin , arrived too late and were locked out .
Mme Duflo is a " development economist " one of the world 's greatest experts – perhaps the greatest – on why development programmes in poor countries often fail and why they sometimes succeed .
Her precise field of expertise has existed less than a decade .
She is among its inventors .
Why is she attracting such attention ?
" Partly , I think , because it 's so unusual for such a young person , especially a woman , to be asked to lecture at the Collège de France , " Mme Duflo said in an interview .
" I suppose people are asking ' Who is this person ?
What is all the fuss about ? '
Partly also , I think the subject is something that intrigues people .
Why is it so difficult , despite all the efforts which have been made , to help people to escape from poverty ? "
Mme Duflo is not an abstract theorist , as French intellectuals are assumed ( often encouraged ) to be .
She investigates , in elaborate detail , the practical , small things which can make a difference in trying to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor .
For instance , not just " education , education , education " but how to make sure pupils and their teachers turn up at school .
( Answer : tiny incentives , such as free meals or uniforms , can transform attendance in poor countries . )
Mme Duflo has , above all , developed and promoted the concept of " scientific " testing of anti-poverty programmes – what works and what does n't but also , crucially , why things work and why they do n't .
She believes – and has proved – that the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes can be explored by " random testing " , in the same way pharmaceutical companies test drugs .
Esther Duflo does her research not so much in government archives and university libraries but villages in India , Ghana or Kenya .
She is left wing but in a " whatever it takes " kind of way .
She has spent most of the past 10 years in the US , where she is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Three years ago , she founded the Poverty Action Lab , to put her ideas into practice .
The World Bank incorporated ideas developed by " random testing " in 87 of its programmes last year .
" Some of what we prove may seem obvious but we have to overcome prejudices , " she said .
" Many aid organisations , for instance , believe people should not be given bribes to improve their own health . "
" We have framed tests in different countries , which show that people will take , say , de-worming medicine in far greater numbers if you give them a tiny incentive , such as a kilo of beans . "

Esther Duflo was brought up in Asnières , just west of Paris .
She rocketed through the French education system and emigrated to US academia after working indirectly for the renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs on a research programme in Russia .
In Massachusetts she worked with the MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee , who was one of the pioneers of development economics .
Professor Banerjee says before Mme Duflo , theories of development economics existed and practical knowledge of aid programmes existed .
She was one of the first to put them together systematically ; to apply economic skills to discovering what was going wrong and adjusting policies .
The intellectuel engagé – or intellectual committed to a cause – has a long history in France .
Mme Duflo's intellectual work and her cause are the same thing .
She had expected to become an academic historian who volunteered for aid programmes in her spare time .
She became an economist , she says , when she grasped it might be possible to put her " academic gift " and " work against poverty " together .
Her spare time is devoted to running to get herself fit for her other passion : climbing in the Alps .
Starting her inaugural talk last Thursday , Mme Duflo appeared shy , even overawed : a tiny woman in a black skirt and jacket and cherry blouse .
Collège de France professors – grey - haired men in brown cord jackets – filled the front rows .
Mme Duflo is no orator but once into the meat of her subject , she was compelling , even inspiring .
Despite billions thrown at " development " , she said , desperate poverty thrives .
Two solutions are usually prescribed : give up and rely on the market ; or throw in more billions .
Mme Duflo believes in a " third way " : making anti-poverty programmes work better .
Instead of imposing abstract theories , she said , economists should believe in their " scientific " skills .
But they should also be more " modest " and get out more .
They should , she says , turn the " dismal science " into a human science , " generous " and determined to make a difference .
Les intellectuels
The days have long gone when French intellectuals such as Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir held court in smoke - filled brasseries of the Paris Left Bank .
Few intellectuals could now afford the rent of apartments in Montparnasse or Saint - Germain - des - Prés .
Sartre ( 1905 - 1980 ) is still for many the archetype of the French intellectual with a cause .
Anti-bourgeois , anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist , his shifting definitions of " existentialism " – there are no absolute truths ; each individual must find his own path to " freedom " – are back in fashion with radical academics in America , a country he detested .
His lover Simone de Beauvoir ( 1908 - 1986 ) influenced generations of young women all over the world with her seminal feminist text Le Deuxième Sexe [ The Second Sex ] , published in 1949 .
The couple had a bizarre on - off love affair in which they probably never slept together in the last 30 years of their lives – but they were buried together in death .
The very image of a more modern , media - savvy French intellectual is Bernard - Henri Lévy , 60 , who holds court mostly on television and in his weekly magazine column in Le Point .
M. Levy challenged the unthinking leftist consensus of French intellectual life with his book La Barbarie à Visage Humain [ Barbarism With A Human Face ] in 1977 .
He has since been – depending on your viewpoint – a committed and courageous or vain and self - regarding critic of tyranny and human rights abuses from Bosnia to Afghanistan .
BEIJING ( AP ) — China ’s fast - growing population of Internet users has risen to 298 million after passing the United States last year to become the world ’s largest , a government - sanctioned research group said Tuesday .
The latest figure is a 41.9 percent increase over the same period last year , the China Internet Network Information Center said in a report .
China ’s Internet penetration is still low at just 22.6 percent , leaving more room for rapid growth , according to CNNIC .
The Pew Internet and American Life Project places U.S. online penetration at 71 percent .
China ’s Internet use is growing at explosive rates despite government efforts to block access to material deemed subversive or pornographic .
Regulators are in the middle of a crackdown on sites accused of carrying sexually explicit material .
The financial size of China ’s online market still trails that of the United States , South Korea and other countries .
The United States had an estimated 223.1 million Internet users in June , according to Nielsen Online , a research firm .
China is preparing to launch third - generation mobile phone service — which supports wireless Web surfing — that is expected to set off a new surge in Internet use .
PANETTA GREAT ON TORTURE ….
With Leon Panetta slated to take over the CIA , for many of us , and I include myself in this , the first question is pretty straightforward : how is he on torture ?
Atrios pointed to an op - ed piece Panetta wrote for a California newspaper in March , in which he took an unequivocal line : “ Torture is illegal , immoral , dangerous and counterproductive .
And yet , the president is using fear to trump the law . ”
Before that item was published though , Panetta had a piece right here in the Washington Monthly on the subject .
It ’s worth re-reading given his new position .
According to the latest polls , two - thirds of the American public believes that torturing suspected terrorists to gain important information is justified in some circumstances .
How did we transform from champions of human dignity and individual rights into a nation of armchair torturers ?
One word : fear .
Fear is blinding , hateful , and vengeful .
It makes the end justify the means .
And why not ?
If torture can stop the next terrorist attack , the next suicide bomber , then what ’s wrong with a little waterboarding or electric shock ?
The simple answer is the rule of law .
Our Constitution defines the rules that guide our nation .
It was drafted by those who looked around the world of the eighteenth century and saw persecution , torture , and other crimes against humanity and believed that America could be better than that .
This new nation would recognize that every individual has an inherent right to personal dignity , to justice , to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment .
We have preached these values to the world .
We have made clear that there are certain lines Americans will not cross because we respect the dignity of every human being .
That pledge was written into the oath of office given to every president , “ to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution . ”
It ’s what is supposed to make our leaders different from every tyrant , dictator , or despot .
We are sworn to govern by the rule of law , not by brute force .
We cannot simply suspend these beliefs in the name of national security .
Those who support torture may believe that we can abuse captives in certain select circumstances and still be true to our values .
But that is a false compromise .
We either believe in the dignity of the individual , the rule of law , and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment , or we do n’t .
There is no middle ground .
We cannot and we must not use torture under any circumstances .
We are better than that .
That ’s what I wanted to hear .
What ’s more , Moira Whelan raises a good point about an important asset Panetta will bring to the CIA : “ He knows how brains work inside the West Wing because he was there as White House Chief of Staff , and therefore will know how to provide information that gets attention in the way it should .
Personally , I think this will give the IC a big advantage in terms of getting their point of view across in the Oval .
Panetta will know how to be subtle , but also how to sound alarm bells as needed . ”

William Lynn , President Barack Obamas nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense , vowed to make the Pentagons missile defense system cost - effective during his confirmation hearing earlier this month before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Indeed , missile defense strikes a lot of national security analysts as a frightful waste of money .
Money is not the central issue , though .
The pros and cons of missile defense are endlessly complex , and men and women in the national security community understand these subtleties .
Some are pro-missile defense ; some are not ; others say the current system wont work , but another kind would .
Still others question the assumption that a rogue nation would ever send a nuclear - armed missile our way with its return address effectively written all over it knowing that U.S. retaliation would be swift and devastating .
Vans or trucks would be a more likely means of delivery , with weapons components smuggled in and assembled in garages .
Such subtleties are missing from the manner in which missile defense advocates market their cause .
Case in point : the teaser for the Heritage Foundations forthcoming documentary film , 33 Minutes , part of a new and extensive pro-missile defense campaign .
The teaser features Arabic music , missile launches , and nuclear explosions .
At one point we watch a teeming - with - vitality montage of New York City street life .
 Less than 33 minutes away ,  intones Dr. Edwin Feulner , president of Heritage ,  their whole city , their whole life could be annihilated . 
Scare tactics have long been used to persuade the American people to side with missile defense .
During the 1980s , it was the Soviet Union that was threatening nuclear Armageddon ; now it is rogue nations and even terrorists .
China , which for years has supported the U.S. economy by helping to cover our annual budget deficits through the purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. Treasury notes , is depicted as a Missile Menace .
The Middle Kingdom , says Frank Gaffney , a hugely influential missile defense advocate , is inexorably building up ever - larger numbers of missiles .
Increasingly , these are capable not only of intimidating Taiwan but also of attacking the United States . 
Gaffney , president of the Center for Security Policy , and the Heritage Foundation are not alone in championing ballistic missile defense : hardline think tanks favor it , as do many editorial writers , columnists , TV talking heads , and for that matter ordinary people .
And why not ?
How could anything labeled defense be anything but a Good Thing ?
In the real world , though , labels and promotional materials are often misleading .
Missile defense is widely perceived elsewhere in the world , even by U.S. friends and allies , as dangerously provocative .
The infrastructure for a ballistic missile defense system is , in large measure , the same as that needed for an offensive anti-satellite system .
Meanwhile , the United States is the only nation that says it intends to develop the means to militarily dominate space according to international law the province of all mankind .
Given that , U.S. missile - defense systems capable of offense look a little sinister , particularly in the light that the United States has vetoed , since 1981 , any serious attempt to negotiate a treaty designed to prevent a space - related arms race .
What is the worlds hyperpower really up to ?
The cover of the March 12 , 2001 , issue of The New Republic said it best :  Missile defense is nt really meant to protect America .
It s a tool for global dominance .
And that s why we need it . 
If missile defense systems can be made reliable , goes the argument , Americas ability to militarily intervene anywhere at any time will be greatly enhanced .
War games have demonstrated time and again that the United States can be deterred from military intervention if the target state has the ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons .
A workable missile defense system would cure that defect .
As Lawrence F. Kaplan , the brilliant neoconservative author of The New Republic story , said : missile defense is mainly about the ability to project military force globally .
That is not an idiosyncratic observation .
The link between missile defense and military intervention is part of the intellectual mix when national security experts get together behind closed doors .
That insight needs to be part of the public discussion , too .
Our propensity for military intervention as in , for instance , Iraq touches upon the very meaning of America .
Can anyone spell global hegemony ?
Panasonic Corp. , sinking into what it expects will be its first annual loss in six years , said Wednesday that it was slashing about 15,000 jobs and closing 27 plants worldwide .
It joins a string of Japanese companies making deep cuts as they cope with the global slowdown .
Plunging consumer demand , lower gadget prices and the soaring yen , which erodes overseas income , are battering Panasonic , the world ’s largest maker of plasma TVs .
It said Wednesday that it swung to a loss of 63.1 billion yen ( $ 709 million ) for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31 , compared with a profit of 115.2 billion yen the previous year .
Quarterly sales dropped 20 % to 1.880 trillion yen from 2.345 trillion , with overseas sales decreasing 29 % and Japanese sales down 10 % .
The Osaka - based manufacturer of cellphones , batteries and camcorders also slashed its forecast for the fiscal year through March to a loss of 380 billion yen ( $ 4.2 billion ) .
The last time Panasonic reported an annual loss was for the fiscal year that ended March 2002 , when a global electronics slump and massive restructuring costs contributed to 431 billion yen in red ink .

Since then , the company has been shedding money - losing businesses and focusing on key products such as plasma televisions to turn itself around .
But the recovery could n’t hold up against the global slowdown set off by the U.S. financial crisis .
Sales slid in a variety of products , including flat - panel TVs , DVD recorders , microwaves , lamps and semiconductors , it said .
The planned job cuts at Panasonic -- half of them in Japan -- will come by the end of March 2010 and will amount to about 5 % of its 300,000 - strong global workforce .
Panasonic also will shut 14 overseas plants and 13 plants in Japan by the end of March to adjust production and cut costs .
The company has 230 production sites around the world .
Panasonic is just the latest among Japan ’s big -name companies to announce massive job cuts and forecast losses in coming months .
Sony Corp. is forecasting a loss of 150 billion yen for the fiscal year through March .
Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Toshiba Corp. are also all forecasting big losses for the fiscal year .
" For once and for all , the Arrested Development movie is happening ! "
Will Arnett tells us today .
But the big question is whether a certain beloved Bluth will be there : Superbad and Juno star Michael Cera .
That 's the word from Arnett , Jason Bateman and producer Mitch Hurwitz , who met with reporters to promote their new animated Fox series , Sit Down , Shut Up .
" I hope so , " Hurwitz tells me when asked if Cera will do the big - screen version of Arrested , which Hurwitz describes as " Valkyrie meets Hotel for Dogs . "
" We 're just trying to get all the actors on board . "
According to inside sources close to the deal , all of the main Arrested cast members have signed on to the movie except Cera , aka George - Michael Bluth .
" I know he 's thinking about it , " Bateman tells us .
" And we 're all awaiting some finality to all of that so Mitch can get writing . "
So why is Cera holding out ?
And what 's the movie all about ?
' Danger from just seven cups of coffee a day , " said the Daily Express on Wednesday .
" Too much coffee can make you hallucinate and sense dead people , say sleep experts .
The equivalent of just seven cups of instant coffee a day is enough to trigger the weird responses . "
The story appeared in almost every national newspaper .
This was weak observational data .
That 's just the start of our story , but you should know exactly what the researchers did .
They sent an email inviting students to fill out an online survey , and 219 agreed .
The survey is still online ( in all its time - consuming glory , I just clicked answers randomly to see the next question ) .
It asks about caffeine intake in vast detail , and then uses one scale to measure how prone you are to feeling persecuted , and uses another , the Launay - Slade Hallucination Scale ( LSHS ) , 16 questions designed to measure " predisposition to hallucination - like experiences " .
Some of these questions are about having hallucinations and seeing ghosts , but some really are a very long way from there .
Heavy coffee drinkers could have got higher scores on this scale by responding positively to questions like : " No matter how hard I try to concentrate on my work , unrelated thoughts always creep into my mind " ; " Sometimes a passing thought will seem so real that it frightens me " ; or " Sometimes my thoughts seem as real as actual events in my life " .
That 's not seeing ghosts or hearing voices .
There could have been alternative explanations for the observed correlation between caffeine intake and very slightly higher LSHS scores .
Maybe some students who drink a lot of coffee are also sleep deprived , and marginally more prone to hallucinations because of that .
Maybe they are drinking coffee to help them get over last night 's marijuana hangover .
Maybe people who take drugs instrumentally to have fun and distort their perceptions also take drugs like caffeine instrumentally to stay alert .
You can think of more , I 'm sure .
The researchers were keen to point out this shortcoming in their paper .
The Express and many others did n't seem to care .
If you read the academic paper you find that the associations reported are weak .
For the benefit of those who understand " regression " ( and it makes anybody 's head hurt ) , 18 % of the variance in the LSHS score is explained by gender , age and stress .
When you add in caffeine , 21 % of the variance in the LSHS score is explained : only an extra 3 % , so caffeine adds very little .
The finding is statistically significant , as the researchers point out , so it is unlikely to be due to chance , but the fact is that it 's still weak , it explains only a tiny amount of the overall variance in scores on the " predisposed - to - hallucinations " scale .
Lastly , most newspapers reported a rather dramatic claim , that seven cups of coffee a day is associated with a three times higher prevalence of hallucinations .
This figure does not appear in the paper .
It seems to be an ad hoc calculation done afterwards by the researchers , and put into the press release , so you cannot tell you how they did it , or whether they controlled appropriately for problems in the data , like something called " multiple comparisons " .
Here is the problem .
Apparently this three times greater risk is for the top 10 % of caffeine consumers , compared with the bottom 10 % .
They say that heavy caffeine drinkers were three times more likely to have answered affirmatively to just one LSHS question : " In the past , I have had the experience of hearing a person 's voice and then found that no one was there . "
Now this poses massive problems .
Imagine that I am stood facing a barn , holding a machine gun , blindfolded , firing off shots whilst swinging my whole body from side to side and laughing maniacally .
I then walk up to the barn , find three bullet holes which happen to be very close together , and draw a target around them , claiming I am an excellent shot .
You can easily find patterns in your data once it 's collected .
Why choose 10 % as your cut - off ?
Why not the top and bottom quarters ?
Maybe they have accounted for this problem .
You do n't know , I do n't know , they say they have , to me , in emails , but it was n't in the paper , we can't all see the details .
I do n't think that 's satisfactory for a headline finding , and the first claim of a press release .
There is another problem : putting a finding in the press release but not into the paper is a subversion of the peer review process .
People will read this coverage , they will be scared , and they will change their behaviour .
But the researchers ' key reported claim , with massive popular impact , was never peer reviewed , and crucially the technical details behind it are not in the public domain .
I 'm sorry to see academics not blameless in this dreary situation .
FAIRNESS DOCTRINE FIGHT REACHES SENATE FLOOR ….
Before the Senate can vote on whether to give D.C. residents a voice in Congress , Senate Republican Steering Committee Chairman Jim DeMint ( S.C. ) and Senate Republican Conference Vice Chairman John Thune ( S.D. ) had a not - at - all - related amendment for the chamber to consider .
The Senate voted Thursday in favor of an amendment to the District of Columbia voting - rights bill that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) from reinstating the so - called Fairness Doctrine , which critics say would decimate conservative talk radio .
The Senate passed the measure 87 - 11 .
So , to review , the Senate today approved an amendment to a bill about D.C. voting rights prohibiting the FCC from bringing back an old broadcast policy that the FCC was n’t considering and which the Obama administration does not support .
Congress at its finest .
But since it passed overwhelmingly , at least we wo n’t have to hear the right complain about this anymore , right ?
If only it were that simple .
The measure would still have to be approved by the House , which is n’t interested in holding a vote .
In response to the DeMint / Thune measure , Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) proposed “ a rival amendment that he said essentially reaffirmed existing law , which calls for the FCC to encourage diverse media ownership . ”
It passed 57 to 41 .
Despite the fact that Durbin ’s measure simply re-stated current law , every Republican in the Senate voted against it .
DeMint told reporters that Democratic efforts to legally encourage diverse media ownership open a “ back door to censorship . ”
I have no idea what DeMint is talking about .
Come to think of it , neither does he .
According to the Daily Mail , using Facebook “ could raise your risk of cancer ” .
The newspaper reported that social networking sites “ could raise your risk of serious health problems by reducing levels of face - to - face contact ” .
This , and several other media reports , is based on an article expressing the opinion of the psychologist Dr Aric Sigman , who is concerned that a reduction in personal contact could increase the risks of heart disease , stroke and dementia .
In this article , he refers to a selection of studies that have informed this opinion .
However , the article is not a systematic review , meaning that it may not take into account all relevant studies , some of which might not support the author ’s views .
Most of the studies discussed looked at the effects of social isolation on health , with no reporting of whether isolation was caused by increased computer usage .
Also , none of the research cited studied whether computer usage directly caused adverse health effects , or whether social isolation or computer use affected the risk of developing cancer .
It is possible that using social networking sites might , in fact , reduce social isolation and loneliness , but this possibility is not addressed by the article .
While interesting , people who use social networking sites should not be concerned by the article 's claims .
Where did the story come from ?
These news reports are based on an article written by Dr Aric Sigman , who is a Member of the Institute of Biology ( IOB ) , a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and an Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society .
No sources of funding for writing the article were reported .
The study was published in the peer - reviewed journal Biologist , which is the journal of the IOB .
What kind of scientific study was this ?
This was a non-systematic review discussing the possible effects on health of social networking on the internet .
The author discusses various studies looking at changes in computer use and in social interaction , as well as studies looking at the health effects of social isolation .
What were the results of the study ?
The author reports that people in Britain now spend about 50 minutes a day “ interacting socially with other people ” , and a 2003 study from the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) is cited to support these figures .
He also states that couples spend less time with each other and parents spend less time with their children than a decade ago .
He says that the number of people working and living on their own is increasing ( also attributed to the ONS ) .
The article also reports that there has been “ rapid proliferation of electronic media ” , suggesting this “ is now the most significant contributing factor to society ’s growing physical estrangement ” .
The article features a graph showing that time spent in daily face - to - face social interaction has declined from about six hours in 1987 to about two to three hours in 2007 .
This decline is plotted next to results that report that time spent in electronic media use has increased from about four hours in 1987 to almost eight hours in 2007 .
These figures are reported to come from “ time use and demographic studies ” .
The author asserts that the use of earphones , mobile phones , laptops or Blackberries are reasons for “ physical and social disengagement ” .
He also notes that there have been deaths caused by people accidentally stepping into traffic while they were wearing an MP3 player , leading to proposals in the US Senate to ban the use of these and other devices whilst crossing the road .
The article also reports various studies that have found that children spend more time in front of the television and computer than doing anything else , that they spend five to 10 times longer watching television than with their parents , and that about a quarter of five - year - old children in Britain own a computer or laptop .
An ongoing study was reported to find that social networking has “ overtaken fun ( online games ) as the main reason for using the internet ” among young children .
The author also says that UK social networking usage is the highest in Europe , and that time spent interacting socially is now being supplanted by “ virtual ” interaction .
The article goes on to discuss what the health effects of a reduction in physical interaction might be .
These effects are reported in six categories , relating to genetics , immunology , sleep , morbidity , mortality and marriage / cohabitation .
Genetic effects
Research at the UCLA School of Medicine is reported to have found that social isolation can affect the level to which genes are active in white blood cells .
People reporting high levels of social isolation had 78 genes that were more active and 131 genes that were less active than in people with low levels of social isolation .
The genes that were less active are reported to include those involved in the body ’s response to stress and illness , while those that were more active are reported to include those involved in promoting inflammation during stress and illness .
The authors of this research are reported to believe that their findings may explain the “ greater risk of inflammatory disease and adverse health outcomes in individuals who experience high levels of subjective social isolation ” .
Immunological effects
One study is reported to have found that women with breast cancer who reported more social activity and social satisfaction had “ stronger stimulated TNF - alpha responses ” .
TNF - alpha is a compound produced by immune - system cells , and is “ associated with tumour regression and increased survival time for cancer patients ” .
Another study is reported to find increased levels of a particular type of immune - system cell among those women with ovarian cancer who reported a greater amount of social support .
The article ’s author also reports that loneliness has been linked to “ low - grade peripheral inflammation ” and may therefore be linked to inflammatory diseases , and that lack of social connection or loneliness has also been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease .
Sleep effects
One study is reported to have found that lonely people sleep less efficiently and spend more time awake .
The author reports that poor sleep has been linked to a number of adverse effects .
Morbidity
The author reports that “ several decades of research has found that greater social contact is related to reduced morbidity , while fewer contacts lead to increased morbidity ” .
The article discusses studies that looked at stroke risk , blood pressure , susceptibility to colds , cognitive function and dementia .
Mortality
Studies are reported that found increased risk of mortality in apparently healthy persons who retired early , and a reduction in mortality in those who regularly attended church or took part in other social activities .
Marriage and cohabitation
Studies are discussed that have found that rate of suicide is lowest among people who are married , and that being single increases risk of mortality .
However , the author does mention that American criminologists have linked the falling murder rate to the fall in marriage rates “ as husbands now have fewer opportunities to kill wives ” .
What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results ?
The author concludes that “ while the precise mechanisms underlying the association between social connection , morbidity and mortality continue to be investigated , it is clear that this is a growing public health issue for all industrialised countries ” .
The author goes on to discuss a study that found internet usage was linked to reduced social interaction and communication within families , and increased levels of loneliness and depression .
He suggests children are now having less social interaction and adults are more likely to live alone .
Finally , he suggests that biologists can provide “ concrete and measureable ” evidence about the importance of social connection , and this may be the key to increasing public awareness of the problem .
What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study ?
This study was not a systematic review .
It is an article that expresses the opinion of the author , who cites various studies that have informed this opinion .
As this was not a systematic review there may be other relevant studies that the author has not included .
Some of these studies may not support the author ’s opinions .
None of the studies that the author discussed looked at whether social networking or computer usage directly caused adverse health effects .
Most of the studies looked instead at the effects of social isolation or loneliness , with no report of whether these were caused by increased computer usage .
None of the studies described found that loneliness , social isolation or social networking affected the risk of developing cancer .
It is possible that in at least some of the studies adverse health led to greater social isolation rather than the other way round .
It is also possible that using social networking sites may lead to reduced social isolation and loneliness , although this possibility is not addressed by the article .
This piece will no doubt stimulate discussion and research , but does not provide proof of an adverse effect of social networking or other technology on people ’s health .
People who use social networking sites should not be concerned by this article .

( New York ) -
Thirty years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge , Cambodia 's culture of impunity remains as strong as ever , Human Rights Watch said today .
Under Prime Minister Hun Sen , the Cambodian government continues to obstruct the United Nations - supported court created to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders and others most responsible for the deaths of up to 2 million people during the Khmer Rouge - era .
Despite more than three years of operations and the expenditure of approximately US $ 50 million , the UN - backed Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia established to hold the Khmer Rouge accountable have held no trials .
" After 30 years , no one has been tried , convicted or sentenced for the crimes of one of the bloodiest regimes of the 20th century , " said Brad Adams , Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
" This is no accident .
For more than a decade , China and the United States blocked efforts at accountability , and for the past decade Hun Sen has done his best to thwart justice . "
The Extraordinary Chambers have been deeply flawed in both design and practice .
UN reports have concluded that the Cambodian judiciary lacks independence , competence and professionalism .
Yet at the insistence of Hun Sen , a former Khmer Rouge commander , the Extraordinary Chambers were established with a majority of Cambodian judges and a Cambodian " co-prosecutor " and " co-investigating judge . "
The United Nations opposed that structure .
Prosecutors and investigating judges have conducted only limited field investigations .
The Extraordinary Chambers have also been mired in allegations of corruption among its Cambodian personnel , with charges of job - selling and bribery .
Five Khmer Rouge leaders whom Hun Sen has allowed to be arrested are in detention , but no other cases have been filed against the many persons implicated in horrific crimes during Khmer Rouge rule .
Human Rights
Watch has called for broadening the scope of investigations beyond the five already charged .
Today , the Extraordinary Chambers published a statement in which the Cambodian co-prosecutor opposed filing additional cases .
The international co-prosecutor rightly asserted in his filing with the Extraordinary Chambers that the charges fall within the court 's jurisdiction and " would lead to a more comprehensive accounting of the crimes that were committed . "
Yet for political and policy reasons , the Cambodian co-prosecutor has opposed bringing more cases , citing " Cambodia 's past instability and the continued need for national reconciliation . "
" No serious observer believes there is any threat to Cambodia 's stability if additional cases are filed against alleged Khmer Rouge killers , " said Adams .
" On the 30th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge 's fall from power , the Cambodian government is playing games .
This is a transparently political attempt to stop the court from doing its work . "
The Khmer Rouge came to power at the end of the United States ' war in Indochina .
Led by Pol Pot and Nuon Chea , the Khmer Rouge was in power from April 17 , 1975 to January 7 , 1979 .
Estimates suggest that as many as 2 million of Cambodia 's 8 million people were killed or died from disease , starvation , or forced labor during this period .
After the Khmer Rouge carried out numerous cross -border attacks on Vietnam in which hundreds of villagers were massacred , the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia .
It pushed the Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh on January 7 , 1979 .
The Khmer Rouge retreated to the Thai border , where it received support from Thailand , China , the United States , the United Kingdom , Singapore and others for the next decade .
To force the Vietnamese army out of Cambodia , the US then led a broad international embargo on Cambodia , depriving a population that had survived inconceivable violence , deprivation , and hardship of the assistance necessary to rebuild their health and their country .
Throughout the 1980s the Khmer Rouge conducted a violent insurgency in which tens of thousands died .
For geopolitical reasons , discussions of holding the Khmer Rouge leadership accountable for their crimes while in power were blocked , principally by the US and China .
At China 's insistence , the Khmer Rouge was included as a party to the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements , which led to creation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) , the UN 's largest peacekeeping effort up to that time , and national elections to form a new government .
The Khmer Rouge withdrew from the peacekeeping force , but the elections went ahead without it .
China pledged to withdraw support from the Khmer Rouge thereafter , which it apparently did .
But elements in the Thai army continued to support the Khmer Rouge and deaths and injuries , many from landmines , mounted .
The Khmer Rouge movement fractured publicly in 1996 with the amnesty granted to Ieng Sary , the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister , by the Cambodian government .
The movement effectively collapsed after the death of Pol Pot in 1998 and the defection to the Cambodian government of other top leaders , including Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan , and thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers .
In 1997 , Hun Sen and his co-prime minister , Prince Norodom Ranariddh , sent a letter to the UN secretary - general at the time , Kofi Annan , asking for an international tribunal to hold the Khmer Rouge accountable .
This effort was blocked by China , which made it clear that it would veto any UN Security Council resolution to create such a court , and by Hun Sen , who with the collapse of the Khmer Rouge , lost interest in holding its leaders accountable .
Instead , Hun Sen invited Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to his government to his home , toasted them with champagne , and called for Cambodians to " bury the past . "
" Hun Sen has spent most of the past 10 years trying to undermine UN efforts to establish a credible tribunal , miring it in delay and fights over jurisdiction , " said Adams .
" Now he is trying to stop a few more cases from being filed . "
Human Rights
Watch said that the impunity enjoyed by the Khmer Rouge has been matched in the post - Khmer Rouge era .
The Vietnamese - backed People 's Republic of Kampuchea , in power from 1979 until 1993 , routinely violated the fundamental rights of Cambodians .
During the UNTAC period in the early 1990s , the United Nations recorded hundreds of killings and attacks by forces under the control of Hun Sen 's Cambodian People 's Party .
On March 30 , 1997 , a grenade attack on an opposition political rally killed at least 16 people and wounded approximately 150 .
Hun Sen 's bodyguard unit has been implicated in the attack .
In July 1997 , Hun Sen staged a coup against his royalist coalition partners in which more than 100 opposition figures were extrajudically killed .
In the 1998 elections , dozens more were killed .
In the past decade , many opposition politicians , journalists , labor leaders and human rights activists have been killed or attacked .
No perpetrator has been held accountable , in spite of the availability of evidence in many of these cases .
" Whether it is for Khmer Rouge crimes or those of more recent times , brutal , well - known perpetrators remain free men , " said Adams .
" Sadly , impunity remains almost complete in Cambodia . "

The new Dredd movie seems to be doing everything right so far —
Jock is one of the most exciting artists to come along in recent years , so I 'm very encouraged to see him doing concept art for the film .
( He 's best known for working with writer Andy Diggle on Losers and 2000 A.D. , but has also worked on Green Arrow : Year One and Hellblazer . )
As Jock himself says , the Dredd concept needs to be redeemed from the 1995 Stallone movie .

[ Standard Attrition ]
With millions of homeowners now struggling to repay money they clearly never should have borrowed , our leaders have been righteously wagging fingers at predatory lenders who allegedly enticed innocent borrowers , and the country , into a financial snake pit .
While the mortgage industry clearly deserves a good share of the blame , unindicted co-conspirators abound .
The ringleaders are still at - large and are , in fact , busy hatching a plan to dwarf the earlier mistakes .
Contrary to the message bouncing off the marble walls of the Capitol , most borrowers in the inflating housing bubble clearly understood the terms of their loans .
Most knew that they could not afford their mortgage payments once their teaser rates expired , but enthusiastically jumped into the debt pool anyway believing that guaranteed real estate appreciation , or a quick and profitable sale , would keep them afloat .
Although both lenders and borrowers were acting in their own perceived self - interest , what can we say of our economic policymakers who are expected to protect the good of all ?
Their actions encouraged the whole sad circus .
Were it not for the excessively low interest rates provided by the Fed , the lax lending standards and moral hazards supplied by Congress courtesy of Freddie , Fannie , and the FHA , and the many real estate subsidies built into the tax code , none of these predatory loans would have been possible .
Had lenders exercised better judgment and had borrowers avoided overly burdensome debt loads , both parties would clearly be in better financial positions today .
Instead , as borrowers were demanding the credit to fuel their dreams of instant real estate riches , lenders were being ordered to accommodate them .

Example of using XMPP on App Engine ( via IMified )
As I mentioned before , App Engine is getting an XMPP API at some point soon .
But if you just ca n’t wait to start adding IM interfaces to your applications then you can do it now , by using a nifty third party in IMified .
IMified provide an incredibly simple HTTP API for interacting with your own IM bot .
If we want to be buzz word compliant we might even call it a webhook .
It ’s also currently a free service while they work through the beta .
The documentation is short and to the point but only contains examples in PHP .
It supports multiple step conversations as well as authentication .
So , armed with a little time on the train over the last few days I got to work knocking together a quick demo application as a proof of concept .
You can find the site on imified - demo.appspot.com and if you want to chat with the bot you can add [ email protected ] to your contacts .
The bot uses the Jabber protocol so is available over Jabber or GTalk .
IMified make it easy to use MSN or Yahoo IM accounts as well , which is something the App Engine API might very well not do I would imagine .
As always you can find the code on GitHub .
Most of the code is actually just the site itself or settings to make local development easier .
The following is a slightly edited version of the live code ( logging and caching removed to make it easier to follow ) .
All we need to do is accept a HTTP Post request with a list of arguments and return a plain text response .
All being well the response is sent as a IM message to the sender .
pre. class IMified ( webapp.RequestHandler ) : “ This is the endpoint for the message from IMified ” def post ( self ) : “ We recieve post data from IMified ” userkey = self.request.get ( ‘ userkey ’) network = self.request.get ( ‘ network ’) msg = self.request.get (‘msg ’) step = self.request.get ( ‘ step ’) try : # we try and create the message message = Message ( userkey = userkey , network = network , msg = msg , step = int( step ) ) message.put ( ) # the response is send as an IM message to the sender self.response.out.write (‘ Message saved ’) except : self.response.out.write(‘ An error ocured , message not saved ’)
I Mified can obviously be used outside App Engine as well , and in fact it ’s not just about working around limitations in existing systems .
Running the long running processes required for bots , and potentially even running your own XMPP server , is fiddly at times and requires at least some setup , monitoring and configuration to get working .
Not having that as a barrier for entry for simple experiments or applications is a good thing .
Aral spoke at the last DJUGL about App Engine and mentioned a wide range of third party services that you can use to get around current limitations .
IMified definitely fits into this group of support services very nicely indeed .
I ’d love to see them do really well as it really makes it much easier to get started with XMPP applications , even if what you can do is limited to a few simple APIs .
I ’d love to hear about other services that people are using in this way to build these distributed applications .
( CNN ) -- Images of chimpanzees on television or in the movies depict cute , cuddly and smart animals .
So it 's no wonder that some people , perhaps those with exotic tastes , may seek them out as pets .
A chimp comes up to the fence to inspect visitors at an animal sanctuary in Fort Pierce , Florida .
Some chimp owners will even dress the animal in diapers and treat them like a doll or a child .
But playing that way with chimps is risking lives , the president of the Humane Society of the United States said .
Wayne Pacelle wants people to know that chimps kill in the wild .
" Their behavior , which is born into them , can come out even if you put the animal in a bed at night , even if you dress them up in a tutu .
They are still wild animals , " he said .
Pacelle 's organization estimates about 15,000 monkeys and other primates are living as either pets or in private zoos .
" As infants they are fascinating , " said Beth Preiss , who directs the organization 's Exotic Pet Campaign .
" But they grow up and become dangerous to manage . "
Just how dangerous was demonstrated Monday when a pet chimp named Travis attacked his owner 's friend in Stamford , Connecticut .
When Sandra Herold could n't pull her nearly 200 - pound chimp off of Charla Nash , she tried to drive him away by stabbing him with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel .
Do n't Miss Chimp attack victim moved to Cleveland Clinic
When that failed to stop the vicious attack , Travis ' owner -- heard on a 911 tape -- asked the police to shoot the chimp in order to stop the attack .
They did and Travis died of gunshot wounds .
The victim of the attack remains hospitalized with extensive injuries to her face and hands .
While being raised by Herold , Travis was treated like a member of the family .
" I cooked for him , I shopped for him , I lived with him , I slept with him , " Herold told WNYW .
Preiss said she believes the only place primates should be sleeping is under the stars .
" When chimps are kept in captivity we think they should be kept in as natural environment as possible , " she said .
One of those seminatural environments for chimps raised in captivity is operated by the nonprofit organization Save The Chimps .
The sanctuary in Fort Pierce , Florida , has several three - acre islands among 200 acres of wilderness where 150 chimpanzees roam free .
The chimps arrive from different types of captivity .
Some are former pets , but there are also some descendants of NASA 's space chimps and some chimps used in labs for medical research .
Watch what life is like for the animals at the sanctuary »
It is the former pets that have the hardest time adjusting , according to Jen Feuerstein , director of operations for Save the Chimps .
" We make them dependent on human beings for their survival , " Feuerstein said .
Travis was 14 years old when he attacked , six years older than the age chimps used for entertainment are usually retired .
They are adorable as babies but " when grown , they are seven times stronger than an adult human and capable of causing some very serious harm , " Feuerstein said .
Herold said she did not have a problem with Travis in the past .
" He did n't have anything but love until this freak accident , " she told WNYW .
Pacelle saw it differently .
" This is a perfectly predictable outcome of an inherently dangerous situation , " he said .
Police in Connecticut say Travis had acted out previously .
The chimp , which was well - known and liked in the community , escaped in 2003 and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours , said Stamford Police Capt .
Rich Conklin .
Pacelle finds it outrageous that some people raise chimps as pets .
" If the owners are stupid enough to allow this animal into their home , they should n't be allowed to jeopardize the rest of the community , " he said .
At least 20 states have laws that make owning a primate illegal .
The Humane Society is asking people to support the passing of The Captive Primate Safety Act , which would prohibit interstate and foreign commerce for primates as pets .
Preiss gave three reasons why chimps should n't be pets .
" One , ( they 're ) too dangerous , two , they can transmit disease , " she said , and third , " they belong in the wild . "
All About Animal Attacks
Feb. 13 , 2009  --
The fertility doctor who helped Nadya Suleman conceive her octuplets also treated a 49 - year - old woman who is carrying quadruplets , according to the Los Angeles Times .
Dr. Michael Kamrava transferred at least seven embryos to the unnamed woman , who is hospitalized at Los Angeles County - USC Medical Center , the Times reported today .
Like Suleman , the woman has been placed on bedrest because of discomfort and to protect the unborn children .
The woman , who is reportedly 20 weeks pregnant , has three other children but was hoping to have one more , according to the Times .
Meanwhile , the California Medical Board is reportedly investigating Kamrava for violating guidelines by implanting too many embryos in women and using unconventional in - vitro fertilization techniques .
Kamrava has previously defended his method , which he said makes it easier for women to conceive .
Dr. John Jain , a reproductive endocrinologist at Santa Monica Fertility Specialists in California , said Kamrava 's technique is " experimental , at best , and very little data exists on the procedure . "
Jain also said a 49 - year - old woman carrying quadruplets poses significant health risk for the mother and the children .
" Not only are there risks to the unborn babies , pre-term delivery and all that goes with it as we learned from the octuplets , but to a 49 - year - old woman the risks mostly relate to her cardiovascular system and these risks are serious , such as stroke and heart attack and even death , " Jain told ABC News .
Who Is Dr. Michael Kamrava ?
Suleman said in an interview this week that a single doctor helped her conceive all 14 of her children .
While she did not reveal the identity of this doctor , a 2006 report by television station KTLA showed a grateful Suleman praising the work of Beverly Hills physician Michael Kamrava .
According to the Web site for the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology , even with his controversial fertility techniques , Kamrava has one of the worst success rates in the country at 10 percent .
The national average is a 39 percent success rate .
Suleman 's mother , Angela Suleman , said she dissuaded one doctor from performing the in - vitro fertilization procedures that led to all 14 births .
" Her dad and I were talking to the doctor and we said ... she 's not married ; she wants children and she really does not have any means to support them and ... she really should n't have more , " she told the news agency Radar Online .
" That 's enough , so he did n't implant anymore embryos and we 're thankful for that .
But then , she went somewhere else and someone else did , so now she has eight more . "
Kamrava , who has refused to talk to the media about the case , has become a central figure in the unfolding drama as critics questioned the ethics of a doctor who provided IVF to a single mother of six that allowed her to have eight more children .
The California medical board is reportedly conducting an investigation to see if the doctor who helped the mother conceive the octuplets violated the standard of care by implanting so many embryos in such a young woman .
Top fertility experts also question his apparent technique of using a camera and catheter to insert embryos , and warn the procedure may actually be dangerous .
Three of Suleman 's Older Children Are Disabled
" Using a camera or scope to transfer embryos has not been scientifically validated to show any benefits , and there is the possibility that it may actually do some harm , " said Dr. Robert Boostanfar of the Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena , Calif .
Three of Suleman 's older children are disabled .
The family receives $ 490 per month in food stamps to help feed them .
Their grandmother provides most of the care for the children who now live with her , her husband and their mother in a small , three - bedroom home .
" I was the main provider , she had no means to support them , " Angela Suleman told Radar Online .
" They were always living in my house .
She 's just not thinking straight . "
In the meantime , Nadya Suleman 's children may prove to be a financial burden not only to her family but to the state of California as well .
Kaiser Permanente , which runs the hospital where the babies are being cared for , is now asking the state to foot the babies ' medical bills , ABC News has learned .
One of the perks of being behind - the - scenes here at SFist is that we get to read all of the angry comments that come after a story has moved away from the home ( or first five ) pages .
Typically they are the of the 4a .m. meth 'd - out variety ( our favorite kind , really ) .
But after a post lingers in purgatory , frequently a MSM news source will pick up on it and it will cull all kinds of fresh voices .
Take , for example , the " Map of Prop 8 Donors " post , which has garnered some news comments as of late .
Comments we 'd like to share with you .
SFist commenter italian415 pounded his ( presumably hairy ) chest yesterday with this gem .
I made a contribution to YES on Prop 8 as well .
I invite any activist , whether they be gay , straight , black , white , whatever , to do what you deem necessary with the information you have been given .
May I warn you , should you trespass or harass me in any way , shape , or form , I will use physicality to force my opinion on you .
I will not hold back .
So come one , come all .
You have got my address , name , and company .
Bring it .
I am always fully stocked , locked , and loaded .
italian415 fails , however , at giving his name or the address to his compound .
And we 're simply dying to see said physicality IRL .
Alas .
When in java land the answer to searching is usually Lucene .
When building a Mac OSX or iPhone application unfortunately the answer is not that simple .
Recently I had the need to build a search index of some data for an iPhone project and was a little surprised about the lack of options .
Again my first thought was Lucene – more specifically the C port of it .
But unfortunately it was abandoned somewhere along the way .
A new try has not even reached the alpha phase .
So what to do ?
Port the Lucene java code to Objective -C ?
That sounded like a bit out of scope for the iPhone project .
I found two options .
LuceneKit
Good someone else already ported Lucene 2.x to Objective - C – for GNUstep though .
But with only little work I got it working for both Mac OSX and the iPhone .
I ’ve forked the official svn repository via git -svn , applied my changes and added some examples for Mac OSX and iPhone .
It ’s available on github .
Here is how you use it .
LCFSDirectory *rd = [ [ LCFSDirectory alloc ] initWithPath : @ " / path/to/index " create : YES ] ; LCSimpleAnalyzer * analyzer = [ [ LCSimpleAnalyzer alloc ] init ] ; LCIndexWriter * writer = [ [ LCIndexWriter alloc ] initWithDirectory : rd analyzer : analyzer create : YES ] ; while ( .. )
{ NSString * content = " ... " LCDocument * doc = [ [ LCDocument alloc ] init ] ; LCField * f1 = [ [ LCField alloc ] initWithName : FIELD_CONTENT
string : content store : LCStore_NO index : LCIndex_Tokenized ] ; LCField * f2 = [ [ LCField alloc ] initWithName : FIELD_ID string : @ " the id " store : LCStore_YES index : LCIndex_NO ] ; [ doc add Field : f1 ] ; [ f1 release ] ; [ doc add Field : f2 ] ; [ f2 release ] ; [ writer addDocument : doc ] ; [ doc release ] ; } [ writer close ] ; [ writer release ] ; [ analyzer release ] ;
The above source code is an example on how to create the index .
Of course that ’s something you should not be doing at runtime ( if possible ) .
Then all you need to do in your application is to open the index in read - only mode .
LCFSDirectory *rd = [ [ LCFSDirectory alloc ] initWithPath : @ " / path/to/index " create : NO ] ;
And you are ready to do some searching .
LCTerm *t = [ [ LCTerm alloc ] initWithField : FIELD_CONTENT text : searchText ] ; LCTermQuery * tq = [ [ LCTermQuery alloc ] initWithTerm : t ] ; LCHits * hits = [ searcher search : tq ] ; LCHitIterator * iterator = [ hits iterator ] ; while ( [ iterator has Next ] ) { LCHit * hit = [ iterator next ] ; NSString * id = [ hit stringForField : FIELD_ID ] ; NSLog ( @ " %@ -> %@ " , hit , id ) ; } int results = [ hits count ] ;
Unfortunately the Objective - C port is still quite alpha .
I ended up having some problems when indexing bigger chunks of data .
It does n’t look like it ’s a really big thing to fix but I did n’t have the time to look into it .
sqlite
So what about using sqlite ?
While it does provide full - text searching the version on the iPhone does not have the feature compiled in .
Bummer !
But no problem – you can just use your own version of sqlite and you are good to go .
I found the easiest way to do this is to download the amalgamation source and add it directly to the Xcode project .
It ’s really just one large .c file .
To enable full - text search all you need to do is to add a define to the head of the file .
#define SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
While you are now ready to go on the iPhone you still need to build the db itself .
For that you also need a sqlite on Mac OSX that supports the virtual table syntax .
Again just use the amalgamation source and build it with
CFLAGS= " - DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3=1 " ./ configure make install
In order to run the new sqlite you need to set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the folder that has the shared libraries ( the libsqlite3. dylib file )
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dylib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
Now you create your SQL that creates and fills the database for you .
Sqlite has a special table syntax for full - search indexes .
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE content_search using FTS3 ( id , content ) ; INSERT INTO content_search VALUES ( ' someid ' , ' content without stopwords ' ) ;
For better performance and efficiency you should remove stopwords first .
sqlite3 content.db < content.sql
So once you have the database files make sure it 's included in your project 's bundle .
That 's where you will open the database from
NSString * filePath = [ [ NSBundle mainBundle ] pathForResource : @" content " of Type : @ " db " ] ;
Then on application launch you prepare the statements
sqlite3 * database ; sqlite3_stmt * statement ; if ( sqlite3_open ([ filePath UTF8String ] , &database ) == SQLITE_OK ) { const char * sql = " select id , snippet ( content , ' [ ' , ' ] ' , '...' ) as extract from content_search where content match ? " ; if ( sqlite3_prepare_v2 ( database , sql , - 1 , &statement , NULL ) != SQLITE_OK ) { NSLog ( @" failed to prepare statement " ) ; } }
that you can then use to search inside the content and step through the result set .
NSString * searchText = " ... " ; sqlite3_bind_text( statement , 1 , [ searchText UTF8String ] , - 1 , SQLITE_TRANSIENT ) ; int success = sqlite3_step ( statement ) ; if ( success == SQLITE_ROW ) { char * str = ( char *)sqlite3_column_text ( statement , 0 ) ; NSLog ( @ " found id ' %s ' " , str ) ; // step for more results } else { NSLog ( @ " not found " ) ; } sqlite3_reset ( statement ) ;
So as a final word : I was really impressed by sqlite .
But the full - text search engine is quite limited .
If you need some more flexibility ( like a different stemmer or search ranking ) LuceneKit might be the way to go .
I bet the fixes are not that hard .
And it would be great to see the code maybe find it's way " back " to the Lucene project .
At least it is already released under Apache License 2.0 .

See photos of 12 strains of Cannabis Therapeutics ' supply at westword.com/slideshow
Behind a locked , unmarked door in a Colorado Springs strip mall , the state 's largest marijuana dispensary is open for business .
The operation 's aromatic showroom is packed floor to ceiling with pot and anything and everything related to it .
" Welcome to Cannabis Therapeutics .
Intended for prescribed medical use only ! " announces a large sign on the wall .
Glass cases display Baggie upon Baggie of pot — 35 varieties in all .
Those looking for cheap medicine can go for the $ 250 - an - ounce , bargain - basement Holland 's
Hope or upgrade to $ 300 - an - ounce Thunderstruck or $ 400 - an - ounce Purple Haze .
Big spenders can opt for top - shelf meds such as a crop of Chocolate Chunk priced at $ 500 an ounce .
It 's all available to buy loose or ready to smoke in pre-rolled blunts .
And , for green thumbs , cloned marijuana seedlings sit in a bubbling tray of water , waiting for the right buyer .
Today an older woman is here buying some Silver Skunk to help ease lingering pain from a shattered right femur she suffered in a car accident , as well as recurring migraines and fibromyalgia .
" I do n't like marijuana , but I have no choice , " she says as she pays part of her $ 136 bill in cash and puts the rest on a debit card .
A mother in a track suit leaves her teenage daughter pouting in the lobby while she shops ; a younger fellow in baggy jeans and a hoodie samples some Mexican True Blue .
A staffer is ready to help newbies who 've just coughed up their $ 25 annual membership fee establish what mixture of sativa and indica , the two core strains of medical marijuana , is appropriate for their particular illness .
For multiple sclerosis , it 's best to go with a cross breed that 's at least 65 percent indica , known for its relaxing physical high .
Sufferers of debilitating stress , on the other hand , typically opt for sativa , which provides more of a mental high .
To administer the medicine , there is a smorgasbord of colorful glass pipes and bongs available , courtesy of a Manitou Springs glass blower .
For those who do n't want to smoke their determined dosage , there are vaporizers to help clients inhale it , as well as THC pills , THC oils , THC butter , THC fudge , ice cream , bubble gum , hot chocolate mix , cheese , fountain drinks , roll - on pain relievers and bubble bath .
Stashed away in a cabinet are jars filled with marijuana marinating in Don Julio and Cazadores tequila .
" It 's not about getting high , " says Michael Lee , the owner of Cannabis Therapeutics .
" It 's about getting medicated . "
Lee founded the operation three years ago under the auspices of Colorado 's Amendment 20 .
The constitutional amendment — approved by voters in 2000 — allows people with cancer , glaucoma , HIV , AIDS , muscle spasms , severe pain , severe nausea and other medical conditions to use marijuana .
With a recommendation from a licensed Colorado doctor , patients can obtain a state - issued Medical Marijuana Registry identification card to show to police — though it does nothing to change the fact that the federal government still considers marijuana illegal .
Patients may cultivate their own medicine or designate a primary caregiver to provide it for them .
Lee and his colleagues at Cannabis Therapeutics , for example , are designated caregivers to more than 600 patients around the state .
This arrangement has proved lucrative : Lee , 44 , says his dispensary earns about $ 105,000 a month , $ 75,000 of which he says goes back out the door for more monthly product .
This onetime owner of a Colorado Springs flooring company insists , however , that his current occupation is more than a business .
" I clinically died .
I can't lie .
I wo n't lie , " he declares , gesturing to a faded news clipping on the wall .
It describes a car crash years ago in Santa Barbara , California , in which a young passenger was killed , and notes that " the driver , Michael Lee , 19 , suffered head and internal injuries , and his condition is listed as critical . "
After being clinically dead for 41 minutes and spending eleven days in a coma , he turned to marijuana for healing .
Years later , lingering pain and muscle spasms led Lee , who is also a member of local mega- churches New Life and Radiant , to become one of Colorado 's first certified medical marijuana patients , and he soon found himself helping other people who used marijuana for pain and illness .
Now there 's no more established operation around for getting medicated .
Lee has signed contracts with seven Colorado growers — all legal under Amendment 20 , he promises , because they 're registered caregivers for some of his patients .
Each grower provides him with roughly a pound and a half of dried marijuana per month .
Cannabis Therapeutics is also insured , says Lee , who convinced his insurance agency to design a dispensary policy just for him .
He also has a good relationship with the Colorado Springs police , having invited them in for a tour in 2006 after the cops caught wind of the operation .
" It was very educational , " says Lieutenant Catherine Buckley of the visit .
" It was not something the officers see on a daily basis . "
When the Environmental Protection Agency poked around in response to a complaint about alleged chemical dumping , they could n't find a single health or safety violation .
All in all , says Lee , who goes by the nickname " the Herbologist " on websites like www.rollitup.org and www.weedtracker.com, everything here is square with Amendment 20 .
After all , his lawyer , Warren Edson , co-authored the law .
That leaves Lee in the center of a booming state industry .
The number of patients who 've received a medical marijuana ID card recently crested 5,000 , twice what it was a year ago .
And while it's hard to determine the absolute number of active dispensaries , there are at least two dozen , along with clinics dedicated to helping people obtain marijuana ID cards , lawyers and tax attorneys hanging shingles as authorities in pot law , even an ad hoc university churning out potential new dispensary owners and employees .
" In the last year , it is my understanding that the number of dispensaries in Colorado has grown from two to about thirty , " says Keith Stroup , founder of the national pot lobbying group NORML .
" Without question , there are more medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado than in any state other than California . "
But the cottage industry is fraught with problems .
Many doctors refuse to recommend marijuana , in part because possessing and smoking pot is still a federal offense , while a bad few could be exploiting the medical marijuana laws for financial gain .
As an unregulated and gray - area industry , there are also inconsistent practices , high prices , oversized egos , safety concerns and possible black - market involvement — not to mention disregard , if not outright hostility , from law enforcement and city officials .
A major change could be on the way .
On March 18 , the Colorado Board of Health — the advisory board for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment — will consider new medical marijuana regulations .
Along with expanding Medical Marijuana Registry application requirements , the proposal would require caregivers to offer additional services to their patients besides providing them with pot .
Most significant would be the reinstatement of a five - patient - per - caregiver limit the state health board put in place after Amendment 20's passage , a restriction that deterred the growth of Colorado dispensaries until it was overturned in Denver District Court in 2007 .
The new rules " could have an impact on the large - scale operations , " says Ron Hyman , registrar of vital statistics for the CDPHE .
" I would say it probably will . "
The changes could make business more difficult for Lee — but by that point , he may have already moved on .
When an anonymous caller threatened to kidnap his young son several months ago , it was one frustration too many .
Lee moved his family , got a German shepherd to guard his son and started thinking about selling his dispensary .
" I 'm done .
I do n't care anymore .
I 've seen a dark side to this , " fumes Lee .
" I clinically died .
I demand life to be fair ! "
His face turns crimson and his temper bubbles to the surface .
Exasperated , he decides to let off some steam .
Excusing himself for a minute , he gestures to an employee to fetch him his foot - long Technicolor pipe .
" I 'm gonna go medicate . "
For a bunch of supposedly lazy stoners , Colorado 's marijuana activists are a committed bunch .
At 9 a.m. on a recent Saturday , hundreds of people gathered at Regis University in northwest Denver for the Colorado Marijuana Reform Seminar and Activist Boot Camp .
" I think this speaks volumes about our movement , " Brian Vicente , executive director of the drug- policy reform organization Sensible Colorado , told the group .
There were nicely dressed middle - aged folks , older couples in knitted sweaters and younger guys wearing backpacks decorated with Grateful Dead patches .
A full day of activities lay ahead : sessions on lobbying strategies and media relations , plus panels featuring Denver City Councilman Chris Nevitt , Colorado State Representative Paul Weissmann and Colorado ACLU Legal Director Mark Silverstein .
Lunch would feature sandwiches donated by Cheba Hut , a restaurant chain offering its signature " ' Toasted ' Subs " in Boulder and Fort Collins .
And just so everybody knows , Vicente reminded the group , " This is a non-smoking workshop .
We are here to change the laws , not break the laws . "
Vicente and his colleagues have big plans for Colorado , building on years of victories .
In 2005 , Denver became one of the first cities in the country to have its voters " decriminalize " marijuana by making it legal for people over 21 to possess up to an ounce of it .
Two years later , the city 's voters agreed that law enforcement should make adult marijuana possession its lowest priority .
Part of the plan today is to strategize about ways to pass similar initiatives in other Colorado communities .
While an attempt to pass a state law decriminalizing up to an ounce of marijuana failed in 2006 , activists here believe it 's only a matter of time before such legislation passes .
" This will be the nail in the coffin of the drug war , " Vicente continued .
" Colorado will be seen as the place that ended the government 's ninety - year prohibition of marijuana . "
It all started with Amendment 20 .
The law allows a person suffering from certain illnesses or that individual 's caregiver to possess up to two ounces of marijuana or six marijuana plants , but it does n't specify much about the relationship between patients and caregivers .
To help fill in the holes , in 2004 the CDPHE developed a five - patient maximum for caregivers , says Hyman .
" We were trying to determine how many patients a caregiver could provide for that would be significant and reasonable , " he explains .
But when Chief Denver District Judge Larry Naves suspended that limit in 2007 because it lacked public input , caregivers were allowed to take on as many patients — and their marijuana quotients — as they liked , even make a business out of it .
That , it turns out , was part of the plan all along for Amendment 20 , the only medical marijuana law in the nation that 's a constitutional amendment .
" The plan was to write it into our constitution so it could n't be tweaked , " says Edson , the law 's co-author .
" There is a reason there are no limits to the number of people you can be a caregiver for .
There is a reason a caregiver is n't specifically designated as a doctor or a nurse .
It is left open to a broad range of individuals . "
For one thing , if doctors were responsible for actually providing patients with marijuana , the federal government might retaliate by revoking their Drug Enforcement Administration - issued licenses , which allow them to prescribe narcotics .
Furthermore , Edson had noticed the inklings of a dispensary industry developing in California , whose open - ended 1996 medical marijuana law led to an industry there that now boasts hundreds of such businesses .
He decided that an entrepreneurial take on medical marijuana would encourage product diversity , innovative practices and competitive prices , all to the benefit of patients .
" I like to see some of these places where a patient has some options , " he says .
" Where it 's not just one guy in his basement with one type of medicine . "
So while other states included impediments to dispensaries in their medical marijuana laws or eventually had lawmakers implement such restrictions , in Colorado the free - market approach was allowed to flourish .
The results were evident at the activist boot camp .
In a side room , staffers in vendor booths handed out brochures and business cards for dispensary operations , not to mention marijuana - friendly medical clinics and drug - law - savvy lawyers .
Denver real - estate broker Michael Griffin says he 's recently picked up three clients , all looking to open 1,500 - to 3,000 - square - foot dispensaries in the area : " People are noticing it as a viable business .
Once it 's legal , I think it 's no different than a liquor store . "
Michelle LaMay has also found a niche .
Last fall , the longtime Denver activist launched " Cannabis University , " a day - long , $ 250 program that gives students a run-down on marijuana laws and growing practices .
It 's for patients wanting to produce their own medicine , and a mini-MBA for those wishing to break into the business .
" I 'm hoping the vast number of caregivers and dispensaries will have to hire some people .
And maybe they will hire our students , " she says .
While they go by different names , dispensaries or caregiver cooperatives operate under roughly the same model .
Patients who wish to buy pot must designate that operation as their primary caregiver on their medical marijuana license by filling out a state health department application .
Since the law does n't say where the pot has to come from , dispensaries can theoretically pick it up anywhere : indoor grow rooms overseen by a dispensary 's owner or employees ; out - of - sight backyard gardens tended by patients ; middlemen hawking stuff from large , clandestine outfits squirreled away in the mountains or in networks of fluorescent - lit basements .
According to Amendment 20 , the marijuana is legal as soon as it gets into a patient or caregiver 's hands , so no need to ask too much about its provenance .
Many dispensaries operate quietly , relying on word of mouth , while a few advertise openly .
If Edson 's predictions are correct , local dispensary owners could eventually be servicing a statewide client base of 50,000 registered patients .
" It 's a full - on gold rush , " says Paul Saurini , producer of Marijuana Radio , a weekly pot - themed radio podcast recorded in a slick studio in the Santa Fe Arts District and broadcast in many a dispensary .
" People are rushing here to make a buck .
I 'm not saying it 's good or bad , but I think it 's a fascinating moment for the movement . "
To get a Colorado Medical Marijuana ID card , Colorado residents first need a doctor who will recommend them for the confidential state registry .
And to get that recommendation , many patients turn to the Hemp and Cannabis Foundation in Wheat Ridge .
Of the 5,000 people on the registry , about 2,700 relied on its services .
One of those is Sandra , who 's been on the registry since 2005 , but who , like all medical marijuana patients , has to go through the state 's annual renewal process .
That means another visit to the foundation 's 1,500 - square - foot , third - floor office in a professional building on Wadsworth Boulevard .
Sandra , her pigtails streaked with gray , sits in a solemn , bare - walled waiting room surrounded by people filling out paperwork or watching a marijuana video on TV .
It 's a scene that 's playing out in similar waiting rooms across the country : the nonprofit , known as the THC Foundation , also has clinics in medical marijuana - friendly states like Oregon , Washington , Hawaii , Montana , California , Nevada and Michigan .
Eventually , Sandra is called into the office of Eric Eisenbud , a lanky Colorado ophthalmologist .
Before Eisenbud has a chance to review Sandra 's history — her multiple sclerosis diagnosis in 1995 , her MS - related leg spasms that qualify her for medical marijuana , and the recent discovery that she has degenerative disc disease in her spine — Sandra blurts out , " Thank you for being here for us . "
She 's well aware how hard it is to find a doctor who will recommend patients for the registry .
Before she found the THC Foundation in 2006 , she asked her primary care physician to recommend her for medical marijuana — and says the doctor nearly threw her out .
Eisenbud 's heard hard - luck stories like this before .
" My feeling is that a large number of doctors in Colorado are open - minded , but they 've been misinformed , " he says later .
Much of the confusion and apprehension in the medical community stems from the fact that after Amendment 20 passed , then - attorney general Ken Salazar warned doctors that they could face federal charges if they participated in the program .
It does n't help that the Colorado Medical Society has n't taken a stance and that the American Medical Association has said it wo n't recognize the medical use of marijuana without further studies .
( Other prominent medical groups , such as the American College of Physicians and the British Medical Association , have endorsed the idea of medical marijuana . )
Many doctors play it safe by not dabbling in marijuana at all .
At Denver Health Medical Center , physicians are allowed to write letters to help patients get registered , says hospital spokeswoman Dee Martinez .
But patient Eric Easter counters that notion , saying his doctors refused to recommend him for the state registry : " They said they do n't do this even if you were dying of AIDS . "
" That 's where we come in , " says Paul Stanford , the Portland - based founder of the THC Foundation .
" When we first moved into Colorado , in 2006 , there were only 700 medical marijuana cards statewide . "
Now , three years later , the Wheat Ridge clinic sees about seventy new patients a week , says Scott Carr , the foundation 's regional manager in Colorado .
Carr also believes the foundation has helped the medical community warm up to medical marijuana .
According to the state , more than 500 doctors have now signed for patients here , and some insurance carriers cover THC Foundation visits .
" I 've had HMO nurses call and ask what the best vaporizer is for patients to buy , " says Carr .
The clinic even has a competitor — an operation called CannaMed that opened in Denver offering similar services .
CannaMed representatives did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment .
But the THC Foundation also has at least one critic : its former doctor on duty , Shawn Elke Glazer .
" They 're all about making as much money as possible until marijuana gets legalized , " says Glazer , a former Libertarian candidate for state representative who now runs the Colorado Green Cross medical clinic in Wheat Ridge .
She believes the THC Foundation signs up as many people as possible so they 'll fork over the $ 200 visit fee , whether they warrant medical marijuana or not .
The fact that a marijuana dispensary now operates in the same building as the foundation raises red flags as well , since it could put the clinic in violation of a 2003 Supreme Court ruling saying that doctors can't assist patients in obtaining marijuana .
Stanford calls that nonsense , but Glazer is n't the only one who has questioned the foundation 's motives .
In 2005 , the Oregon justice department began looking into the Portland - based nonprofit for potential IRS violations , such as a $ 100,000 reimbursement it made to Stanford .
" It 's an ongoing thing .
It has caused a little extra scrutiny , but it has n't caused any problems whatsoever , " Stanford says .
Carr notes that the Wheat Ridge clinic only works with patients who have medical records proving they qualify for the state law and turns away those who do n't .
He also adamantly denies association with any dispensary , including the one that operates in the same building .
The owners of that business , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , concur that there 's no connection .
Sandra has no complaints about the THC Foundation , and she 'll follow it when it relocates to bigger digs near Speer Boulevard and I - 25 .
Yes , the cost of the visit on top of the $ 90 annual state registration fee is n't easy on her budget , especially since she spends about $ 300 a month on marijuana .
Still , she 's grateful for its existence : " Thank goodness the service is here and it 's helping me .
This place is safe . "
In the past , she did n't feel so safe obtaining her medicine .
In 2005 , before the THC Foundation opened , she went to a Loveland doctor who charged her more than $ 400 for the service .
Then , to get marijuana , she relied on an operation run out of a former Denver church called the Colorado Compassion Club .
The club operated at night and had armed guards at the doors , Sandra says .
" There were all these people , and I did n't feel safe at all .
It was like being in a bread line . "
After that , Sandra was referred to Ken Gorman , a well - known Denver pot activist and one - time write - in candidate for governor .
" I do n't have my medical certification up to date , " she remembers telling Gorman when she reached him by phone .
" Are you sick ? " he replied .
" That 's all I need to know . "
" Here was someone I 'd never met , and he was so kind to me , " says Sandra , who decided to make him her caregiver .
She never got a chance to follow through .
That weekend , on February 17 , 2007 , Gorman was shot and killed in his home .
Gorman 's death , which is still unsolved , sent shockwaves through the medical marijuana community .
It also created a vacuum that permanently changed the industry in Colorado .
Today there are storefront operations like Cannabis Medical , the Healing Center , North Reasonable Access Denver , Denver Patients Caregivers Cooperative and the Kind Room , and delivery services like Confidential Caregivers Unlimited and the Organic Medicine Club .
Among them are settings to suit every taste , from dorm - room - like operations with mismatched thrift - store furniture and mega - sized posters of killer kind bud to dentist - office - like venues complete with cushy couches and bubbling aquariums .
Because state law does n't explicitly sanction dispensaries , the businesses try to protect themselves by making sure that everyone involved is either a patient or a caregiver .
" Most of their employees are patients themselves and are listed caregivers for some of these people , " Edson says .
" And most of the dispensary owners are listed as caregivers for some of the people .
But the equivalent of a pharmacy just does n't exist under the amendment . "
That 's why dispensary owners typically consult with a cadre of lawyers , squirrel away documentation listing their patients and are reluctant to talk to the press .
" We hate to be this evasive , " says Daniel Tsirlin , co-owner of Alternative Medicine of Southeast Denver , a newly opened dispensary .
" Why not let people know ?
On the other hand , you do n't want to be the first to do anything .
Be the second . "
That 's a good approach , judging by the comments of Jeff Sweetin , special agent in charge of the Rocky Mountain field division of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
" We are investigating some dispensaries throughout this region , " Sweetin says , without giving specifics .
" The DEA investigates large , well - organized , well - funded organizations .
Some of these dispensaries rise to that level . "
Sweetin is concerned that elements of the medical marijuana scene are tied up with organized crime , in part because Amendment 20 does n't include rules about where dispensaries can buy their pot .
Early last year , authorities busted a multimillion - dollar marijuana ring involving dozens of indoor grow operations in the north metro region — and Sweetin believes there 's a connection to the medical marijuana scene .
" It 's the largest , most organized indoor grow operation I have ever seen , " he says .
" I do n't believe that 's coincidence .
I believe they purposely moved that operation to Colorado . "
For the most part , however , he says the dispensaries are the problem of local and state agencies — and so far , no one seems to know exactly what to do about them .
Police officers are frustrated by trying to differentiate between illegal drug users and state - certified patients and caregivers , says Captain William Nagle of Denver 's Vice and Drug Control Bureau , especially since the only time state health employees can verify certifications is during weekday business hours — not the most conducive time for drug cops .
When mistaken raids have occurred , judges have sometimes demanded that law enforcement return the confiscated marijuana and paraphernalia — though police say that by doing so , they could be breaking federal law themselves .
Dispensary owners have grievances , too .
While they operate without problem in Denver , other cities have n't been as welcoming .
Former Aurora dispensary owner John Chipman says he was hardly up and running before he was run out of town because a city ordinance there did n't allow businesses to operate in violation of federal law .
" They said they do n't have pit bulls , they do n't have massage parlors and they do n't want any dispensaries , " he says .
Others have problems with crime .
Last November , Fort Collins dispensary owner James Masters told reporters that his operation had been burglarized or vandalized nine times in a month .
While Masters could n't be reached for comment , several sources claim these crimes were part of a rash of medical marijuana robberies — including , according to Carr , an attempted break - in at the THC Foundation .
Patients have their own complaints , grumbling that the current business climate is filled with grandstanding and ego clashes , slapdash practices and exorbitant prices .
There 's no easy way for them to shop around to find better options , however , since they 're required to designate only one caregiver .
Officials , law enforcement , caregivers and patients can agree on one thing :
The industry should be regulated .
They say they'd like to see consistent health standards and better communication between police , government agencies and medical marijuana operations , not to mention dispensary - specific rules and licenses .
But since Amendment 20 is written into the Constitution , there 's no easy way to tweak the law without a vote of the people , not to mention courting antagonism from either the state 's growing medical marijuana community or the federal government .
" The reason you do n't have clear and positive regulatory enforcement is that a lot of entities are afraid to piss off the feds by setting up any kind of regulatory environment , " says Matthew Kumin , a San Francisco attorney who consults for numerous California dispensaries .
" You have something that should be happening more but is n't because of fear . "
Michael Lee runs his soil - dusted hands under the faucet at Cannabis Therapeutics .
He 's spent the morning planting new strains of marijuana seedlings in a grow room , preparing for his next big endeavor .
He just got a call finalizing his purchase of $ 20,000 worth of dirt that he 'll use to fill a 30 - foot - by - 97 - foot plot of land he 's obtained at an undisclosed spot along the Front Range .
Eventually , he says , he 'll ask United States Department of Agriculture officials to inspect the site , since his plan is to grow certified organic marijuana .
That way , even if he does sell Cannabis Therapeutics , he 'll still be involved with producing medicine for it and other dispensaries .
He 'll also continue to operate Genovations Laboratories , the research - and - development company for marijuana - infused products that he runs out of a secure warehouse space near Cannabis Therapeutics .
There , thanks to an expensive extraction machine and a full - scale chemistry lab , he 's pulling THC out of plants and inserting it into tinctures , foods , maybe someday into self - replicating yeast .
" I can medicate your hot dogs , " he says .
" I can medicate your hamburgers . "
And while Lee may shift his business focus away from his dispensary , he and other owners say the proposed new regulations wo n't go through without a fight .
" We 're probably going to rent buses .
We are going to try to get 1,000 patients there , " says Edson of the March 18 Colorado Board of Health hearing .
" I 've been dealing with these [ medical marijuana ] folks for ten - plus years .
I do n't think the attorney general 's office and the health department appreciates what is about to happen . "
The health department 's Hyman understands that the meeting will be " energetic . "
The point , he says , is to include as many people as possible in the process , which is what Judge Naves said the department did n't do when he struck down the five - person - per caregiver rule in 2007 .
Lee believes it will take another vote to make changes to Amendment 20 , and despite his talk of selling Cannabis Therapeutics , he has many more plans .
A few doors down from the dispensary , he 's opened a patient activity resource center , where , amid a pool table , a massage chair and a cappuccino machine , patients meet with caregivers and receive alternative treatments for their conditions .
" It ca n't just be about weed , " he says .
" You 're going to see more places like this once the bar is set , because the state will say places like this can stay open while others have to close . "
And he has even bigger dreams for the day marijuana becomes legal for everyone :
A gentlemen's club , ready from day one , with prices starting at $ 500 an ounce .
After all , he says with a grin as he reaches for his bowl , " Why should n't I be a household name ? "
Those pictures which you will see are from some old playground .
Maybe on some of those you were played while you was a kid .
It ’s sad how some playgrounds can be like those .
Call it misplaced loyalty or misplaced partisanship , but Senator Ted Stevens , a Republican of Alaska , is holding a razor - thin edge with voters despite his conviction last month on seven felony counts of violating federal ethics laws .
After being pronounced guilty by a jury , Mr. Stevens went around telling Alaskans that he had “ not been convicted of anything yet ”  a fatuous distortion rooted in the technicality that he has not yet been sentenced .
That did n’t wash with his party ’s presidential nominee , Senator John McCain , who called on Mr. Stevens to resign forthwith .
And it should n’t wash with the rest of the Senate .
The final tally could take two weeks .
As of Wednesday , Mr. Stevens was leading by about 3,400 votes over his Democratic opponent , Mark Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , with 50,000 absentee ballots still to be counted .
Mr. Stevens is determined to maintain his 1 percent edge and claim vindication , not disgrace .
Still , Jennifer Daskal , senior counterterrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch , said , “ It would be contrary to the principles of the criminal justice system for the attorney general to say he believes a very serious crime has been committed and then to do nothing about it . ”
Charles D. Stimson , who served as the Defense Department ’s top official on detainee affairs from 2004 to 2007 and is now a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said the statements “ certainly will increase the pressure on Holder to mount some kind of investigation . ”
In addition to domestic political pressures , the United States appears to have a legal obligation as a party to the international Convention against Torture to follow up on the torture statements .
That treaty requires signatory states to conduct a “ prompt and impartial investigation , wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction . ”
The Bush administration placed its interrogation operations offshore , at the American base in Cuba and at secret C.I.A. sites , and officials have sometimes argued that they were not on territory under American jurisdiction .
But that assertion has been eroded by court decisions concerning the Guantánamo detention center , and it is unlikely that the Obama administration would use such a loophole to avoid the torture convention ’s effect .
“ There ’s a moral , legal and practical obligation of the United States to follow this allegation in good faith wherever it leads , ” said Juan E. Méndez , a veteran human rights lawyer who is president of the International Center for Transitional Justice in New York .
Where such an inquiry might lead is an unsettling question for departing Bush administration officials , who have long worried that aggressive policies could make them vulnerable to civil or criminal liability .
If rank - and - file interrogators are protected by the Justice Department ’s assurance that their actions were legal , what about the lawyers who gave the assurances ?
What about the senior officials , including President Bush , who approved the use of waterboarding and other such tactics ?
At the end of a pretty tumultuous week for Gordon Brown , Lord Burns 's critique of the banks went unnoticed .
But his evidence to a committee was more significant than some of the other brouhaha at the Palace of Westminster - and may yet come back to haunt Downing Street .
Burns , the former Treasury permanent secretary , criticised the banking regulation that he had - reluctantly - helped to introduce when Labour came to power in 1997 .
Burns said the tripartite structure covering the Bank of England , the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority , had not properly overlapped - with the result that failed business models in British banking were not spotted .
He also said the system was insufficiently transparent and in the initial stages of the crisis led to uncertainty of responsibility .
He said the tighter system of bank regulation in Spain had been far more effective in controlling dangerous expansion and regulating off balance sheet securities , the source of the much of the British banking crisis .
His remarks to a Lords economic affairs committee will add to the pressure on the prime minister as he dodges to avoid being made culpable for the banking crisis .
The failures will not go away - and they were highlighted again this week by what happened at HBOS .
There lack of communication between the FSA and the Treasury over repeated warnings concerning the bank .
Yet the government appointed its former chief executive Sir James Crosby to become FSA vice - chairman in 2006 .
He was forced to resign suddenly this Wednesday amid claims that he had been dismissive of excessive risk - taking .
The Conservatives are increasingly convinced that the flaws in the regulatory system will become the achilles heel in Brown 's claim that the British recession was caused almost exclusively by the sub - prime mortgage debacle in the US - a claim he restated at a question and answer session yesterday in Coventry .
But the shadow chancellor , George Osborne , believes the trail of responsibility for this crisis is now heading inexorably to Brown 's door .
Nevertheless , it was fortunate for Brown that when Burns gave his evidence earlier this week , reporters were swarming elsewhere in Westminster , hearing four former bank bosses give their abject apologies for driving the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS into the ground .
The questioning of Burns may have been gently done , and the answers couched in the understated tones of the upper house , but nonetheless the overall effect was highly damaging to the government 's defence .
In 1997 he had acted as a fraught intermediary between Brown and the Bank of England 's Eddie George over the decision to strip the bank 's supervisory structure .
Burns wrote the memorandum of understanding between bank , Treasury and the FSA , admitting in his evidence it had been his task to try to resolve some very serious tensions over their respective responsibilities .
He argued that paradoxically in the light of recent events :
" The new system had been set up on the basis of a Treasury instinct that the Bank of England was always too ready to rescue banks .
This was a view that ran quite strongly through the walls of the Treasury and therefore much of the arrangements set up , and the division of responsibilities , were designed to make it just a little more difficult for the Bank to get involved in this . "
Discussing the start of the credit crisis , he said : " I do n't think anybody quite anticipated a system where it would be the Bank of England dragging its feet as lender of the last resort , and there was a period when I felt possibly the Treasury was not as much in charge of this process as it would have been under the old arrangements .
There was a period from the beginning when they had some difficulty in using the mechanisms that had been set up . "
At one point , he sounded wistful of the arrangements that had been in place before . " I look back to the world when it was just the Treasury and the Bank of England .
It had been working for a very long time .
" At every level of the two organisations , people met on a very regular basis and if there were differences of opinion , a sense of accommodation was reached usually relatively quickly .
Having a third member into this seems , if anything , to have slowed down the process in the early stages of cooperation . "
He also criticised the lack of transparency in the new system , saying the process was obscure and adding that it would help if the minutes of the senior tripartite committee were published .
He also doubted if the committee often met .
The decision to take the issue of City regulation away from the Bank , he said , meant it was hard to staff up two institutions to have the skills and the background waiting for when a crisis started to build .
Burns is neither an oracle , or a totally neutral observer .
But it will be No 10's concern that as the recession unwinds , and two select committee inquiries complete their reports into British banking supervision , the issues he raised will gain ever wider currency .
If Brown could only admit some role in the emergence of the crisis , he would be in a stronger political position .
But so long as he suggests a perfect regulatory system was struck down purely by a US contagion , the criticisms of authoritative figures such as Burns will ring ever louder come election time .
To hell with IE6 ?
More like to hell with “ good enough ” Friday , February 13th , 2009 at 1:17 pm
Lately a lot of bloggers have started venting their frustration on IE6 - Robert Nyman got the ball rollling , Roger Johannson enforced the argument and now Ara Pehlivanian chimes in .
The general consensus is that people should stop making things work pixel - perfect for IE6 at the cost of delaying projects or adding cruft to the code .
This brings on fond memories of Jeffrey Zeldman ’s To Hell With Bad Browsers and WaSP ’s browser upgrade campaign which was great ( although I always considered the javelin thrower a bit creepy ) but like then it makes you wonder who we are talking to with these campaigns .
As I pointed out in my comment on Ara ’s post I thoroughly support the sentiment but consider it misguided :
As much as I would love to see IE6 being taken out into the garden and beaten by kids with sticks before being set on fire , I ’d say there is a lot of fallacy in the argument that we as web developers have much say in the matter .
Of course users have the choice to use any other browser , but the sad fact is that IE6 prevails in environments where users do n’t have the option to upgrade their browser as IT defines what software is on the computer .
These are the same companies that block Facebook and Flickr as it distracts people from “ doing real work ” .
The “ good enough ” syndrome
Actually this to me is a symptom of a bigger cause , one that I call the “ good enough ” syndrome .
That ’s the thing that keeps us from improving a lot of working environments : people are happy to use a half - baked solution that does n’t require any additional work instead of keeping their setup up - to - date .
Not everybody is as enthusiastic about IT as we are and in most cases computers are a tool to reach a goal .
That is the same for us but in a lot of cases the users simply do n’t want to be bored with details .
Instead they just want to use the damn thing .
It does n’t matter how convoluted and braindead a process to get where they need to get is – once learned , this is the way to go and it is easy to repeat this every time it has to be done .
Learning an easier way or trying out a different technology is extra work and seems superfluous – the time for the braindead task is already allocated and there is no point in shifting the interaction with that computer thing around .
Paper trail conditioning
You get the same happenings in companies and when it comes to paperwork .
A lot of steps in internal processes or in ordering forms are completely redundant – ludicrous even .
But as they are the way that things have to be done and questioning them means more work and “ rocking the boat ” we stick to them .
There must be a reason for them , after all , right ?
We do n’t work with idiots , there must be some good reason for all these redundant steps .
We could ask for those reasons but that is too much work – after all we need this time to follow all these steps that have to be done , right ?
Keeping the saw blunt – computers do n’t evolve , right ?
As computers are magical and too hard to understand there is also not much sense in questioning the status quo : whatever they use at work must be the best thing there is as we work with professionals .
As geeks we like to push the boundaries of our toys and use them for all kind of cool things .
Most of all we like to tinker with the toy itself which gets us far too close to the subject matter .
A lot of of other users out there however see it as a tool to either get work done or to be entertained .
My favourite example is my brother : he wanted a computer to do some graphical work , to write reports for his job and to play games .
Having these three tasks of course he needed a Windows machine as all his colleagues had one and can lend him games to try out .
He also spends most of his time trying out new virus scanning tools and firewalls as all his colleagues tell him about all the evil viruses out there .
Last time I checked his machine there were 3 virus scanners and 2 firewalls running and he wondered why the computer is so slow and why he needed yet another video card to run a new game .
I bought him a Wii and introduced him to Macs and Linux , but that ’s not on as the latter two do n’t run games and there is no Word for it .
All in all the setup is “ good enough ” as he is not a professional and it allows him to do what he wants to do .
That there are easier and better ways out there is neither here nor there , it took long enough to get the hang of it and other things will be harder to learn , after all everybody uses this setup and is protected by Virus scanners – it has to be the right one .
That many people can not be wrong .
The good enough syndrome manifests itself in a milder form of Stockholm Syndrome where people start defending the terrible solutions and complex processes with claws and teeth instead of keeping an open mind and trying out something new .

The achievement of Captain Chesley Sullenberger in getting his plane down safely has astonished pilots and aviation experts .
Rory Cellan - Jones reports .
On Saturday , Barack Obama pledged the largest new investment in roads and bridges since President Dwight D. Eisenhower built the Interstate system in the 1950's .
Obama unveils 21st Century New Deal
President - elect Barack Obama added sweep and meat to his economic agenda on Saturday , pledging the largest new investment in roads and bridges since President Dwight D. Eisenhower built the Interstate system in the late 1950s , and tying his key initiatives – education , energy , health care –back to jobs in a package that has the makings of a smaller and modern version of FDR's New Deal marriage of job creation with infrastructure upgrades .
The president - elect also said for the first time that he will “ launch the most sweeping effort to modernize and upgrade school buildings that this country has ever seen . ”
Advertisement
“ We will repair broken schools , make them energy - efficient , and put new computers in our classrooms , ” he said in the address .
The president - elect is bringing new elements of his domestic agenda into his economic recovery plan , committing to a path toward giving every American access to an electronic medical record as part of an “ economic recovery plan ... that wo n’t just save jobs , it will save lives . ”
Obama had talked in the campaign about lowering health care costs by investing in electronic information technology systems , but not in the context of the economy .
Now , his key initiatives – education , energy , health care – are all being tied back to jobs .
“ When Congress reconvenes in January , I look forward to working with them to pass a plan immediately , ” Obama says in the address .
“ We need to act with the urgency this moment demands to save or create at least two and a half million jobs so that the nearly two million Americans who ’ve lost them know that they have a future .
And that ’s exactly what I intend to do as president of the United States . ”
Obama had committed just before Thanksgiving to saving or creating 2.5 million jobs in the next two years , more than twice his campaign promise of 1 million new jobs over an unspecified period .
But he did n’t say how he would do it .
On Saturday , he began to spell it out , offering " five key parts " of his economic plan :
— ENERGY : “ [ W ]e will launch a massive effort to make public buildings more energy - efficient .
Our government now pays the highest energy bill in the world .
We need to change that .
We need to upgrade our federal buildings by replacing old heating systems and installing efficient light bulbs .
That wo n’t just save you , the American taxpayer , billions of dollars each year .
It will put people back to work . ”
— ROADS AND BRIDGES : “ [ W ]e will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s .
We ’ll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways , and we ’ll set a simple rule – use it or lose it .
If a state does n’t act quickly to invest in roads and bridges in their communities , they ’ll lose the money . ”
— SCHOOLS : “ [ M ]y economic recovery plan will launch the most sweeping effort to modernize and upgrade school buildings that this country has ever seen .
We will repair broken schools , make them energy - efficient , and put new computers in our classrooms .
Because to help our children compete in a 21st century economy , we need to send them to 21st century schools . ”
— BROADBAND : “ As we renew our schools and highways , we ’ll also renew our information superhighway .
It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption .
Here , in the country that invented the Internet , every child should have the chance to get online , and they ’ll get that chance when I ’m president – because that ’s how we ’ll strengthen America ’s competitiveness in the world . ”
( Incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had talked about expanding broadband access , but this is the first time the transition has formally proposed it . )
— ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS : “ In addition to connecting our libraries and schools to the Internet , we must also ensure that our hospitals are connected to each other through the Internet .
That is why the economic recovery plan I ’m proposing will help modernize our health care system – and that wo n’t just save jobs , it will save lives .
We will make sure that every doctor ’s office and hospital in this country is using cutting edge technology and electronic medical records so that we can cut red tape , prevent medical mistakes , and help save billions of dollars each year . ”
Hackers did n’t just stop at the Twitter Phishing Scam that we saw few days back .
Now
They are after the social news site – Digg !
A Digg copycat site – http://567gu.com/ has been leaked which looks and functions exactly like digg .
But the only difference is when you will login to digg the story , your password will be sent to the hacker who will completely mess your account up .
How Does it Work ?
You may receive messages via IM or via digg itself containing a link to a particular story .
Sometimes we get so many of these everyday that we hardly look at the URL of the story .
If its anything other than “ digg.com “ , I ’d advice you not to click it .
Be particularly careful when someone gives you a link with a URL Shortening service like Tiny URL .
Those can really fool you big time .
For example , Check this out —
http://tinyurl.com/6vjavf
If I randomly give you this link , you will open it without noticing the ‘ address bar ’ .
This is a FAKE digg page .
Since the page looks exactly like digg , its very easy for you to get fooled .
I feel that this is even dangerous than the Twitter Phishing because – a social news site like digg involves more sharing of links .
If you are active on Digg , I bet you have a lot of friends in your IM ( e.g. Google Talk , AIM ) .
One of them might be the Scammer who would want to pass you a fake digg page and ask for a digg .
If you are careless and actually try to login and digg his post , he will get access to your actual digg account and use it for his own benefit .
So be aware !
Pass this news to all your friends , because if they can compromise one of their accounts they might actually use their account to send the phishing message to you .
And since you trust your friend , you might not actually bother to look at the address bar .
Here is the Whois Information
Registrant :
Organization : su yue bian
Name : suyuebian
Address : shanghaipudongtangqiao19B
City : shanghaishi
Province / State : Shanghai
Country : CN
Postal Code : 361009
Source : http://www.networksolutions.com/whois-search/567gu.com
The fake twitter site also has a similar whois info – Shanghai , China .
Interesting !
Update :
One of the commenter in this post is a strong believer that this is not a phishing site as both the site has the same IP .
Well I was aware of that before posting this entry because the actual news originated here .
And as you can see in the comments of that entry , a few of the diggers already pointed out well before that both the sites have the same Ip .
However I still find it risky and a possible phishing scam ‘ attempt ’ .
Here is why :
Both digg.com and the domain in question – 567gu.com are on different name servers .
So even though they are redirecting the requests to digg ’s server ‘ right now ’ , it not might be the case after an hour ?
Or tomorrow !
are on different name servers .
So even though they are redirecting the requests to digg ’s server ‘ right now ’ , it not might be the case after an hour ?
Or tomorrow !
Digg.com is working fine .
Its not blocked by my ISP nor it has any other issues .
So why would I take the risk of going to a 3rd party site and take my chances ?
Phishing is like ‘ social engineering ‘.
Today they may be actually pointing to digg ’s server , tomorrow they might point to a totally different location !
User has no control over it , only the person who owns the domain will be able to control it – whenever he wants to !
After what happened with twitter , I do n’t think this is a co-incidence .
If you are smart you should not take this ‘ lightly ’ .
Since the owner of the domain is in control , He can keep everything the way it is and simply point the ‘ login page ’ to another address to capture your password .
If you still want to go ahead and try your luck , Be my guest :)
I am no numismatist , but I have picked up a few old coins that sometimes offer clues about the origin of words .
One is a worn copper token , about the size of a nickel , on which is inscribed “ Millions for Defense ” around the edge , and “ NOT ONE CENT for Tribute ” in the middle .
This was the rallying remark at a Philadelphia dinner honoring John Marshall in 1798 .
It was made by Robert Goodloe Harper , a Federalist politician from South Carolina who urged the U.S. to give that answer to France , which was seeking tribute for the protection of American merchant vessels .
His hardheaded advice was taken up as the slogan against the Barbary pirates of 1800 and used by hardy hard - core hard - liners throughout U.S. history .
On the envelope containing the old coin is written “ Hard Times token , 1837 . ”
I passed that clue on to Ben Zimmer , executive producer of www.visualthesaurus.com and a longtime capo of the Phrasedick Brigade , with the suggestion that it may have to do with the populist President Andrew Jackson ’s assault on Philadelphia ’s Second Bank of the United States .
Jackson liked “ hard ” money — silver and gold , money you could bite , none of that soft , paper stuff being printed by private banks — and was furious at the way rich merchants controlled much of the nation ’s money supply .
As he turned the White House over to his vice president and acolyte , Martin Van Buren , the bottom fell out of the economy , inflation raged and the first Great Depression lasted five years .
“ The financial crisis of 1837 was indeed a high - water mark for hard times usage , ” Zimmer reports .
“ I checked Gale ’s 19th Century U.S. newspapers database , and there are a whopping 375 articles from 1837 mentioning ‘ hard times , ’ 50 of them using the phrase in the headline of the article . ”
( Times may change , but headline writers never let go of a short grabber . )
“ The Washington Globe reported on April 29 , 1837 , ‘ Every paper we open contains some lamentable account of the pressure in the money market , and loud cries of hard times . ’
That ’s when the Panic of 1837 began in earnest .
In May , banks suspended the payment of hard money , and small change disappeared from circulation , leading to the production of ‘ Hard Times ’ tokens . ”
( That accounts for the NOT ONE CENT on my token , to distinguish a coin issued by a private bank from a government - issued cent . )
While he was at it —
Netymologists are compulsive diggers —
Zimmer provided a citation in the Early English Books Online database from a 1598 poem , “ The Complaint of Poetry for the Death of Liberality , ” by Richard Barnfield .
Its plaintive question is echoed these days by journalists induced to take buyouts as well as literary lights dimmed by darkling publishers : “ But who can live with words , in these hard times ? ”
The collocation echoes through the centuries after bright bubbles of euphoria pop and dismal days of dysphoria spread .
When the Broadway musical star Christine Ebersole recently made a supper - club appearance at the Café Carlyle in New York , she stopped the show with a song composed by Stephen Foster , not your latest hot songwriter .
The selection was not his dreamy “ Beautiful Dreamer , ” the classic “ Old Black Joe , ” the romantic “ Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair ” or the rousing “ Oh! Susanna . ”
The sad song that the chanteuse chose to move a bejeweled audience nibbling its nails about impending impoverishment was one that Foster wrote in 1855 , when he was going through a rough patch in his personal and professional life .
The composer had surely remembered the previous generation ’s shuttered banks and worthless paper money , as his lyric pleaded : “ Hard Times , Come Again No More . ”

There is a lot to like about Windows 7 for the consumer .
For the enterprise , not so much .
While Microsoft has added some fancy new features aimed at the enterprise ( see box , below ) it seems to have treated the enterprise 's needs as an afterthought , contends Windows guru Paul Thurrott in an interview with Microsoft Subnet .
Thurrott is editor of the SuperSite for Windows website and author of Windows Vista Secrets SP1 edition .
Considering that the bulk of Microsoft 's customers are businesses , its neglect here could be described as not smart .
Do n't get him wrong , there are cool , eye - popping features in Windows 7 for the enterprise –- unfortunately some are randomly tied to Windows Server 2008 R2 - – which is also in beta .
If you want to yank out the VPN and let Windows handle a secure connection to the server ( a new feature called DirectAccess ) , you can .
But only if all of your clients and servers are using the latest operating systems from Microsoft .
That 's a shame in this economy when expensive , large - scale upgrades of the entire operating system infrastructure are not going to fly .
( To be fair , enterprises that have opted for Microsoft 's Software Assurance deal should be covered for the license fees of an upgrade from WS2008 to R2 , but that wo n't cover the cost of man hours ) .
On the other hand , the enterprise story for R2 is quite good .
It is a compelling new version , despite a name that makes R2 seem as if it ’s a minor upgrade when it 's not .
In this interview , we get Thurrott 's under - the - hood view of both of these beta operating systems .
Q : In your opinion , will enterprise IT folks who are holding onto XP for their users want to adopt Windows 7 fairly quickly ?
Why / why not ?
A : I would n't say that Windows 7 will drive them to upgrade .
There are natural upgrade rhythms and Windows 7 should benefit from that .
But there are some things about it -- that it runs well on lower - end hardware -- that make it appealing to businesses .
I do n’t see people doing a rip - and - replace of existing hardware for it , and Windows 7 is n't magic .
It 's not going to make obsolete , five - year old hardware work .
But it does run on new lower - end systems and does so effectively , allowing businesses to buy lower - end hardware than they might not have otherwise considered .
Vista , as we all know , unfortunately did n't do that -- hardware minimums were high .
Q : What does Microsoft need to fix in Windows 7 to make it more appealing for the enterprise than Vista ever was ?
A : In all fairness Microsoft for years was criticized for not pushing the envelope and when they did –- with Vista -- they got a lot of push back .
Windows XP will go down in history as the Windows version that lasted for the longest possible time .
But Windows 7 runs great , as I mentioned , even on low - end hardware .
If there 's one big negative to Windows 7 , it's that there is n't much of an enterprise story .
Microsoft is pushing the idea that Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 are " better together " and also pushing the notion that , for the first that time since Windows Server 2000 , Microsoft has co-developed the server and client code together .
Now , WS2000 offered a whole lot of new , compelling features -- Active Directory , Group Policy , all kinds of new important technologies for the day .
Its technologies are now mainstream –- and if we look at Windows Server 2008 through the same lens , we see it is not as huge a jump in such ways at all .
Of the new technologies it does offer , one disappointment I have is that sometimes both server and client have to be on the newest version to use them and that it seems almost arbitrary , which features require Windows 7 … I can't even say that many of them are Tier A features .
Also , Microsoft did itself a disfavor with its naming scheme .
Windows 7 is really Windows 6.1 , an incremental upgrade to Vista .
But if you follow Microsoft 's naming scheme , an R2 release should n't be that big a deal .
But this version of R2 is a bigger update than would be apparent from its name .
Q : How much of a learning curve can IT folks expect to have to give XP users if they cut over to Windows 7 ?
A : There will be a learning curve but its not rocket science .
Microsoft has moved forward .
The leap from Windows Vista to 7 is n't much , but the leap to Windows 7 from XP is somewhat far apart .
Still , we are at the point now , where many people are familiar enough with general computer OS usage that training wo n't be a big issue for IT departments .
If people are buying new computers for home , they are likely getting Vista on them , for the most part .
Plus , people use computers all the time … we 're not living in a world anymore where people avoid the bank 's ATM because they want to deal with a human .
People " get " PCs .
Q : What administration / management features are available for W7 that you love ?
A : Windows 7 includes PowerShell and a new PowerShell IDE -- so that would be the big one .
Q : What administration / management features are used in W7 that you hate -- or at least think need to be fixed ?
Hate … well I would n't’t go that far .
I feel disappointed because it seems some Windows 7 enterprise features are arbitrarily locked to WS2008 R2 .
That 's a problem when you are asking corporations to spend a significant sum of money or a lot of effort to upgrade and they have to upgrade their server and client operating systems .
It ’s a tough year for that .
Q : Can you give a couple of examples of features that require WS2008 R2 and Windows 7 ?
A : Branch Cache is one –- it ’s a WAN performance feature that caches data on a branch office server to limit the data traveling over the WAN to speed performance .
Another is DirectAccess -– a VPN replacement technology .
Q : When analyzing Windows 7 , what is it that Microsoft still " does n't get " about creating appealing operating systems for the masses ?
A : I own some Macs .
When I think of the Mac , from a usability standpoint , it is n't friendlier or more inviting than Windows either in many ways .
What it does is a nice job with is integration with other Apple consumer products like iPods .
Microsoft comes at it from the reverse –- they have always considered their business customers first and treated consumers as an afterthought .
But then again , I do n’t think Microsoft has ever released a successful consumer product .
( There 's the Xbox , which they point to as a success –- but the truth is , that business will never recuperate the R&D costs and it lost a lot of money over the years . )
Windows 7 has pretty much done what consumers want .
It offers prettier , flashier effects to make them say ooh - ahh .
But , you know , Apple just had keynote at Macworld and talked at great length about its new video tools and so on .
I think that people do n't actually do a lot of that stuff .
When it comes to video editing , Apple kills Microsoft .
But most people are n't running around with digital video cameras .
They are taking short videos on still cameras that they want to post as is on YouTube .
Most people are not doing fancy transitions , end credits , scrolling Star Wars text .
Microsoft 's attempt to be like Apple have not done well ..
Like the Zune for example .
What I 'd like to see Microsoft do is figure out a way to work with Apple –- a partnership like it does with partners like Facebook through Windows Live –- instead of competing with them .
I 'd like them to focus on making their stuff work better on Macs and not about being as cool as Apple .
Q : Speaking of Windows Live , how does Windows 7 ( and for that matter WS2008 R2 ) help ease enterprises into the brave new world of cloud computing ... and do the cloud computing components work well enough for enterprises to want to use them ?
A . On the client , Windows 7 has taken out a bunch of stuff and put onto Windows Live and that 's smart .
That makes it possible to update the software as frequently as they want , rather than tying it to the operating system , which is the high bar and can't be updated as often .
It also gets people used to thinking of looking at the cloud for updates … and treating Windows as a more basic thing .
On the server , my criticism is integration .
For instance , Microsoft just launched new versions of Small Business Server and the new Essential Business Server based on Windows Server 2008 .
They launched these right when small businesses should n't be installing services on site and should be looking to the cloud to reduce costs .
But I 'm not seeing a lot of integration between the two .
Why not ship a version of SBS where the e-mail is hosted , not local ?
I do n't know .
Hopefully we 'll see Microsoft do that one day ( and this is just speculation , not insider info ) .
True , businesses will always need some traditional server products , but good integration with cloud computing services , that I do n't see .
I mean SBS is a great product , the best version yet , but the truth is I think the world is moving on from onsite services .
Q : Microsoft promises that its software will be identity - aware ( via Active Directory ) and secure ( via features like BitLocker ) .
In what ways does Windows 7 meet your expectations of identity management / inbred security ?
Fail to meet them ?
I think identity will happen more on the application side than in the desktop OS –- like with Office 14 –- and there is a big push on the server end .
What they really need to on Windows is to make it possible for more portable user stuff … that 's the bugaboo that 's not fixed yet , to my way of thinking .
WS2008 on the high end does have features that when you logon to a new computer , your desktop comes down to you .
But they need to make it more universal , more applicable on the low end - – you should be able to log in from a coffee shop and get your desktop .
Q : What new features in R2 were you most impressed with ?
A : R2 has all kinds of stuff but in many ways the server version is a lot like Windows 7 in that , to be fair , the previous version was already pretty good and they really just tweaked it .
With WS2008 , they lacked certain administration features and in R2 , they fixed them .
For instance , they are now using PowerShell as their basis of admin going forward - – that 's smart .
WS2008 had PowerShell but you could n't do much with it .
In R2 , you can script everything , or use a GUI - like interface ( similar to the one added to Exchange 2007 ) .
In R2 there 's also lot of tools built on PowerShell and a lot of administrative cmdlets included to automate stuff .
DirectAccess is another one .
Do you remember with Exchange , when they added https access to it and took something that was otherwise so complex to do and made it easy to do ?
DirectAccess takes that notion and brings it to a VPN .
What I 'd like to see is Microsoft open up DirectAccess to more versions of its clients –- right now it requires Windows 7 .
They also extended BitLocker to removable devices –- that was smart .
Also , for technology enthusiasts that want to run WS2008 on workstations they are offering a version for that called Foundation Server .
It 's super - inexpensive and includes everything but Hyper - V , that 's smart .
( The server team seems to move in a much more measured fashion than the client guys . )
There 's also a lot of evolution of features , but good stuff , like the Live Migration stuff .
I 'm not so positive myself that the migration features between WS2008 and R2 are such a big deal … it used to take seconds to move a virtual machine and now it takes milliseconds .
Q : So , was Live Migration worth the wait ?
A : Users have said it is an important thing .
For end users , they are working on an application running on virtual machine , but they do n't know that .
Then , it does n't respond for a couple of seconds and then it 's back .
To me it 's not a big difference but it is something VMware has and users asked for it so here it is .
Q : Which features did you find lacking in R2 ?
A : The biggest thing that confused me is that there is a lot going on with virtualization in both the client and the server .
The client and the sever can mount virtual machines … ( Windows 7 and R2 ) … OK , that 's neat , it makes it possible to do things like copy files in / out of a virtual machine live .
But then there 's this feature where R2 can boot from a virtual hard drive .
What 's the scenario here ?
The way the folks at Microsoft explained it to me is , imagine you are retail shop and you need to run certain workloads virtualized so that during the holiday season you can increase capacity .
The server can do that if it boots off the physical hardware .
But I asked them what happens after the holidays , can users get back the capacity dedicated to the virtual hard drive ?
It turns out , no … so it 's like a one - way switch .
Maybe during the beta period , they will get feedback and fix it in next version .
But for now , its just weird functionality that no one is sure what the point of it is .
Also , as I said some of Windows 7 integration stuff was on the dubious side to me and I think it would be smart if Microsoft offered Direct Access and BitLocker on Vista , which would make it more inviting for enterprises to use them .
DirectAccess will be a VPN killer .
It is so obvious when you see it that you ask , why did n't this happen before ?
Q : What can you say about management -- particularly for shops that do n't use Microsoft for everything ( i.e. -- they do n't use System Center ) ?

NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexico
City is facing a crisis over where to put its trash -- enough to fill four sports stadiums a year -- with its sprawling dump already crammed to bursting and under a closure order .
A government employee works at the Nezahualcoyotl dump site in Mexico City February 6 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Daniel Aguilar
One of the world ’s biggest landfills , the Nezahualcoyotl dump site is a fifth the size of Manhattan and sits inside the urban sprawl of the fast - growing Mexican capital .
Mexico
City is built on a dried - out lake bed first settled by the ancient Aztecs and grew at such a frenetic pace in the 1980s and 1990s that it now envelopes outlying villages , the dump and the international airport .
Now , mountains of refuse piled several stories high are pressing against a major drainage canal that runs along the dump ’s edge .
That risks a rupture that could flood residential areas and the airport with stinking effluent and grime , says the federal government which ordered the dump closed in January .
But city officials are stalling in court , arguing that the danger is exaggerated and asking for more time to implement ambitious recycling and green energy projects .
“ If the canal breaks it would be a disaster , you would have thousands of people inundated with sewage , ” said Mauricio Limon , an official at the Environment Ministry , which has been trying to close down the landfill for years .
“ More time in operation means more polluting methane ... tainted aquifers , more contamination of the surrounding areas , damaged wildlife and bad odors , ” Limon said .
Mexico City ’s left - wing government is facing off with the ruling conservatives to keep the dump open and find green alternatives to absorb the 12,500 tons of garbage produced each day by the capital ’s 20 million residents .
City officials say garbage can be heaped up at the 4 - square - mile ( 10 - square - km ) site on the edge of Mexico City for several more years .
Small privately run landfills are offering their services , but at triple the price and with less space .

“ If we close it , they ’ll start chucking it wherever they can .
Soon this garbage will be in our ditches , ” said Martha Delgado , the city ’s head of environmental policy .
“ Crises should give us opportunities to change .
We need a profound transformation in the way this city deals with its waste . ”
WORMS TURN INNARDS TO COMPOST
Mexico City launched a campaign several years ago to teach households to separate organic waste from recyclables .
Sorting centers were built to replace informal workers who rake through trash for scraps of metal , plastic and paper .
Despite that , only 15 percent of the city ’s garbage is recycled , compared to up to 60 percent in parts of Europe .
There are no waste reduction programs .
Styrofoam plates , cups and plastic straws pile up at taco stands and shoppers pack groceries into doubled - up plastic bags .
Mayor Marcelo Ebrard , with one eye on a future presidential bid , has made strides toward making the capital greener , adding cycle lanes and public transport .
Now he has big plans for a $ 186 million recycling center and a methane gas project like one that fuels the metro in the northern city of Monterrey .
The plans could take years to come to fruition , however .
Nezahualcoyotl workers pushing bulldozers over animal carcasses from food markets , computer parts and plastic bottles say they are caught in the middle of a political fight .
Pilot projects at the dump include one that has 7 million worms chomping away at organic waste , including 14 tons a day of animal innards , to turn it into rich compost .
Another project uses a water filter to skim off some of the black sludge that bubbles off the trash heaps and distill it into yellowish water , used to wet dusty roads in the area .
The city wants to build infrastructure to capture 1.4 million tons a year of greenhouse gas belched by decomposing trash and burn it to run power stations , helping reduce smog .
“ If they close it now it would be a step backward from the very small advances we ’ve made so far , ” said Judit Lopez , 39 , who runs a plant turning old trees into sawdust for compost .
The credit crisis has eased , but the bad news for the American worker may just be beginning .
Employers slashed jobs from one end of the economy to the other in October , pushing the unemployment rate to 6.5 % .
That ’s the highest level in more than 14 years , and makes a deep recession a virtual certainty .
Almost no sector of the economy was immune to the decline .
The biggest losses were in manufacturing and construction , but they were joined last month by big cuts in retail trade , financial services , and leisure and hospitality .
“ It seems that firms had previously been cutting back employment only gradually , being cautious on hiring but not aggressive on firing , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist with consulting firm Global Insight .
“ They have now decided that the recession will be deeper than feared , and are acting more aggressively on firing , as they see demand for their products falling rapidly . ”

Employers shed 240,000 jobs in October , and the toll in September was far worse than previously reported -- 284,000 , up from an initial reading of 159,000 .
The economy must normally create about 100,000 jobs a month just to keep pace with population growth .
So far this year , the economy has shrunk by nearly 1.2 million jobs , the Labor Department said .
The latest cuts pushed the unemployment rate , which was 6.1 % in September , almost half a percentage point higher in one month -- a sign that employers , facing slackened demand for their goods and services , were responding by cutting jobs .
Even two of the more robust employment sectors -- healthcare and government , which includes public servants such as teachers and police -- grew more slowly than in the past .

The last time the unemployment rate was so high was in the first quarter of 1994 , when the economy was still struggling to recover from a recession .
The situation facing job seekers today is even worse when so - called discouraged workers are factored in -- an 11.8 % overall unemployment rate in October , the Labor Department estimated , up from 11 % in September .
Officially the unemployment rate counts only those who have lost employment and are actively looking for new work ; it does not include those who have stopped trying to find work or are working part time because they can’t find a full - time job .
Jared Bernstein , a labor economist with the Economic Policy Institute , noted that job losses were a “ lagging ” phenomenon .
That is , unemployment tends to peak well after the economic shocks that cause it , and takes longer to abate even after the economy recovers .
He noted that the lag had lengthened in recent business cycles , with it taking roughly two years after a recession was over for the economy to regain the lost jobs .

“ Employers often wait to be sure that the economy is really tanking before laying people off in earnest .
And they want to be quite sure that consumers are back before they take on other workers , ” Bernstein said .
“ Unfortunately , that lag has gotten a lot longer in recent years . ”
Deteriorating conditions for U.S. workers are likely to intensify calls for Congress to pass another stimulus package .
“ When the private sector engine stalls , the public sector engine needs to kick in , ” Bernstein said .
A crucial factor in a recovery will be whether the financial shocks of the last few weeks and months have forced consumers to rethink their spending and saving habits .
Advertisement
For the first time in years Americans appear to be increasing their savings , said Ed Leamer , director of UCLA ’s Anderson Forecast .
That is probably wise for consumers whose assets have lost value and for workers fearful of losing their jobs , but it robs the economy of its major driver : About 70 % of the nation ’s gross domestic product is composed of consumer spending .
Leamer said that much of last spring ’s stimulus payments went toward savings or paying down debt , and consumers are even more inclined now to save extra cash , not spend it .
The trick in devising a new stimulus , he said , would be to help consumers spend a little more in the short run while learning to increase their savings over time .
“ It ’s important not to panic the consumer , ” Leamer said .
“ The short - term problem is too little spending and the longer - term problem is too much spending .
. . .
A nice little gradual increase in saving is what we should be doing . ”
Advertisement
But , he said , the economy will not return to health until spending and saving are in better balance and Americans produce more and consume less .
“ We ’re in an economy that ’s going to experience a structural adjustment , ” Leamer said .
“ We need to convert some of our malls into factories . ”

The FDA 's war on Mother Nature
( Natural News )
The FDA has effectively banned a naturally - occurring form of vitamin B6 calledby declaring it to be a drug , reports the .
Responding to a petition filed by a drug company , the FDA declared pyridoxamine to be " a new drug .
" Now , any nutritional supplements containing pyridoxamine will be consideredby the FDA , which may raid vitamin companies and seize such products .
See the history of FDA raids on vitamin companies here : https://www.naturalnews.com/021791.html
Pyridoxamine occurs naturally in fish , chicken and other foods ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6 ) , putting the FDA in the strange position of banning a substance from dietary supplements even though it is already present in the food supply .
It 's not the first time the FDA has declared a natural molecule to be a " drug " while attacking nutritional supplements that contain the same molecule .
A similar story unfolded withand themolecules it contains that lower high cholesterol .
The drug companies engaged in biopiracy , ripping off the molecule from red yeast rice to make their now - famous " statin drugs . "
Once the statin drugs were patented , Big Pharma and the FDA went after red yeast rice , claiming the supplement was " adulterated with pharmaceuticals .
"
It was n't really adulterated , of course .
It just contained a natural statin - drug - like molecule that the drug companies copied and patented .
It would be like Big Pharma patenting vitamin C , then the FDA claiming that all oranges and lemons were adulterated with drugs because they naturally contain their own vitamin C. This is the insanity of the FDA as it operates today .
You can read more about the FDA on our channel webiste www.FDAreform.org which is updated every few days .
So will this ruling on pyridoxamine affect nutritional supplements ?
Yes , any supplements containing this form of vitamin B6 can now be declared " adulterated " by the FDA .
Manufacturers of such supplements can be arrested and shut down for engaging in " illegal drug trafficking . "
Such is the nature of the FDA 's agenda to criminalize nutritional supplement companies and limit consumers ' access to Mother Nature 's remedies .
The pyridoxamine " drug , " by the way ( which is just pyridoxamine ) , is designed to prevent the progression of diabetic nephrothapy ( kidney disease ) .
Most likely , the FDA will eventually approve the " drug " for that condition , even while claiming vitamin B6 supplements containing the very same chemical are useless and insert .
This is another classic oppression tactic of the FDA :
Ban the herb , but promote the drug using the same chemicals .
The same thing happened with ephedra , a Traditional Chinese Medicine herb known as .
The FDA banned the herb , saying it was " dangerous at any dose , " but pharmaceuticals containing the very same molecules ( ephedrine ) are still being sold over - the - counter as cold medicines , meaning they 're available to any child without a prescription .
The bottom line is this : .
If a drug company can make money selling a vitamin as a drug , the FDA will gladly ban the vitamin and protect the drug .
If a drug company can rip off molecules from Mother Nature and patent them , the FDA will ban those same molecules found in nature .
All of this points to the urgent need to reform the FDA .
A new petition demanding real FDA reform will be announced here on NaturalNews in the coming days .

Abstinence has never been sexier than it is in Stephenie Meyer ’s young adult four - book Twilight series .
Fans are super hot for Edward , a century - old vampire in a 17 - year - old body , who sweeps teenaged Bella , your average human girl , off her feet in a thrilling love story that spans more than 2,000 pages .
Fans are enthralled by their tale , which begins when Edward becomes intoxicated by Bella ’s sweet - smelling blood .
By the middle of the first book , Edward and Bella are deeply in love and working hard to keep their pants on , a story line that has captured the attention of a devoted group of fans who obsess over the relationship and delight in Edward ’s superhuman strength to just say no .
The Twilight series has created a surprising new sub - genre of teen romance :
It ’s abstinence porn , sensational , erotic , and titillating .
And in light of all the recent real - world attention on abstinence - only education , it ’s surprising how successful this new genre is .
Twilight actually convinces us that self - denial is hot .
Fan reaction suggests that in the beginning , Edward and Bella ’s chaste but sexually charged relationship was steamy precisely because it was unconsummated — kind of like Cheers , but with fangs .
Despite all the hot “ virtue , ” however , we feminist readers have to ask ourselves if abstinence porn is as uplifting as some of its proponents seem to believe .
Given that teens are apparently still having sex — in spite of virginity rings , abstinence pledges , and black - tie “ purity balls ” — it might seem that remaining pure is n’t doing much for the kids these days anyway .
Still , the Twilight series is so popular it has done the unthinkable : knocked Harry Potter off his pedestal as prince of the young adult genre .
The series has sold more than 50 million copies , and Twilight fan fiction , fan sites , and fan blogs crowd the internet .
Scores of fans have made the trek to real - life Forks , Washington , where the series is set .
The first of a trilogy of film adaptations of the books , starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson , was scheduled to hit theaters in time for Christmas .
Nowhere was readers multigenerational infatuation with Bella and Edward ’s steamy romance more evident than in their “ engagement " party at a Sandy , Utah , Barnes & Noble store .
On the evening of August 1 , 2008 , before the fourth book was released , guests flocked to the store wearing formal wedding attire to celebrate the happy fictional couple .
Preteen girls in princess dresses , “ My Heart Belongs to Edward ” stickers plastered to their faces , posed for photos .
Grandmothers in flowing gowns or homemade “ I Love Edward ” t- shirts stood in line to play Twilight trivia .
Clever teen boys in Edward costumes fought off ersatz Bellas .
The air in the store was electric as fans broke into two groups : the much smaller group of Jacob fans ( Jacob is Bella ’s best friend who is hopelessly in love with her , but it ’s a doomed relationship since Jacob is a werewolf , a lifelong enemy of the vamps ) and the group of rabid Edward fans .
The questions of the night were : Will Edward and Bella finally do it ?
If so , will the magic be ruined when the abstinence message is gone ?
But nobody seemed to be asking an even more important question :
Has the abstinence message — however unwittingly — undermined feminist sensibilities ?
The answers came sooner than expected .
After the engagement party , fans rushed home with their copies of Breaking Dawn , only to discover that Edward and Bella go all the way in the first few chapters , after they get married , of course .
But it seems that in the context of marriage and parenthood ( which comes quickly , natch ) , Edward and now - 19 - year - old Bella are just like our traditional grandparents .
Or the Moral Majority .
Breaking Dawn ’s Bella is a throwback to a 1950s housewife , except for the fact that Edward has turned her into a vampire .
But this act is one of ' 50s - esque female self - sacrifice :
It ’s precipitated by Bella ’s need to let her human self die in order to save their half - vampire baby .
Their monstrous offspring is frightening , but what ’s really frightening is Bella and Edward ’s honeymoon scene .
Edward , lost in his own lust , “ makes love " so violently to Bella that she wakes up the next morning covered in bruises , the headboard in ruins from Edward ’s romp .
And guess what ?
Bella likes it .
In fact , she loves it .
She even tries to hide her bruises so Edward wo n’t feel bad .
If the abstinence message in the previous books was ever supposed to be empowering , this scene , presented early in Breaking Dawn , undoes everything .
What ’s worrisome is that fans are livid about the last book not because of the disturbing nature of Bella and Edward ’s sexual relationship , but because they consummated it in the first place .
Shimmerskin , a poster on the message board Twilightmoms.com , summed it up best for a number of defeated fans :
“ The first three books were alive with sheer romanticism but I never felt it in [ Breaking Dawn ] .
The sweep and scope of a grand love affair in [ the first three books ] was absent .
The brilliantly innocent eroticism that took our breath away was also gone . ”
Some fans are so upset at this loss of " innocence ” they ’ve created an online petition demanding answers from Meyer and her publisher , Little , Brown .
“ We were your faithful fans… , ” the petitioners write .
“ We are the people that you asked to come along with you on this journey , and we are disappointed . ”
Perhaps some of this bitter disappointment stems from book four ’s departure into adult territory , where Bella becomes a traditional — and boring — teenaged mom .
The removal of the couple ’s sexual tension reveals two tepid , unenlightened people .
Neither character has much to offer outside the initial high school romance storyline : Bella does n’t have any interesting hobbies , nor is she particularly engaged in the world around her .
Her only activity outside her relationship with Edward seems to be cooking dinner for her father .
Edward hangs out with his family , but the bulk of his 24 hours a day of wakefulness seems to go to either saving Bella from danger or watching her when she sleeps — you know , that age - old savior / stalker duality .
Romantic !
As other feminists like Anna N. on Jezebel have pointed out , Edward is a controlling dick , a fact that becomes abundantly clear in the leaked pages of Meyer ’s first draft of Midnight Sun , a retelling of Twilight from Edward ’s perspective .
In those pages , available on Meyer ’s website , Edward imagines what it would be like to kill Bella .
" I would not kill her cruelly , ” he thinks to himself .
Ever the gentleman , Edward .
His icy calculation of how best to kill Bella is horrifying , and it illustrates the disconnect between the two characters .
By extension , readers who interpreted Edward ’s reluctance to be near Bella in Twilight as evidence of his innocent “ crush ” on her are forced to recognize that even Edward — the dream guy — is not at all he ’s cracked up to be .
Digging into Edward ’s mind reinforces the old stereotype that underneath it all , even the best guys are calculating vampires , figuring out how to act on their masculine urges .
Edward holds all the power , while Bella — and female readers — romanticizes the perfect man who does n’t exist .
It ’s no wonder that Midnight Sun has not been widely released :
It would likely spark even greater fan ire .
Such disappointment suggests something about the desire readers have for abstinence messages ; it may also suggest readers ’ belief that , pre-sex , Edward and Bella were the perfect couple .
In reality , the abstinence message — wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn — objectifies Bella in the same ways that " real ” porn might .
The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity with the loss of other things , including her sense of self and her very life .
Such a high - stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless , an object , a fact that is highlighted when we get to the sex scenes in Breaking Dawn .
Of course the paradox is that the more Meyer sexualizes abstinence , the more we want Bella and Edward to actually have sex .
This paradox becomes extra-convoluted when we find out , in a moment that for some is titillating , for others creepy , that sex could literally equal death for Bella .
In one scene in Twilight , Bella asks Edward in a roundabout way if they would ever be able to consummate their relationship .
Edward responds , “ I do n’t think that …that …would be possible for us . ”
Bella responds , “ Because it would be too hard for you , if I were that …close ? ”
Yes , Edward tells her .
But more than that he reminds her that she ’s “ soft " and “ so fragile " and “ breakable . "
“ I could kill you quite easily , Bella , simply by accident . ”
And it ’s not just Bella 's life that 's at stake — it ’s her very humanity .
The closer she and Edward get , the more tempting it is for him to bite her and turn her into a vampire , and the conflation of his vampiric and carnal urges is obvious .
As Midnight Sun reveals , Edward ’s bloodlust is every bit as potent as his romantic love .
It does n’t take a Freudian to read Edward ’s pulsating , insistent vampire lips pressed against Bella ’s pale , innocent neck as an analogy for , well , something else .
From clandestine meetings in Bella ’s bedroom to time spent in a forest clearing , Edward almost always has his lips on Bella ’s neck — a dangerous activity , as we learn in Twilight that “ the perfume of [ Bella ’s ] skin ” is an unbearably erotic and tempting scent for Edward .
When they do kiss , Bella often loses control of herself , which means Edward must be ever - vigilant in controlling “ his need . "
After their first kiss , Bella asks if she should give him some room .
“ No , ” he tells her , “ it ’s tolerable . ”
He goes on , “ I ’m stronger than I thought . ”
Bella responds , “ I wish I could say the same .
I ’m sorry . ”
Fan fiction reveals fans ’ tacit understanding of the serious dangers of sex and the excitement of it , illustrating that readers have picked up on Meyer ’s analogy where the sexual penetration of Bella ’s human body is akin to the vampiric penetration of Bella 's skin .
One piece of fan fiction was posted to TheTwilightSaga.com on June 22 , 2008 , before the release of the fourth book , by a particularly ardent fan ( hardy ’ sgirl ) .
In the story , Edward and Bella have gotten married and are on their honeymoon .
Edward begins kissing Bella ( on her neck , of course ) , and then begins removing her jeans .
Bella , with a pounding heart , asks herself , “ Would I really let him go all the way ? ”
Keep in mind that within this story , Bella and Edward are married ; waffling about “ doing it ” with your husband might point to the age and maturity of the writer , but it also taps into the fear of intimacy that Meyer establishes in the books .
The fan writer picks up on that fear as she continues her story :
As Edward becomes more sexually aroused , he turns into something Bella does n’t recognize , and she begins to fight him .
The fan writes :
Edward had become a monster .
that dangerous vampire he held hidden away from me …and I was the one about to pay for it …he held my arms above my head pinned onto the bed in iron clasps .
i was panicking and my breathing was fast .
Edward sat up above me …and the look in his eyes were n't ones ive ever seen before … unless he was about to feed .
The rape fantasy is apparent , of course , but even more salient is the fan writer 's subconscious understanding of the theme Meyer has been establishing : that sex is dangerous and men must control themselves .
It 's a matter of life or death , and ultimately men are in charge .
It ’s clear from both the books and the fan fiction response to them that Edward has taken on the role of protector of Bella 's human blood and chastity , both of which , ironically , are always in peril when Edward is nearby .
Bella is not in control of her body , as abstinence proponents would argue ; she is absolutely dependent on Edward ’s ability to protect her life , her virginity , and her humanity .
She is the object of his virtue , the means of his ability to prove his self - control .
In other words , Bella is a secondary player in the drama of Edward ’s abstinence .
Reader Shimmerskin again astutely notes , “ … it ’s so clever that these books are n’t just about sexual abstinence .
Edward is fighting two kinds of lust at the same time .
Abstaining from human blood has probably been good practice for tamping down his sexual appetites now that he ’s with Bella . … ”
It ’s arguably clever , sure , but it ’s also a sad commentary on Bella ’s lack of power .
Ultimately , it ’s a statement of the sexual politics of Meyer ’s abstinence message :
Whether you end up doing the nasty or not does n’t ultimately matter .
When it comes to a woman ’s virtue , sex , identity , or her existence itself , it ’s all in the man 's hands .
To be the object of desire , in abstinence porn is not really so far from being the object of desire in actual porn .
FRENCH REACTION : PRESIDENT
NICOLAS
Sarkozy said yesterday that Israel ’s offensive in the Gaza Strip is a failure that has harmed the security of the Jewish state .
He also expressed willingness to return to the region to help reach a ceasefire agreement .
The war in Gaza is a “ tragedy which must stop ” , Mr Sarkozy told foreign ambassadors at his annual new year reception .
France condemned Israeli forces entering the Gaza Strip .
“ It was n’t an easy decision to take .
Everyone knows the attachment of France , and mine in particular , to the non-negotiable security of Israel .
But I say what I think .
This intervention does not strengthen the security of Israel . ”
Mr Sarkozy condemned Hamas for “ firing rockets that regularly fall on Israeli civilians who ’ve got nothing to do with it ” .
Assessing the results of the three - week - old conflict , Mr Sarkozy said the Palestinians are more divided than ever ; Mahmoud Abbas , the western - backed president of the Palestinian Authority , and moderate Arab leaders have been weakened .
“ The Israeli government stands accused everywhere in the world , while Israel , more than other states , needs the solidarity of the world , ” Mr Sarkozy said .
“ This is the result .
If you tell me that this is n’t a tragedy , when those who are most extreme in every camp have benefited , then we do n’t have the same vision of the crisis . ”
Mr Sarkozy mentioned Barack Obama twice , saying he hopes the new US president will immediately “ send a strong signal of US re-engagement ” in the Middle East , and urging the new US administration to adopt a climate package similar to Europe’s .
Mr Sarkozy predicted that 2009 “ will be a year of very great difficulty , probably one of the most difficult in decades ” because of the economic crisis and the risk of war “ in this vast arc of crisis that goes from the near east to Pakistan . ”
It was “ indispensable ” that both the G20 summit in London in April and the climate summit in Copenhagen in December succeed .
The French leader delivered a pull - up - your - socks harangue to the rest of the world .
“ It all depends on your will , ” he told the ambassadors .
“ Do we want to submit to the crisis , or do we want to master the crisis ? ”
Mr Sarkozy outlined his ambitions for 2009 : a return to economic growth ; the adoption of “ clear and universal ” rules in finance and for the fight against global warming ; “ decisive progress ” towards adapting international institutions for the 21st century ; the conclusion of a peace accord in the Middle East , and resolution of crises in Sudan and the Great Lakes region of Africa .
“ You probably think I ’m too ambitious , ” the French president said .
“ I ’m convinced that time works against us – against the crisis , against peace and justice .
To think we have time is a major strategic error . . .
We know what has to be done , so let ’s do it . ”
The task will only become more difficult in 2010 , he warned .
“ I want us to understand that we no longer have time , ” Mr Sarkozy said , hammering out each word .
“ The priority for 2009 is that men and women in positions of responsibility use these responsibilities to act – not to command , not to wait .
Because waiting without doing anything is nothing other than complicity . ”
He could almost stop there , the French president said , prompting laughter from the ambassadors .
He nonetheless talked for 38 more minutes .
... on Brian Cowen
When Mr Sarkozy addressed European issues , at the end of his New Year ’s speech to the diplomatic corps , Ireland came first .
“ I hope Europe will at last equip herself with the institutions she needs : a president elected for two - and - a - half years , ” Mr Sarkozy said .
“ And that depends on our Irish friends .
I would like to pay homage to the courage of the prime minister , Brian Cowen , who announced a referendum for the second semester of 2009 .
We will support them .
Ireland must understand that Europe needs her , and perhaps she needs Europe , as the financial crisis has shown .
Europe needs to speak with one voice . ”
Beverly Eckert : 9 - 11 Victim Sean Rooney 's Widow Dies in Flight 3407 Crash
Sean Rooney died in the World Trade Center attack .
Eckert was the founder of Voices of September 11th , a victim 's advocacy group of September 11 widows , mothers and children who ultimately forced lawmakers to pass reforms of the U.S. intelligence apparatus .
Just last week , Eckert was at the White House with President Obama , as part of a meeting with relatives of those killed in the 2001 attacks and the bombing of the USS Cole to discuss how the new administration would handle terror suspects .
Eckert was flying to her hometown and had planned to celebrate her late husband 's 58th birthday .
" Entourage 's " Ari Gold is obviously a caricature of Endeavor 's Ari Emanuel , but having been out to lunch with the real Ari several times , I often came away with the feeling that the real Ari-- the brash , endlessly competitive and bravado - filled Hollywood agent provocateur extraordinaire -- is a caricature too .
So let 's give credit to Charlie Rose ( who can be something of an all - too - talkative talk - show host caricature himself ) for offering us a glimpse of the amazing Emanuel family Monday night .
( It took a while for a link to the show to appear -- if the video above does n't work , trying going here to watch . )
To see the three Emanuel brothers around the same table -- telling tales , laughing , finishing each other 's sentences and reliving old arguments -- was like seeing a new chapter of Neil Gabler 's " Empire of Their Own ' ' come to life .
Rose gave everyone a chance to talk , eldest brother Ezekiel ( top - flight oncologist , bio-ethicist and author of a new text , " Healthcare Guaranteed " ) giving way to middle - son Rahm ( former Clinton operative turned Illinois congressman and chair of the Democratic House Caucus ) followed by baby brother Ari , whose smarts and hustle have helped make Endeavor into Hollywood 's No. 2 talent agency , behind CAA .
If Ari is ever having trouble pitching a new film , he should try selling the story of his own family , which offers a compelling modern - day twist on the fabled Jewish immigrant success story .
The three brothers ' ( they also have a sister ) grandfather was a union organizer who built a synagogue with his own hands .
Their father , a talented doctor in his own right , emigrated to Chicago from Israel in 1959 and led an early campaign to get lead paint out of inner-city tenement housing .
Their mother was an ardent civil rights activist .
When Rahm and Ari were boys , they had to share a room because their mother had brought in a foster brother , who needed a room to himself .
As this exchange from the show attests , they were taught not to just talk the talk , but walk the walk .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department will not renew the contract of security contractor Blackwater Worldwide when it expires in May , a senior State Department official said Friday .
Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad , Iraq , from a helicopter in 2003 .
The decision was made after the Iraqi government refused last week to renew the firm 's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired on and killed 17 Iraqis .
Blackwater 's latest " task order " expires in May , and the senior official said that " one of the conditions is that you have to have a license " to continue working in the country .
" No license , no renewal , " the official said .
" If they do n't have a license to operate , we would certainly not renew the task order . "
The official said the decision would not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department to protect American diplomats around the world .
As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees worldwide , the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq , renewable each year .
Blackwater , one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq , has one of the biggest security contracts there .
Officials said the State Department is talking with security firms DynCorp International and Triple Canopy , which share the Iraq contract with Blackwater , about picking up Blackwater 's duties .
The Iraqi government has been unclear about when Blackwater will have to cease operations .
But the official said , " We are working to make sure our people are protected . "
Losing the contract will be a huge blow to Blackwater .
It has been estimated that the Iraq contract makes up one - third to one - half of the privately held company 's business .
Blackwater has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq and 1,000 personnel .
Earlier this month , five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16 , 2007 , shootings in a Baghdad square .
A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .
Watch why Blackwater is notorious among Iraqis »
Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents .
An Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation .
The company does not face charges .
But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life .
The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act .
The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . "
The recently approved U.S. - Iraqi security agreement specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country .
Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004 , but the provision was not strictly enforced .
Last year , the State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government .
Starting January 1 , the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate .
As of Wednesday , Blackwater said it had not been officially notified of any Iraqi decision not to renew its license .
CNN 's Suzanne Simons contributed to this report .

The Koala and the Lizard
" Hey Koala !
What are you doing ? "
The koala says : " Smoking a joint . "
" Come up and have some . "
So the little lizard climbs up , sits next to the koala
and they enjoy a large doobie .
After a while the little lizard says his mouth is dry
and he is going to get a drink from the river .
But the little lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls into the river .
A crocodile sees this , swims over to the little lizard and helps him to the side then asks the little lizard :
" What 's the matter with you ? "
The little lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree , smoking a joint with the koala , got too stoned , and then fell into the river while taking a drink .
The crocodile says he has to see this .
So they walk into the rain forest and find the tree where the koala is sitting , with yet another joint .
He looks up and says , " Hey you ! "
The koala looks down at him and says ...
" Fu-u-u- u - c - c-k , Dude .......
How much water did you drink ?
The car company late on Tuesday asked the US government for an another $ 16.6 bn ( £ 11.7 bn ) in new loans and can keep the money if they can show the Government by the end of next month how it can become profitable .
Rival Chrysler also asked for another $ 5bn and plans to cut 3,000 jobs of its own .
This passive multitouch controller designed and built by Randy Jones requires no electric circuits to operate .
All it needs it a little 80s synth and the party starts itself .
Cool trivia : Jones created the input device for his thesis at the University of Victoria :
Physical modeling synthesis has proven to be a successful method of synthesizing realistic sounds , but providing expressive controls for performance remains a major challenge .
This thesis presents a new approach to playing physical models , based on multidimensional signals .
Its focus is on the long - term research question , “ How can we make a computer - mediated instrument with control intimacy equal to the most expressive acoustic instruments ? ”
In the material world , the control and sounding properties of an instrument or other object are intimately linked by the object ’s construction .
Multidimensional signals , used as connections between a gestural controller and a physical model , can in principle provide the same intimacy .
This work presents a new , low - cost sensor design capable of generating a 2D force signal , a new implementation of the 2D digital waveguide mesh , and two experimental computer music instruments that combine these components using different metaphors .
The new instruments are evaluated in terms of intimacy , playability and plausibility .
Multidimensional connections between sensors and a physical model are found to facilitate a high degree of control intimacy , and to reproduce as emergent behavior some important phenomena associated with acoustic instruments .

The Baconator Can't Compete with this Whopper
Ever wonder what a Burger King Whopper would look like if you put 16 servings bacon on it ( woops , I miscounted , there is only 15 servings ! ) ?
To be honest , I had never wondered that before today when I stumbled across this work of bacon art .
This Whopper contains 15 orders of bacon on top of the Whopper with cheese .
If this just is n't enough artery clogging goodness for you , take a look at the Bacon Cheese Roll recipe .
Here is the whopper proof !
Today , Good Morning America introduced us to Melanie , an 18 - year - old part - time model whose married , millionaire " sugar daddy " is 40 .
But Melanie says their relationship is about much more than sex .
In the clip at left , Melanie explains that when one goes on a website that matches young women with older wealthy men , the first thing the guys ask is " what are your goals and your dreams " because " they 're not just going to give you all this money to go shopping ... they want you to actually do something and achieve something and do something good . "
She then proceeds to show off her new Manolos .

According to GMA , the sugar daddy " phenomenon " has exploded recently , as evidenced by the existence of these websites , the Real Housewives shows , and Anna Nicole Smith marrying that billionaire ... in 1994 .
But these are n't your mother 's sugar daddies .
The man who runs SeekingArrangement.com says while we usually think of " a guy with a gold chain and a furry chest , a sugar daddy today could be the guy in the Starbucks waiting line . "
AMMAN , Dec. 16 ( Xinhua ) -- Jordan 's Prime Minister Nader Dahabi stressed Tuesday that peaceful nuclear project is the kingdom 's strategic choice for future energy .
" This project is vital and will have a positive impact on different economic sectors in the kingdom , " Dahabi told visiting deputy executive director of French nuclear giant Areva , Jean - Jacques Gautrot .
The premier , meanwhile , underlined dire need to forge a comprehensive outlook governing cooperation between the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission ( JAEC ) and Areva in fields of extricatingand mining uranium and training Jordanian nuclear cadres .
Jordan has signed an agreement of cooperation with Areva , under which a joint venture is established to exploit uranium in the kingdom .
Unlike its oil - rich neighbors , Jordan faces grave energy challenges as it lacks conventional energy resources , with scarcity of water .
Currently , about 96 percent of the country 's energy needs were met by imports from neighboring states , mainly Saudi Arabia and Egypt , at a cost of some 20 percent of its gross domestic products .
In a drive to reduce the country 's dependence on imported hydrocarbons , the government mapped out a nuclear energy program last year , under which Jordan will have its first nuclear reactor up and running by 2016 , with more to be built in the years leading up to 2030 .
By that time , 30 percent of the kingdom 's electricity needs will be met by nuclear power stations , with excess production to be made available for export , according to the national strategy on nuclear energy .
In order to seek international help on pumping nuclear energy , Jordan has managed to win supports from the UN nuclear watch dog International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the United States and the European Union among others , while inking a series of cooperation deals with countries like France , Canada , Britain , China and South Korea .
The Kindle and the iPhone , in particular , are new members of a small and exclusive club : Products that , once you have them , you will never relinquish .
Still , as is the nature of revolutionary products , there are rough edges just begging to be smoothed .
This column is about those rough edges .
Who ’s talking ?
Bruce Tognazzini was hired at Apple by Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin in 1978 , where he remained for 14 years , founding the Apple Human Interface Group .
He went on to be a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems , Chief Designer at WebMD , and is now in partnership with Jakob Nielsen & Don Norman .
Human / Machine Interaction vs. User Experience
These two terms are not interchangeable .
Human / machine interaction focuses on the elements of physical and behavioral interaction between human and machine .
It is the stuff of button pushing & keyboard clacking & pointer pointing , along with the computer 's measured responses .
The user experience is different .
It is bigger , encompassing events from the potential buyer 's first glimpse of the device to the effort required to recycle it at its end of life .
The Kindle has an overall quite wonderful user experience , even though the first generation 's human / machine interaction was a disaster .
The iPhone / iPod Touch , on the other hand , offers exceptional human / machine interaction revolutionary , in fact but that interaction is coupled with a user experience that varies from good to almost hostile .
Kindle Human / Machine Interaction
Any attempt on the part of the reader to hold the first Kindle electronic book as they would a real book results in its flipping pages as rapidly as a teenager handed a copy of Modern Maturity .
The industrial design is coated with giant buttons that you simply can’t avoid , even with practice over time .
Do n’t even think about casually walking with it still turned on !
By the time you get where you ’re going , it will have flipped forward or backward 25 or 50 pages with no possibility of an Undo .
( The unspoken rule for Undo , of course , is that developers do n’t have to provide it if really serious damage will occur .
Delete a character , and you must provide Undo .
Delete a file and , oh , well .... )
It gets worse .
The first Kindle was also designed to slip the bonds of its cover , so that you can test it 's free - fall capabilities several times a day .
( A thin strip of Velcro at the bottom middle of Kindle & cover will address this failing . )
The Kindle was either never tested , or they decided to ship it anyway .
Either scenario reflects badly on the industrial designers and product team , as does the choice of white as a color : the Kindle screen , state - of - the - art for readers , is is a dingy gray in color , resulting in less than ideal contrast between background and character .
The white surround not only advertises this unfortunate failing , it constantly draws the user 's eye away from the reading surface .
Kindle User Experience Setting aside the first - generation Kindle ’s human / machine - interaction shortcomings , everything else about the greater user experience is wonderful .
It is a joy to flip on the built - in modem and find a couple hundred thousand books just begging to be bought .
You can browse and download the first few chapters of any books you want before ever committing to an order .
Even when you 've committed to downloading the full book ( for a fraction of it's print price ) , you 're given the chance to cancel the order the designers realized that people make mistakes .
It 's grand that my wife and I can read the same book at the same time for one low price without having to resort to tearing the book into chapters , as we did with our paper copy of The Da Vinci Code .
It 's equally grand that a decade from now , when we want to reread a chapter we marked up on the first go - round , we can redownload the same book , at no cost , into our new , paper - white - screen Kindle and find the same mark - ups we made a decade before .
It is just as marvelous that , when we leave for travel to exotic destinations devoid of English bookstores , we no longer look like refugees , weighted down with all our worldly possessions in the form of 15 or 20 books between us .
Not only can we carry several hundred books inside our Kindles , we can buy more anywhere along the way , eliminating that frantic rush to a bookstore the night before flying to Beijing or driving into Alabama .
The user - experience of the Kindle , beyond it 's disastrous industrial design , is really remarkable for a first - release product .
It reflects its birthing at the hands of people who love books , love reading , and understand what the experience of buying , reading , and collecting books is all about .
i Phone / iPod Touch Human / Machine Interaction Reams of material has been written on the virtues of the iPod Touch / iPhone human / machine interaction , and I wo n't belabor it here .
The interface represents a fundamental breakthrough .
Even typing , a bit of a challenge for me the first week or so , became fluid enough for me that I chose to write this entire article on my iPhone on a flight to London it was easier than having to get my computer out of my carry - on .
The iPod Touch / iPhone interface is the gold standard for small - device interfaces and , based on the paltry offerings of the early imitators , likely to remain so for a while yet .
( Blackberry Storm users : Please do n't write .
You wo n't change my mind about your product . )
iPhone / iPod Touch User Experience
As great as the iPhone / iPod Touch may be , many aspects of the user experience are pretty miserable .
Sales Experience
The sales period extends for the first 72 hours of a product 's life cycle , what we used to call the period " before the check clears . "
During this time , the customer is deciding whether to buy , paying , and , post - sale , deciding whether buying was a mistake or not .
This latter process is called " overcoming cognitive dissonance . ”
At the end of the process , the mind will have come to the conclusion that either that the whole thing was a colossal blunder ( “ I ’ve been tricked ! ” buyer ’s remorse ) , or the buying choice was obviously good and should never have been questioned at all ( “ my , are n’t I the clever one ! ” ) .
The first 72 hours of my experience with the iPod Touch consisted of a series of tortures .
Buying the iPod I spent weeks trying to buy a Touch .
Apple Stores would claim they had one , but were sold out when I got there .
They refused to sell over the phone for pick - up .
There were long lines at cash register ( a problem Apple has since addressed nicely by replacing the registers with roaming sales people armed with portable terminals ) .
Why is all this important when you have customers as motivated as myself ?
The last step of this sale is the first step of the next .
Customers left with bad memory of this sale less likely to subject themselves to the next .
( In my Websites that Sell course , I cover the psychology behind this critical point in detail . )
Even Before Purchase
Most people do n’t accidentally “ fall by ” an Apple Store .
They ’ve either read about a product , or , more likely , a friend has told them about a product .
The telling friend , with a portable product like the Touch , is likely to have shown them the product , too .
And that ’s a real problem with the Touch .
The iPod Touch is beautiful to behold , as long as you do n't touch it .
If you do , it immediately takes on the graceful countenance of a motel - room crime scene , with sufficient fingerprints for an entire season of CSI .
OK , it 's true : I 'm cantankerous , dipping over into curmudgeonly .
Still , Apple has known of the fingerprint problem for years , and periodically chooses to ignore it , ( They did n’t with the original iPhone , which featured a brushed - metal back that hid fingerprints .
They returned to high - gloss metal with the iPod Touch .
The iPhone 3G has a glossy plastic back , but it still does n't illuminate fingerprints like the Touch . )
Apple appears to exclusively focus on making products that look good on display when rotating slowly below tiny little spot lights .
What Apple fails to appreciate is that most customers learn about products from their friends , and that a CSI - like appearance does n’t help sell .
Initial Ownership Experience
The Touch came with no song , no video , and no picture .
Even a cheap wallet comes with a picture of a family , so customers will get the idea .
Most customers remove and discard the picture , replacing it with their own , unless they were in the market for a new , more attractive family .
iPod owners could , likewise , discard sample pictures , etc. Instead , they are left with a $ 300 to $ 500 hole in the wallet and absolutely nothing to show for it , at least not until they get to iTunes , where the real nightmares begin .
“ But this is an iPod Touch review ! ”
User experience goes beyond external beauty , and it also goes beyond the elements that form the interface , in this case , elements that are brilliantly conceived .
I ’ve covered those in my iPhone review .
Syncing Should Sync
Not one to employ halfway measures , I bought two Touches , one for myself and one for my wife .
I already had iTunes working on my Mac .
( I ’d never owned an iPod , but I enjoy listening to music while I work . )
Therefore , I just had to sync the Touch to get my music on it , a straightforward task .
My wife , however , had nothing on her Sony Vaio PC , so I began by downloading and installing iTunes .
Then , we laboriously transferred her favorite music from her CDs , tapes , and records .
I ’ve used iTunes for years , and the way it works is that , when you drag a song to iTunes , it copies it into the iTunes library .
That leaves you with two copies of the same song , one in a nice , neatly - ordered iTunes music folder , along with the originals in their unstructured folder .
Not wanting a bunch of useless duplicates , when we finished dragging the song into iTunes , I did the natural thing : I deleted the originals .
Except iTunes was n’t copying her songs , because it had defaulted to pointers - only .
I methodically erased the only copy of her songs on the computer !
Fortunately , I had synced the iPod before I erased the originals ( not being a complete fool ) , so the songs were safely stored on the iPod , so all I had to do was to re-sync to have them flow back onto her computer .
Except Apple has chosen to ignore the established definition of sync , which is that two machines , when synced , interchange data so that both machines end up with a common copy of the most up - to - date version of the information .
Instead , what Apple labels “ sync ” is actually “ download . ”
Once the songs flow out to an iPod Touch , there 's no way to get them back onto the host machine .
This is not a technical issue ; this is a decision by Apple to seriously degrade the user experience presumably to protect their music sales .
It 's part of Apple 's philosophy to go beyond the strictures of copyright law in order to limit fair use in ways the legislature never intended .
Reconstruction elapsed - time : 2.75 hours .
Fortunately , we had only transferred around fifteen songs , so I started pawing through the tapes and disks again .
( Having been married more than 20 years , I had sense enough not to mention the problem to my wife until it was solved , saving an additional three hours of being yelled at . )
I had an even bigger problem myself , since I had a desktop machine for home and a small portable for on the road .
There was no way I could keep my music synced with the two machines .
Fortunately , I was able to easily address this problem by dumping my separate desktop and small portable in favor of a single , heavy , oversized portable that can act as both a home and road machine , badly , all for just a little over $ 2500 .
Simple .
Video Transferring video could n't have been worse .
Propriatarianism raised its ugly head .
All video other than Apple stuff , such as Podcasts , must be converted to a special version of mpeg 4 that ensures they wo n't run on anything except iTunes .
How do you convert them ?
The only way to convert them is to use the QuickTime Player , and not just any QuickTime Player .
No , you have to shell out an additional $ 30 for QuickTime Player Pro , which is n't .
Pro , that is .
Not only does QuickTime
Pro lack many standard codecs , forcing people to use the free VLC player in real life for watching anything but the most standardized movies , it does n't know its own limitations .
When it is failing at a task , it does n't inform users as to why and what they should do about it .
It just kind of ignores your instructions .
Here ’s the simple , 11 - step user experience of converting a perfectly - normal MPEG video from a Canon camera :
Try to drag and drop video into iTunes .
Nothing happens at all -- no conversion , no warning , no notice .
Google the problem and discover video must be converted using QuickTime , instead of iTunes .
Open video in QuickTime and attempt to Export as iPod movie .
Receive notice must spend $ 30 for privilege of Exporting Buy and install QuickTime Pro unlocking code .
Try to Export .
Program crashes .
Repeat step six after restarting program , rebooting system , etc. until Export finally works .
First convert video to " movie " using QuickTime Pro " Save as ... " path .
Convert movie into proprietary mpeg 4 for iPod - only format Double - click resulting movie , probably installing it in iTunes , but who knows ...
Sync
It got worse .
One Infinite Loop Shortly after I got my iPod Touch last year , a notice arrived : “ Go to iTunes and upgrade now ! ” I was eventually able to find a link on the iTunes home page that carried me through several pages extolling the virtues of upgrading now !
On the final page of the sales pitch , I looked around for the Buy button or the Download button , to no avail .
Then , just as I was about to abandon all hope , I discovered a link that just might work ... except it actually linked back to the first page of the sales pitch .
Round and round we go !
What users were supposed to magically know is that , now that they have been properly motivated , they should plug in their iPhone / iPod Touch , wait for an icon representing their device to show up in the left - hand column of iTunes , which it often does , and then click that tiny little icon to begin their search anew for a link to download and install the new system .
Now I know how to upgrade , so I have n't even glanced at their sales pitches since then .
Therefore , I do n't know when , if ever , they fixed this particular problem .
I only know that it could never have existed if they had tested the workflow on even a single user before releasing it on the world .
In an era when Microsoft has finally seen the light and begun doing extensive user testing , Apple has apparently turned out the lights and gone home .
User -testing does not result in brilliant design .
That requires brilliant designers .
User testing guarantees that whatever level of design a company has been able to achieve will actually work .
Apple Gets It Right The Apps Store for the iPhone / iPod Touch has an exceptional user experience .
As with Kindle , users can fluidly browse , easily discover all information needed to make a buying decision , and within seconds begin enjoying their new purchase .
Clearly , the team that worked on this project carefully thought through and stepped through the entire user experience .
The Dog that Caught the Car The only drawback to the Apps experience is a direct result of the Apps Store 's wild successit truly is the killer - app of the iPhone / iPod Touch .
There are now 10,000 apps , requiring the big screen of a real computer to do a proper job of browsing and searching .
Unfortunately , today that big screen is inside iTunes and features the aesthetics and usability of a used - car lot .
At this writing , it is easier to shop on the tiny screen than the big screen .
The big screen needs to stop just shouting and provide a clear and concise way to ferret out wanted applications , not among a relative handful of featured or best - selling apps splashed across the home screen , but among all 10,000 apps .
Design Both Human Interface & User Experience Companies that pay attention to both the mechanics of the interface and the subtleties of the user experience win .
Explore websites like Bed , Bath & Beyond and see how good screen design and carefully - plotted user experience come together .
Do n’t just examine look and feel ; set up a shopping scenario and experience every step from thinking about maybe buying a product to selecting it and checking out .
Bed , Bath & Beyond has perfected a superior experience in their real - world stores , and they have translated it beautifully into the cyber world .
There are no trade - offs here .
Human / machine interaction is a subset of the user experience .
Anything done to improve the mechanics of the interface will , by its very nature , improve the overall experience .
Anything done to improve the user experience will amplify the good qualities of the human / machine interaction .
You must , however , research and design each of them separately and to test each of them separately .
They each require a specific frame of mind , and concentrating on just one will lead to the kind of uneven design that both the Kindle and the iPhone / iPod Touch have been offering .
Buying Advice
As for buying advice , both products you will never want to live without again .
Because of that , ironically , I recommend not buying a first - generation Kindle .
The page - flipping is endlessly frustrating .
However , I suspect the first generation has also gone away , and the next units amazon will ship will be second - generation .
As for the iPhone , buy now .
Every day I wonder how I lived without it .
It is a wonderful companion for both work and play , and the drawbacks I ’ve discussed in its case are strictly software and will disappear .
I thought the iPod Touch , with its wi-fi connectivity , was enough , but having virtually constant ( as long as I ’m in this country ) connection to the Internet is truly a life - changer .
Advice for amazon & Apple For amazon , it 's simple : Bring out a new machine to fix the human / machine interaction .
Then , expand the boundaries of the user experience .
Probably the biggest problem right now is that people can't see in the dark :
The Kindle , which has a passive screen , is in desperate need of an illumination system .
Best would be a halo light source around the screen , but , at the least , offer a plug - in , flip - up LED lamp that draws power from the Kindle supply .
As for Apple , do some studies and find out what the user experience for people who do n't work at Apple really is .
My experiences above are likely not that unusual .
iTunes , designed for a few songs , has been crushed by the weight of too many media and too many tasks .
Even the name has become an anachronism .
It is time for that entire workflow to be rethought .
Look at how different people use the product in different environments .
For example , right now , the design of the browser assumes that everyone , both iPhone and iPod Touch users , are jacked into the net at all times .
We are not .
Keep our opened web pages in memory so , for example , when our plane is due to take off soon , we can leaf through Google News and stack up a whole bunch of pages to read once the plane is in flight .
In the late 1970s , we at Apple held a very high market share in the computer business .
We let that slip away .
Do n't let it happen again .
Mind the competition , and do n't be fooled by their first fledgling attempts .
They will learn , and it wo n't take them nearly as long as it did last time .
Stay ahead .

Test Or Die : Validates Uniqueness Of , Shoulda and Factory Girl Edition
John Nunemaker recently posted about testing validates_uniqueness_of using test / unit and fixtures .
I ’m going to take his lead , but use shoulda and factory_girl instead .
I ’m going to assume you ’ve read his article .
If you look at the code for testing validates_uniqueness_of of your model , and think about how often you might use it in your projects , it starts to be repetitive very quickly .
John has this to say about this style of testing in his comments :
“ The thing that I have noticed when teaching people testing though is they have to learn this first .
If they start with the macros , mocking and stubbing , they never quite understand the underpinnings .
Also , when they start new project , I often watch them stumble , trying to do things with all the macros , but not having their test environment setup .
I think it is good for people to see that they are repeating themselves and think , well , how can I fix this ?
I kind of think it is good to feel the repetition pain as it helps people understand why we switch to macros and start to stub and mock things so that you do n’t require hitting the database or using fixtures . ”
Now , I ’m assuming you ’ve learned these valuable lessons , and want to more succinctly test your code .
Before starting , you ’ll need to install should and factory_girl .
I also created shoulda_generator for shouldaified and factory_girlied generators .
You can either install shoulda and factory_girl as plugins by running :
script / plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda.git script/plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl.git
… or as gems by adding this to config / environment.rb ( although some might argue it belongs in config / environments / test.rb ) :
config . gem ' thoughtbot - shoulda ' , : lib => ' shoulda ' , : source => ' http://gems.github.com' config . gem ' thoughtbot-factory_girl ' , :lib => ' factory_girl ' , : source => ' http://gems.github.com'
shoulda_generator can be installed as a gem :
# run this if you have n't before : gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
# install it : sudo gem install technicalpickles - shoulda_generator
We can now proceed :
script / generate shoulda_model
Category name : string rake db : migrate db:test : prepare
Shoulda provides the should _require_unique_attributes macro for testing uniqueness .
It requires an existing record though , so we need to use factory_girl to create one in a context .
Together , this would look like :
require File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + '/../test_helper ' class CategoryTest < ActiveSupport :: TestCase context " an existing category " do setup do @category = Factory ( : category ) end should _require_unique_attributes : name end end
If we run rake test , we ’ll see it fails because we have n’t declared name to be unique :
Started F Finished in 0.096949 seconds .
1 ) Failure : test : an existing category should require unique value for name .
( CategoryTest ) [ /opt/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20080810/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/thoughtbot-shoulda-2.0.6/lib/shoulda/active_record/assertions.rb:63:in `assert_bad_value '

< false > is not true .
1 tests , 2 assertions , 1 failures , 0 errors
Now add the validates_uniqueness_of :
class Category < ActiveRecord :: Base validates_uniqueness_of : name end
And running rake test now yields much success :
Started .
Finished in 0.132653 seconds .
1 tests , 4 assertions , 0 failures , 0 errors
I ’d continue on to test validates_uniqueness_of : name , : scoped_to => : site_id , but I have n’t actually used it before , and I was n’t able to get the macro working quite right .

This tranquil setting became a crime scene when hikers John and Irene Bryant went missing after a hike .

In February 2008 , after investigators had spent months searching for a missing 80 - year - old man , they found John Bryant 's body .
A suspect was already in custody .
Establishing Bryant 's time of death would be crucial to making a case , however .
The answer could be found through knowledge gained at what is academia 's most gruesome research facility : the body farm .
John Bryant 's body was located in a part of the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina where hunters often throw away animal carcasses .
Mixing of animal bones with human remains complicated the investigation .
So police brought in two forensic anthropology experts -- both professors at nearby Western Carolina University -- who assisted in locating , collecting and dating Bryant 's remains .
This helped build evidence for a case against his killer .
Advertisement Advertisement ­Forensic anthropologists can date remains by observing insect activity on the decomposing body , but if the body has decomposed to just the skeleton , the task is far mor­e challenging .
This is where body farm research comes in .
Body farms are teaching scientists how to study the ground around human remains for evidence -- soil acidity can indicate how long a body has been leeching fluids into the Earth .
What 's more , forensic anthropologists are learning to pay heed to the effects of weather and environment on remains .
Scientists consider the effect on putrification by a hot , desert sun and how a decomposing body can be disrupted by scavenging animals .
If larger bones have been scattered , it 's safe to assume that the body has been there for a pretty long period of time ( animals carry away smaller bones first ) .
Western Carolina is one of only three colleges in the United States that believe in the merits of allowing human corpses to rot away on their otherwise lovely campuses .
In addition to the body farm at WCU , there are also farms at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville and the University of Texas - San Marcos .
In this article , you 'll learn all about body farms and their role in education and investigation .
First , though , we 'll have a frank discussion in the next section about what happens to your body when you die .
Human Death and Decay As bodies decompose , tissue emits a green substance and provides fodder for flies ' appetites .
This rotting arm may become a home to nearly 300 lucky maggots .

In order to understand how body farms work , it helps to know some basics about human death and decay .
Though it sounds pretty macabre , it 's perfectly normal for your body to go through some radical changes when you die .
To begin with , when your heart stops beating , your body 's cells and tissues stop receiving oxygen .
Brain cells are the first to die -- usually within three to seven minutes [ source : Macnair ] .
( Bone and skin cells , though , will survive for several days . )
Blood begins draining from the capillaries , pooling in lower - lying portions of the body , creating a pale appearance in some places and a darker appearance in others .

About three hours after death , rigor mortis -- a stiffening of muscles -- sets in .
Around 12 hours after death , the body will feel cool , and within 24 hours ( depending on body fat and external temperatures ) , it will lose all internal heat in a process called algor mortis .
The muscle tissue begins to lose its stiffness after about 36 hours , and within about 72 hours of dying , the body 's rigor mortis will subside .
As the cells die , bacteria within the body begin breaking them down .
Enzymes in the pancreas cause the organ to digest itself .
The body soon takes on a gruesome appearance and smell .
Decomposing tissue emits a green substance , as well as gasses such as methane and hydrogen sulfide .
The lungs expel fluid through the mouth and nose .
Insects and animals certainly take notice of all this .
A human body provides sustenance and a great place for insects to lay eggs .
A fly trying to find its way in this crazy , mixed - up world can eat well on a corpse , and then lay up to 300 eggs upon it that will hatch within a day .
" " ­ ­ HowStuffWorks 2008 Maggots -- the larvae that emerge from these eggs -- are extremely efficient and thorough flesh - eaters .
Starting on the outside of the body where they hatched , maggots use mouth hooks to scoop up the fluids oozing out of the corpse .
Within a day 's time , the maggots will have entered the second stage of their larval lives , as well as burrowing into the corpse .
Moving around as a social mass , maggots feed on decaying flesh and spread enzymes that help turn the body into delectable goo .
The breathing mechanism of a maggot is located on the opposite end of its mouth , enabling it to simultaneously eat and breathe without interruption around the clock .
While a first - stage larva is about 2 millimeters long , by the time it exits the third stage and leaves the body as a prepupa , it may be as large as 20 millimeters -- 10 times its initial length .
Maggots can consume up to 60 percent of a human body in under seven days [ source : Australian Museum ] .
The environment in which a dead body is placed also affects its rate of decay .
For instance , bodies in water decompose twice as fast as those left unburied on land .
Decomposition is slowest underground -- especially in clay or other solid substances that prevent air from reaching the body since most bacteria require oxygen to survive .
Now that we know more about human decay , we 'll look at a group of people whose workplace smacks strongly of it : forensic anthropologists .
Do Nails and Hair Keep Growing After Death ?
It once was commonly believed that nails and hair continued to grow on a dead body .
To the casual observer , it would seem true .
However , this visual effect is caused by shrinkage of the skin , scalp and cuticles .
Studying the Bones : Forensic Anthropologists BARBARA SAX / AFP / Getty Images
Depending on how deep a coffin is buried , the body inside may be completely stripped of its tissue or flesh within 40 to 50 years .
Bodies left unprotected from the elements will decompose to a skeletal state much sooner .
However , it may take hundreds of years for bones to decompose entirely .
Although most bodies are discovered long before dust has returned to dust , enough time -- anywhere , say , from a few days to many years -- has often passed that it 's impossible to visually determine the identity of a body found under mysterious circumstances .
Skin , muscle and other tissue matter may have decomposed and been consumed or scattered by wild animals .
What 's most likely to remain is the skeleton , and that 's often where the answers must be found .
Advertisement Advertisement Forensic anthropology is the study and analysis of human remains for purposes of assisting a criminal investigation .
Forensic anthropologists provide information about the origin and identity of a body and the means and time of its death .
Forensics has many different branches -- everything from forensic entomology ( study of insect evidence ) to odontology ( analysis of dental evidence ) .
A forensic anthropologist may consult and confer with an odontologist , for example , to more accurately determine an age range for a human skull .
When a body is discovered , a forensic anthropologist is summoned to the crime scene to help find and collect the human remains .
It 's not always as simple as it sounds .
There may be two bodies tangled together in a shallow grave , or the body may be located among animal bones left by hunters .
The forensic anthropologist will separate the bones from other matter , take them back to a lab , clean them and examine them .
Analysis is complicated by countless factors .
For instance , trauma to a bone may have been caused by a struggle with the killer -- or it could just be the result of a childhood accident .
A forensic examination of the body can help determine which may be the case .
Forensic anthropologists also provide court testimony about their findings -- reaffirming for the record their professional opinion on the identity or profile of the individual and the presence of bone or skull trauma .
When forensic scientists are represented on televised crime dramas , their roles are often combined and exaggerated .
A forensic anthropologist studies only the bones and decomposed remains of an individual -- not the mysterious , bloody note clenched in a fist , the half - chewed bubble gum in the victim 's mouth or the peculiar pattern of a bloodstain on the wall behind the body .
Some tasks not handled by forensic anthropologists include : DNA collection or analysis
Autopsies
Bloodstain pattern analysis
Searching for hairs , fiber or other such evidence
Study of ballistics or other weapons - related evidence
So even if forensic anthropologists do n't really cover all the ground they do on TV , they still have their work cut out for them .
And to correctly analyze corpses , they 've got to learn about decomposition .
It helps to have firsthand experience -- that 's where body farms come in .
Body farms are like a hands - on laboratory where forensic anthropology students can learn about the environment 's effects on a body , as well as observe the decomposition process up close .
On the next page , learn about the colleges that consider a field full of rotting bodies to be a bountiful harvest .

Body Farm Research Facilities
At body farms , corpses are assigned to particular spots and left to decompose .
Forensic anthropology students study how environment affects the corpses and their rate of decomposition .

The first body farm ( officially known as the University of Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Facility ) was opened by Dr. William Bass in 1971 .
Bass recognized the need for research into human decomposition after police repeatedly asked for his help analyzing bodies in criminal cases .
What started as a small area with one body has developed into a 3 - acre complex that contains remains of around 40 individuals at any one time .
The facility became famous ( and gained its moniker ) after it inspired Patricia Cornwell 's 1995 novel , " The Body Farm . "
Where do these bodies come from ?
When Dr. Bass first started the body farm , he used unclaimed bodies from medical examiners ' offices .
Later , people started donating their bodies to the facility to help with forensic studies .

There 's no common set of standards or guidelines that body farms adhere to , other than safety , security and privacy .
Even the dimensions of the facilities vary .
Western Carolina University 's body farm is about 59 - feet ( 18 m ) squared and is built to hold about six to 10 bodies at a time , while the body farm at the University of Tennessee holds around 40 bodies and covers nearly 3 acres .
And even body farms are bigger in Texas :
The facility at University of Texas - San Marcos covers about 5 acres .
Each facility also has a different focus .
The Tennessee body farm pursues a broad range of study into decomposition under all conditions -- buried , unburied , underwater and even in the trunks of cars .
The body farm at Western Carolina places emphasis on decomposition in the mountainous region of the Carolinas .
Texas ' body farm also provides region - specific data .
Forensic anthropologists from states like New Mexico are waiting on data from Texas so they can comprehensively study decomposition in desert climates .
Generally , when a facility accepts a body , it 's placed in a refrigerator ( not unlike one found in a morgue ) .
The body is then assigned an identifying number and placed in a specific location on the grounds of the body farm .
The location of each body is carefully mapped .
Students learn how to maintain the chain of evidence when working with the bodies .
In a criminal case , it 's imperative that anyone coming into contact with human remains logs that he or she handled it .
This way , no legal questions can be raised about the integrity of the evidence or possible gaps in its custody .
The bodies are allowed to decompose for various amounts of time .
Then students practice locating , collecting and removing the remains from the area .
The remains are taken to a laboratory and further analyzed .
When analysis is finished , the skeleton may be returned to the family of the deceased for burial , if requested .
Otherwise , it will likely remain in the department 's collection of skeletons .
U of T - Knoxville boasts a collection of skeletal remains from more than 700 people .
Body farms may or may not cover the bodies with wire cages .
Doing so prevents coyotes in Texas from making off with body parts , but security fencing at the much smaller Western Carolina facility is sufficient .
What are students learning on the body farm ?
And how is their research helping in real criminal investigations ?
Find out next .
The Student Body
In 2006 , there were more corpses and skeletons on the U of T - Knoxville campus ( around 900 in the osteopathological collection , 700 between two skeletal collections and 40 more on the body farm itself ) than there were Asian students currently enrolled ( 673 total undergraduate and graduate ) [ source : Nair ] .

In the last section , we learned about the basic setup and operation of a body farm .
Now let 's look at what scientists learn at these facilities .
Body farms allow scientists to study the natural decay of the human body as well as how a decomposing body affects the world around it .
For instance , entire insect populations will rise or fall based on the presence of a corpse .
A decaying body will even affect surrounding vegetation , killing off some flora with digestive enzymes .
Advertisement Advertisement Forensic anthropologists can determine an individual 's age , sex , race and body type by looking at the corpse 's bones .
There 's normally not enough difference between genders in the skeletal remains of preadolescent children to identify the sex of the child .
The easiest way to detect the gender of an adult skeleton is to simply look at the size of the bones -- males ' bones are normally larger , as are the areas where muscle connections are made .
There are many differences in the pelvic bone , the most obvious of which is the size of the pelvic inlet ( the space inside the pelvic bone ) .
The inlet is larger in women to aid in the birthing process .
The skull also offers clues to facilitate sex determination .
Males tend to have backward - slanting foreheads while females ' are rounder .
Females ' chins often come to a point , and male chins are generally more squared off .
Not every bone helps establish an age or range of ages for a set of remains .
Forensic anthropologists look for certain things in a very young child -- such as whether or not teeth have come in -- that obviously wo n't help in analyzing older specimens .
Conversely , when they 're identifying older bodies , other observations can be made .
Ribs can be a helpful determining factor of age .
As we get older , the ends of our ribs become more ragged and less flat where they meet the cartilage that connects to the sternum .
Therefore , the more ragged the ribs , the older the body .
Regardless of what forensic anthropologists examine , there 's no way to determine the precise age of an individual , only a general approximation .
When determining the race of a deceased individual , forensic anthropologists seek to place the body in one of three broad groups : African , Asian or European .
This is n't an easy task .
Most differences are found in the skull .
The distance between eyes or the shape of the teeth help determine ethnicity , as well as more specific genetic background , such as commonalities found in people from certain parts of Asia that other Asians do not share .
There are actually more differences within each racial group than there are between each group [ source : Ubelaker ] .
Once age , sex and ethnicity have been determined , this data -- combined with bone measurements -- can be used to determine an individual 's approximate predeath height and weight .
Though they provide a wealth of useful information , body farms do cause some raised eyebrows , as we 'll discuss in the next section .
Does Your Body Weigh Less After You Die ?
In 1907 , Dr. Duncan MacDougall proposed the idea that the human body loses weight at the moment of death .
Today 's scientists are skeptical of MacDougall 's methodology , and some recent studies with sheep have shown that a body may actually gain as much as a pound momentarily after death .
This temporary weight gain has also been measured in humans during meditation and dream states [ source : Hollander ] .
Other Body Farm Issues

Leaving dead bodies out in the open is n't for everyone .
Beliefs and traditions concerning burial of the dead vary greatly across cultural , religious and geographic divides .
The ancient Egyptians maintained elaborate ceremonies and funerary preparations , such as embalming the dead , which is still common today .
Tibetan Buddhists may opt for a sky burial , in which one 's remains are left exposed to be consumed by vultures .
Some people plan to be cremated when they die while others may find the thought of destroying their body by fire -- even after they 're dead -- to be disturbing .
Some citizens in San Marcos , Texas , balked when they learned that nearby Texas State University planned on building a body farm .
Concerns were raised about smell , possible unsightliness and even the chance of coyotes redistributing decaying body parts around town .
When a new site was proposed , it was a notably Texas - style problem that halted construction -- buzzards .
Citizens feared that the body farm would attract buzzards and other birds of prey , and that these creatures would be a risk to low - flying aircraft taking off and landing at a nearby airport .
Texas State University assuaged concerns by announcing that the body farm would be located within a 3,000 - acre property and would be at least a mile away from any properties that border the site .
The isolation and privacy of this final location satisfied local residents .
Advertisement Advertisement Another common fear associated with body farms is contamination or the spread of disease .
The faculty in charge of running these decomposition facilities do everything they can to alleviate such worries .
Body farms do n't accept any bodies that test positive for infectious diseases .
Additionally , anyone who has proximity to corpses must have a round of vaccinations to prevent catching hepatitis , tetanus and other diseases .
The bodies themselves , though , actually prevent disease from spreading .
When bodies go through the putrification process , disease - causing organisms also decompose , rendering the remains harmless .
More body farms are needed across the nation because research done on corpses in any given environment provides the most applicable data to bodies found under those same environmental conditions .
While this may not pose a problem for bodies found in states like Georgia or Virginia , the effects of decomposition vary greatly for a body in a desert climate , such as Arizona or New Mexico .
This specific problem spurred the creation of the Texas body farm .
Ideally , there would be at least one body farm operating in each state -- but it may take many more years for that goal to be realized .
For body farms to exist , there have to be bodies -- and yours could be one of them .
If you want to donate your body to a forensic anthropology facility , you should make arrangements with the body farm of your choice before you die .
You should also tell family members or an attorney about your decision so that the body farm can be notified of your death -- and the farm 's imminent acquisition .
Generally , the university will collect the donated body after funeral services have been held .
However , depending on the distance between the body and the university , it may be necessary for your estate to pay to ship your body .
In the next section , we 'll look at some mysteries solved through skills and knowledge being learned at body farms .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Ireland is to be offered concessions on the EU reform treaty in the hope its voters will reverse their “ No ” verdict in a second referendum , diplomats said on Thursday .

Exact details of the deal still had to be thrashed out by EU leaders at a summit in Brussels .
But envoys from Ireland ’s EU partners said they had reached agreement in principle giving Dublin assurances on the issues which prompted Irish voters to reject the treaty in June .
“ No one rejected Ireland ’s position , ” Spanish secretary of state for European affairs Diego Lopez Garrido said .
“ The leaders who spoke intervened to consider that the conditions asked for by Ireland are acceptable , ” he said after a first round of talks , stressing his country still wanted checks on how the deal would affect other parts of the treaty .
The Lisbon treaty -- successor to the defunct EU constitution -- aims to streamline the system of voting among EU states and create a long - term EU president and foreign policy supremo .
It must be ratified by all 27 EU states .
Aside from Ireland , only the Czech Republic and Poland have yet to ratify it .
Prague is set to do so by early next year , and Poland ’s president has said he will back the treaty when the Irish problem is solved .
Ireland ’s constitution requires approval in a referendum for ratification of the treaty .
A draft document obtained earlier by Reuters suggested Ireland could hold a second referendum by the end of October 2009 if Dublin ’s concerns could be addressed , notably on the retention of a permanent Irish seat in the European Commission .
Other concerns which led to the Irish “ No ” vote are also addressed in provisional accord .
They include respecting Ireland ’s military neutrality and additional assurances on taxation policy and workers ’ rights .
“ ( Irish Prime Minister Brian ) Cowen said he is ready to hold another referendum next year .
He said there need to be 27 commissioners , ” another diplomat said .
The treaty would have reduced the number to 18 .
RESPECT
Cowen will have to choose a date carefully as his government ’s popularity continues to dive amid a budget deficit , dwindling growth , increased unemployment and unhappy unions .
His ruling Fianna Fail party are facing the possibility of major losses in June ’s local and European elections .
The Sinn Fein party , which campaigned for a “ No ” vote in June , dismissed the concessions on the Lisbon treaty as “ meaningless . ”
“ What we needed was genuine respect for the Irish vote , which would have meant Lisbon being stalled and properly amended , ” said Padraig Mac Lochlainn of Sinn Fein .
The draft document presented to EU leaders said :
“ In the light of the above commitments by the European Council , and conditional on the satisfactory completion of the detailed follow - on work by mid-2009 and on presumption of their satisfactory implementation , the Irish Government is committed to seeking ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the term of the current Commission . ”
This means that the re-run would be held before November 1 , when the mandate of the current Commission ends .
The treaty is a central plank of EU efforts to modernise its institutions , which have become unwieldy in the last few years , partly due to the entry of central and eastern European states .
No 10 ordered to release Cabinet minutes on Iraq
Details of a move by Gordon Brown to encourage colleagues to support the Iraq war could be revealed after the Government was ordered to release secret Cabinet papers .
Information watchdogs upheld an unprecedented ruling that minutes from two crunch Cabinet meetings in 2003 should be made public .
The judgment - the first ordering the release of private Cabinet documents - has infuriated ministers , who argue it threatens the proper functioning of government .
The Government is now expected to appeal to the High Court to try to overturn the decision of the Information Tribunal .
The Information Tribunal has ordered that cabinet minutes into the invasion of Iraq , which British soldiers took part in , must be made public .

Ultimately , it could take the step of vetoing the release under a little - known clause of the Freedom of Information Act .
If released , the papers will shed new light on the then Chancellor Mr Brown 's role in the build - up to military action .
It is thought he was originally sceptical about the war , but in his diary , the late Foreign Secretary and leader of the Commons Robin Cook claimed that Mr Brown delivered a ' long and passionate statement of support ' of then Prime Minister Tony Blair 's strategy at a Cabinet meeting in the days before the war .
The Information Tribunal yesterday upheld a decision by the Information Commissioner that details of the sessions on March 13 and 17 should be disclosed .
The meetings considered the issue of whether the invasion was allowed under international law .
Criticism of former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith 's legal advice to ministers on the case for military intervention supported the case for releasing details the tribunal said .
It added that the need to maintain Cabinet confidentiality was outweighed by the ' exceptional ' public interest in the decision to go to war .
The tribunal also claimed ministers have undermined the case for keeping Cabinet minutes private by disclosing details of discussions in their own memoirs .
Four ministers who were in the Cabinet in 2003 - Mr Cook , Clare Short , David Blunkett and John Prescott - have gone into print .
The tribunal said this demonstrated ' a dwindling respect by ministers for the convention of Cabinet collective responsibility in general ' .
The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats welcomed the ruling , but said a comprehensive public inquiry into the build - up to war in Iraq was long overdue .
Shadow Foreign Secretary William
Hague said : ' Rather than have items of evidence dragged into the public domain piece by piece , the Government should set up a full - scale Privy Council inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq war .
' The sooner we can learn the lessons of the war the sooner we can apply them .
It is imperative to begin an inquiry before memories have faded , emails have been deleted and documents have disappeared . '
LibDem foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey said : ' These were crucial Cabinet meetings , when issues central to the decision to go to war with Iraq were discussed .
The public clearly has the right to see the minutes .
' Their publication may help answer some critical questions , and certain people may find themselves in an even more difficult position . '
Miss Short , who resigned over Britain 's involvement in Iraq , said she suspected people would be ' very disappointed ' by how little the formal minutes say .
She said there was ' very little proper discussion ' in the Cabinet , adding : ' Cabinet meetings were limited and the minutes are very generalised and limited . '
Information Commissioner Richard Thomas said : ' Disclosing the minutes will allow the public to more fully understand this particular decision . '
The Cabinet Office now has 28 days to decide whether to appeal to the High Court against the ruling .
A No10 spokesman said : ' We are considering our response . '
CHICAGO — Add the MRSA " superbug " to the list of concerns you bring to the beach nowadays , a research doctor said today .
It 's still safe to go in the water , especially if you shower thoroughly before and after swimming , but antibiotic - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , a strain of bacteria that can cause staph infections that are difficult to treat with traditional anti-infection drugs such as methicillin , can be caught when you take a dip in ocean water , said Dr. Lisa Plano of the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine .
MRSA stands for methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or multiple - resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
It has become a deadly and growing problem in hospitals in recent years .
" MRSA is in the water and potentially in the sand , " Plano told a group of reporters today at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" This constitutes a risk to anyone who goes to the beach and uses the water …
Most of us wo n't get infected but it only takes one infected person to spread [ MRSA to others ] . "
So - called staph or Staphylococcus aureus , the kind that responds to antibiotics , is not a big deal typically out in the general public .
About a third of us has it living in the nose or on the skin all the time , and we do n't get sick from the bug .
But for babies , the elderly and other people with compromised immune systems , staph can lead to an infection that can be deadly .
And in any population , when people catch the antibiotic - resistant strain ( MRSA ) , doctors struggle to find a way to kill the infection .
Both the staph that responds to antibiotics and MRSA ( which does not ) have long been problems in hospitals , but the bugs have cropped up in locker rooms full of healthy people more recently , including some rumored infections among NFL and NBA players .
Staph and MRSA can also occur in daycare settings .
A 'complicated bug '
Scientists already knew staph could spread in water .
Now the research led by Plano shows that MRSA is also found at the beach — in the sea water and potentially in the sand .
To pin this down , Plano and her colleagues recently studied 1,300 adult bathers at a South Florida beach , half of whom took a dip in the water and brought back a sample of water for later lab analysis , and the other half of whom sat on the beach for 15 minutes .
Some 37 percent of the ocean water samples had Staphylococcus aureus in them , and 3 percent of those were the antibiotic - resistant strain of the bug , Plano said , even though the beach is located nowhere near a sewage source .
In other words , the " call was coming from inside the house " — probably , the bathers .
The staph was relatively mild strain , Plano said , but the strain of MRSA was particularly virulent , she said .
One weird thing she found was that a later genetic analysis of the bugs in the water samples indicated a very low presence of markers for genes that cause the skin infections associated with staph .
" Staph is a really complicated bug , " Plano told LiveScience in a phone interview earlier in the day .
" S. aureus has an excess of 40 different virulence factors that it could potentially have and use to establish different types of infections , and not all staph will have all of them .
Basically , most staph will have some of them , and what I looked at and what I compared these to are ones we knew to be associated with skin- infecting bugs . "
In the sand too
Municipal pools and most private pools are safe from S. aureus if chlorine levels are appropriate , Plano said .
But there is some evidence that staph is spread in beach sand , she said .
In one study , several quarts of staph - free sea water was poured over 14 previously staph - free toddlers in diapers who had played for 10 minutes in beach sand .
The water that flowed off the kids was collected and analyzed — some of it was found to have S. aureus in it .
" If they had MRSA on their skin , they would 've had MRSA in the sand , " Plano said .
It 's unclear if staph and MRSA incubate in ocean water , she said .
" We know that MRSA can be isolated from marine mammals such as dolphins and seals , which suggests MRSA is still in the water , " she said , but more research needs to be done to find out how long organisms can survive in the water .
Recommendations : shower
Still , there is no reason to shun the beach , Plano said , but people should shower before and after going in the water .
And , it is wise to avoid the beach if you have an open wound .
Plano just wants people to be aware of the potential risks of S. aureus and MRSA at the beach .
" This is a very complicated issue , " she said .
" There is a tremendous amount of work that still needs to be done for us to understand the risk of person at beach being exposed to Staph aureus .
You should n't fear the beach .
You go to the beach .
You should have fun .
You should embrace it . "
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation , the Florida Department of Health and Environmental Protection , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the Environmental Protection Agency .
" After experiencing years of sexual abuse and neglect Thomson and other former members of the organization may never know what " normal " is .
CINEMAX Reel Life documentary follows
Thomson as he searches for others who have tried to start a new life outside the cult - and searches for answers about his own lost childhood .
Children of God ( now known as The Family ) started in 1968 in California .
It was part of the Jesus movement of the late 1960s , and many early converts were hippies .
In 1974 , The Family began a method of evangelism called " flirty fishing " - using sex to show God 's love and win converts .
Flirty fishing has been compared by some to religious prostitution , and was discontinued in 1987 .
David Berg , the founder and prophetic leader of the cult , communicated with his followers via " Mo Letters " - letters of instruction and counsel on a myriad of spiritual and practical subjects .
Following Berg 's death in late 1994 , his wife , Karen Zerby , became leader of The Family .
In CHILDREN OF GOD : LOST AND FOUND , Noah Thomson sets out to interview other ex-Children of God , discovering that these young , second - generation members have often failed to thrive in the outside world , turning to drugs , crime and suicide , unable to adjust to a society indifferent to their abuse as children .
Surprisingly , a few still find value in the Children of God , bowing to the organization 's request that they not give interviews , or telling Thomson they see nothing wrong with their upbringing .
Thomson also reaches out to his mother several times in the film , asking her to be interviewed and defend the family she has chosen in place of her actual family .
ABOUT THE FILMMAKER : Noah Thomson was born in Brazil in 1976 in a Children of God commune .
As a child he moved around often , living in campers and tents in various communes .
At 18 , he moved to a commune in Japan and worked for the Children of God 's in - house video production unit .
After leaving the cult , he started collecting video footage to document his childhood .
Children of God : Lost and Found is his first film .
He lives in Brooklyn . " *** related links : www.liveleak.com/browse?q=scientology+%26+me& ;s=Search + All "

Encuentro de Familias lleva 8 mil registros
[ email protected ]
La Arquidiócesis de México cuestionó los principios del Estado mexicano , al que acusó de haberse extralimitado en sus funciones , convirtiéndose en un “ educador absolutista ” y planteó la urgencia de legislar en favor de la vida , la familia y la educación religiosa .
En el editorial de su órgano informativo Desde la fe , la institución urgió a replantear el tema de la educación religiosa , “ más allá de atavismos y fobias ” , y anticipó que esta discusión será uno de los temas del VI Encuentro Mundial de las Familias , que se realizará en la ciudad de México del 14 al 18 de enero .
“ El enorme deterioro social en que vivimos es consecuencia de un vacío espiritual y de una ausencia de valores , propiciada por un malentendido Estado laico que ha dejado en la indigencia de valores a la educación pública ” , aseguró en el texto titulado “ La educación en la familia ” .
“ El pretexto era perfecto : la educación religiosa quedaba erradicada del contexto público , en el que sólo sería posible difundir las ideas del Estado : socialismo , comunismo , nacional socialismo ( nazis ) , nacionalismo revolucionario , etc ” , sostuvo .
Superar los anacronismos del siglo XIX y dar el paso a una sociedad moderna , tolerante y respetuosa de los derechos humanos ” , reconociendo la importancia que tienen las convicciones religiosas en la formación de la conciencia y para mejorar la convivencia social , es un tema pendiente aun en México , sostuvo .
Sobre los preparativos del encuentro , la Arquidiócesis informó que hasta la fecha se han registrado más de 8 mil personas .
Las actividades serán presididas por el cardenal Tarcisio Bertone , secretario de Estado del Vaticano .
Forbes Hill , an animator from Los Angeles , was walking past Dupont Circle on Monday morning looking for an art gallery to visit when he noticed the Raging Grannies -- peace activists who set antiwar lyrics to familiar songs -- warbling away at a microphone on a makeshift stage .
Then he spied a 25 - foot - tall inflatable President Bush figure in a “ Mission Accomplished ” flight suit .
People were chucking shoes at it .
Hill had stumbled across one of the few angry gatherings in a town bathed in good vibes in anticipation of today ’s inauguration of Barack Obama .
( Well , angry - ish .
Everyone who threw shoes smiled and giggled in spite of themselves . )
The shoe hurling , sponsored by several anti-Bush , pro-peace groups , was inspired by Iraqi journalist Muntather Zaidi , who threw his shoes at Bush last month during a Baghdad news conference .

Hill ’s sister , Ashley Hill of Durango , Colo. , picked up a pair of strappy brown leather sandals from one of the piles of donated shoes strewn around Dupont Circle .
Hill pointed his camera phone .
“ This is totally cathartic , ” Hill said as he snapped a shot of Ashley launching the sandals .
“ How can you resist ? ”
The shoes bounced off the midsection of the giant Bush , forcing a local television cameraman to duck as they sailed past his head .
On the stage nearby -- behind a neat line of boots , loafers and sneakers -- Gael Murphy , co-founder of the antiwar group Code Pink , called Zaidi courageous and thanked “ everyone who has stood up and spoken truth to power in their own way . ”

“ Hold onto your shoes , ” Murphy said to the crowd of about 100 protesters .
“ The struggle is not over . ”
Barbara Cummings , a retired government worker from San Diego , solicited signatures for a petition urging Atty .
Gen.- designate Eric H. Holder Jr. to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for war crimes .
She also sold posters featuring Bush and Cheney ’s faces behind bars , with the slogan “ I have a dream . ”
“ Just because we ’ve elected a new president does n’t negate that crimes were committed , ” Cummings said .
“ Obama has said that no one is above the law .
Bush and Cheney have admitted proudly they condoned torture .
We will never regain our moral standing in the world if we just allow these criminals to say , ‘ Bye bye . ’ ”
The shoe hurlers planned to march later to the White House , where a few were going to toss their ammunition over the fence .

This year ’s protests are expected to be notably mild compared , for example , with 1973 ’s raucous anti-Vietnam War demonstrations aimed at President Nixon or the angry shouts of “ Hail to the thief ! ” in 2001 after George W. Bush ’s disputed victory over Al Gore .
A handful of anti-Obama protests -- most centered around the abortion issue -- were planned for Inauguration Day .
The Rev. Patrick Mahoney , director of the Christian Defense Coalition , said his group would carry anti-abortion banners near the swearing - in .
“ We want to send a clear signal to President Obama from Day One , from the very moment you are sworn in , the pro-life community will be there . ”
Obama , who favors abortion rights , has muted some of the criticism by choosing evangelical Pastor Rick Warren to give the invocation at today ’s ceremony .
Members of the Save Darfur Coalition plan to circulate petitions urging Obama to act on the crisis in war - torn Sudan .

Meanwhile , at the base of the Dupont Circle fountain , the political theater intensified as a gray - haired man in a bright orange prisoner ’s jumpsuit prepared to be “ waterboarded . ”
He was thrown to the ground ( gently ) , his face covered by a towel ( on top of a clear plastic face mask ) and his “ torturer ” doused his head with a gallon of water .
The “ victim , ” Steve Lane , a chemist who lives in Bethesda , Md. , and writes grants for the National Institutes of Health , looked shaken when it was all over .
“ It ’s so horrible , this feeling of helplessness , ” Lane said .
“ Even though it ’s make - believe , it still panicked me when the water accidentally got in my mouth . ”
This was the fifth or sixth time Lane had volunteered for “ waterboarding ” at an anti-Bush demonstration , he said .
Advertisement
“ We were doing a leash thing like they did at Abu Ghraib , ” he said , referring to the infamous photographs of Iraqi prisoners being mistreated by American soldiers .
“ Then this guy I work with on this said , ‘ Let ’s step it up a notch . ’
So that ’s what we did . ”

Millions of Iraqis vote amid tight security
Millions of Iraqis have gone to polls on Saturday in the country ’s first election in four years .
Security was tight , and no one had been reported injured or killed .
Protected by armed police and barbed wire , Iraqis voted at polling stations to elect new provincial councils , widely seen as a test of the country ’s stability as the U.S. role in Iraq diminishes .
More than 14,000 candidates , including about 3,900 women , are competing for 440 seats in 14 of Iraq ’s 18 provinces .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , accompanied by a bodyguard , dipped his finger into an ink box after voting in the walled Green Zone enclave in Baghdad .
“ This gives a picture of trust in the government , the elections and the people ’s right to take part in this democratic process , ” he said .
Watch the video here :
Btrfs merged for 2.6.29
It appears that the questions regarding merging the Btrfs filesystem for 2.6.29 have been resolved : Linus just merged Btrfs into the mainline repository .
Congratulations to Chris Mason and company ; now all they have to do is to make it stable enough for us to trust our data to it .
It seems likely that the squashfs filesystem ( a read - only filesystem used on embedded systems and live CDs ) will also go in ; as Andrew Morton put it : " We 've long needed a filesystem named after a vegetable . "
Why You 'll Love Paying for Roads That Used to Be Free : A Guest Post
Eric A. Morris is a researcher at U.C.L.A. ’s Institute of Transportation Studies , concentrating on a variety of transportation issues including history , economics , and management .
He weighed in here earlier on the gas tax .
Here is his first of two posts on road tolls .
Why You ’ll Love Paying for Roads That Used to Be Free
By Eric A. Morris
A Guest Post
To end the scourge of traffic congestion , Julius Caesar banned most carts from the streets of Rome during daylight hours .
It did n’t work — traffic jams just shifted to dusk .
Two thousand years later , we have put a man on the moon and developed garments infinitely more practical than the toga , but we seem little nearer to solving the congestion problem .
If you live in a city , particularly a large one , you probably need little convincing that traffic congestion is frustrating and wasteful .
According to the Texas Transportation Institute , the average American urban traveler lost 38 hours , nearly one full work week , to congestion in 2005 .
And congestion is getting worse , not better ; urban travelers in 1982 were delayed only 14 hours that year .
Americans want action , but unfortunately there are n’t too many great ideas about what that action might be .
As Anthony Downs ‘s excellent book Still Stuck in Traffic : Coping With Peak - Hour Traffic Congestion chronicles , most of the proposed solutions are too difficult to implement , wo n’t work , or both .
Fortunately , there is one remedy which is both doable and largely guaranteed to succeed .
In the space of a year or two we could have you zipping along the 405 or the LIE at the height of rush hour at a comfortable 55 miles per hour .
There ’s just one small problem with this silver bullet for congestion : many people seem to prefer the werewolf .
Despite its merits , this policy , which is known as “ congestion pricing , ” “ value pricing , ” or “ variable tolling , ” is not an easy political sell .
For decades , economists and other transportation thinkers have advocated imposing tolls that vary with congestion levels on roadways .
Simply put , the more congestion , the higher the toll , until the congestion goes away .
To many people , this sounds like a scheme by mustache - twirling bureaucrats and their academic apologists to fleece drivers out of their hard - earned cash .
Why should drivers have to pay to use roads their tax dollars have already paid for ?
Wo n’t the remaining free roads be swamped as drivers are forced off the tolled roads ?
Wo n’t the working - class and poor be the victims here , as the tolled routes turn into “ Lexus lanes ” ?
And besides , adopting this policy would mean listening to economists , and who wants to do that ?
There ’s a real problem with this logic , which is that , on its own terms , it makes perfect sense ( except for the listening to economists part ) .
Opponents of tolls are certainly not stupid , and their arguments deserve serious consideration .
But in the end , their concerns are largely overblown , and the benefits of tolling swamp the potential costs .
Unfortunately , it can be hard to convey this because the theory behind tolling is somewhat complex and counterintuitive .
This is too bad , because variable tolling is an excellent public policy .
Here ’s why : the basic economic theory is that when you give out something valuable — in this case , road space — for less than its true value , shortages result .
Ultimately , there ’s no free lunch ; instead of paying with money , you pay with the effort and time needed to acquire the good .
Think of Soviet shoppers spending their lives in endless queues to purchase artificially low - priced but exceedingly scarce goods .
Then think of Americans who can fulfill nearly any consumerist fantasy quickly but at a monetary cost .
Free but congested roads have left us shivering on the streets of Moscow .
To consider it another way , delay is an externality imposed by drivers on their peers .
By driving onto a busy road and contributing to congestion , drivers slow the speeds of others — but they never have to pay for it , at least not directly .
In the end , of course , everybody pays , because as we impose congestion on others , others impose it on us .
This degenerates into a game that nobody can win .
Markets work best when externalities are internalized : i.e. , you pay for the hassle you inflict on others .
I ’ve blogged on the externalities inherent in driving on this blog , and Levitt and Dubner wrote about it here .
Using tolls to help internalize the congestion externality would somewhat reduce the number of trips made on the most congested roads at the peak usage periods ; some trips would be moved to less congested times and routes , and others would be foregone entirely .
This way we would cut down on the congestion costs we impose on each other .
Granted , tolls cannot fully cope with accidents and other incidents , which are major causes of delay .
But pricing can largely eliminate chronic , recurring congestion .
No matter how high the demand for a road , there is a level of toll that will keep it flowing freely .
To make tolling truly effective , the price must be right .
Too high a price drives away too many cars and the road does not function at its capacity .
Too low a price and congestion is n’t licked .
The best solution is to vary the tolls in real time based on an analysis of current traffic conditions .
Pilot toll projects on roads ( like the I - 394 in Minnesota and the I - 15 in Southern California ) use sensors embedded in the pavement to monitor the number and speeds of vehicles on the facility .
A simple computer program then determines the number of cars that should be allowed in .
The computer then calculates the level of toll that will attract that number of cars — and no more .
Prices are then updated every few minutes on electronic message signs .
Hi -tech transponders and antenna arrays make waiting at toll booths a thing of the past .
The bottom line is that speeds are kept high ( over 45 m.p.h. ) so that throughput is higher than when vehicles are allowed to crowd all at once onto roadways at rush hour , slowing traffic to a crawl ( more on how this works in a minute ) .
To maximize efficiency , economists would like to price all travel , starting with the freeways .
But given that elected officials have no burning desire to lose their jobs , a more realistic option , for now , is to toll just some freeway lanes that are either new capacity or underused carpool lanes .
The other lanes would be left free — and congested .
Drivers will then have a choice : wait or pay .
Granted , neither is ideal .
But right now drivers have no choice at all .
What ’s the bottom line here ?
The state of Washington recently opened congestion - priced lanes on its State Route 167 .
The peak toll in the first month of operation ( reached on the evening of Wednesday , May 21 ) was $ 5.75 .
I know , I know , you would never pay such an exorbitant amount when America has taught you that free roads are your birthright .
But that money bought Washington drivers a 27 - minute time savings .
Is a half hour of your time worth $ 6 ?
I think I already know the answer , and it is “ it depends . ”
Most people ’s value of time varies widely depending on their activities on any given day .
Late for picking the kids up from daycare ?
Paying $ 6 to save a half hour is an incredible bargain .
Have to clean the house ?
The longer your trip home takes , the better .
Tolling will introduce a new level of flexibility and freedom into your life , giving you the power to tailor your travel costs to fit your schedule .
But is this fair ?
Have n’t we already paid for these roads with our tax dollars ?
Wo n’t the wealthy buy their way out of congestion , while the rest of us are stuck ?
And wo n’t conditions in the free lanes deteriorate as they are packed with all the drivers who have fled the toll lanes ?
These are perfectly legitimate and important concerns .
But I should warn you : toll advocates are a pretty dogged bunch , and they have an answer to everything .
I ’ll let you know their ( quite convincing ) responses to these questions in my next post .

Ever since we deployed scarling in production , its name has progressed from being a stale joke to an annoyance .
It started out as a test of porting starling to scala , but as features have been added and it's been hardened by the real world , it has needed its own identity .
I wanted to stay with the bird theme , because I think it 's cute , so after spending several days mulling over possible new names , I 've settled on " kestrel " .
Poof !
And so it is .
What was scarling is now kestrel .
I 've updated the code and github page : http://github.com/robey/kestrel/tree/master
Meanwhile , over the last couple of weeks , I 've added three big features .
One of the working assumptions of kestrel is that queues are normally empty .
A healthy system has more consumers than producers , so new work items are gobbled up as fast as they come in , and we can usually keep all queued items in memory , for the rare times there are any items queued at all .
However , you may have an event -- like a realigning US presidential election -- which causes brief " high traffic " bursts that temporarily overwhelm consumers .
It became clear at Twitter that we needed to have a graceful soft - landing for these bursts , to prevent kestrel from running out of memory or needing manual intervention .
In kestrel 's git -head , now , when a queue passes a memory limit ( 128 MB by default ) , that queue will be dropped into what I call " read - behind mode " .
New items are added to the queue by writing them into the queue 's journal , but not kept around in memory .
Instead , we just keep the first 128MB of the queue head in memory , and track a second file pointer to our journal .
As items are read from the queue , this new file pointer replays the journal from behind , filling the queue back up until it either catches up with the write pointer or fills up 128 MB again .
In effect , we 're keeping a window of the head of the queue in memory , and using the journal as a disk store for the rest .
It nicely caps memory consumption and the added disk I/O can be amortized out across consumers .
You probably do n't want to let an out - of - control queue grow forever because it will fill up your disk , but this should make it cope well with short - term spikes and give you one less thing to worry about when the snake is trying to swallow the pig .
Something that 's bothered me about using the memcache protocol is that there 's no way for a consumer to do a blocking fetch from a queue .
If an item is immediately available , kestrel will give it to you .
If not , you 'll immediately get a " nothing " response .
Since , like I just said above , you always want to have more consumers / workers than work items , these consumers swarm all over the cluster , asking for work and immediately being sent away empty - handed .
Just to keep them from going crazy , we have ruby client code that looks something like this : Good grief .
If we 're going to let the workers take a nap on the job , we could at least make it happen while blocking on a queue fetch .
So I did a little sneaky thing with queue names in the memcache " get " command by letting clients add options to the end , separated by slashes .
Slashes are n't allowed in filenames anyway so they were never valid in queue names .
Then I made a timeout option , so a client can ask to block for work for some amount of time : The " " option means " if there 's nothing in the queue right now , I 'm willing to wait up to 250 milliseconds for something to arrive " .
After that timeout , if there 's still nothing , kestrel will answer with the usual empty - response .
It 's important here to make sure that your memcache client is set to have a read - timeout larger than the timeout you send in the " get " request .
This was the easiest thing to implement after I worked out how .
Each queue just has a kernel - style wait - list of clients attached to it .
If a client makes a timeout - style " get " request , and the queue is empty , we just put the client on the wait - list and the client 's actor does ato wait for a message saying something new has arrived .
When items are put on the queue , the first wait - list client is removed from the wait - list and notified .
Theload test exercises this by having 100 ( or 500 ) clients pile on to a queue with blocking fetches while a single producer slowly trickles out data .
It seems to work like a charm .
Writing something into a queue is pretty reliable .
The client does a " set " operation , and if it worked , kestrel responds " " .
Naturally , it only sends that response after the item has been written into the queue 's journal file .
The " " response means kestrel has taken responsibility for the item .
Fetching from a queue is not such a happy story .
When kestrel sends an item to a client , it will never get an acknowledgement or confirmation , and has to blithely assume that the client got all the data okay and took responsibility for it .
If a client loses its connection during the data transfer , or crashes right after receiving a work item , that item is gone forever .
So I added an " open " option to " get " which opens a tentative fetch on a queue .
If an item is available , kestrel will remove it from the queue and send it to the client as usual .
But it will also set the item aside and prepare to " un-get " it if the client disconnects without confirming it .
So a tentative fetch is started with : and confirmed with : which returns nothing .
For efficiency , you can also confirm a previous fetch and get the next item in one operation ( avoiding an extra round - trip ) : Each client connection may only have one outstanding tentative fetch , and if a connection is dropped , any tentatively - fetched item will be put back on the head of the queue and given to the next available consumer .
I want to briefly make a distinction here between confirming that a client receives an enqueued item and confirming that some useful work was done on it .
Kestrel can really only concern itself with the former .
As a good queue server , it would like confirmation that a client has accepted responsibility for an item before that item is erased from the queue and journal .
But it has no way of confirming that " something useful " was done with that item .
You still need to write careful client code to ensure that an item is n't lost after it 's received .
Using reliable fetch means you are protected from losing items , at the expense of potentially receiving duplicates -- that 's the trade - off .
A client may successfully handle a fetched item but crash before confirming it to kestrel , and the item may then be given to another client .
I think this is a good trade - off , though .
If you know you may handle some items twice , you can design your system so that duplicate work is harmless -- versus the case where you may lose items and do n't have any recourse .
With these three new features , you should be able to survive large bursts of traffic more easily ( with big queues ) , allow incoming items to be processed immediately by the next available consumer ( with blocking fetches ) , and deliver items reliably even to flaky consumers ( with reliable fetch ) .
They expanded the code size 50 % , from 1000 lines to 1500 , but I think they were worth it , because they solve several limitations inherited from starling .
In 1925 , the legendary British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett ventured into the Amazon , vowing to make one of the most important archeological discoveries in history .
He was searching for an ancient civilization , which he had named , simply , the City of Z . Ever since the Spanish conquistadores descended the Amazon River , in 1542 , perhaps no region on the planet had so ignited the imagination - or lured so many men to their death .
For centuries , the conquistadores had searched the jungle for the glittering kingdom of El Dorado .
The kingdom , which the conquistadores had heard about from Indians , was said to be so plentiful in gold that its inhabitants ground the metal into powder and blew it through " hollow canes upon their naked bodies . "
( El Dorado literally means the Gilded Man . )
Thousands had died looking for this golden realm .
Yet after a toll of suffering and death worthy of Joseph Conrad , most archeologists had concluded that El Dorado was no more than an illusion .
Many modern scientists have assumed that no complex civilization could have emerged in so hostile an environment , where the soil is agriculturally poor , mosquitoes transport lethal diseases , and predators lurk amid the forest canopy .
The Amazon 's brutal conditions have fueled one of the most enduring theories of human development : environmental determinism .
According to this theory , even if some early humans eked out an existence in the harshest conditions on the planet , they rarely advanced beyond a few primitive tribes .
Society , in other words , is a captive of geography .
Fawcett , however , was convinced that the Amazon wilderness - an area virtually the size of the continental United States - concealed the remnants of at least one , and probably more , highly advanced civilizations .
He was the last of a breed of explorers to venture into blank spots on the map with little more than a machete , a compass , and an almost divine sense of purpose , and he spent nearly two decades gathering evidence to prove his case and pinpointing a location .
With his 21 - year - old son , Jack , and Jack 's best friend , Raleigh Rimell , Fawcett finally set off into the Brazilian jungle to find the City of Z .
Then he and his party vanished , giving rise to what has been described as " the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century . "
Fawcett had warned that no one should follow in his wake due to the danger , but scores of scientists , explorers , and adventurers plunged into the wilderness , determined to recover the Fawcett party , alive or dead , and to return with proof of Z .
In February 1955 , the New York Times claimed that Fawcett 's disappearance had set off more searches " than those launched through the centuries to find the fabulous El Dorado . "
Some were wiped out by starvation and disease , or retreated in despair ; others were murdered by tribesmen firing arrows dipped in poison .
Then there were those adventurers who had gone to find Fawcett and , like him , simply disappeared in the forests that travelers had long ago christened the " green hell . "
History has been as unsparing of Fawcett as was the jungle .
Although his legend helped inspire Arthur Conan Doyle 's novel " The Lost World " and once spawned radio plays , poems , documentaries , movies , stamps , children 's stories , comic books , ballads , stage plays , and graphic novels , Fawcett has increasingly been forgotten .
Most scholars have dismissed him as a crank who sacrificed his life , and that of his son , in pursuit of a mad fantasy .
Yet in recent years archeologists have begun to find evidence of what Fawcett had always claimed : ancient ruins buried deep in the Amazon , in places ranging from the Bolivian flood plains to the Brazilian forests .
These ruins include enormous man-made earth mounds , plazas , geometrically aligned causeways , bridges , elaborately engineered canal systems , and even an apparent astronomical observatory tower made of huge granite rocks that has been dubbed " the Stonehenge of the Amazon . "
The discoveries are not only transforming our understanding of one of the most daring and eccentric explorers ever to set foot in the New World .
They are challenging long - held assumptions about the Amazon as a Hobbesian place where only small primitive tribes could ever have existed , and about the limits the environment placed on the rise of early civilizations .
And these revelations are exploding our perceptions of what the Americas really looked liked before the arrival of Christopher Columbus .
The idea did not strike Fawcett like a bolt of lightning .
Rather , the theory of Z developed over time , with one clue leading to the next .
Fawcett , who was born during the Victorian age of exploration , had trained as a surveyor at the Royal Geographical Society in London , the same place that had helped launch such explorers as Richard Burton and David Livingstone .
In 1906 , after serving as a British secret agent in Africa , Fawcett had been recruited by Bolivia , Brazil , and Peru to map the interior of the Amazon .
The region was still so unexplored that these countries could not even agree on their borders :
They were simply speculative lines sketched through forests and mountains .
It was during these epic journeys - journeys in which many of his men perished from disease and starvation - that Fawcett began to gather evidence of Z .
Over a span of nearly two decades , he made contact with various unknown tribes , documenting how they had brilliantly adapted to the conditions in the jungle .
They often used the Amazonian flood plains , which were more fertile than terra firma , to grow crops , and relied on elaborate ways of hunting and fishing .
As a result , they were able to generate enough food to sustain larger populations - a precursor to any sort of complex society with divisions of labor and political hierarchies such as chiefdoms and kingdoms .
" Food problems never bothered them , " Fawcett said .
Fawcett also studied the 16th - and 17th - century chronicles of the El Dorado hunters .
Even though the conquistadores had not found a golden kingdom , they had reported seeing " cities that glistened in white , " with temples , public squares , palisade walls , causeways , and exquisite artifacts .
Because later explorers never came across similar settlements - or indeed any large populations - it was assumed these descriptions , like El Dorado itself , were simply products of the conquistadores ' fervid imaginations .
But once while Fawcett was climbing a desolate mound of earth above the flood plains of the Bolivian Amazon , he noticed something sticking out of the ground .
He scooped it into his hand : it was a shard of pottery .
He started to scour the soil .
Virtually everywhere he scratched , he later wrote , he turned up bits of ancient , brittle pottery .
He thought the craftsmanship was as refined as anything from ancient Greece or Rome or China .
" Wherever there are ' alturas , ' that is high ground above the plains " in the Amazon basin , Fawcett said , " there are artifacts . "
And that was n't all : extending between these alturas , there appeared to be some sort of geometrically aligned paths .
They looked , he could swear , like " roads " and " causeways . "
Still , Fawcett struggled to make sense of his own findings .
The notion of a complex civilization in the Amazon contradicted the two ethnological paradigms that had prevailed since the first encounter between Europeans and Native Americans , more than 400 years earlier .
Though some of the first conquistadores were in awe of the civilizations that Native Americans had developed , many theologians debated whether these dark - skinned , scantily clad peoples were , in fact , human ; for how could the descendants of Adam and Eve have wandered so far , and how could the biblical prophets have been ignorant of them ?
In the mid-16th century , Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda , one of the Holy Roman Emperor 's chaplains , argued that the Indians were " half men " who should be treated as natural slaves .
At the time , the most forceful critic of this genocidal paradigm was Bartolomé de Las Casas , a Dominican friar who had traveled throughout the Americas .
In a famous debate with Sepúlveda and in a series of treatises , Las Casas tried to prove , once and for all , that Indians were equal humans ( " Are these not men ?
Do they not have rational souls ? " ) , and to condemn those " pretending to be Christians " who " wiped them from the face of the earth . "
In the process , however , he contributed to a conception of the Indians that became an equal staple of European ethnology : the " noble " savage .
According to Las Casas , the Indians were " the simplest people in the world , " " without malice or guile , " who are " totally uninterested in worldly power . "
Although in Fawcett 's era both conceptions remained popular in scholarly and popular literature , they were now filtered through a radical new scientific theory on the origins of humankind : evolution .
Victorians now attempted to make sense of human diversity not in theological terms but in biological ones .
A popular anthropology manual , which Fawcett studied , included chapters on " Anatomy and Physiology , " " Hair , " " Colour , " Odour , " " Physical Powers , " " Senses , " and " Heredity . "
The Victorians wanted to know , in effect , why some apes had evolved into English gentlemen and why some had n't .
Fawcett was deeply influenced by such racist ideas ; his writings are rife with images of Indians as " jolly children " and " ape - like " savages .
And he constantly struggled to reconcile what he saw with everything he had been taught .
The only thing he was certain of was that the Amazon and its people were not what everyone assumed them to be .
Too much evidence indicated that the jungle had once been the center of a great civilization .
After Fawcett disappeared , many scientists no longer doubted his theory on biological grounds .
The Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in Peru had obviously produced extraordinary cities , disproving any notion that Native Americans were somehow " half men " physically incapable of such feats .
Instead , many scholars assumed that the Amazon jungle was simply too inhospitable to sustain a sophisticated society .
Biological determinism had increasingly given way to environmental determinism .
And the Amazon - the great " counterfeit paradise , " as the archeologist Betty Meggers famously coined it - was the most vivid proof of the Malthusian limits that the environment placed on civilizations .
And then slowly it began to happen .
After many archeologists had ignored the Amazon , assuming nothing of import would be found , a small group of revisionist scholars started to visit the region .
Unlike their predecessors , they were often aided by an array of sophisticated tools , including ground - penetrating radar , satellite imagery to map sites , and remote sensors that can pinpoint buried artifacts .
And what they found , in the words of one archeologist , was " earth shattering . "
In the last few years , a team of researchers led by the archeologist Michael Heckenberger uncovered 20 pre-Columbian settlements in the Xingu region of the southern basin of the Amazon - the very region where Fawcett believed he would find the City of Z and where he disappeared .
These settlements , which were occupied roughly between 800 and 1600 AD , included houses and moats and palisade walls .
There were causeways and roads , which connected the settlements together .
There were plazas laid out along cardinal points , from east to west , and roads positioned at the same geometric angles .
( Fawcett had reported that Indians told him legends that described " many streets set at right angles to one another . " )
According to the scientists , each cluster of settlements contained anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 people , which means that the larger communities were the size of many medieval European cities .
" These people had a cultural aesthetic of monumentality , " Heckenberger said .
" They liked to have beautiful roads and plazas and bridges . "
Other scientists are fueling this revolution in archeology , which is upending the view of the Amazon as a place that could never sustain what Fawcett had envisioned : a prosperous , glorious civilization .
Anna Roosevelt , a great - granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt , who is an archeologist at the University of Illinois , has uncovered in a cave near Santarém , in the Brazilian Amazon , the remains of a settlement at least 10,000 years old - about twice as old as scientists had estimated the human presence in the Amazon .
Drunk Dialing / Sexting
Trying to seduce your ex with drunken gibberish at 3 in the morning is ...
The paradigm has shifted .
Dating is dated .
Hooking up is here to stay .
( For those over 30 years old : hooking up is a casual sexual encounter with no expectation of future emotional commitment .
Think of it as a one - night stand with someone you know . )
According to a report released this spring by Child Trends , a Washington research group , there are now more high school seniors saying that they never date than seniors who say that they date frequently .
Apparently , it ’s all about the hookup .
When I first heard about hooking up years ago , I figured that it was a fad that would soon fizzle .
I was wrong .
It seems to be becoming the norm .
I should point out that just because more young people seem to be hooking up instead of dating does n’t mean that they ’re having more sex ( they ’ve been having less , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) or having sex with strangers ( they ’re more likely to hook up with a friend , according to a 2006 paper in the Journal of Adolescent Research ) .

In January , the Federal Reserve released its latest survey on the current state of the U.S. banking system .
The survey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ titled Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices Ã¢â‚¬â€œ contains a review of bank lending practices for the previous three months .
The survey is based on input from 53 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks .
By reviewing this document , it is possible to review how effective the injection of billions of dollars has been with regards to convincing the commercial banks to free up credit .
To read the complete survey results , go to the federal reserve website and search for “ Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey ” .
Commercial Real Estate Lending
According to the survey , about 80 percent of the domestic banks questioned reveal that during the survey period , they have tightened their lending standards for commercial real estate ( CRE ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ this is down slightly from the 85 percent that claimed to have tightened requirements for the three - month survey released in October of 2008 .
At the same time , commercial lenders report that demand for CRE loans weakened by about 55 percent .
In addition , the survey also found that 95 percent of domestic banks surveyed increased loan - rate spreads compared to foreign banks reporting a 75 percent increase in loan - rate spreads .
Residential and Household Lending
One of the key areas for household lending remains the need for mortgages and 45 percent of the institutions reported a tightening of lending standards compared to nearly 70 percent for the previous period .
This is a notable decrease but also noteworthy is the 10 percent overall drop in demand for residential mortgages .
In addition , only four banks continued to offer subprime mortgages during the survey period .
The availability of home equity lines of credit ( HELOCs ) appears to have increased slightly with over 60 percent of domestic lenders reporting they have tightened lending standards .
This is down from the 75 percent reported in the previous survey but still indicates an overall lack of credit available for consumer lines of credit within the banking system for many consumers .
Finally , nearly half of the banks surveyed have raised the minimum credit scores required to obtain consumer loans and credit cards .
This is in conjunction with reduced credit limits as 45 percent of the institutions claim they have lowered the credit limits on both existing credit card holders as well as new credit card accounts .
So , what conclusions can we draw from this ?
Overall , the survey shows that there has been Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at best Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a slight increase in the availability of credit for some types of corporate and consumer loans .
Given that the commercial banks have received several hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars already and will soon receive even more , many are questioning if the banks are doing enough to ease the credit crunch .
President Obama and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner have made it clear that they expect the banks to make more money available for lending and the possibility of nationalizing the banking system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least in the short - term Ã¢â‚¬â€œ may yet be one option the Obama administration employs to meet this goal .
In fairness , this survey contains information for the final quarter of 2008 only but the next survey expected for the end of April will coincide with the release of another $ US 2 trillion by the Treasury Department .
You can bet that Obama and Geithner will be paying close attention to the results of this survey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a fact that will not be lost on the banks .

RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP )  Blackwater Worldwide is abandoning the brand name that has been tarnished by its work in Iraq , settling on Xe ( pronounced zee ) as the new name for its family of two dozen businesses .
Blackwater Lodge and Training Center , the subsidiary that conducts much of the company ’s overseas operations and domestic training , has been renamed U.S. Training Center Inc. , the company said Friday .
The company ’s rebranding effort grew more urgent after Blackwater guards in Baghdad were involved in a shooting episode in September 2007 that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead .
Blackwater ’s president , Gary Jackson , said in a memo to employees that the new name reflected the company ’s shift away from providing private security .
He has said the company is going to focus on training .

Ever since I was 15 I ’ve been coming up with ways to make money .
For some reason , I ’ve always had the internal belief that I ’m going to be very successful when it comes to finances .
At 19 , having a lot of money is n’t as important to me now as it was to my old egotistical self , but I still want to be comfortable .
There are definitely areas of personal finance that I could improve upon , but I think some of the fundamentals I ’ve stuck to have kept me in a relatively good position compared to others my age .
Hopefully , despite my youth , I ’ll be able to share something here that you can apply to your own situation .
6 Things I ’ve Learned
Before we start , I want to say the obligatory : I am by no means a financial advisor so my words should n’t be taken as fact .
However , hopefully you ’ll see these , often common sense , ideas as beneficial to your own wealth generation and apply them where relevant .
1 ) Keep Doing What You ’ve Done , Keep Getting the Same Results
It amazes me how many people can moan about the likes of living from paycheck to paycheck and make absolutely no change to their spending habits month after month .
As the saying goes , if you keep doing what you ’ve always done , you ’ll keep getting the same results you ’ve always gotten .
This applies to many areas of life but especially to finances .
If you ’re in debt then the simple solution is this : earn more money than you spend , or , spend less money then you earn .
If you want to start saving money and you have n’t been doing so previously , you ’ll obviously need to cut back your spending habits .
2 ) The Most Expensive Items are Rarely Necessary
Although you may be thinking “ but I do n’t go for the expensive items anyway ” , I ’m speaking as someone who is n’t yet twenty years old .
I ’m sure you can all relate to your youth ( or you may be there now ) where everyone wants the best MP3 player , the coolest phone and the most impressive car .
For me , it was turntables .
I got into DJ’ing over 2 years ago and instantly knew I had to buy Technics 1210 ’s , they are the best in the industry and retail at around $ 1200 brand new .
Even though I was 16 and playing only to my friends in my bedroom , I thought they were a must .
I ended up saving my money for almost a year to afford them , but I eventually got my hands on a pair .
These days , I ’m much wiser as to where my money goes , I do n’t need the latest iPhone and my laptop is 4 years old .
If it is n’t broke ( and still fairly optimal ) , do n’t fix it .
3 ) Showing Off is the Highest Form of Ego and Lowest Form of ‘ Cool ’
If you can afford to show off with your cash then great , but it does n’t mean you have to .
Teenagers especially like to show people how much money they have , and this was further pushed into my reality when watching ‘ My Sweet 16th ’ — the TV show where millionaires spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to throw their daughters a birthday party .
Often though , the sad case is that people who really do n’t have the cash spend what they have in order to look better in the eyes of others .
Sometimes it is to fit in and appear cool , other times it ’s just about the ego .
If you ’re spending money just to look good to others then that is a low form of fulfilment and the relationships you gain are n’t going to be of much substance .
An old friend of mine from high school used to be very popular until he started talking about how expensive his watch was , how much money he earned and which car he was going to buy .
People started seeing him for what he really was .
People are n’t interested in your false self , there ’s nothing for them to connect with .
4 ) Rash Spending Will Catch Up to You
I registered my own limited company when I was 17 so that I could legally start offering internet marketing services .
When I decided I wanted to start a company I just quickly Googled “ Register a company online ” and went with the first service I found .
The price was only $ 50 to set - up a company which I did n’t think was bad at the time .
My haste led me to missing the $ 300 charge after a year which was explained in the terms of service ( I guess you should read them sometimes ) .
Needless to say , since that incident I ’m much more careful about what I sign up for and where I ’m spending my money .
If something is worth buying , it ’s worth the time to make sure you are getting the best deal for your money and that there wo n’t be any nasty extras like I found myself with .
5 ) Actually Spend Time to Look at Your Income / Outgoings
This is probably one of the most common bits of advice you ’ll see on finance related articles , but let ’s be honest – who actually does this ?
I know personally this is something I had never really wanted to do , mostly due to the time and effort it would take .
However , I ’ve started taking a more responsible attitude to my dealings , especially regarding outgoings .
In fact , now that I work from home full - time this is even more important to me as I need to make sure that my income is matching my targets .
Even if it ’s just for one month , or if you find that too challenging , just one week , actually take the time to record where your money is going and where it is coming from .
The most important thing you should look for are any unnecessary expenditures you are making ; you might surprise yourself and see a few things you can cut back on .
6 ) If You Must Take Risks , Take Affordable Ones
This might be a rare occurrence , but it ’s likely that there will be times when you need to take risks in order to reap some potential rewards .
This might be in the form of an investment , an idea you would like to take into production or even just some fun gambling .
As the point states , if you have to take a risk , make sure it ’s an affordable one .
By that I mean consider the worst possible scenario .
Ideally , the worst possible scenario is going to leave you in a situation that is n’t financially abundant , but one that is at least financially stable .
As any sensible gambler will tell you , “ Do n’t bet more than you ’re willing to lose ” .

Detailed flow chart orders officers to respond to negative material
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , Jan 9th , 2009
The US Air Force has announced a “ counter - blog ” response plan aimed at fielding and reacting to material from bloggers who have “ negative opinions about the US government and the Air Force . ”
The plan , created by the public affairs arm of the Air Force , includes a detailed twelve - point “ counter blogging ” flow - chart that dictates how officers should tackle what are described as “ trolls , ” “ ragers , ” and “ misguided ” online writers .
Wired blog Danger Room summarizes how the chart lays out a range of possible responses to a blog post :
Airmen can offer a “ factual and well - cited response [ that ] is not factually erroneous , a rant or rage , bashing or negative in nature . ”
They can “ let the post stand — no response . ”
Or they can “ fix the facts , ” offering up fresh perspective .
No matter what , the chart says , airmen should “ disclose your Air Force connection , ” “ respond in a tone that reflects high on the rich heritage of the Air Force , ” and “ focus on the most - used sites related to the Air Force . ”
Another option offered by the chart is to “ monitor the site for relevant information and comments ” while reporting back to HQ .
Of course , the type of bloggers that Air Force officers will be able to respond to may be limited due to the fact that the Air Force actively blocks access to just about any independent site with the word “ blog ” in its web address .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
No doubt the Web Posting Response Assessment plan is an offshoot of the Air Force ’s “ national cybersecurity initiative “ , an ongoing $ 11 million project which is also seeking the capability to hack into , fully control and even destroy any form of computer or network in existence .
( Article continues below )
We have previously reported on similar efforts on behalf of the military and the government to quell online dissent , as well as more broadly control the information available to the American public .
Multiple programs are currently being rolled out by the Pentagon and its offshoot agencies such as DARPA , in a secret war with the internet that has been described as a $ 30 billion “ electronic Manhattan Project “ .
Such ongoing efforts to infiltrate the Internet and propagandize for the war on terror are well documented .
CENTCOM has programs underway to infiltrate blogs and message boards to ensure people , “ have the opportunity to read positive stories , ” presumably about how Iraq is a wonderful liberated democracy and the war on terror really is about protecting Americans from Al - CIAda .
In May 2008 , it was revealed that the Pentagon was expanding “ Information Operations ” on the Internet with purposefully set up foreign news websites , designed to look like independent media sources but in reality carrying direct military propaganda .
More recently the New York Times published an expose on privately hired operatives who have been appearing on all major US news networks promoting the interests and operations of the Pentagon and generating favorable news coverage of the Bush administration while posing as independent military analysts .
This operation was formally announced
In 2006 when the Pentagon set up a unit to “ better promote its message across 24 - hour rolling news outlets , and particularly on the internet ” .
Again , the Pentagon said the move would boost its ability to counter “ inaccurate ” news stories and exploit new media .
The program represents another wing of the Pentagon ’s Office of Strategic Influence , publicly announced after 9/11 but simply the latest incarnation of a PR brainwashing scam that spans back decades .
The OSI exploited legal loopholes by planting its propaganda in foreign newspapers that would later be picked up by U.S. newswires .
In today ’s environment even that seems quaint , with the Pentagon openly and proudly shouting from the rooftops that they will knowingly violate the law to indoctrinate the American people .
Perhaps the most alarming case of the military ’s information tentacles burrowing their influence deep into media circles in recent years was in February 2000 , when another branch of the same Pentagon propaganda bureau , Psychological Operations Command ( PSYOPS ) , had placed their operatives “ in the news division at CNN ’s Atlanta headquarters as part of an “ internship ” program starting in the final days of the Kosovo War . ”
FAIR speculated that the purpose was twofold , one to directly propagandize the American people via CNN and also potentially to allow the “ military to conduct an intelligence - gathering mission against the network itself , ” because the “ military needed to find ways to “ gain control ” over commercial news satellites to help bring down an “ informational cone of silence ” over regions where special operations were taking place . ”
With the knowledge that government propagandists were utilizing U.S. news network hubs at CNN to run what was described as a “ vast psychological warfare operation of the kind the military conducts to influence a population in enemy territory , ” and that this took place almost eight years ago – just imagine how infested today ’s networks and newsrooms are with paid agent provocateur propagandists whose sole job specification is to orchestrate methods of mind control over the population of the United States .
In October 2005 Government Accountability Office investigators concluded that the Bush administration ’s secret policy to pay off influential journalists to plant fake news and positive spin on Bush ’s policies was illegal and that the “ administration had disseminated “ covert propaganda ” in the United States , in violation of a statutory ban . ”
A study by media watchdog Center for Media and Democracy revealed that , over a ten month span , 77 television stations from all across the nation aired video news releases without informing their viewers even once that the reports were actually sponsored content .
Some of the fake news segments talked up success in the war in Iraq , or promoted specific companies ’ products .
The consequences were not the drafting of new legislation that would clearly outlaw such actions in future , nor any form of criminal proceedings against the protagonists .
The upshot of it all was a slap on the wrist for conservative commentator Armstrong Williams and a request that he pay back part of the money that the government had given him – not even all of it .
“ Armstrong Williams is going to pay back $ 34,000 to the government for work he failed to deliver , but who ’s going to pay the taxpayers for the rest of the quarter million dollars Williams was paid for his propaganda services to the administration ? , ” asked Congressman George Miller , as the Justice Department hurried a settlement and swept the whole sordid affair under the rug .
See the Prisonplanet archive on Government Use Of Fake News for more examples of these practices .
These operations equate to a formal declaration of psychological warfare on the American people .
The military is engaging in direct propaganda and indoctrination .
Recent history clearly indicates this is just the latest outreach of an insipid brainwashing agenda that is totally unlawful and anathema to the U.S. Constitution .
The White House has made it perfectly clear that it will target American citizens for propagating information harmful to the interests of the U.S. government and classify them as enemy combatants .
This is codified in sub-section 27 of section 950 v. of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
Bush ’s own strategy document for “ winning the war on terror ” identifies “ conspiracy theorists , ” meaning anyone who exposes government corruption and its lies about major domestic and world events , as “ terrorists recruiters , ” and vows to eliminate their influence in society .
We have even seen the proposal of legislation that would require bloggers to register with and regularly report their activities to Congress or face prison .
The eminently hypocritical tenet of the suggestion that the military and the Air Force need to “ Fix the facts ” , correct “ inaccurate statements ” and “ set the record straight ” is borne out by the fact that they participated in the dissemination of the most lurid and damaging propaganda since Hitler ’s final speech – a deliberately fomented lie about weapons of mass destruction that has killed over one million Iraqis and thousands of American soldiers .
It is they who constitute the “ ragers ” and “ trolls ” and it is we the alternative media – the fifth estate – that should mobilize in the infowar to counter their spurious deception .

Functional Programming Unit Testing – Using Type Classes Tuesday , January 20 , 2009
I wanted to take a brief sidebar from the refactoring conversation that I ’ve been having in the past couple of posts , and focus on QuickCheck again .
In the next post , I ’ll get back to refactoring with HLint .
In this post , I want to talk about using type classes to implement operators to use for QuickChecks property - based tests .
Let ’s get caught up to where we are today :
Utilizing Type Classes
In the previous post about , “ How Would the CLR be Different ? ” , I stated that I wished the CLR made it easier for higher - kinded polymorpishm to allow for better type classes .
But , let ’s step back for just a second to talk about how type classes can help us .
Let ’s say for example , that we ’d like to test for approximate equality for floating - point numbers .
Floating point numbers cannot reliably be compared for exact equality .
Instead , the algorithm that is used to check for approximate equality is as follows :
abs ( x1 - x2 ) < epsilon
Where we take the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers and compare the result to ensure that it is smaller than epsilon ( a rather small number ) .
But , I ’d rather have the ability to write the code the way that it makes sense to the reader instead of all the semantics of the approximate equality .
Let ’s write a test for the way that it should look using an operator as an implementation of approximate equality .
-- Test for property of average
prop_average :: [ Double ] ->
Bool
prop_average xs =
( average xs * fromIntegral ( length xs ) ) =~= sum xs
-- Implementation of average
average :: ( Fractional a ) => [ a ] -> a
average [ ] = 0
average xs = sum xs / fromIntegral ( length xs )
Our test makes relative sense that the average of a list multiplied by the length should approximately equal the sum of said list .
This should always hold true for our tests .
But , how do we write that operator ?
With the beauty of type classes of course .
First , let ’s look at the implementation of general equality inside Haskell using a type class .
class Eq a where
( == ) :: a -> a ->
Bool
(/= ) :: a -> a –>
Bool
This allows us to implement the equality for any given type that we create or use the default implementation given .
Let ’s take this approach to create an ApproxEq type class so that we can implement it for our comparisons .
class ApproxEq a where
( =~= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool
(=/~= ) :: a -> a –>
Bool
We ’ve now implement both an approximate equality and approximate inequality function inside our ApproxEq type class .
Now to actually use this , we need to create an implementation using double floating - point precision for our average tests .
An example might look something like the following :
instance ApproxEq Double where
x =~= x ' = abs ( x - x ' ) < epsilon
where epsilon = 0.0000001 –- Could be smaller
x =/~= x ' = not $ x =~= x ' ) \
Now , when we compile our prop_average , it should now work as expected where I ’m checking for approximate equality .
We can wire up our property checks in batch form and run as the following :
import Test.
QuickCheck
import Test.QuickCheck .
Batch
options :: TestOptions
options = TestOptions
{ no_of_tests = 200 ,
length_of_tests = 1 ,
debug_tests = False}
main :: IO ()
main = do
runTests " average properties " options
[ run prop_average ]
And when we run through the GHCi console , we get the following results :
ghci > main
average properties : . ( 200 )
We now see that we pass 200 tests , which is something we expected .
Moving on over to F# , is this something we can apply ?
The answer is yes !
Type Classes in F #
I ’ve had a lot of thoughts lately around type classes and their importance in the F# language .
Unfortunately , there are n’t clean ways to do this .
Instead , as Kurt Schelfthout discovered in his post about “ A Poor Man ’s Type Class ” , it can be done , but always the prettiest solution .
Let ’s go ahead and go for the same ideas as above in the Haskell code in F # and see how it can be accomplished .
The idea , as stated above is to create a test and associated implementation to use an operator to check for approximate equality .
Here is how I ’d like to write my code :
let prop_average ( xs : float list ) =
( ( List .
average xs ) * float ( List .
length xs ) ) =~=
List .
sum xs
[< Fact >]
let test_prop_average ( ) =
check FsCheckExtensions .
config prop_average
First , let ’s define the interface much as we did above for our type class above to check for both approximate equality and inequality :
type IApproxEq <'a > =
abstract member approxequal : ' a -> ' a -> bool
abstract member approxinequal : ' a -> ' a – > bool
Now , we need the ability to store the associations of the type instances of our given interface .
This allows us to query a table to see whether one has been implemented or not .
[< AbstractClass >]
[< Sealed >]
type ApproxEqAssociations private ( ) =
static let associations = new System .
Collections .
Hashtable ( )
static member Add <'a > ( approxEqual : IApproxEq <'a > ) =
associations .
Add ( typeof < 'a > , approxEqual )
static member Get <'a > ( ) =
let a = associations . [ typeof <'a >]
match a with
| null ->
failwithf " Type %s does not have an implementation of IApproxEq "
( string ( typeof < 'a > ) )
| : ? IApproxEq <'a > -> a : ?> IApproxEq <'a >
| _ ->
failwithf " Type %s has an incorrect implementation of IApproxEq "
( string ( typeof < 'a > ) )
What we ’ve implemented here is a static class that will let us both add and get instances of our IApproxEq type instances based upon a given incoming type .
This gives us the capability now of creating instances of our ApproxEq class and and adding it to the associations table such as this :
// Provide instances of the type class , and register these
type DoubleApproxEqual ( ) =
let epsilon = 0 .000001
let approxEq x x ' = abs ( x - x ' ) < epsilon
interface IApproxEq < float > with
member this .
approxequal x x ' = approxEq x x '
member this .
approxinequal x x ' = not ( approxEq x x ' )
ApproxEqAssociations .
Add ( new DoubleApproxEqual ( ) )
Once the class has been created and then added to the association table , we can then retrieve it any time we need through the use of our ApproxEqAssociations .
Get method .
Let ’s not stop there , because now I want to create some operators that will then act upon this association to allow us to check for approximate equality .
Those are defined below :
// Define an operator which references the associations table
let ( =~= ) x x ' = ApproxEqAssociations .
Get ( ) . approxequal x x '
let ( =/~= ) x x ' = ApproxEqAssociations .
Get ( ) . approxinequal x x '
Now that everything is defined , it should just work through our handy FSI command prompt such as the following :
> quickCheck prop_average ; ;
- Ok , passed 100 tests .
And there you have it , we have type classes that can help improve the design of our code .
Is it checked at compile time whether we have an instance or not ?
The answer , is unfortunately , no .
That ’s why our tests are of greater importance to verify the behavior of these type classes .
Conclusion
As you can see , we have the ability to define type classes in such a way as to abstract such things as checking for approximate equality .
This allows us to write the code the way it should be , instead of worrying about underlying complexity that is checking for such a thing as approximate equality .
Using techniques such as this also allows us to generalize our functions in such a way that we get maximum reuse .
Next time , we ’ll move back to our refactoring topics and cover refactoring and cleaning our code using HLint .

KABUL , Dec 20 : The United States plans to send between 20,000 and 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan next year , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Mike Mullen , said here on Saturday .
Gen David McKiernan , the US commander in Afghanistan , has asked for more than 20,000 extra troops to counter a rise in militant violence , including four combat brigades , an aviation brigade and other support forces .
“ The troops that were asked for in joint discussions with Gen McKiernan is what we ’re going to need for the foreseeable future .
So I do n’t see an increase any higher at this point than 20,000 to 30,000 , ” Mullen told reporters .
He said he hoped the extra troops could be deployed by mid-2009 .
The build - up would nearly double the US military presence in Afghanistan , raising it from 31,000 troops to over 50,000 .
On Friday , a US military official said Defence Secretary Robert Gates had already ordered the deployment of a combat aviation brigade with 2,800 troops to Afghanistan next year .
“ This is the beginning of the sourcing of the increased requirement that he ( McKiernan ) has asked for , ” the official said .
The aviation brigade , composed of a mix of attack and transport helicopters , will deploy to Afghanistan after January from the United States , he said .
Mullen said beefing up US forces in Afghanistan was linked to winding down in Iraq .
“ Available forces are directly tied to forces in Iraq .
As we look to the possibility of reducing forces in Iraq over the course of the next year , the availability of forces to come here in Afghanistan will increase , ” Mullen said .
He said the attacks by militants in Mumbai last month showed the need to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan and that would help bring stability to Afghanistan .
“ That ’s another big piece of the strategy , what I would call regional focus to include Pakistan , Afghanistan and India ... leadership in all three of those countries to figure out a way to decrease tensions , not increase tensions , ” Mullen said .
He claimed that the late arrival of winter this year had meant there were still significant flows of militants from the tribal belt along the Pakistani side of the border , but better cooperation with the Pakistani military was nevertheless helping .
“ We ’re not there , we still have a long way to go but we ’ve actually made a lot of progress . ”
He said the Afghan government was not as strong as he had anticipated and engaging with tribal areas in remote parts of Afghanistan could be central to future operations .
“ We may have overstated the focus on the ability of the central government to have the kind of impact that we wanted , given the history here in Afghanistan . ”
Mullen also said more must be done to boost economic development in Afghanistan , one of the world ’s poorest countries , and to make the Afghan government more effective .
“ No amount of troops , no amount of time will provide a solution here without development , ” he said .
In an interview aired on Wednesday , Gates indicated there would be limits to the US military build - up because of fears that the larger the presence , the greater the risk that Afghans would turn against it as an occupation force .
“ I think that we can meet the requirements of the commander in Afghanistan , our commander , Gen McKiernan , for the additional four brigade combat teams and a combat aviation team , without tipping the balance , ” he said .
“ But ... after those forces are provided , I think we should think long and hard before we make any further significant troop contributions in Afghanistan , ” he said in the interview on PBS television .

California is yet to pass Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s budget , intended to help correct the huge deficit the state is expected to face over the next year and a half .
The Governator has apparently had enough , and is turning to social media to urge constituents of the nation ’s most populus state to pressure their lawmakers in the state legislature .
The “ Legislature ’s Failure to Act ” widget features how many days the state has gone without having a budget passed , and also keeps a running ticker estimate of how much money the state is losing , modeled after the famous National Debt clock in New York that recently ran out of digits .
The widget , powered by Clearspring , can be emedded on user ’s websites and blogs , or posted directly to social networking profiles by clicking the " share " button :
Additionally , in case you had n't noticed yet , Schwarzenneger has taken to Twitter in recent months , posting links to updates about the budget crisis and promoting things like the widget .
So far , his team is using the microblogging tool completely as a one - way broadcasting tool ( the Governator is n't following anyone and he has made no replies ) , but it ’s a useful stream of information if you ’re concerned about the issue .
Schwarzenneger , the former movie star , fittingly has his own channel on YouTube as well .
" We need your help , " begins the plaintive ad on the front of the Whitehaven News .
Did you work at Sellafield in the 1960s , 1970s or 1980s ?
Were you by chance in the job of disposing of radioactive material ?
If so , the owners of Britain 's nuclear waste dump would very much like to hear from you : they want you to tell them what you dumped - and where you put it .
The reason for the ad is simple : the Cumbrian facility 's new operator , LLW Repository Ltd , has discovered that the historic records of disposal supposedly kept by the British state are far from complete .
" LLWR are looking for nuclear industry employees who have worked at Sellafield and have been involved in the consignment of waste to the Low Level Waste Repository near Drigg , " the ad says .
" We are very keen to speak to people who were directly involved in consigning nuclear waste during the 1960s to the mid-1980s in order to build up a comprehensive picture of the waste inventory in the trenches . "
According to Dick Razz , LLWR 's managing director , the ad is an act of thoroughness not desperation .
" We think it 's important to gain as much information as possible to enable us to better analyse what we have here .
We also need to combat some of the mythology and folklore that surrounds us here . "
By " folklore " , he means claims by local environmentalists that the site near the giant Sellafield atomic complex is awash with highly radioactive materials - even including some taken from the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine , site of a huge disastrous accident in 1986 .
But the newspaper ad and Razz 's remarks cut little ice with local greens .
They say the need for such appeals does not bode well for any high - level waste dump being considered by the government in its drive to build a new generation of nuclear power plants ; they also warn Drigg contains all sorts of waste , from Chernobyl and but also from another site in the US .
" If they can't even account for the lower category of radioactive wastes , what hope is there for the volumes of significantly more dangerous intermediate - and high - level wastes they now so desperately want to dump deep underground , " said Martin Forwood of Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment , or Core .
Forwood says that , despite the " low - level waste " tag , trenches at Drigg are believed to hold more dangerous material .
" Information provided to Core in the 1990s revealed debris from the 1957 Windscale fire , materials from the US Three Mile Island reactor accident , and from the Chernobyl explosion , " he said .
David Lowry , co-author of a history of nuclear waste management , is also worried .
The book quotes a UK Atomic Energy Authority scientist , Dr Spence , warning in 1957 before Drigg opened that it was essential that an analytic controls system , ie , proper and accurate records , must be developed before storing of radioactive waste began , so it was known what was in store and where .
This advice was dropped soon after by UKAEA , said Lowry .
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority , the state - owned body that handed Drigg to the LLWR consortium of companies led by the Washington Group of America , defended the new operators , saying there was nothing exceptional about an appealt to help address any small holes in records .
" This is very , very low - level waste we ;re talking about ; gloves , paper and hospital waste and it's all carefully stored in cemented - up containers in a vault , " said an NDA spokesman .
It was " utter nonsense " that anything from Chernobyl or further afield was buried there .
30 Components of The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index
Since 1896 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gauged the performance of the stock market .
From 12 stocks that originally tracked the performance of American industrial sector , it has grown to 30 stocks that represents one of the most widely mentioned index of the US stock market .
How the Dow Jones Industrial Average is Calculated
In order to prevent events like stock splits or spinoffs to affect the numerical value of the index , a divisor ( sometimes known as the DJIA divisor ) was created .
Originally , the divisor was 12 , which effectively made the index a simple average of all the stock prices of the components .
As more stock splits and structural changes occurred through the years , the divisor kept being readjusted downwards ( as of the end of 2008 , the divisor stands at 0.125552709 ) .
If you were to calculate the average today , all you have to do is add up the stock prices of all the components in the Dow ( currently 30 of them ) and then divide that by the DJIA divisor .
What the Dow Jones Index Means for Us
Knowing a few details about the average really help us become a better investor of the Dow .
Here ’s a couple you should know about :
The Stock Price is Just Added Together –
This translates to a higher stock priced company having more affect on the Dow Jones Industrial Average than other smaller priced ones .
For example , if there was a 10 % move in a $ 100 stock , it will bump the average much higher than a 10 % move in a $ 10 stock .
As of writing , the highest priced stock in the Dow is IBM .
Sectors Dominating the Average – Financials used to be a huge part of the Dow Jones index , but after the troubles of Bank of America , Citigroup and JPMorgan as well as American Express , the sector has a much smaller effect on the average .
As of the beginning of 2009 , the average is highly weighted in Technology .
Not All 30 Components Open at the Same Time Every Morning –
If you see a huge jump ( up or down ) of the average early in the session , you are seeing the effect of this .
Therefore , looking at the price history may not be a good way to do a technical analysis .
Knowing these will greatly enhance our ability to predict the future of the average .
For example , we know that in order for the average to stay the same on a day that IBM went up 10 % , American Express , Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan , and General Electric all have to be down roughly 15 % ( approximation based on stock prices on Feb 1 , 2009 ) .
Therefore , we can conclude that if IBM is doing well , the average will likely do better than even a few financial firms rallying on the same day .

DETECTIVE work by an Australian online poker player has uncovered a $ US10 million cheating scandal at two major poker websites and triggered a $ US75 million ( $ A93 million ) legal claim .
- Australian uncovers online poker cheating
- Player accounts ' won money too fast '
- Site owners file $ US75 m legal claim
Australian Michael Josem analysed detailed hand history data from Absolute Poker and UltimateBet and uncovered that certain player accounts won money at a rate too fast to be legitimate .
His findings led to an internal investigation by the parent company that owns both sites .
It found rogue employees had defrauded players over three years using a security hole that allowed the cheats to see other players ' secret ( or hole ) cards .
Now the owners of the sites have filed a $ US75 million claim against the makers of the software that powers them , claiming they were unaware of the security holes when they bought the sites in 2006 .

University of Nevada , Reno researchers discovered that used coffee grounds can be successfully converted into biodiesel for powering cars and trucks .
The fuel even smells like coffee !
Not only does this new process have the potential to keep all of those coffee grounds out of the trash , researchers Mano Misra , Susanta Mohapatra , and Narasimharao Kondamudi say that coffee - based biofuel is more stable , due to coffee ’s high antioxidant content .
Used coffee grounds contain between 11 and 20 % oil , which is about on par with other biofuel sources such as soybeans .
Scientists collected discarded grounds from a coffee chain and were able to convert 100 % of the oil they extracted into biofuel .
The stability aspect is really exciting .
Traditional biofuel gels or crystallizes in cold temperatures , making it a less viable option in winter and in areas with colder year - round climates .
Would this new , more stable option withstand colder temperatures ?
Growers produce more than 16 billion pounds of coffee per year worldwide .
Rather than tossing the bulk of the used grounds into the waste stream , scientists estimate that spent coffee grounds could produce up to 340 million gallons of biodiesel annually .
They are planning a small scale testing program for the fuel within the next six to eight months .

You remember me .
You bought the film rights to my novel Jennifer Government , for Steve Soderbergh and George Clooney .
Did n’t work out , but that ’s not your fault .
These things happen .
I hope we can work again some day .
That ’s not why I ’m writing .
I ’m writing because yesterday I rented The Dark Knight , and I could n’t watch it .
I tried .
But when I popped that DVD into my home theater PC and snuggled up on the sofa with my wife , it would n’t play .
At first I thought the disc must be damaged .
I tried it in my laptop : no dice there , either .
So I took it back to the video store and swapped it for a new one .
They were very apologetic , by the way , Warners .
I guess they understand that physically traveling to a bricks - and - mortar store is kind of a pain , and when you ’re in business against digital downloads , you do n’t want to make your transactions more difficult than they already are .
Home with my fresh DVD , I tried again .
But still : did n’t work .
A little Googling later , I discovered the disc was indeed damaged , and by who : you .
You ’ve installed some new anti-piracy protection onto The Dark Knight DVDs , which prevents the disc from playing in my PC .
Well , “ prevents : ” it took me an hour of messing around to figure out how to rip it .
I did n’t want to rip it , Warners .
I only wanted to watch it .
I think it may actually be illegal to rip copy - protected DVDs where I live .
But you engineered your disc so that it would n’t play in my DVD player : this was the only way I could access the content I ’d paid for .
Now , I understand that home theater PCs are kind of new - fangled , Warners , and not everyone wants to watch their DVD on a computer or laptop .
But some of us do , more every day .
I think you need to get over the idea that PCs are just for pirates .
Please , help me out here : who does your protection scheme target ?
It ca n’t be the real pirates ; they are barely slowed by such things , and you surely know this .
If I ’d wanted to download The Dark Knight illegally , it would have been quick and easy ; there ’s no shortage of places to find it , and the copies are high - quality .
Unlike your DVD , they are also ad - free , play without a hitch , and would have spared me three trips to the video store .
I think your target must be the average consumer : someone with a PC and a legitimate copy of your DVD , but limited technical knowledge .
This person will be defeated by your anti-piracy protection , at least for the moment .
But what does this gain you ?
I ’m honestly stumped .
These are not the people who are distributing copies over the internet .
They are , at worst , time - shifting a rental , or handing out a copy to their friends .
A copy of a store - purchased DVD , that is .
They are that tiny , precious slice of the population who has decided to give you their money : your customers .
When you optioned my book , Warners , I noticed the contract provided for a cut of the film ’s eventual revenue to the MPAA .
I felt a little uneasy at this , because even back then I was n’t comfortable with the shenanigans that organization was up to .
The unskippable copyright notices at the start of movies , for example : that ’s half the reason I swapped to a home theater PC in the first place .
There is something wrong , in my opinion , when a machine I purchased , playing a DVD I purchased , tells me I ’m not allowed to use the fast - forward button .
I understand piracy is a serious problem for you .
I really do .
You ’ll get no argument from me that wholesale downloading of copyright material easily available from legitimate channels is morally indefensible .
If we can sensibly fix that , I ’m right there with you .
But you seem to be hell - bent on converting your entire customer base into pirates .
You are facing competition that offers your product at zero cost and maximum ease of use , and you respond by breaking your own DVDs .
So , next film deal , I ’m striking that clause out .

Pope prepared to lift excommunication of SSPX bishops
January 22 , 2009
According to multiple reports from reliable Vatican - watchers , Pope Benedict XVI will soon lift the decree of excommunication imposed upon four traditionalist bishops who were consecrated by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1988 .
Italian journalists report that the Pope 's action will be made public within a matter of days .
The move would be a major step toward reconciliation with the Society of St. Pius X ( SSPX ) .
SSPX leaders -- including the bishops living under the decree of excommunication -- have consistently stated that before ending their break with the Holy See , they would insist on the removal of that excommunication and the right of every Catholic priest to celebrate the Mass using the traditional rite .
With the publication of Summorum Pontificum in 2007 , Pope Benedict fulfilled the latter condition ; lifting the excommunication would satisfy the former SSPX demand .
Still to be resolved , however , would be the serious disagreements over the authority and interpretation of Vatican II documents .
The Rorate Caeli blog is carefully following the latest reports , from Rome and elsewhere , on the Pope 's reported plan .

Implicit in Mr. Benn ’s argument , however , is that the only way to stop Hamas from gaining legitimacy is for Israel to fully occupy Gaza again , more than three years after removing its soldiers and settlers .
That is a prospect practically no one in Israel or abroad is advocating .
Image Israeli soldiers took position on Saturday before entering Gaza at its northern border .
It is not clear whether Israel hopes to overthrow Hamas , or who would lead Gaza if Hamas were ousted .

Moreover , while it may sound decisive to speak of taking Hamas out of power , almost no one familiar with Gaza and Palestinian politics considers it realistic .
Hamas legislators won a democratic majority in elections four years ago , and the group has 15,000 to 20,000 men under arms .
It has consolidated its rule in the past 18 months since pushing out its rivals loyal to the more Western - oriented and moderate Fatah party of President Mahmoud Abbas , who sits in Ramallah in the West Bank .
And while there are plenty of Gazans who would prefer Fatah , they seem hardly organized or strong enough to become the new rulers , even with the help of former colleagues in exile in Ramallah who say , anyway , that they would never be willing to ride into Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank .
In fact , the longer Israel pounds Gaza , the weaker Fatah is likely to become because it will be seen as collaborating .
The likelier result of a destruction of the Hamas infrastructure , then , would be chaos , anathema not only to the people of Gaza but also to those hoping for peace in southern Israel .
Yet in its campaign so far , which has killed scores of children and other bystanders , Israel has not spared the trappings of Hamas sovereignty or limited itself to military targets .
It says that the mosques it has destroyed were weapons storehouses and that the Islamic University , which it has hit repeatedly , housed explosives factories .
But it has also reduced many government buildings to rubble without any claim that they were military in nature .
“ The government buildings are a place where financial , logistical and human resources serve to support terror , ” said Capt .
Benjamin Rutland , a spokesman for the Israeli military .
“ Much of the government is involved in the active support and planning of terror . ”
Taken together , it suggests that even if Israel intends to hold back from completely overthrowing Hamas , its choice of assault tactics could head that way anyway .
And the Israelis may already be facing a kind of mission creep : after all , if enough of Hamas ’s infrastructure is destroyed , the prospect of governing Gaza , a densely populated , refugee - filled area whose weak economy has been devastated by the Israeli - led boycott , will be exceedingly difficult .
Can cannabis cause schizophrenia ?
Is it addictive ?
Or is it an undervalued medicine ?
Dr John Marsden discovers that science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions .
Cannabis is the world 's favourite drug , but also one of the least understood .
Can cannabis cause schizophrenia ?
Is it addictive ?
Can it lead you on to harder drugs ?
Or is it simply a herb , an undervalued medicine ?
Addiction specialist Dr John Marsden discovers that modern science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions .
John traces the cannabis plants ' birthplace in Kazakhstan ; finds the origins of our sensitivity to cannabis in the simple sea squirt ; and shows just what it does to our brains .
He meets people who have been changed by this drug in drastically different ways - from those whose lives have been shattered to those who lives have been revived .
Valve is a wonderfully open company — in many cases , direct questions sent to the publisher will be answered by a member of the creative team within hours .
One gamer recently e-mailed Valve and asked why he saw EA 's logo on a commercial for Left 4 Dead : he bought the game via Steam but did n't want to support EA after the Spore DRM debacle .
He got a reply from a managing director at the company , Gabe Newell , that was to the point : EA only handles distribution for the physical product , and Valve thinks most DRM is " just dumb . "
" Left 4 Dead is developed entirely by Valve .
Steam revenue for our games is not shared with third parties .
Around the world we have a number of distribution partners to handle retail distribution of our games ( i.e. make discs and boxes ) .
EA is one of those partners , " Newell wrote .
In other words , if you buy Left 4 Dead through Steam , EA does n't see any of your money .
This should be good news for gamers who want to slaughter some zombies but do n't want to break their EA boycott .
Newell does n't have kind words for the use of digital rights managements .
" As far as DRM goes , most DRM strategies are just dumb .
The goal should be to create greater value for customers through service value ( make it easy for me to play my games whenever and wherever I want to ) , not by decreasing the value of a product ( maybe I 'll be able to play my game and maybe I wo n't ) , " he wrote .
" We really really discourage other developers and publishers from using the broken DRM offerings , and in general there is a groundswell to abandon those approaches . "
Buying Left 4 Dead on Steam supports Valve , not EA
It 's easy for him to say ; Steam is its own form of DRM , one that makes programs like SecuROM redundant .
" You 'd have to ask Valve for specific numbers , " PC Gaming Alliance President Randy Stude told Ars , " but I believe piracy on Steam is very low . "
You can add games you obtained at retail to the Steam service to take advantage of its social networking features , but you need your CD key to do it ; cracked games are out of luck .
Do n't assume that buying a game via Steam means escaping SecuROM however , as EA has included the program on some its own games that it has released via Steam , such as Crysis : Warhead .
If we do n't kick you in the gut , can we punch you in the face ?
Newell 's take attracted the attention of others in the gaming industry .
" I think the problem with DRM is not so much the particular method used , but the attitude behind it .
It makes us feel like we 're all being punished for the sins of the few , " Microsoft 's Games for Windows Community Manager Ryan Miller wrote on his blog .
" It is also pretty clear that most DRM is not a problem for the pirates , just for the legitimate consumers .
These two factors combine to make a ton of bad feelings on the consumer side . "
This is an arguable sentiment : gamers do care about the method of DRM that is used .
Programs such as SecuROM ( which do n't uninstall along with the game ) and limits on the number of installations allowed anger PC gamers .
When we reported on the use of SecuROM in Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC , many of our readers pledged not to buy the game on principle .
Miller addresses that controversy directly .
" Rockstar has put an interesting twist on the much - maligned software by removing the install limits that have plagued other games , though the software still installs components that can be very difficult to remove should you want them off your hard drive , " he wrote .
" It seems like a reasonable compromise to me , but what do you think ?
Is the lack of install limits enough to overlook the installation of code you can't remove ? "
This is the sort of question that may sound reasonable from Miller 's point of view , but will enrage PC gamers .
SecuROM serves no purpose other than to annoy legitimate customers , and a version of the game that lacks the program ( and is superior for that ) will be available to pirates as soon as the game is released , if not before .
The fact that Rockstar wo n't limit installations , a new twist on DRM that has drawn bile from gamers and seemingly given pirates the high ground , does n't excuse the use of SecuROM in the game .
While Steam is a step in the right direction , giving gamers the ability to play games on multiple systems without having to worry about losing discs or CD keys , some gamers have reported issues getting their games to work in offline mode , and worry about Valve shutting down the servers at some point in the future .
Piracy is a complex issue with no easy answer , but what 's clear is that gamers are less and less willing to put up with intrusive DRM technology in their games , but there does n't seem to be much of a movement to lessen its use among game publishers .
What the industry has to understand is that gamers have the upper hand , as they can simply go to the torrents for a free version of each game that includes no DRM .
Until publishers do more to welcome their legitimate customers as friends instead of treating them as potential pirates , piracy will continue to eat at profits and morale .

The injured included French and German tourists , said a security official who did not have an exact breakdown of the wounded .
The blast took place in the famed Khan el - Khalili market in medieval Cairo , frequented by tourists and locals alike .
Blood could be seen , on the marble paving stones in front of the historic Hussein mosque .
A police colonel at the scene said the small bomb went off outside a cafe near the mosque kicking up stone and marble fragments , which wounded the passersby .
Riot police cordoned off the area and sniffer dogs could be seen as worshippers were being evacuated .
A security official said police were attempting to defuse a second bomb .
Fire engines were also on the scene .
Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they was not authorized to speak to the press .
I feared for my life , says investigator who waged fruitless nine - year campaign to expose Bernard Madoff
' I feared for my life ' : Harry Markopolos testifies before Congress in Washington today
The man who waged a decade - long campaign to blow the whistle on fallen money manager Bernard Madoff told Congress today that he had feared for his physical safety .
Harry Markopolos also assailed the Securities and Exchange Commission , accusing it of ' roaring like a lion and biting like a flea ' .
The SEC failed to act despite receiving credible allegations of fraud from Markopolos about Madoff 's operations over a decade .
Because of the agency 's inaction , ' I became fearful for the safety of my family , ' Markopolos said .
He told a House subcommittee hearing that ' the SEC is ... captive to the industry it regulates and is afraid ' to bring big cases against prominent individuals .
The agency ' roars like a lion and bites like a flea , ' Markopolos said .
Madoff , a prominent Wall Street figure , was arrested in December after allegedly confessing to bilking investors of more than $ 50 billion in what the authorities say was a giant pyramid scheme , possibly the largest ever .
His repeated warnings to SEC staff that Madoff was running a massive pyramid scheme have cast Markopolos as an unheeded prophet in the scandal .
' The SEC was never capable of catching Mr. Madoff .
He could have gone to $ 100 billion " without being discovered , Markopolos testified at the hearing .
" It took me about five minutes to figure out he was a fraud . '
Markopolos , a securities industry executive and fraud investigator , brought his allegations to the SEC about improprieties in Madoff 's business starting in 2000 .
He fruitlessly pursued the quest through this decade with agency staff from Boston to New York to Washington , but the regulators never acted .
Now thousands of victims who lost money investing in Madoff 's fund , which was separate from his securities brokerage business , have been identified .
Bernard Madoff ( right ) is escorted out of court by a U.S. Marshall :
He is awaiting trial for fraud
Among them are ordinary people and Hollywood celebrities - as well as big hedge funds , international banks and charities in the U.S. , Europe and Asia .
Life savings have evaporated , foundations have been wiped out and at least one investor apparently was pushed to commit suicide .
And the SEC has been sustaining volleys of criticism from lawmakers and investor advocates over its failure to discover Madoff 's alleged fraud , which could be the biggest pyramid scam ever , despite the credible allegations brought to it over years .
Markopolos said he determined there was no way Madoff could have been making the consistent returns he claimed using the trading strategy he touted to prospective investors .
Madoff , who was at one point chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market and sat on SEC advisory committees , was ' one of the most powerful men on Wall Street and in a position to easily end our careers or worse , ' Markopolos said .
Calling the SEC ' non- functional ' and harmful to the reputation of the U.S. as a global financial leader , Markopolos recommended ways to revamp the agency , including replacing its senior staff and establishing a central office to receive complaints from whistleblowers .
Also due to testify before the House Financial Services subcommittee were five top SEC officials , including the agency 's enforcement director Linda Thomsen , and the head of its inspections division Lori Richards .
In December , Christopher Cox , then the SEC chairman , pinned the blame on the agency 's career staff for the failure over a decade to detect what Madoff was doing .
He ordered the SEC 's inspector general , H. David Kotz , to determine what went wrong .
Kotz has expanded his inquiry to examine the operations of the divisions led by Thomsen , who has been the enforcement chief since mid-2005 , and Richards , who has held that position since mid-1995 .
Thomsen and Richards defended their actions at a Senate hearing last week over the SEC 's failure to uncover Madoff 's alleged fraud scheme .
Members of the Senate Banking Committee were scarcely satisfied with explanations given by the two officials and by Stephen Luparello , the interim chief executive of the brokerage industry 's self - policing organization .
That organisation , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , was headed until December by Mary Schapiro , President Barack Obama 's new SEC chief .
Schapiro has said that because Madoff carried out the scheme through his investment business and FINRA was empowered to inspect only the brokerage operation , it was n't possible for the organization to discover it .
A scandal involving a member of the House of Lords is exposed today – but this one occurred 34 years ago and the only harm caused was to anyone lacking a sense of humour .
Baroness Elaine Murphy , a cross - bench peer and former Professor of Psychiatry at Guy 's Hospital , has confessed to manufacturing a medical condition which only existed in her imagination .
In a letter to the British Medical Journal published in 1974 , the young Dr Murphy claimed to have discovered " cello scrotum " , a painful affliction which only affected male players of the instrument .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The spoof letter was written in response to an earlier one about " guitar nipple " from a Dr P Curtis , which the young Dr Murphy thought likely also to be a spoof .
To disguise her identity she persuaded her former husband , John Murphy , now chairman of St Peter 's Brewery , Suffolk , to sign the letter , although he was a theoretical chemist , not a medical doctor .
Their secret was kept for more than three decades until a researcher writing in the 2008 Christmas issue of the BMJ cited cello scrotum among the health problems of musicians in an article entitled " A symphony of maladies " .
In a letter to the BMJ published today , the Baroness and her co-conspirator said the citation of their " discovery " in the Christmas BMJ prompted them to confess to their youthful prank .
" Reading Curtis ' letter on guitar nipple , we thought it highly likely to be a spoof and decided to go one further by pretending to have noticed a similar phenomenon in cellists .
Anyone who has ever watched a cello being played would realise the physical impossibility of our claim , " they write .
Despite this , and to their astonishment , the original letter was published by the presumably musically illiterate then letters editor of the BMJ .
The mystery deepened when , the following Christmas , the Murphys sent a card to Dr Curtis addressed to " The inventor of guitar nipple from the discoverers of cello scrotum . "
It turned out that Dr Curtis knew nothing about the condition he had supposedly identified – " another joke , we suspect " , they write .
Their letter continues : " We have been dining out on this ever since .
We were thrilled once more to be quoted in " A symphony of maladies " .
The BMJ has dubbed the episode " Scrotumgate " in a tribute to the political scandal that had engulfed Washington DC the previous year .
Baroness Murphy had a distinguished 25 - year career as a doctor and academic in the NHS before moving into NHS management .
She has been chair of the North East London Strategic Health Authority and is chair of council at St George 's , University of London .
She was made a life peer in 2004 and speaks mainly on mental health , education , healthcare and ageing issues .
She has remarried and lives in Norfolk .
Fiona Godlee , editor of the BMJ , said : " It seems the BMJ has been deliciously hoaxed .
It is wonderful it has been going all these years and no one realised .
We frown on misconduct and medical fraud is taken very seriously .
But in this case I hope I am right in saying that no harm has been done . "
The letter is illustrated by a cartoon of a naked cellist in pain – caused by his instrument , or by being the butt of a 34 - year - old jape .
( CNN ) -- Illinois ' highest court validated the appointment of Roland Burris to fill President - elect Barack Obama 's vacant U.S. Senate seat Friday , ruling that the Illinois secretary of state does not have to sign off on it .
An opinion favoring Roland Burris says a Senate rule does n't remove a power that the Constitution gives states .
The court 's opinion states that " no further action is required by the secretary of state or any other official to make the governor 's appointment of Roland Burris to the United States Senate valid under Illinois law . "
In a victory for embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who appointed Burris to the Senate seat , the Illinois court stated that " no explanation has been given as to how any rule of the Senate , whether it be formal or merely a matter of tradition , could supersede the authority to fill vacancies conferred on the states by the federal constitution . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that he was waiting for a ruling from the Illinois high court on whether Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White needs to sign Burris ' certificate of appointment .
Aides to Reid said his lawyers were reviewing the ruling , particularly a passage that suggests an alternative way to authenticate Burris ' certificate .
Majority Whip Dick Durbin , the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate , said that he still thinks White 's signature is required on Burris ' certificate .
Durbin , the senior senator from Illinois , said he did not see a way around the Senate rule , dating to 1884 , that a certificate must bear the secretary of state 's signature .
The rule has never been waived to seat a senator , Durbin said .
" The rules of the United States Senate are clear .
...
At this point , we 've clearly reached an impasse , " Durbin said in Chicago , Illinois .
Durbin said he thought the best way forward would be to suspend the process of seating Burris until the impeachment trial of Blagojevich concludes in the Illinois Senate .
If Blagojevich is removed from office , the new governor -- the current lieutenant governor , Pat Quinn -- could make an appointment to the Senate , possibly Burris .
White has declined to sign the certificate , siding with some Senate Democrats who say Burris should not be seated because of the cloud over Blagojevich , who has been accused of trying to sell the open seat .
Burris , in turn , asked the Illinois court to force White to sign the certificate by ruling that White 's signature is , in effect , nothing more than a ceremonial , nondiscretionary government action .
White seemed to agree , saying that he thought Burris could be appointed without his signature on the certificate .
" My signature is not necessarily required for the Senate to place the gentleman in the seat , " White said Tuesday during a radio interview .
" It carries a lot of weight , but my signature is mostly ceremonial , rather than it being a point of law . "
On Thursday , appeared before a panel that was weighing whether to impeach Blagojevich and denied any quid pro quo with Blagojevich for his appointment .
" I can , for this committee , state that there was no legal , personal or political exchange for my seat , " Burris told the panel .
Burris also said he had no conversations with Blagojevich before the governor 's arrest about his desire to take the seat vacated by Obama .
The former state attorney general appeared before an impeachment committee of legislators in Springfield , Illinois , to explain his ties to the governor , who was arrested December 9 after federal prosecutors alleged that Blagojevich had tried to sell the seat for money and influence .
Later Thursday , the panel unanimously recommended impeaching Blagojevich .
On Friday , the full Illinois state House of Representatives took up the issue and voted to impeach the governor .
Before Thursday 's hearing , Illinois Republicans had said they wanted to know whether Burris was " paying to play . "
GOP lawmakers pointed to state records showing that Burris , a Democrat whom Blagojevich appointed on December 30 , and his lobbying firm contributed more than $ 20,000 to the governor 's political campaigns .
Blagojevich has not been indicted .
He and Burris say the appointment is legal .
In a written affidavit given to the impeachment panel , Burris said he had one limited conversation with the governor about the Senate seat before he was appointed .
And that conversation , he said , was initiated by a Blagojevich attorney .
CNN 's Dana Bash contributed to this report .

In the meantime , guest blogger Brent Swancer continues his examination of the Ainu , with part II of his contribution from Saturday .
If you recall , he left us noting that the focus of the debate swirling around one theory on the origins of the Ainu involves a curious piece of fossil evidence called the Kennewick Man ( which was studied by a team that included paleoanthropologist Grover Krantz before his death ) .
The Ainu and the Kennewick Man
by Brent Swancer
December 8 , 2008 .
The Kennewick Man , also sometimes referred to as the Richland Man , is a skeleton which was accidentally found at the Lake Wahulla section of the Columbia River in Kennewick , Washington on July 28 , 1996 .
The skeleton was in remarkably good condition , missing only the sternum and some bones in the hands and feet .
Upon examination , it was found that the skeleton lacked many distinctive features found in Native Americans , and exhibited some Caucasian features as well .
In addition to features of the skull and bones , the condition of the teeth suggested a diet different from the Native Americans .
For these reasons , it was thought that the remains were perhaps that of an early European explorer , however the mystery would only deepen upon further analysis .
Through preliminary radio carbon dating , it was found that the remains were around 9,000 years old .
Also , a projectile tip of a type used from around 8,500 BP to 4,500 BP was found lodged in the hip .
It seemed that this was no European explorer , but rather a stone age individual with characteristics unlike the later Native Americans .
Anthropologists and paleontologists rushed in to do more detailed examinations and try to determine the nature of these mysterious remains .
Upon comparing the remains to 18 modern populations of humans , it was determined that the ancestry most closely resembled that of the Ainu .
The study of the Kennewick Man remains has long been embroiled in controversy .
The remains were originally taken possession of by the U.S. Army Corps of engineers , who own the land on which the remains were found , however this was immediately challenged in court by the NAGPRA ( Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ) .
NAGPRA states that any human remains found on federal lands that are found to be affiliated with a Native tribe can be claimed by that tribe .
Several tribes claimed the remains as their own and demanded their return for a proper burial .
This was quickly opposed by a group of archeologists and anthropologists who claimed that NAGPRA did not apply in this case .
And so the long legal battles surrounding the Kennewick man started , often holding up studies and even bringing research on the remains to a halt .
Examination was halted in 1996 due to court battles and debates with Native tribes , only to resume again in 1998 .
Scientific studies that were done on the skeleton from 1998 to 2000 were frequently dogged by legal woes , and it was n’t until 2002 that a federal court ruled that NAGPRA did not apply to the remains as a cultural link was not met , and this allowed scientists better access to the remains .
This ruling was upheld again in 2004 , but the firestorm of controversy and legal motions are far from over .
Currently , the skeleton is being held at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington , and is legally designated as the property of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
To date , despite the legal controversy , the Kennewick Man remains have been physically examined on various occasions using standard scientific methods and techniques , and some things have been gleaned from it .
It is known that the man was between 45 and 55 years old , around 5 ’ 9 ″ in height , was muscular , and had received various injuries that appear to have healed before death .
In addition , evidence suggests that the body was deliberately buried rather than left exposed to the elements .
Yet the mystery of who this man was or where he came from remains as mysterious as ever .
In 2006 , results of studies performed on the remains in 2005 supported the earlier notion that these remains closely matched features found in the Ainu people .
So is it possible that Ainu were some of the first humans to inhabit North America ?
The theory certainly has its share of detractors .
Some insist that there are not enough samples to make any assumptions on the origins of the remains .
They are quick to point out that the physical differences of a single specimen do n’t mean anything in the larger picture and therefore the Kennewick Man is useless as evidence of anything .
Others point to the greater physical diversity between individuals in remains dating over 8,000 years old , or even point to the blurry lines of race to begin with .
It could be argued that human populations are not unambiguous or clearly separated biological groups so therefore any divisions made between biological populations are subjective and arbitrary , especially when looking at 9,000 years old bones .
The debate goes on , but the essential mystery remains .
Who was Kennewick man ?
Further analysis of the remains may yield more answers , but if it is indeed the skeleton of an Ainu as speculated , then this would shake to the core our current conventional understanding of how and by whom the continent was first settled .

Footnote from Loren :
One of the first forensic reconstructions from the skull of the Kennewick Man looked extremely familiar to those who viewed it soon after its completion .
Very familiar .

KIEV , Jan 11 ( Reuters ) - Ukraine , which agreed to an EU - backed deal to resume Russian gas flows through its pipelines to Europe , must still face off with Moscow to secure gas for its own population as temperatures stay below freezing .
The three - way transit deal , signed by Ukraine in the early hours of Sunday , does nothing to solve Kiev ’s struggle to resolve a pricing dispute with Russia that resulted in its gas supplies being cut on New Year ’s Day , analysts said on Sunday .
“ We remain one - on - one with Russia , ” Mykhailo Pohrebynsky , director of the Kiev Centre for Political Research , said .
Ukraine , Russia and the European Union signed a pact that should enable the resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe , large parts of which have been plunged into a mid-winter energy crisis .
[ ID:nLB599732 ]
Analysts said this deal should not mask problems faced by Ukraine in getting its own supplies turned back on .
Oleh Dubyna , chief executive of Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz , said the latest round of price talks in Moscow had come to nothing .
" The talks now have to proceed at a higher level , " Dubyna said after returning empty - handed from Saturday talks with Gazprom GAZP .
MM , Russia 's state - run gas export monopoly .
Ukraine should not rely on support from the European Union , which has been exasperated by the long - running gas dispute and whose primary concern is to monitor compressor stations and ensure the flow of Russian supplies , analysts said .
“ It would be a strategic mistake to rely only on Europe ’s support to squeeze out an agreement with Russia , ” Volodymyr Fesenko , director of the Penta think tank , told Reuters .
“ Europe can help in some way as a go - between , play some sort of role , but Ukraine must agree on its own . ”
Kiev says it has gas reserves to cover more than two months of consumption , but some Ukrainian companies and utilities have already cut back consumption and are trying to switch to other fuels , such as coke and fuel oil .
[ ID:nL9320185 ]
FAR APART ON PRICE
Gazprom , at the latest negotiations , insisted on a price of $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas for 2009 supplies to Ukraine , Dubyna said .
Naftogaz has said it will pay no more than $ 201 , up from $ 179.50 in 2008 .
Ukraine , which has been paying significantly below market price for Russian gas , is likely to struggle to pay a much higher price as its crisis - gripped economy heads for a forecasted contraction of between 3 and 5 percent this year .
“ Russians have run out of patience and Ukraine will now face a very tough position , ” said Alexander Razuvayev , Moscow - based analyst with Sobinbank .
In addition to the price , Gazprom is pursuing compensation for lost gas and full redemption of last year ’s debt .
Razuvayev said he expects Gazprom to ask for $ 370 - $ 380 per tcm based on the cost of Central Asian gas plus transportation costs .
Moscow , however , might not want to alienate the significant pro-Russian population of eastern and southern Ukraine , most of whom speak Russian as their preferred language .

“ Not signing a deal would endanger the positive view of a significant portion of Ukrainians toward Russia , ” Pohebrynsky of the Kiev Centre for Political Research said .

“ It ’s not possible to discredit the Ukrainian authorities in the eyes of Ukrainians .
They ’re already completely discredited . ”

Subversion has had a tough ride during the latter half of 2008 .
During that time we shipped Multiwinia and we also did the Chronometer project , so time has been short .
Work has still occurred on Subversion , but a lot of it is internal – difficult to demonstrate , and more concerned with the inner workings of the project than externally flashy stuff .
So I do n’t have a huge amount of cool new stuff to show , but this blog was never about showing the polished finished article – it ’s about the development process of an Introversion game .
So , enough excuses , on with the update !( xvid codec required ) The first half of the video shows the latest version of the Subversion city generator .
It now operates in a very different ( and much better ) way .
Once the road network has been finished , a new system takes over – which I ’ve called the Geometry Generator .
This system is responsible for running all the different procedural generation algorithms in turn as they are required , generating all of the data of the city and pushing it onto the graphics card in realtime before your eyes , starting with a road network and ending at the buildings and skyscrapers .
Some technical details for those interested :
This system operates on a hierarchical data structure that represents all the 3d geometry in the world .
It searches that data structure , looking for “ stub ” nodes that have n’t yet been generated .
Lets say it finds a node of type “ Park ” with an outline , and nothing else .
It then searches a database of generation rules , looking for anything that can help it generate a park node .
Once it finds one it will run that generator and add more detail into the park – such as trees , a lake , a few paths , etc .
Those objects then become new child nodes in the hierarchical data structure , and can be generated in more detail later if the rules exist and if you want that much detail .
So you could write all the generation rules for Park / Lake / Path / IcecreamVendor / Swings / Slide / Bins etc , going into stupid levels of detail , and the Geometry Generator would just take care of it for you .
You can generate higher levels of detail for objects near the camera , and throw away unnecessary high detail a long way away .
This system can be extended easily – if I decide that streets are suddenly vital to Subversion , I can write generators for Street , Road , Pavement etc and add more detail to those previously empty nodes – streetlamps , bins , chairs etc .
One thing I ’ve found : you can generate data at an astonishing rate .
This system can generate data at a max of around 10,000 polygons per second ( its half that in the vid because fraps is very cpu hungry ) , but it ’s not particularly optimised at the moment .
In a couple of minutes this system can build a city with over a million polygons .
The previous city generator from a year ago could n’t do anything like this .
Firstly I was using openGL display lists , which would n’t even be able to render 1 M polygons at a decent frame rate , never mind have generation occurring at the same time .
I ’m now using Vertex Arrays , or Vertex Buffer Objects if your gfx hardware supports it , which are an order of magnitude faster at rendering .
Secondly there was no way to update display lists dynamically , but I ’ve now figured out a reliable way to update Vertex Arrays with new graphics data every frame , which is why you can now see the city growing in realtime before your eyes – that ’s the Geometry Generator , pushing newly generated geometry onto the graphics card in realtime .
And thirdly , I ’ve made the whole generation system multi-core , freeing it up from the render loop and making good use of my dual - core cpu .
All three of those breakthroughs have occurred in the last six months , making this system possible .
The second half of the video shows the work - in - progress generating the insides of buildings .
Right now only three bits of detail exist : support columns , elevator shafts ( empty ) , and stairwells .
But crucially , and this is where the real magic has happened : the insides of the building now use the same Geometry Generator system as the city and the same data structures , meaning the whole thing has been unified .
So instead of generating Parks and Streets and Buildings , we are now generating Floors and Windows and Stairwells , but the underlying system is the same .
The transitions still need a lot of work – you would be forgiven for not believing me , but you can click on any building in the city view , and the Geometry Generator will spawn that building ’s shell and generate all the data inside the building dynamically .
The result is that the buildings all look like they are half - finished construction sites , with just the frameworks and shells of the buildings , and none of the office details .
Obviously lots more to do here .
So that ’s where things are at the end of 2008 .
You may be wondering , what happened to the elevators and the buttons and the lua scripts and stuff ?
Most of that material was moved out of the project while I integrated the Geometry Generator from it ’s prototype into the main codebase , and things are still a little bit untidy , but they will be coming back next .
I ’ve got a clear first playable in my head now , although we are a long way off still , and simulation of the insides of the building is next on the list once I ’ve got some basic geometry working .
I ’d also like to see the transitions from City to Site handled better – ideally I ’d like the Site to appear in the city view , inside the buildings you just clicked on , but we ’ll see – it may be too much of a render burden , but it would look pretty cool .

L.L. Sendbearer Hints at Bendiness With Russia on Firebolt Warding
A more teamworking bond with Russia that helps lower the uncleftish foreboding from Iran would be " one of the things " bearing weight on the Obama landsteering 's choosing on when and whether to put in a firebolt warding bodyframe in eastern Europe , an elder L.L. landbearer said this week .
" The Linked Lands is quite open to the likelihood of new kinds of teamwork " on a warding shield , and is " keen on a thorough talking on the whole reach of matters on shielding with Russia , " Underlandsmarshal William Burns said on a calling to Moscow .
" If through strong landbearing with Russia and our other friends we can lower or cast out that foreboding , it overseeingly shapes the way at which we look at firebolt warding , " Burns said .
His speaking followed a bid last week by Underlandshead Biden to hit a " reset knob " on bonds with Russia after a lengthy time of strife over firebolt warding and a reach of other matters .
In a betweenseeing with the Russian Interfax news maker at the end of his landcalling late Thursday , Burns , a former L.L. sendbearer to Moscow , said the landsteering hopes to take the boon of " this time of good befalling ... to undertake to turn those good forethoughts and those sound words into earthly headway . "
A landsteering head in Washington called Burns 's words , which were posted on the L.L. Sendbearing Web spot in Moscow , " fully same with the way we 've been talking about firebolt warding and willing to work with the Russians .
If we have the might to work with the Russians to lower the foreboding from Iran , we need to think hard on how to go forward with likely unfolding of the bodyframes . "
U.S. Envoy Indicates Flexibility With Russia on Missile Defense
A more cooperative relationship with Russia that helps reduce the nuclear threat from Iran would be " one of the factors " influencing the Obama administration 's decision on when and whether to install a missile defense system in eastern Europe , a senior U.S. diplomat said this week .
" The United States is quite open to the possibility of new forms of cooperation " on a defense shield , and is " interested in a thorough discussion of the whole range of security issues with Russia , " Undersecretary of State William Burns said on a visit to Moscow .
" If through strong diplomacy with Russia and our other partners we can reduce or eliminate that threat , it obviously shapes the way at which we look at missile defense , " Burns said .
His comments followed an offer last week by Vice President Biden to push a " reset button " on relations with Russia following a lengthy period of contention over missile defense and a range of other issues .
In an interview with the Russian Interfax news agency at the end of his visit late Thursday , Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow , said the administration hopes to take advantage of " this moment of opportunity . . . to try to translate those good intentions and that positive rhetoric into practical progress . "
An administration official in Washington called Burns 's remarks , which were posted on the U.S. Embassy Web site in Moscow , " entirely consistent with the way we 've been talking about missile defense and trying to engage the Russians .
If we 're able to work with the Russians to diminish the threat from Iran , we need to consider how to proceed with potential deployment of the systems . "
Sendbearer - used this twice , for envoy and ambassador .
Influenced by Icelandic sendiherra for ambassador .

Firebolt - made this one up myself .
Seems like a good word for missile .
Uncleftish - that 's from uncleftish beholding ( atomic theory ) .
I 'm glad that word was already available .
Landsteering - administration , influenced by Dutch bestuur .
. Bodyframe - means system ; inspired by Japanese / Korean / Chinese 体系 ( among other ways to write it ) , literally meaning body + framework .
Landbearer - a diplomat is a person bearing a kind of permission to represent their country , so landbearer seemed okay .
Landbearing ( diplomacy ) comes from this too .
Landshead - President .
Head of the land .
Underlandshead is Vice President .

Landcalling - a visit to a country .
In the spirit of the unforgettable Uncleftish Beholding , a paper on atomic theory showing what English might look like with all the non-Germanic words removed , I 've tried my own hand at a bit of pure Germanic English with a few paragraphs from this article entitled U.S. Envoy Indicates Flexibility With Russia on Missile Defense , which I 've entitled .
It 's certainly not an attempt to extrapolate at what English might have become without the Norman Invasion since that resulted in a change to the structure of the language itself , just a fun ( academic ) demonstration of just how many non-Germanic words there are in the language , to the extent that English does n't really function without them .
Let me know if you catch any non-Germanic words in there ( etymonline.com is awesome and was the largest help here ) .
Some of them are pretty tricky and can look Germanic , but actually come from Latin or Old French .

Turley : FISA review court ruling ' wildly pro-government ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 16 , 2009

In a ruling issued in 2008 but only revealed this Thursday , a secret federal appeals court upheld a 2007 law , the Protect America Act , which authorized the warrantless wiretapping of international phone calls and interception of emails , even when those communications involve American citizens .
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow , " This opinion is wildly pro-government .
It 's astonishing how the court accepts all of the assertions made by the government . "
" The court even went ahead and said , ' Look , there might be abuses , but there could be abuses under the warrant system , ' " Turley continued .
" There 's one problem with that .
When you are abused in the standard warrants , you know it .
If you 're abused by the FISA court , you do n't .
And the government has been successful in preventing anyone from challenging by saying , ' You ca n't prove that we actually intercepted you . '
So it 's a very weird decision . "
Turley emphasized , however , that despite the way the decision is being generally reported , " for the most part , it says nothing about the criminal allegations against the president .
This case specifically dealt with a law passed by Congress .
It is not binding on the question of what happened before that law -- when the president went at it on his own . "
As one legal blogger explains , " There is nothing at all in this ruling that offers any ' legal credence to the Bush administration 's repeated assertions ' that it had the power to order surveillance that violated statutory restrictions .
Quite the contrary .
From the moment the NSA program was first disclosed in December of 2005 , the issue has always been whether the president has the ' inherent authority ' to disregard a statute like FISA that purports to place restrictions on his ability to conduct surveillance of Americans .
...
The court here has merely upheld Congress 's prerogative to pass such a law .
There 's nothing here that lends any credence whatsoever to claims of law - breaking authority made by the Bush administration over the last few years . "
The decision was issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review , which was created to hear rare appeals from decisions of the full FISA court .
Turley said he sees this appeals court itself as questionable , because it " was created specifically for the FISA court , which itself is viewed by many , including myself , as being inherently unconstitutional .
It was created for the purpose of circumventing the Fourth Amendment . "
" This is n't even binding on the other circuits , " Turley further noted , " and I expect many judges would strongly disagree with what this court said . "

EVEN some of the most experienced home cooks I know are afraid of soufflés .
The fears : they ’ll never rise , they ’ll immediately fall , they ’re difficult to make , they ’re temperamental .
A soufflé is the kind of dessert you order in a fancy restaurant on a special occasion .
Yet people want to make soufflés — or want them made for them , as was evidenced by the number of readers who responded to my query on my blog , Bitten ( nytimes.com / bitten ) , saying a chocolate soufflé would top the list of things they ’d like to be served on Valentine ’s Day .

Hassan , an 8 - year - old Gazan boy , could consider himself lucky .
Last year , thanks to his serious illness , Israel let him in to be treated in a Tel Aviv hospital .
Israel boasts of its generosity : after four decades of occupation , which has left Gaza ’s hospitals on a Third World level , followed by years of siege , which has exhausted the little equipment and medicine arsenal those wretched hospitals had acquired , Israel grants treatment to a small number of mostly terminal Palestinian patients , provided the full cost is paid by the Palestinian National Authority .
How very generous indeed .
Since every Arab is a terrorist until the opposite is proven , Israel lets at best just one adult , usually a woman , accompany a sick child into Israel .
Hassan ’s mother could go with him .
But no Palestinian vehicles are allowed in .
Having crossed the checkpoint into Israel , how would the ill child and his mother make the 45 miles to Tel Aviv ?
Public transport is unfeasible ; a taxi or an ambulance is unaffordable .
A solution is offered by a small network of volunteer drivers , Israelis who take Palestinian patients to Israeli hospitals and then back to the checkpoints in Gaza or the West Bank .
Many Israelis label these people “ Arab lovers ” or worse .
That ’s how friends of mine got to know Hassan and his mother , about a year ago .
Hassan was diagnosed and treated in Tel Aviv on an outpatient basis and had to be driven back and forth .
My friends would pick up Hassan early in the morning , take him to hospital , wait outside till he was finished , and then take him back to the checkpoint .
A whole day off .
But they earned new friends .
Gazans , but humans .
Hassan ’s illness got worse and worse .
Three months ago , with the hospitals in Gaza having only painkillers to offer , Hassan was permanently hospitalized in Tel Aviv .
His mother stayed day and night at his bed : first , because Palestinians seem to love their children too , second , because she had to leave her ID card at the hospital , so that she could not get out anyway .
She spent months around the clock in the hospital with her ill son .
The doctors recommended bone - marrow implantation .
Hassan ’s four brothers were allowed in for one day , to check their compatibility as donors .
But where would they stay the night ?
My friends offered them a bed .
Realizing the four teenagers had never seen anything but the Gaza Strip , my friends did their best to give them a taste of life in Tel Aviv .
After 24 hours they returned to Gaza ; none of them could be used as donor .
The last hope was Hassan ’s married aunt , but her husband would n’t let her go .
When he was finally persuaded , it was too late .
The war broke out .
About 80 percent of Gaza ’s residents are refugee families who were driven out of Israel in and after 1948 .
Hassan ’s family belongs to the small minority of original Gazan families .
They own a house .
After the first day of the war all the windows and doors were gone , thanks to Israel ’s surgical bombing .
Hassan ’s sister was injured : a deep , bleeding cut in her leg .
Her father took her to the nearby hospital , behind which dozens of corpses lay in the open air .
They poked fun at her slight injury and sent her home .
A week later , the terrified father and Hassan ’s five siblings were pushed into a single room .
The rest of their home was ruined .
Yet another surgical bombing .
Their text message to my friends sounded like a farewell , and not just because they had no electricity to charge their cell phone .
Meanwhile in Tel Aviv , Hassan ’s condition deteriorated .
His mother , at her dying son ’s bed , followed the horrors in Gaza on the phone , fearing the Israeli bombings , which targeted cellular antennas as well , would break the little communication left with her bombed family .
Her favorite doctor was taken to the army .
I never met Hassan or his mother , but I could see their horror and despair , on both fronts , reflected in my friend ’s sleepless eyes .
In the second week of the war , Hassan , 9 years old by now , passed away .
It took several hours to arrange an ambulance to take the bereaved mother and Hassan ’s body back to Gaza , hoping they would not be bombed there .
They entered the Strip shortly before the “ humanitarian pause ” was over ; the ambulance refused to take them home .
Hassan ’s mother left her little luggage behind  including some expensive medicines for her brother , unattainable in Gaza and paid for by my friends  and walked the last mile home , carrying her dead son in her arms .
Hassan was buried the same day .
Now the family could now go back to “ normal . ”
The last room left of their house had collapsed , so they moved in with relatives .
Another bombing took the life of close friends of theirs , a couple with two young children .
One of Hassan ’s uncles was injured , my friends failed to understand how seriously .
Ten days later a cease - fire was announced .
Hassan ’s family returned to what was left of their home .
Like most of their belongings , the fridge too is badly damaged , but there is little electricity anyway .
Hassan ’s mother is physically and mentally exhausted .
Her doctor tells her to rest a lot and avoid stress .
Sure thing .
This is a true story , but a very unusual one .
There are virtually no contacts between Israelis and Palestinians .
Israel has been doing all it can to prevent such contacts : they jeopardize the national project of dehumanizing the Palestinians .
We must dehumanize them , otherwise we wo n’t be able to teach them a lesson they wo n’t forget ( experts call it “ deterrence ” ) .
And we must teach them a lesson they wo n’t forget , in order to prove that they never learn , so that yet another lesson is necessary .
Someone has to keep the weapon industry running , and Israel has really tried every possible way to reach peace ( except ending the occupation ) .
So here we are now : a bereaved family in a ruined house in Gaza and an Israeli family in Tel Aviv who have almost become one family through Hassan ’s illness and death .
They phone each other daily , hoping to meet again soon .
Will they see each other again  not just soon , but ever ?
The answer is no .
Not as long as Israel ’s apartheid regime is in place .
Israel does not allow its civilian citizens to enter Gaza , under any circumstances whatsoever .
And Gazans are not allowed to enter Israel , unless they are lucky enough to be dying .
LAS VEGAS --
With many of us spicing up our lives with all the power we can fit in one hand , WowWee introduced Cinemin at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas tonight .
It 's a line of hand - held micro projectors that are due out this spring .
They use Texas Instruments ’ DLP technology , similar to what 's in high - def TVs , classroom projectors and larger - scale theaters .
What 's cool about this device is that you can connect your portable video player , be it an iPod , iPhone or Flip , and project an image measuring up to 60 inches onto a surface up to 12 feet away .
The bedroom blinds could be your movie screen .
The pico projectors come in three flavors :
Cinemin Swivel , the one at right in the foreground in the picture above , sports an adjustable 90 - degree hinge that lets you shoot your video to the moon -- well , at least the ceiling -- if you prefer to watch videos the way you stargaze .
It costs about $ 300 and is roughly the size of a candy bar .
The company says it has a three - hour battery life and full volume control .

Cinemin Station , the one that resembles an iHome clock radio , is the big daddy of the family .
The projector and controls are on top of the box , which serves as an iPod dock .
It boasts a better speaker system -- and a bigger price tag : $ 400 .
So on that flight that no longer offers you a movie and a meal , you could pack your own movie and popcorn .
The world is your screen .
And this way , you 're less likely to get a crick in your neck from staring down at a 2 - by - 4 - inch screen for a couple of hours .
Just hope that hyper kid in the seat in front of you actually sits still that long .

President - elect Barack Obama has promised change .
And there 's one change that internet - happy Americans want more than another other .
In an age of crippling recession , skyrocketing unemployment , and a looming threat environmental armageddon , their primary request is this :
Pass the joint , yo
Obama 's Change.gov site will close down its internet suggestion box today , after a week of taking suggestions and opinions on the new administration 's executive policy from the web public at large .
In standard Web 2.0 fashion , users can vote up or down on existing entries — the theory being that the best schemes will rise to top .
Supposedly , the " top ideas " will be presented directly to the new Commander - in - chief in the form of a " Citizen 's Briefing Book " following his inauguration on January 20 .
Barring any massive last - minute changes , the tip - top idea will be best summarized by the philosopher / poet Chris Tucker in his cinematic role as Smokey : " I 'm gunna get you high today , ' cause it 's Friday ; you ain't got no job ... and you ai n't got shit to do . "
Here are the top - five results ( for the moment ) :
1 ) With 70,520 points at time of publication , the the most popular idea by a margin of 10,300 is " Ending Marijuana Prohibition . "
" I suggest that we step back and take a non-biased ' Science Based ' approach to decide what should be done about the ' Utter Failure ' that we call the War on ( some ) Drugs , " the entry reads .
Of course , the Obama team has done a notable job ignoring its top entry .
The staff skipped directly to commenting on the second most popular idea in their videos of Obama administration officials addressing the cream of the crop .
Which brings us to : 2 ) " Bullet Trains & Light Rail . "
Numero dos in user popularity calls for an increase in funding for US train transportation at the federal level .
" I think that the one issue keeping many people from using trains to travel to and from other cities is that they are too slow , " the submitter writes .
That — or maybe a fear of getting shot .
Nancy Sutley , the chair - designee for the White House council on environment replied on YouTube that the administration will be " really excited " to look into high speed rail .
3 ) Closely behind train funding in votes is a call for " an end to the government sponsored abstinence education to be replaced by an introduction of age appropriate sex education . "
" Sex WILL happen , " the entry observes .
" As adults our own histories have proven that .
It is wrong to expect more from our children than we could for ourselves .
We can , however , help them to understand the consequences and beauties of decisions they choose to make . "
To be saved for a cold day in hell is 4 ) the request America " Commit to becoming the ' greenest ' country in the world . "
" If America committed itself to this creed it would solve many problems at once , " the suggestion states .
That includes saving the US auto industries , putting millions of people back to work , creating safe transportation , and eliminating the country 's need for " foreign oil . "
" Renew the American Dream and restore America 's leadership and respect in the world , " the submitter writes .
Shine on you crazy diamond .
At the end of our top five , we hit our top 5 ) , which takes us back to ! ) : " Stop using federal resources to undermine states ' medicinal marijuana laws . "
" Our federal government is wasting scarce resources - and hurting sick people - by arresting patients and their caregivers ; it should stop doing so , " the policy suggestion reads .
Speaking of hurting sick people — not only does pot reform come up twice on the top five — it ranks above even a call for the closure of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
So how did mob rule do ?
Frankly , I 'm surprised the internet pulled together a policy list without demanding the establishment of a LOLcat tzar and the national anthem become a Rickroll .
Still , I can't help but wonder how much the list was gamed by various internet groups .
But ultimately , it comes down to this :
Will policies based on internet popularity really be destined for consideration in the Oval Office , or have the " Citizen 's Briefing Book " voters just created Obama 's new presidential paperweight ? ®
With less than two weeks to go before Watchmen opens , anticipation for the movie is at fever pitch ... which only makes us wonder what will happen if the movie is n't what everyone is waiting for .
Advertisement
Do n't get me wrong ; I do n't actually want the movie to fail , and actually expect it not to , at least in the short term .
If nothing else , the ridiculous success of The Dark Knight has definitively proven that a mainstream audience exists for what , for want of a better term , could be called " Arthouse Superhero " movies ( Something that had been hinted at before ; I tend to think of Tim Burton 's Batman Returns and Sam Raimi's last two Spider - Man movies - in particular Spider - Man 3 , with its jazz interludes and weird uneven tone - as earlier examples of superhero auteurism ) , and Watchmen 's intense , endless marketing campaign is definitely aiming for that level of gravity , with mentions of a " visionary director " adapting " the most celebrated graphic novel of all time . "
What I 'm worried about , though , is what the marketing is n't saying , and what effect that could have on the Arthouse Superhero genre moving forward .
From what we 've seen of Watchmen so far - and I write this as someone who has n't seen the movie , although I 've talked to people who have - we know that they 're trying to be faithful to the look of the book , at least ; the trailers show glossy CGI - massaged scenes that we recognize from Dave Gibbons ' original drawings , and many comparisons have been made between movie stills and comic panels .
It seems , at times , that this is the drive of the entire marketing for the movie :
Look how much it resembles the comic !
Look at how much detail we have copied over , even down to the dedication on the Comedian 's gun !
The trailers , in fact , are much less about the story of the film than a collection of fan - familiar images meant to make the faithful fans get excited with recognition and warm with the glow of nostalgia .
But the problem with that is , in many ways , the visuals are the least important thing about Watchmen the book .
Advertisement
For all of the claims that Watchmen the book was unfilmable , very few of them centered around the kind of special effects needed to make us believe a man could explode and then re-create himself as a glowing blue naked go ( In fact , shitty special effects may even have been more in tune with the arch - knowingness of the original book that both acknowledged and transcended its pulpy , ridiculous roots ) .
No , what would make Watchmen unfilmable - and what the trailers and the arcade game - style web extras and the released scenes with too much slow - mo and the black and white portraits od actors and everything we 've seen from the film so far have failed to show us is in evidence in the movie - is the deftness of Alan Moore 's writing , which manages to balance a formal exploration of the comic medium with a complex , flawed humanity that looks " behind the hood " of the characters to make them into real people who would look ridiculous in those outfits ... and not as Batman Begins - esque as the movie 's Nite Owl .
Of these two things , one is literally impossible to translate to another medium , and the other would seem to be nearly impossible to fit within a three - hour movie , no matter what you may feel about Zack Snyder 's talents as a director .
I can't help but feel that it's this potential misdirection - that the truly important elements of Watchmen the book have been ignored or lost , and instead we 're seeing the movie being sold on how much it looks like the comic - that will be the downfall of the movie , ultimately .
It strikes me as foolish to try and promote the movie to fans on how faithful it is visually , when the heart of the book will be missing , and to non-fans , the mainstream audience that made Dark Knight such a massive hit , the faithfulness will have no meaning without the original context ; all they 're seeing are a bunch of colorful characters and explosions and being told it 's a big deal .
It 's that mainstream audience that all of the hype should have been geared towards ; the very idea of a Watchmen movie would be enough to anger and excite the hardcore fanbase in and of itself , and while all of the promotional pandering has been welcomed , it wo n't change the final outcome , which is that Watchmen the movie will almost definitely disappoint them .
That 's not a comment on the quality of the final movie , but on the expectations those fans have for it ; after almost a year of hype and previewed footage and interviews and seeing the Owlship at San Diego Comic - Con , there is almost no way in the world that any movie can live up to the one that they 've created in their minds ( A movie that will , undoubtedly , include the squid at the end ) .
You can almost taste the backlash now .
Better to have spent the time , and the money , selling everyone else on the movie , and hope that they understand and embrace whatever it turns out to be .

And what happens if it DOES fail ?
In one sense , very little ; more mainstream superhero movies like Thor and Avengers will most likely be unaffected in terms of box office , although they may find more snark thrown their way by critics stung by wanting to fall for Watchmen more than they actually did , perhaps .
I think that , if audiences do n't love the movie to Dark Knight levels , then that wo n't affect their desire to see Robert Downey Jr. wisecrack his way through another 90 minutes while wearing armor ; they may not even see any real connection between the two movies .
But what I 'm worried about is what it 'll mean for movies that are n't summer blockbusters based on well - known comic book franchises .
Will The Dark Knight start to be looked at , not as a sign of things to come , but a fluke that shows that audiences only really want to watch self - important superheroes when they grew up with them ?
Will movie producers shy away from projects that aim for epic grandeur and high budgets , because Watchmen suggests that that kind of thing scares people away ?
Will Billy Crudup 's career survive ?

Okay , maybe I do n't really care about that last one so much .
Sorry , Billy .
There 's a lot resting on the success of Watchmen , I think ; not just Fox 's ability to point at Warners and laugh and say that they were right in the first place to pass on the project ( and then , you know , sue just in case ) , but in a strange sense , it 's managed - through force of marketing as much as anything - to become the First Post - Dark Knight - Era Important Superhero Movie .
If it succeeds , then the door may be open to more and more ambitious science fiction movies ( whether based on comics or not ) .
But if it fails , then maybe we 'll end up with a movie industry that thinks that Transformers and X - Men Origins : Wolverine is all that genre movies should aspire to ...
And that 's a much greater tragedy than losing a giant alien squid for your climax .
It is the oldest of questions .
" What is love !
It is a pretty thing , as sweet unto a shepherd as a king , " wrote Robert Greene back in the 16th century .
Four hundred years on , the poser is as tricky as ever .
Ahead of Valentine 's Day , theories still abound as to why two people are attracted to each other .
To some , it is a romance - laden " bolt from the blue " , a deftly timed arrow from Cupid .
To the scientists , it is a mixture of factors : everything from status to age , similarity , and pheromones .
" Explaining pheromones is like trying to find the end of a piece of spaghetti in a big plate of spaghetti bolognese , " says Dr Simon Moore , a psychology lecturer at London Metropolitan University .
" There are so many areas you have to consider , despite the fact that we came down from the trees to the plains thousands of years ago .
Psychologists still think we have these inherited cultural factors that underpin attraction , which are different for males and females . "
And women , it seems , tend to be more discriminating than men because they are fertile for a shorter part of their lives .
So what is the answer ?
" If you ask a load of men in a room what they find attractive , it is often eye contact .
It produces a physiological response in the opposite sex , " says Elizabeth Clark , the author for Flirting for Dummies ( to be published in June ) .
" If a lady is staring at you for 10 seconds , it 's because she wants you .
Women always get themselves into trouble by doing that .
They think they 're being friendly , but men interpret it differently . "

While most of us think the factors that attract us to others are under our control , there are many instinctive and conscious influences that affect our behaviour .
Many of the reasons for attraction cited by behavioural scientists derive their principles from evolutionary pyschology – that is , the explanation of behaviour using evolutionary theory .
Such theories are based on the assumption that , as animals , we select our partners on their suitability for transferring good genes to our offspring and not just , say , as an opportunity for casual sex .
But some would say this clinical explanation takes the wonder out of dating , flirting and anything it might lead to .
So what determines who we think is hot or not ?
And can we do anything about it ?
The experts explain all .
Power and status
" Women find men who are successful and dominant attractive , and this is especially true in tribal societies , " says Dr Mark Sergeant , a psychology lecturer at Nottingham Trent University .
He says that , in Western culture , lots of money gives women the impression that men will be able to provide for them and for any offspring they may have together .
Equally , status indicates intelligence , another desirable characteristic for children .
" Women look for things like good personality , leadership , resourcefulness and intellect , " Sergeant adds .
A powerful and rich man is also more likely to be able to provide for their partner during pregnancy .
Studies show that older women are n't as influenced by status , and this may be linked to a decline in their fertility .
" This evolutionary hold diminishes as women get older .
Compatibility becomes more and more important . "
Age
Women are fertile over a relatively short period of their lives – from puberty until the menopause – but some men can reproduce from puberty until late age .
Traditionally , men are said to prefer blondes , and this may be because blonde hair can be interpreted as a sign of youthfulness , and thus of fertility ( many children have blonde hair that darkens as they age ) .
Men also correlate youth with health and hence with an increased possibility that their spouse will have healthy children .
This may be one reason why men generally link up with women who are younger than themselves , while women often look for older men who are established in their careers and are more mature , enjoy greater status , and have a greater ability to provide .
Gay men and women
Research shows that gay men generally look for similar characteristics in their partners as straight men do : namely , younger partners and short - term sexual liaisons .
" Gay men can be more promiscuous than straight men as they have more chance to do it , " Sergeant says .
Furthermore , studies in gender identity suggest that the higher gay women are on a " scale of masculinity " , the more their preferences tend to resemble those of heterosexual men .
Similarly , the higher gay men are on a " scale of femininity " , the more similar their preferences are to those of heterosexual females .
" Not everyone is going to act like this , but people probably wo n't realise how they are being unconsciously influenced , " Moore adds .
Physical attractiveness
Scientists say attractiveness indicates the quality of someone 's genes .
We generally find people whose faces are the most symmetrical the best - looking .
" The eye prefers symmetry or figures with some regularity , " wrote Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man .
Sergeant says that the reason for this is that humans are born with bilaterally symmetrical faces , and due to any inbreeding or mutations or malnutrition we or our family have experienced , we become less symmetrical over our lifespan .
The more we preserve this symmetry , the better we are at dealing with genetic and environmental problems .
Thus , those with the most symmetrical faces are the best catches .
Men also make inferences about women based on the colour of their hair .
" Blondes are perceived to be fun and bubbly and possibly lower in intelligence .
Some men might find that attractive .
Such people are seen as being feminine and available , " Sergeant says .
In African cultures , bigger women are perceived as more attractive because they are thought to be more resilient .
In Britain , the preferred female body shape has changed greatly over the past 100 years , influenced by media pressures and what is seen to be attractive – thinner bodies are famously desirable .
Some studies have showed that , in the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle , women show off more flesh and thus maximise the possibility of their best features being seen .
Familiarity
" From a social point of view , people will go for the same types of partners throughout their lives .
For example , one woman might go for tall , brown - eyed men throughout her life , " Sergeant says .
Research shows that this preference stems from our parents .
" This sounds Freudian , but it operates through an imprinting - like phenomenon .
Men often look for qualities in a potential mate that they might have seen in their mothers , " he adds .
There is an evolutionary reason for this .
When we decide to have children , we want to do so with an individual whose genes we know have been tried and tested , and are therefore successful – hence the similarity factor .
There is , however , an optimum level of similarity .
Too similar is unattractive , as it suggests similar genes and inbreeding .
We are after new genetic material , but equally material that we have seen has worked in the past .
Pheromones
Studies show that men's smell is more appealing to women around the time they are ovulating .
This facilitates contact at the key moment for conception .
Some other studies suggest that women most like the smell of men whose looks are symmetrical at the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle .
They can also smell the difference between symmetrical and non-symmetrical faces .
" They are looking for the best genes , " Sergeant says .
" A few studies have also pointed out that men find women 's odour most attractive when the female is most fertile . "
At around this time of ovulation , a woman 's body odour and vaginal secretions are also more appealing to males .
" Lots of secretions like body odour are dependent on hormones moving around the body .
As people 's hormones change , their smell changes . "
People smell differently throughout their lifespan .
This is also linked to fertility .
The reliance on odours is something we have from birth .
" Attraction to maternal odours has obvious survival benefits by keeping the offspring in close proximity to its mother , " writes the American neuroscientist Gene Wallenstein in his book The Pleasure Instinct .
Similarity
Individuals tend to go for partners who are relatively similar to themselves – in lay terms , " in the same league " .
" If you go for someone roughly equally to you in attractiveness , it avoids two things , " Sergeant says .
" If they are much better - looking than you , you are worried about them going off and having affairs .
If they are much less attractive , you are worried that you could do better . "
Sergeant cites a study in which people were asked to rate themselves in attractiveness and then to rate their partners .
This backed up the similarity theory that people want someone who is of the same overall " value " as they feel they are themselves .
In terms of men , this might be linked to ambition , dominance and control over resources .
In women , this " value " is focused on fertility and looks .
A Navy diver has undergone emergency surgery after fighting off a shark off Woolloomooloo in Sydney Harbour this morning .
The 31 - year - old was brought to St Vincent 's Hospital in a critical condition about 7:00 am ( AEDT ) , with severe injuries to his right hand and right thigh .
The hospital has not confirmed reports that the man lost his hand .
It says he is in a serious but stable condition in intensive care .
The Navy says the specialist clearance diver was rushed to hospital from Woolloomooloo Bay , in Sydney 's inner east , after being bitten off the naval base at Garden Island .
The Commander of the Australian Fleet , Rear Admiral Nigel Coates , says the 31 - year - old was on the surface of the water with a police diver on the last day of an international counter - terrorism exercise .
" It all happened very quickly , I 'm told , " he told ABC NewsRadio .
" He fought the shark , punched it a few times .
The shark disappeared .
" Our diver then swam to our nearby safety boat , which was n't far away .
" The people on the safety boat got him into the boat , they applied some first aid , rang 000 and got him ashore to an ambulance and up to St Vincent 's as fast as they could . "
The man was involved in a Defence trial of new technologies designed to protect ports , naval bases and ships from underwater attacks .
The last day of the exercise has been suspended .
Rear Admiral Coates says it is the first time an Australian Navy diver has been attacked by a shark .
He says the Navy will review its diving operations .
" When something like this happens , we 've got to sit back when the facts become clearer and try to understand what happened and see whether there 's ways we can reduce the risk of that ever happening again , " he said .
Bull shark suspected
The curator of the Australian Shark Attack File at Taronga Zoo , John West , says no - one has been bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour since the late 1990s .
" They 're very , very uncommon , " he told ABC 702 Local Radio .
" We 've got to go back 12 years until we find where a swimmer was bitten up in Parramatta River .
" Then there 's a couple in between , in 2002 and 2000 , where rowers had their paddles or their skis bitten by a shark up in Parramatta River . "
Mr West says the shark was most likely one of the bull sharks that feed in the harbour at this time of year .
" The bull shark occurs in the estuaries along the east coast of Australia every year and around this time , " he said .
" All of the bites from bull sharks occur in February and March .
Usually there 's more swimmers in the water around that time .
" The sharks appear in the harbour every year and the bull shark in particular will swim all the way up the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers , so I 'm not surprised that they 're in the harbour . "
He says the last fatal attack in Sydney Harbour was in 1963 , when Martha Hathaway was killed by a bull shark at Middle Harbour in 1963 .

Unfortunately some PS3 kernels do not come with huge page support enabled .
Jakub Kurzak and Alfredo Buttari step through the details of recompiling the kernel for huge page support .
[ Mike Acton ]
This process also works with YellowDog Linux virtually unchanged .
The availability of huge TLB pages depends on the way the linux kernel has been configured prior to compilation .
The default kernel that ships with Fedora Core 5 ( most likely with any other distribution that has binary kernel packages ) does n't include this option .
So , in order to have huge TLB pages , it is necessary to reconfigure the kernel , recompile it , instruct the boot loader about the newly created kernel image .
Finally we will also show a way to allocate the TLB pages automatically at boot time .
Lego 's just announced that it 's teamed with Digital Blue to bring out a line of digital cameras , PMPs , and walkie talkies for children .
As you can see , the products will have the familiar " Lego " look to them ( though not constructed out of actual bricks ) , and though we have n't heard anything in the way of specs yet , they 're said to be arriving this summer with prices ranging from $ 19 - $ 60 .
Our opinion of these is currently hanging out in the " not really excited " file , but outfit these suckers a set of wheels and we 'll probably be sold .

Sony has enjoyed another number one hit in Japan , with PlayStation 3 exclusivebecoming the best selling title in one of the country 's busiest sales weeks .
With the Japanese gift - giving period centering around New Year celebrations , the week ending December 28th saw significant sales across the board .
Developed byandcreator Level - 5 , role - playing gamehas long been seen as one of the PlayStation 3's most important exclusives for the Japanese market .
Recently confirmed for future release in the West , the game sold 206,954 units in its first week .
A total of five games in the top 10 sold over 100,000 units , although with New Year 's Eve just days away there were few other new entries .
for the PSP was the second - highest seller , with impressive second week sales of 176,385 units.
for
Wii was at number three with 144,179 unit sales , withon Nintendo DS at number four with 140,934 units andon DS at number five with 105,225 unit sales .
Sega 'son DS was the only other new entry in the top ten , at number seven .
Although the sales of 84,055 units are by no means poor , they are much below that ofon PSP - which sold 342,000 units on its debut in August .
The only other new entry in the top 30 was the new Wii de Asobu ( aka New Play Control ! ) version offor the Wii .
Debuting at number 18 , the game is a re-release of the original GameCube title with new motion sensitive controls .
Overall in the top 50 , there were 22 titles for the Nintendo DS , 14 for the Wii , six for the PSP , four each for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 , and none for the Xbox 360 .
Thanks to the Japanese holidays , the chart results were reported a few days earlier than usual , with hardware figures for the week already available .
This saw the Nintendo DSi easily maintaining its lead as the top - selling platform , even as sales fell slightly , by 9,000 units to 245,150 .
The Wii overtook the PSP for second place , although it only increased its sales by 4,000 units to 134,958 .
Boosted last week by the release of hardware bundles for , Sony 's portable saw its sales drop by 27,000 units to 118,765 .
Despite the success ofsales of the PlayStation 3 increased by less than 7,000 units , to 45,989 .
Although well ahead of the Xbox 360 , which was largely unchanged at 13,011 units , this was still less than the older DS Lite model of portable on 56,453 .

With the first - ever human test of a medical treatment based on embryonic stem cells gaining federal approval , researchers are optimistic that President Obama will soon lift a controversial Bush - administration ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research and speed work developing treatments for diabetes , heart disease , cancer , Parkinson's , and Alzheimer's .
The Food and Drug Administration today approved human tests of stem cells to repair spinal cord injuries .
The first test will involve eight to 10 people with spinal cord injuries below the neck and will start sometime this summer , according to Thomas Okarma , president and CEO of Geron Corp. of Menlo Park , Ca. , which developed the stem cell treatment .
Patients will be injected seven to 14 days after being injured .
Although this Phase 1 test is intended just to test the safety of the stem cell treatment , the researchers will be looking closely to see if the injected cells bridge the gap in a severed spinal cord , as stem cells have done in mouse studies .
Embryonic stem cells have the ability to turn into any type of human tissue cell , which is why researchers are so excited about their potential .
The Geron researchers also will assess whether the patients gain any return of sensation , bowel or bladder function , or movement in their legs .
" That would be a very exciting finding , " Okarma said .
If this trial does well , the company expects to expand it to include patients with cervical spinal cord injuries , which are much more common and cause paralysis in all four limbs .
The FDA 's approval of the trial three days after Obama took office was coincidental , according to the agency and Geron officials .
" We have no evidence that there was any political shadow over this process , " Okarma said today .
Indeed , the embryonic cells used by Geron come from stem cell lines created before the 2001 Bush administration ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
The ban came about because embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos that were made for in vitro fertilization but never used .
Today 's go - ahead raises hopes that either the Obama administration or Congress will soon rescind the ban , which researchers say has hindered their ability to move quickly on developing potential cures .
Scientists are trying to use stem cells in three ways :
1 ) In the laboratory , to create an infinite variety of living human cells to better test the disease - fighting ability of new drugs in test tubes ;
2 ) As patch kits , with cells injected to repair injured body parts , such as spinal cord or heart muscle cells ;
3 ) To create transplants that could be used to replace body parts .
For instance , Geron is also trying to develop embryonic stem cell treatments for heart disease , in which the injected cells would be used to rebuild damaged heart muscle , and for type 1 diabetes , with the goal being to rebuild islet cells in the pancreas that were destroyed by the patient 's immune system .
The biotech firm is also investigating making cartilage to repair arthritic joints , bone cells to combat osteoporosis , and liver cells to treat liver failure .
Other companies and researchers are pursuing treatments for sickle cell , cystic fibrosis , Parkinson's , Tay - Sachs , leukemia , and Alzheimer's .
" We 're quietly excited , " says Douglas Melton , codirector of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute .
Melton and other scientists who are trying to harness embryonic stem cells ' power to turn themselves into many different types of human tissue have had to separate that work from the rest of their laboratories , with stickers marking which equipment could be used for stem cell work and which for all other work .
They also could n't collaborate with other scientists whose work was paid for by grants from the National Institutes of Health , the primary source of funding for biomedical research in the United States .
Since then , scientists have had success in using other forms of stem cells .
In 2007 , Rudolph Jaenisch , a researcher at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass. , created induced pluripotent stem cells ( IPS cells ) , which can be made from cells taken from an adult and appear to have the same regenerative power as embryonic stem cells .
Last year , Jaenisch used IPS cells to treat sickle cell anemia and Parkinson 's in rodents .
If IPS cells work in humans , they could eliminate one of the biggest problems with embryonic stem cell therapy : Patients need to take immune - suppressing drugs , so that their bodies wo n't reject and attack the cells as foreign .
In the Geron trial , patients will take low - level immune - suppressing drugs for six months .
Adult stem cells also have been used to grow organs , including bladders , of the same type of cells .
That way , they do n't need to differentiate into the right kind of cell , as embryonic cells do .
Two days ago , there was an interesting post by Andrzej Jaworski , entitled “ [ Haskell ]
Teach theory then Haskell as example , ” dated “ Wed , 14 Jan 2009 04:37:33 +0100 , ” on the Haskell mailing list on the Haskell programming language , recommending that Haskell be taught “ on most abstract terms in a framework of higher order logic , types and CT right from the start . ”
While I agreed with the gist of his post , I had n’t found an appropriate publication on category theory that addressed the subject at the proper pace , level , and perspective .
Most publications did not explain enough detail , assumed too many topics not covered , or did not explain the concepts in a manner which would allow me to form a visual framework of reference in my mind .
In my response , I listed the following publications on category theory , a branch of mathematics which forms a theoretical framework for Haskell .
( Author names and dates have been added , explicit URL ’s replaced by hyperlinks in titles , and descriptions expanded , for referential convenience .
In addition , I have added one additional book entry for cross- referential purposes . ) :
In conclusion , I stated as follows :
I would believe that having specific Haskell code to help interact with the categorical examples would help to motivate study of the abstract theory for many programmers .
One problem that many people have with studying abstract theory in isolation is that they often tend to lose motivation unless they can see how the theory directly relates to and influences the semantics and data structures in the code .
Having specific examples of Haskell code to tie together immediately with the abstract theory would most likely help to motivate and maintain interest .
Then I discovered a similar thread in the USENET newsgroup comp.lang .
haskell which had originated two days earlier , entitled “ Book recommendations on underlying theory , ” dated “ Sun , 11 Jan 2009 15:11:40 - 0800 ( PST ) , ” in which a reader nicknamed “ grimey ” was asking for recommended readings on the theory behind Haskell .
Grimey described himself as a programmer who had “ studied physics at the undergrad level , ” and whose mathematical background included “ Diff & Integ .
Calc , Linear Algebra , Diff Eq , Advanced ( Vector ) Calc , [ and ] Complex Analysis . ”
In particular , he added ,
Although the Vector Calc class was particularly difficult
for me and sort of “ took the wind out of my sails ” and leaving me
adrift on the sea of mathematics for a long time .
I always wanted to
continue on with more abstract math , like algebra and group theory , to
gain understanding of the beauty behind quantum physics ; but for
various reasons , that did n’t happen .
Anyway years later I still use
Linear Algebra and Diff Eq quite frequently for work , and have a good
practical engineer ’s grasp of those topics .
I use advanced calculus
less frequently and I use quaternions for very practical , non -
theoretical way for rotation sequences in 3D .
I am an expert C/C++
programmer .
He then mentioned the following books as two that had “ piqued [ his ] interest , ” before asking for further suggestions :
Topics In Algebra
by I.N. Herstein
Xerox Corporation : 1975 Lambda - Calculus and Combinators
by J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin
Cambridge : Cambridge University Press , 2008
In my response linking the two threads , I mentioned Andrzej Jaworski ’s response to my earlier posting in the first thread , in which he had replied in part that :
[ T ] here are many very good articles addressing specific issues of Haskell 's theoretical foundations ( e.g. http://www.cs.ut.ee/~varmo/papers/thesis.pdf).
They however always assume more than they target to explain making student turn around them like a dog not knowing which ball to catch first .
I.e. , the problem was that many such papers depended on parts of other papers , which either depended on other parts of the first paper , or on parts of still other papers .
Then I mentioned a response to this issue that I had received in a private e-mail message from a reader of the first thread , in which that reader had written that :
… the problem “ comes from trying to use academic papers as textbooks , a
purpose for which they ’re not usually designed . ”
I then added that this was the gist of the problem , and , as a possible solution , added a dead - tree - based book that I had read about earlier ( already mentioned above ) :
Conceptual Mathematics : A First Introduction to Categories ( Paperback )
by F. William Lawvere and Stephen Hoel Schanuel
Cambridge : Cambridge University Press , 1997
An elementary introduction
I added :
This book is reputed to be interesting even to non-mathematicians at a
philosophical level .
I myself have purchased a copy .
Then , on an afterthought , in an additional post immediately afterwards , I added that what would be even better would be a mathematical storybook ( separate links to the storybooks hyperlinked in the following quoted portion ) :
What would be especially interesting would be an introductory storybook on category theory : a book similar to , say , Flatland , by Edwin Abbott Abbott , or even Flatterland , by Ian Stewart .
These books would elevate category theory out of the realm of dry equations into a story which would keep me awake with suspense reading through the night .
Yes !
What we need is Category Land : Like Flatterland , Only About Categories .
If only a book were so .
Any suggestions ?

New judgeseems to be a bit of a spit fire too .
Show host Ryan Seacrest may be feeling a slight bit embarrassed today .
The final performer of the evening was a blind young man named Scott MacIntyre , who got one of the golden tickets signifying that he will advance to Hollywood .
Congratulating Scott , Ryan then held up his hand to give the contestant a high five , forgetting that he was blind .
We feel for Ryan .
It was a very uncomfortable moment .
What was probably a 2 second span felt like an eternity from our vantage point .

The Final Straw
was
His comments raised eyebrows in medical and political circles alike .
It is not every day that a high - profile physician relies on family videotapes to challenge the diagnosis of doctors who examined a severely brain - damaged patient in person .
" I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office , " he said in a lengthy speech in which he quoted medical texts and standards .
" She certainly seems to respond to visual stimuli . "
John McCain even got into the act .
And they even played the Randle Terry card .
America was horrified .
And so the conservative movement began to crumble because the media could n't waffle their way through it .
Bill Frist 's political career never survived his video tape diagnosis .
Delay : Mrs. Schiavo ’s death is a moral poverty and a legal tragedy .
This loss happened because our legal system did not protect the people who need protection most , and that will change .
The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior , but not today .
Today we grieve , we pray , and we hope to God this fate never befalls another .
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Schindlers and with Terri Schiavo ’s friends in this time of deep sorrow .
And those who are still learning -- our children - - oh , what terrible lessons they 're learning .
What terrible stories are shaping them .
They 're witnessing the Schiavo drama on television and hearing it on radio .
They are seeing a society -- their society , their people -- on the verge of famously accepting , even embracing , the idea that a damaged life is a throwaway life .
Our children have been reared in the age of abortion , and are coming of age in a time when seemingly respectable people are enthusiastic for euthanasia .
It can not be good for our children , and the world they will make , that they are given this new lesson that human life is not precious , not touched by the divine , not of infinite value .
Once you " know " that -- that human life is not so special after all -- then everything is possible , and none of it is good .
When a society comes to believe that human life is not inherently worth living , it is a slippery slope to the gas chamber .
You wind up on a low road that twists past Columbine and leads toward Auschwitz .
Today that road runs through Pinellas Park , Fla .
Yeah , you 'll learn the hard way , son .
" Lucky " children all over the world unwrapped their presents on Christmas Day and , according to an unhealthy amount of Youtube videos , went thoroughly insane .
My prediction is that , by now , the waggle boxes are already sitting untouched on the floor .
The above video , as spotted on Kotaku , is the thing that nightmares are made of .
He screams like he 's being raped , murdered and losing a bet at the same time .
And then comes the dancing ... oh God the dancing .
If you dare to watch , just be warned that it is not funny , not even in a " so bad it 's good " kind of way .
It will just make you want to find the nearest doctor and beg him for a cheap vasectomy .
There 's another video after the jump , equally unbearable and guaranteed to make your sperm shrivel up and die .
I 'm just glad that my wife 's boy 's a nihilist and does n't seem to care about anything , even Christmas , because I could not cope with that kind of behavior ... especially over a Wii .
This video is from a family of ten .
I can't stand people who have that many kids in these overpopulated times , but I take some solace from the fact that right now , the sheer amount of kids in the house is probably leading to the some intense fighting over who gets to play on the Wii .
In fact , I kind of get a boner imagining the conflict .
There are some more posted , but others seem either staged or not very interesting .
Not that these are interesting , but you get what I mean .
Never have children , dear readers .
And if you do have some -- drown them quickly .
BART looks at cuts , higher fares and lot fees BAY AREA Agency is projecting a $ 92 million deficit over next 18 months
late night Bart trains zoomed out of MacArthur station in Oakland as they where scheduled to ran all night to help people get across the bay .
While workers raced to fill a gaping 350 - foot hole they had demolished in middle of the Bay Bridge 's upper deck Monday morning , Bay Area drivers avoided the chaos that might have come with the holiday - weekend closure of the region 's key viaduct by staying off the roads in droves and taking BART .
BART ran trains all night on Labor Day morning as when it is usually closed .
Late night party goes packed the Powell Street station after last call and enjoyed safe ride to the east bay many feeling no pain at all from the inconvenience of the bridge being closed .

BART officials , faced with a projected budget shortfall of up to $ 92 million over the next 18 months , warn that service cuts and higher fares may be imposed later this year to balance the budget .
Commuters also may pay more for parking at station lots and see their trains wrapped in advertising , in effect turning them into moving billboards .
" We 're exploring everything , " said Carter Mau , executive manager of planning and budget for BART .
Confronted with falling fare and sales tax revenue , as well as anticipated funding cuts from the state , the nation 's economic crisis has caught up to BART , the regional rail operation with an average weekday ridership of 348,000 .
BART administrators had floated the idea of moving forward quickly with a plan to reduce the frequency of service at half the stations on nights and weekends , running the trains every 20 minutes instead of every 15 .
But the idea was put on hold after the BART Board of Directors delayed the scheduled budget session to deal with the fallout from the fatal New Year 's Day shooting of an unarmed man by a BART police officer , agency spokesman Linton Johnson said Tuesday .
That does n't mean the proposal wo n't pop up again .
With a projected operating shortfall of $ 37 million for the remainder of the current fiscal year , which ends June 30 , BART bosses think they can balance the books in the short term with a partial hiring freeze , dipping into reserves and delaying some planned capital projects , such as repaving station parking lots .
But most of those are one - time fixes that wo n't resolve the bigger budget problem .
The projected deficit for the new fiscal year that starts July 1 is $ 45 million to $ 55 million - just short of the record $ 60 million deficit the agency grappled with in 2003 .
" We 're going to have to look at longer - term solutions that potentially will impact passengers , " Mau said .
David Wang is one of those passengers .
He has commuted on BART between Oakland and downtown San Francisco since landing a job in real estate management six years ago .
" I understand BART is having financial problems like everyone else , " he said .
" But that does n't mean I like the idea of having to pay more for less service . "
Mau was quick to point out that staff has not recommended which , if any , budget - balancing proposals should go forward .
Ultimately , that decision will be made by the nine - member elected board .
Mau 's budget team , however , put together a number of options - from imposing a 5 - cent or 10 - cent surcharge on each trip to raising fares 5.5 percent or 10 percent .
The increased revenue would be $ 4 million to $ 14 million , depending on the particular fare increase .
Higher parking fees also are on the table .
Among the proposals : adding $ 1 to the existing parking charges , beginning to charge for parking on the weekends , and extending the paid - parking hours on weeknights .
BART also could start basing parking fees on demand , charging more when the lots near capacity and less when spaces are plentiful .
Another potential money saver : starting service an hour later in the morning and ending it an hour earlier at night , which officials say would save more than $ 2.4 million a year .
One idea on the options list is n't expected to go anywhere : Closing select stations on weekends .
The plan would end up costing the agency more than it saves due to lost fare revenue , Mau said .

It is commonly stated that China ’s ruling power has struck a kind of bargain with it ’s people – that they will accept the one - party rule and other political restrictions – as long as the government is able to keep the standard of living rising .
Orville Schell , Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and author of several books on China , gives a typical explanation :
… it would not be excessive to say that everything – economic health , social stability , political reform , environmental modernization , etc. – all depend on China ’s economy maintaining at least a 6 percent to 7 percent growth rate .
This is something that most market economies cannot do in perpetuity given the nature of cyclical growth cycles .
When this topic is brought up in foreign policy discussions , it is often understood as a uniquely Chinese problem – this bargain between the people and the state that they will accept an authoritarian government in return for a growing economy .
But a government ’s dependence on its ability to increase opportunities for its people for its legitimacy is not a uniquely Chinese problem .
The Chinese government may only be able to survive as long as it continues to provide economic growth to it ’s citizens , but how different is this bargain the Chinese people have made with their government from the bargain the America people have with ours ?
As long as American citizens have their basic needs met and a reasonable opportunity to succeed , they will accept a polarized distribution of wealth , corruption of various sorts , and sundry other injustices .
And as long as the Chinese citizens are moving towards having their basic needs met and have a reasonable opportunity to succeed , they will accept a single - party state , restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly , and other restrictions .
Any state ’s constitutional structure is legitimated by whether it provides for the needs of it ’s people .
In another age , the state merely provided security against hostile invasions and criminals ; later , it provided an identity as well ; by the middle of the 20th century , a state was legitimated by the extent to which it could provide for the basic needs of it ’s citizens .
The Cold War was , to a large degree , a competition between the capitalist states and the Communists states to see which could provide more ably for the needs of it ’s citizens .
Today , the state is evolving from providing for the needs of it ’s citizens to providing opportunities for it ’s citizens .
The basic problems of sufficient housing , food , clothes , and other necessities are able to be met with our global prosperity .
This evolution of our state into a market - state can best be seen by looking at the long - term trends in politics , shaping both the left and the right – as politiciains , with their ears constantly attuned to changing expectations , have sensed this evolution before most .
Looking from Carter to Clinton to Obama , we can see how each has progressively embraced a different sort of liberalism – each less focused on a government providing services and more focused on government providing opporunity .
Carter was a traditional big state Great Society liberal ; Clinton favored free trade , ending welfare , and reining in the deficit ; Obama ’s liberalism accepts a number of libertarian premises and seeks as it ’s goal the maximization of opportunity – as his health care reform plan , for example would n’t force people to join any particular program while offering a stable base for a necessary service that often causes people to remain in jobs they would not otherwise .
A similar evolution can be seen in Nixon to Reagan to Bush – as Nixon favored big government programs ; Reagan attacked big government ; Bush focused on creating an ownership society among other reforms .
Even when misguided – as for example his Social Security proposal – it was focused on offering greater opportunity .
James Glassman speaks for many doctrinaire anti-government conservatives when he suggests we allow our economy to contract – as eventually , it will reach bottom and bounce back .
Stimulus – he says – is the wrong metaphor :
“ We ’re going to have to jump start this economy with my economic recovery plan , ” [ Obama ] said on January 3 .
According to the image , one can jolt a dormant economy into action just as one can hook up polarized cables to a car battery , clamp a defibrillator to the chest , or breathe into the ear of a reluctant lover .
Suddenly , the object of our attention will be back in action , aroused …
In fact , stimulus may be precisely the wrong metaphor .
Rather than getting jazzed up , we need to be calmed down and to take the time to learn from the Great Depression , a time when government did too much , not too little .
Putting aside the non-consensus historical take on government action in the Great Depression ( discussed here ) , Glassman misses the point our political leaders do not : our societal order is premised on the idea of continuous growth .
A growing economy in a market state is like a beating heart – without it , we can not survive .
Perhaps a more apt metaphor is a business not making a payroll – the company can’t continue if it ’s employees do n’t get paid .
The employees will no longer consent to subject to their employer ’s authority – and the company will dissolve .
When the nation - states of the early 20th century were not able to legitimate their structure by providing for the basic needs of their citizens , radicalism , revolution , and war ensued as the old order broke down and fascism and Communism took it ’s place .
Today , if market - states are unable to provide opportunity their citizens , they will not survive going forward .
Our politicians and the elites sense this – which creates the manic desire to arrest this free fall and start our economy moving forward again – before it ’s too late .

We all learn lessons in life .
Three years ago , the lesson was that when you release highly anticipated downloadable content for your blockbuster RPG , it should never , never ever , be an Oblivion horse wrapped in foil .
Bethesda has learned this lesson , and that 's why Operation Anchorage is a holographic encounter detailing the Chinese occupation of Alaska .
So good , so far .
Now let 's saunter off to Anchorage to blow the heads off oriental futuro - gentlemen in slow - motion and glorious technicolour .
Following your download ( and if you 're playing on PC bear in mind that you 'll be dealing with Microsoft 's ever slack - jawed Games for Windows Live system ) , while you 're wandering through the wasteland you 'll pick up a distress call from a group of Brotherhood of Steel outcasts - those chaps with the rusty armour .
They 're calling for reinforcements in an area found in the South West of DC , just near the Red Racer factory , and are a bit grumpy at you when you turn up unannounced ready to chip in with a running battle against a cohort of Super Mutants .
In the aftermath of said battle , you 're advised to take a lift down into the vaults below you , since your wrist - mounted PipBoy companion means you may be able to help them out with a spot of technology pilfering / securing .
You alone , through the magic of Pip , can enter a military training program ( with safety parameters decidedly switched off ) , complete a variety of missions in the snowy virtual tundra and rout the Chinese invaders - thereby unlocking the wasteland installation 's loot container .
As soon as you enter virtua - Alaska it 's evident that this is an action - heavy piece of content - and due to the nature of the simulation it 's very much role - play lite .
Holographic corpses flicker and disappear before they can be looted , health and ammo is administered through abundant terminals placed along your firmly linear path , and the multi- layered decision - making so brilliantly executed in the full game is put out on its ear .
This is a content pack of the snipe , the grenade toss and of multiple Chinese Assault Rifle unloads direct to the head .
Subtle it is not .
The Crimson Dragoon are thought to be a distant relation of the Panzer Dragoon .
Not a blood relation though , clearly .
The game 's first section is essentially where Guns of Navarone meets the opening of GoldenEye ( you know , the bit before Sean Bean goes bad ) .
You and a friendly commando plough your way along icy cliff paths and through occupied military installations ; your objective being to knock out the three giant cannons that are causing a nuisance to the US troops .
It 's in this section that you 're introduced to Operation Anchorage 's best addition , enemies wearing a slinky Chinese brand of stealth armour - whether they 're the crack Chinese commandos called the Crimson Dragoon that run at you with swords , or the snipers that hide in the least convenient corners possible and try to make your life a misery .
They 're presented and introduced a lot like the lady assassins in the original Half - Life , and undoubtedly add an extra slice of tension and surprise to the accustomed Fallout gunplay template .
The problem , however , is that for the seasoned wasteland warrior everything is just far too easy .
True , my character is maxed out at level twenty and is a dab hand at small guns - but surely most people paying for this download will be an established part of the ' 30 hour + '
Fallout 3 faithful ?
It 's possible to spray your way through Operation Anchorage without ever truly breaking a sweat .
Overall the number of enemies on - screen at any time is probably higher than the norm , but you nearly always have an ally or two , and health recharge points pepper the level to a degree that goes beyond Bethesda hand - holding and moves into full - blown spooning .
DARPA has over 300 engineers working for the DARPA ’s Revolutionizing Prosthetics 2009 program .
They have been working on a project to create a new robotic arm .
The program was started in 2005 and includes people from different schools such as CalTech and Johns Hopkins University .
So far they have spent $ 71.2 million and may get up to $ 100 million before they are done .
The final design should be complete in late 2009 or 2010 .
This robotic arm promises to bring cyborg & human relations to new levels .

The first soccer game involving both sexes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution led to punishment on Monday , as a soccer club said it had suspended three officials involved and handed out fines .
Iran ’s Islamic rules ban physical contact between unrelated men and women , and Iranian women are barred from attending soccer games when men play .
The officials , a coach and two managers , first denied the game took place , but cellphone videos of the game were used as evidence against them , the newspaper Vatan - e - Emrooz reported .
The game was last Tuesday in Tehran between the club ’s women ’s team and its boys ’ team .
The boys won , 7 to 0 .
President - elect Barack Obama announced a massive public works campaign during his weekly address .
Part of it is broadband availability for all Americans .
Said Obama :
It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption .
Here in the country that invented the Internet , every child should have the chance to get online and they 'll get that chance when I'm President .
The pledge is a huge win for Kleiner Perkins - backed startup M2Z Networks , which last year proposed the FCC auction off spectrum for a free over - the - airwaves - Internet .
Perhaps getting early signals from Obama 's transition team , FCC chair Kevin Martin earlier this week announced he put a variation of the proposal on the agenda for the FCC's December 's meeting .
Martin 's version has critics because it calls for filters that would try to prevent minors from accessing porn .
Critics say that 's a technologically impossible feat and one the government should n't be allowed to bother with anyway .
Cynical advocates whisper that porn filters are a technologically impossible feat and that we should all let the government make a show of trying -- the same argument Google uses for justifying doing business with China .

It is one of the world 's most persistent myths : that one in 10 children are illegitimate without their legal fathers knowing that they have been cuckolded .
Now scientists believe they have arrived at the real figure .
One in 25 .
Scientists analysed the Y chromosomes of 1,600 unrelated men with 40 surnames to test the idea that there could be a link between the Y chromosome and surnames , which are both passed on to boys down the male line .
For certain , uncommon surnames there was a clear association between the unique genetic markers carried on the Y chromosome with the surname , suggesting that many of the men sharing the same surname had a common male ancestor many centuries ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This also enabled the scientists to estimate the probability of illegitimacy among the men carrying the same surname and found that it came out at between 1 and 4 per cent .
" People often quote a figure of one in 10 for the number of people born illegitimately .
Our study shows that this is likely to be an exaggeration .
The real figure is more likely to be less than one in 25 , " said Professor Mark Jobling of Leicester University , who carried out the study with colleague Turi King .
Common surnames , such as Smith and Brown , do not show any significant link with the genetics of the Y chromosome , but some less common names , such as Attenborough , Haythornthwaite , Herrick , Stribling and Swindlehurst , showed a definite association with the male chromosome , indicating that as many as 80 or 90 per cent of the men with these less familiar names shared a common ancestor .
" Surnames such as Smith come from a person 's trade and would have been adopted many times by unrelated people .
Less common names were more geographically specific and possibly adopted by only one or two men , so we would expect people with these surnames to be more closely related , " Dr King said .
" Attenboroughs , for example , essentially form one big family of distant relatives .
The Y chromosome type was the same even across spelling variants , which confirms that the spelling of names were formalised only relatively recently , " she said .
Surnames were introduced into the British Isles with the Norman invasion and had become widely used by about 1500 .
Previous research demonstrated a link between Y chromosomes and surnames , especially in Ireland where scientists had found that more than one in five men in north - west Ireland were descended from a single medieval ancestor .
Police say three Holland Township siblings whose names have Nazi connotations have been placed in the custody of the state , according to a story first reported in The Express - Times .
But a New Jersey Department of Youth and Family Services spokeswoman said that the agency would not remove children from a home based on their names alone .
Police Sgt. John Harris says workers from the state Division of Youth and Family Services on Tuesday removed 3 - year - old Adolf Hitler Campbell and his younger sisters , JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell from their home Friday .
" Just to be clear , removal of a child from a family is only done when there 's an imminent danger to a child and that would n't include the child 's name alone , " spokeswoman Kate Bernyk said .
" We would n't remove a child based on their name . "
Harris says a family court hearing on the case is scheduled for Thursday in Hunterdon County .
He said the parents were not happy about the decision , but that there was nothing unusual about the procedure .
DYFS spokeswoman Kate Bernyk says the child - welfare agency does not comment on specific cases .
The children and their parents , Heath and Deborah Campbell , received attention last month when a northwestern supermarket bakery refused to put Adolf Hitler Campbell 's name on a birthday cake .
The couple could not be reached for comment on Wednesday .

I am running my sites on a VPS from Slicehost and have had a very good experience .
When I started , I set everything up using Apache 2 , since that is what I am most familiar and adept with using .
Apache works well , but likes more memory than I have in my server .
This caused me to use my swap far too much .
I worked with the Apache configuration , finally coming up with the changes below for my /etc / apache2/ apache2.conf file , which minimized the swapping , but was n’t quite enough for me to be happy .
Also , if more than one or two people were browsing the site at a time , it forced everything to go much more slowly , because it now got backed up in a queue instead of being served quickly ( this was by design , to save memory and prevent swapping ) .
That was not acceptable .
Here you can see the changes I had made to get it to run without swapping all the time in a lean - memory environment .
I have removed everything but the necessary changes I had made , just to save space here .
Apache is so well documented , you should be able to figure the file out as needed using readily available info , if you need to .

I did some reading and decided to try nginx as a replacement for httpd .
The Slicehost folks also have some great how - tos ( not only on nginx ) and helpful people in their forums , and my friend , Ryan , has a helpful post as well .
There are lots of how - tos around for installing from scratch on a server .
Most are good .
I am focusing on migrating from Apach e2 to nginx .
For that , I will assume you have your site set up and running on Apache , your DNS is set properly and pointing to the server , etc .
First , make sure your system is up to date , especially with all security updates .
Then , install nginx , either from source or from your Linux distribution ’s package repositories .
I chose the latter .
You also want to install the cgi version of php5 .
On my Ubuntu 8.10 server , I did this :
sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe - upgrade
followed by :
sudo aptitude install nginx php5-cgi
I made a couple of modifications to my /etc/nginx /nginx .conf file .
Here is what I have .
My server has two dual core processors , hence the 4 worker processes .
I lowered the keep - alive timeout , added the gzip config , and made a couple more simple changes .
user www - data ;
worker_processes 4 ;
error_log /var/log/nginx /error.log ;
pid /var/run/nginx.pid ;
events {
worker_connections 1024 ;
}
http {
include /etc/nginx/mime.types ;
default_type application / octet - stream ;
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log ;
sendfile on ;
tcp_nopush on ;
#keepalive_timeout 0 ;
keepalive_timeout 3 ;
tcp_nodelay off ;
gzip on ;
gzip_comp_level 2 ;
gzip_proxied any ;
gzip_types text / plain text / html text / css application / x- javascript text / xml application / xml
application / xml+rss text / javascript ;
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf ;
include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled /*;
}
After that , I used the php- fastcgi script I found here and put it in /etc / init.d/ php-fastcgi .

Most how - to articles tell you here to create the directories to hold your website (s ) .
Since I am doing this on a site that was already running Apache , my sites already existed in /home / myusername/public_html/sitename / public .
Note where yours is , because you will need that info .
Ngnix works similarly to Apache for multiple domains .
With each you can set up more than one domain on an IP address using virtual domains .
If you only have one domain , the setup is easier , but outside the scope of this article .
Apache2 puts the sites in directories in /etc / apache2 / sites - available for setup , with symbolic links to there for active sites from / etc / apache2 / sites - enabled .
Nginx can do the same , using / etc / nginx / sites - available and / etc / nginx / sites - enabled .
Make a virtual host ( vhost ) file for each domain / site you plan to use in / etc / nginx / sites - available .
Here ’s a sample , based on this domain , but with sensitive info changed :
/etc/nginx/sites-available/matthewhelmke.net
server {
listen 80 ;
server_name www.matthewhelmke.net;
rewrite ^/(.*)
http://matthewhelmke.net/$1 permanent ;
}
server {
listen 80 ;
server_name matthewhelmke.net ;
access_log /home / myusername/public_html/matthewhelmke.net/log/access.log ;
error_log /home / myusername/public_html/matthewhelmke.net/log/error.log ;
location / {
root /home / myusername/ public_html/matthewhelmke.net/public ;
index index.html index.htm index.php ;
# this serves static files that exist without running other rewrite tests
if ( - f $ request_filename ) {
expires 30d ;
break ;
}
# this sends all non-existing file or directory requests to index .
php
if (!-e $ request_filename ) {
rewrite ^(.+ ) $ /index.php?q=$ 1 last ;
}
}
# pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0. 1:9000
#
location ~ \.php$ {
fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000 ;
fastcgi_index index.php ;
fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME
/home/myusername/public_html/matthewhelmke.net/public$fastcgi_script_name ;
include fastcgi_params ;
}
}
The first server section rewrites all requests for the domain that use www in front to the same url without the www .
The second server section is where all the fun happens .
Both are listening on port 80 , the standard for http .
The second tells nginx where to put the log files ( in a special log directory I created for each domain , in each domain ’s directory in my / home directory ) .
The location section is especially important .
It tells where to find the root directory for my site , in my case , in a special directory called public .
Then , I have two special rewrites .
These allow you to use permalinks aka clean urls aka pretty urls aka SEO urls with your site .
Once these lines are in the vhost file , you will discover that both WordPress and Drupal allow you to adjust the settings in their admin panels to use them as you would like .
I have n’t tried it with other types of content management systems , but I think it would probably work .
Without these lines , you have to use the standard url formats .
The other incredibly important bit is that last section .
It tells nginx to send all php files to the fastcgi script to be interpreted .
Without this , you wo n’t get php to work .
Once you get your vhost file set up , create a link to it from the sites - enabled directory so that nginx will know to use it .
cd /etc/nginx / sites - enabled / && sudo ln -s ../sites-available/yourdomain.com
Then , to test it out , start the fast - cgi script , turn off Apache , and start nginx .
/etc/init.d/php-fastcgi start
/etc/init.d/apache2 stop
/etc/init.d/nginx start
If everything is set correctly , you should now be able to view your site using nginx .
If it is n’t , you can always stop nginx and start apache2 again to keep your site up while you try to figure out the problem .
Once it is up , tested thoroughly , and you are happy , you can remove Apache if you like .
Note : I had some trouble with the fast - cgi script at first , having copied one that had special characters put in it .
That happens sometimes when you post code with WordPress .
I ’m trying to prevent it here by using code tags , but they reset any time there is a blank line , so you may need to cut / paste in sections .
If you have problems , and all you did was cut & paste , look at this first as the likely cause .
Before Ms. Kitts had the reinnervation procedure in October 2007 , for example , she had to move her back muscles a certain way to make the wrist rotate , and flex her triceps and biceps to move the elbow up and down .
“ It was a lot of work , ” she said .
“ It was n’t useful to me at all . ”
Image Amanda Kitts lost her arm in a car accident in 2006 , but a new kind of prosthetic allows her to tie shoes at her day care center .
Credit ... Shawn Poynter for The New York Times
The reinnervation method is part of a recent explosion of new ideas and techniques being explored as scientists try to help people better compensate for missing limbs or paralysis .
The drive is being fueled by increasing amputations from diabetes and military injuries and by advances in technology .
Arms have become a particular focus .
Science has long had success with prosthetic legs , but it is harder to mimic the complexity and dexterity of hands and arms .
Efforts under way include more flexible and sensitive skin and arm designs , and wireless devices implanted in prosthetic arms to allow more natural movement .
Researchers have also used sensors implanted in the brain to enable two monkeys to control a mechanical arm , and a paralyzed man to move a cursor on a computer screen .
Some of these methods , if perfected and if approved by regulatory agencies , may eventually become more viable for amputees .
And while the reinnervation technique does not require regulatory approval because it is done with surgery and existing devices , it has limitations that even its creator acknowledges , including that it is not possible for every patient , is costly , and takes months for the rewired nerves to grow and become effective .
Still , experts say it is the most advanced system being used in actual patients that allows the nervous system to directly control movement of an artificial arm .
Since it was pioneered in 2001 by Todd Kuiken , a physiatrist and biomedical engineer at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago , it has been performed on about 30 people in the United States , Canada and Europe , including eight soldiers injured in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Many patients , including the first , Jesse Sullivan , an electrical worker from Tennessee who lost both arms when he was electrocuted by a wire , can not only manipulate their prosthetic arms , but feel sensations of their missing hand when their chest is touched , Dr. Kuiken said .
Mr Lubanga denies the charges The International Criminal Court in The Hague has heard from a man who says he trained children to use Kalashnikovs for DR Congo warlord Thomas Lubanga .
The unnamed former militia fighter was giving evidence at Mr Lubanga 's trial for war crimes allegedly committed during the five - year civil conflict .
He said Mr Lubanga had told child recruits in his camp : " Do not be afraid .
The war will not be difficult . "
Mr Lubanga denies using hundreds of child soldiers during the war .
His trial opened on Monday after a seven - month delay , as judges and prosecutors disputed confidential evidence .
He is the first person to be tried at the ICC .
' Fighting and dying '
Taking the stand on Friday , the unnamed former fighter said he had joined Mr Lubanga 's militia , the Union of Congolese Patriots , in 2002 after militia commanders threatened to burn his village if the young people did not join its ranks .
THOMAS LUBANGA
Leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots , an ethnic Hema militia Accused of recruiting children under 15 as soldiers Arrested in Kinshasa in March 2005
Held by the ICC at The Hague since 2006 Born in 1960 , has a degree in psychology
Trial starts road to justice Profile : Thomas Lubanga
He said that children had been among the group that went with them to a training camp .
The militia made him an instructor since he had already served in the DR Congolese army , in which he had served seven months as a child soldier in 1997 , at the age of 13 .
He taught children to shoot and the basics of combat , he said .
Underage children were often assigned to officers as armed " bodyguards or escorts " , he said .
" Children were deployed in companies , battalions , brigades and platoons .
They were like soldiers . "
Eventually , the witness added , he saw children fighting and dying in several battles .
" If the commander gave the order , everyone had to fire , even the children , " he testified .
The first witness at the trial retracted his testimony after first saying he had been recruited by Mr Lubanga 's fighters on his way home from school .
The prosecutor , Fatou Bensouda , asked for an investigation into whether the witness , who was also unidentified , feared for his personal safety after the trial .

First release candidate of darcs 2.2 .
Dear Haskellers , I would like to forward this announcement on behalf of Petr Ročkai ( the current darcs Release Manager ) .
Darcs 2.2 is scheduled for release in 2009 - 01 - 15 , only three days from now !
This is the first of our biannual time - based releases .
We hope you 'll like it , and to help us ensure that you will like it , please help us test our the release candidate .
Thanks !
Eric
Petr 's words follow : ----------------8<-------------------------------------------------------------
I am pleased to announce that darcs 2.2 is coming along nicely .
I would like to ask everyone to give a ride to darcs 2.2 , release candidate 1 .
This release again comes in two flavours :
1 ) The source tarball , http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.2.0rc1.tar.gz, which can be built using the traditional autoconf - based buildsystem .
This is the fully supported version .
After downloading and unpacking , you can issue : $ ./ configure $ make $ ./ darcs -- version or # make install
More detailed instructions inside the tarball ( file README ) .
2 ) Cabalised source .
You can either download a tarball from http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.1.99.0.tar.gz and build manually ( see the build instructions in README inside the tarball ) , or , alternatively , you can use cabal - install to obtain a copy ( the release candidate is now available on hackage ) : $ cabal update $ cabal install darcs
This should give you a darcs binary in ~/.cabal / bin -- you should probably add that to your PATH .
This is a preliminary changelog since version 2.1.2 ( released last November ) : * In interactive record , it is now possible to get a list of currently selected hunks ( command 'l' ) .
( Christian Kellermann ) *
It is now possible to specify -- in - reply - to when using darcs send , to generate correct references in the mail header .
( Pavel Shramov ) *
New repositories with -- no - pristine - tree can no longer be created .
This only has effect on legacy darcs - 1 repositories .
* Improvements in Windows support .
( Salvatore Insalaco ) * Performance improvements in `darcs repair` and robustness improvements in `darcs check` .
( Petr Ročkai ) * Extensive manual and online help improvements .
( Trent W. Buck ) * Support for GHC 6.10 . * Overhaul of the make - based build system .
( Trent W. Buck ) * Cabal is now supported as a build method for darcs .
( Duncan Coutts , Petr Ročkai , Gwern Branwen ) *
First stab at libdarcs -- when building through Cabal , all of darcs implementation is now exposed in modules .
No API guarantees whatsoever .
( Eric Kow ) * Additions to Haddock documentation of the existing darcs modules for improved development experience .
* Improvements in the testing infrastructure .
( Christian Kellermann , Gwern Branwen ) * Low - level optimisations in filesystem code .
( Ganesh Sittampalam ) * Numerous major and minor bug fixes , refactorings and cleanups by David Roundy , Eric Kow , Jason Dagit , Dmitry Kurochkin , Thorkil Naur , Salvatore Insalaco , Christian Kellerman , Florent Becker , Duncan Coutts , Reinier Lamers , Ganesh Sittampalam , Petr Ročkai .
Preliminary list of issues that have been fixed in darcs since version 2.1.2 : 1223 sporadic init.sh test failure ( 2.1.1rc2+472 ) 525 amend - record => darcs patches show duplicate additions 1247 make TAGS is broken 1273 rename
File : does not exist ( No such file or directory ) 1165 get should print last gotten tag 1249 2.1.2 (+ 342 patches ) local drive detection on Windows error 1238 wish : darcs help setpref should list all prefs 1199 Backup files darcs added after external merge 1043 pull => mergeAfterConflicting failed in geteff ( 2.0.2 + ) 1117 Whatsnew should warn on non-recorded files 1101 darcs send -- cc recipient not included in success message Thanks to Thorkil Naur for compiling this list .
I would like to thank all contributors -- developers , testers , bystanders -- for helping darcs get along further .
It 's been hard times recently for darcs , as many of you probably know .
Nevertheless , we are regaining confidence in future darcs development .
No way are we going to leave darcs fall by the road .
I am sure that this one time , I speak for everyone in our developer and user community .
Yours , Petr. -- Eric Kow < http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Eric.Kow>

According to the LiMo Foundation , six of its operating members plan to deliver handsets based on the LiMo Platform , a Linux platform , this year .
Verizon Wireless , NTT DoCoMo , Orange , SK Telecom , Telefonica and Vodafone are all planning devices sometime this year , the LiMo Foundation said .
The LiMo Foundation said many of the new devices coming this year will be low - cost Linux devices .
Because of the open platform , operators have more control over the software development and customization of the devices .
According to LiMo , its collaborative nature opens itself up to customization and enables operators to build on their individual strategies through flexible implementation , while also reducing portfolio complexity , lowering device costs and speeding the deployment of third - party applications and services .
Along with the members stating their intent to have affordable LiMo devices on the market this year , the foundation on Monday also hinted at the release of LiMo Platform R2 and the development of several reference platforms .
All participants have turned in the technology needed for the R2 platform , the foundation said .
" The on - time completion of R2 technology contributions and the introduction of reference implementations demonstrate the deep collaboration amongst mobile industry leaders within the LiMo ecosystem , " Morgan Gillis , the LiMo Foundation 's executive director , said in a statement .
" Cooperation of this nature is unprecedented within the mobile industry and is fostered by LiMo 's unique governance frameworks which promote balanced contributions and influence over the LiMo Platform .
The LiMo Reference Implementations will reduce time to market for LiMo devices while providing ample scope for deep customization at the user interface and application layers . "
LiMo said the reference implementations will include code specific within both LiMo Platform R1 and LiMo Platform R2 , which includes source code contributions from members including Access , Azingo , LG Electronics , Purple Labs and Samsung Electronics , and components from open - source communities .
The devices expected from the six operators will be based on the latest LiMo Platform .
According to LiMo , so far 33 commercial handsets have been certified as LiMo Compliant , including 10 that will be showcased at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week , which includes devices from NEC and Panasonic and prototype models from LG and Samsung .
The LiMo Foundation was launched in January 2007 and is open to all mobile vendors and service providers , including device manufacturers , operators , chipset makers , independent software vendors , integrators and third - party developers .

Like many other students , players in the major revenue sports — football and basketball — work long hours at jobs that support them in college .
Their job is playing on a team .
For these students , however , a double standard has emerged .
They are treated better than other students in some ways , but much worse in other ways .
Specifically , they operate under wage rules and freedom - of - movement restrictions that anti-trust laws banned long ago for most people in this country .
Is this fair ?
College athletics is controlled by a powerful cartel .
That cartel , managed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , provides a good livelihood for the adults involved — coaches , athletic directors , team doctors , sports announcers , and college presidents .
Those adults receive handsome , competitive salaries that sometimes exceed $ 1 million per year .
But the athletes themselves miss out on the benefits of competition .
Hoping to become highly - paid professional players ( only a minuscule portion do ) , football and basketball players accept scholarships for room , board , and tuition .
Payment is called a “ scholarship ” in order to qualify for tax advantages .
No college is allowed to pay more , and anything resembling a gift is exhaustively scrutinized .
A star athlete cannot receive more compensation than an obscure teammate who sits on the bench most of the time .
Essentially , the NCAA is acting as a buyers ’ cartel just as OPEC acts as a sellers ’ cartel for oil - producing countries .
It makes sure that the normal forces of supply and demand do not operate .
If competition for outstanding athletes prevailed , outstanding athletes , like outstanding coaches , would be very well paid .
Colleges do n’t want to pay those high wages , and the NCAA is acting as their agent .
Although the best football and basketball players are harmed , it should be kept in mind that not all college athletes are harmed .
Some of the cartel revenue is used to subsidize non-revenue sports .
The fact that schools cannot compete for talented players on the basis of wages does not keep coaches and athletic directors from competing .
The NCAA is obliged to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable forms of competition .
In fact , there is a giant superstructure of rules and regulations designed to keep enterprising coaches from getting ahead of other schools .
The rules defy logic , and loopholes are closed as soon as they are discovered .
Schools can offer elaborate physical facilities , for example , and the services of expensive coaches , medical doctors , and tutors .
They can offer lower admissions standards for talented athletes who are weak students .
However , they are not allowed to offer gifts to students or their families or lucrative summer jobs .
College booster clubs cannot compensate players .
Rules have become so complex that schools often hire full - time bureaucrats with titles such as Athletic Director in Charge of Compliance .
Rules even restrict the number and timing of phone calls by coaches to high school recruits .
Former Indiana University coach Kelvin Sampson was fired for improper phone calls .
He tried to circumvent the phone call restrictions by substituting text messages , but the tactic did not save his job .
Each time the NCAA prohibits a particular kind of competition , enterprising coaches switch to another form .
Recruitment has moved to younger athletes , and coaches have already offered scholarships to middle - school students .
In response to this pursuit of youth , the NCAA recently restricted contact between college coaches and seventh graders at summer basketball camps .
A sign of the incongruity of this rule is that while the NCAA prohibits contact with young athletes , most people consider college summer camps for young science and foreign language students to be wholesome institutions .
Suppose a college wants to improve its team by persuading players to transfer from other schools .
Although offering higher pay is not allowed , the school might hire a better coach or build better facilities .
But the NCAA considers transferring an unacceptable practice that justifies punishment .
If students transfer , they can not compete for one year .
The restriction against student transfers applies even if a student ’s coach — who is often the reason why the athlete chose the college in the first place — takes another job .
A current Alabama high school star , DeMarcus Cousins , is challenging the arrangement .
He has made a verbal commitment to the University of Alabama - Birmingham , but refuses to sign a written agreement unless the UAB athletic director agrees in writing to let him transfer if the coach takes another job .
So far , UAB has refused the request .
NCAA officials have privately expressed concern that other athletes might seek the same transfer provision in their agreements .
Another rule is designed by the NCAA to keep outstanding high school players from going directly to professional basketball .
The NBA and the NCAA have an agreement that no players will be hired until they reach the age of 19 .
Although the agreement has kept 18 - year olds out of the NBA , it has also resulted in many players going to college for one year before turning pro ( “ one and done ” ) .
Maybe they should be called “ temporary ” student - athletes .
To avoid that year of low pay , a California high school player , Brandon Jennings , went directly to the Italian professional league .
He is earning $ 2 million this year , while waiting to join the NBA .
Other players are expected to follow his example , although this escape is only available to the very best players .
Perhaps the most extreme example of the cartel - like arrangement in these sports is the cooperation by colleges with the professional basketball and football drafts of college students .
For example , when the NFL has its annual draft , each eligible player is selected by one team ; all teams agree they will not offer jobs to draftees of other teams .
If a player is drafted by Cleveland but wants to play in New York , his only option is to try to persuade Cleveland ’s management to trade him to New York .
Americans would n’t tolerate such an arrangement anywhere else .
Imagine if colleges gave the right to hire their electrical engineering graduates to a group of employers who would , one by one , have exclusive rights to negotiate with each graduate .
The graduate would have to accept employment with the employer that “ drafted ” him , or search for a job outside electrical engineering .
No one would think that fair , but the public accepts such a practice for sports .
There is a way to treat athletes in revenue sports fairly : pay them competitive salaries , just as coaches and other employees are paid .
The best players would receive higher pay than average players , just as more productive employees do in many occupations .
As a result of competition , some of the revenue now controlled by athletic directors and the NCAA would be transferred to the athletes who have a critical role in generating it .
While space is limited for discussing this proposal ( and other proposals have been made for addressing the problem ) , it could take a couple of forms :
1 . Pay competitive salaries under current rules that require players to be full - time students .
Or ,
2. Relax the idea the players must also be students .
Thus , they would be employees , like coaches , medical doctors in infirmaries , or plumbers .
Most universities have film and drama series that entertain in a way similar to spectator sports , but the workers involved do n’t have to be students .
Considering the ethically dubious regulations that characterize the current cartel arrangement , those approaches are worth considering .
5. Mixtape Volume 3 by The Hood Internet

John Paulson shorted Lloyds and , according to Bloomberg , may have made $ 2.68 million a minute over a 25 - minute period this morning .
Put your calculators away : it ’s $ 67 million .
In 25 minutes .
Paulson ’s good fortune came as Lloyds fell as much as 43 percent in less than 25 minutes of London trading after it said HBOS Plc , the U.K. lender it took over last month , was going to report a $ 14.5 billion loss .
According to Bloomberg :
“ Paulson held a Lloyds short position representing 0.79 percent of the bank , or 129.3 million shares , as of Jan. 20 , according to a regulatory filing .
DataExplorers.com , which tracks share borrowing from London , said 1.1 percent of the stock was on loan as of Feb. 11 , the most recent data available .
That ’s down from as much as 8 percent six months ago and suggests Paulson held the bulk of the short position left . ”

A Japanese mobile phone operator has stopped selling
Research In Motion
's
( RIMM ) BlackBerry
Bold because of overheating problems during battery charging , according to a report .
According to
Reuters
,
NTT DoCoMo
( DCM )
halted sales of the high - end Bold after 30 customers reported the phone 's keyboard area heating up .
No users have reported being injured or their phones catching fire , the company said , according to
Reuters
.
DoCoMo , which began offering the Bold to customers last week , has sold about 4,000 of the smartphones .
According to
Information Week
, RIM is looking into the issue and said in a statement : " This issue appears to be specifically limited to the BlackBerry Bold devices sold in Japan since last week and sales of BlackBerry Bold devices in other countries are unaffected by this matter . "
It 's been something of a tough road for the Bold , one of RIM 's many weapons in the phone war with
Apple
( AAPL ) - Get Report
,
Palm
( PALM ) ,
Nokia

RIM shares closed up 1 % to $ 39.94 , and DoCoMo closed up 1 % to $ 15.37 .
DURHAM , N.C. - A device that can bestow invisibility to an object by " cloaking " it from visual light is closer to reality .
After being the first to demonstrate the feasibility of such a device by constructing a prototype in 2006 , a team of Duke University engineers has produced a new type of cloaking device , which is significantly more sophisticated at cloaking in a broad range of frequencies .
The latest advance was made possible by the development of a new series of complex mathematical commands , known as algorithms , to guide the design and fabrication of exotic composite materials known as metamaterials .
These materials can be engineered to have properties not easily found in natural materials , and can be used to form a variety of " cloaking " structures .
These structures can guide electromagnetic waves around an object , only to have them emerge on the other side as if they had passed through an empty volume of space .
The results of the latest Duke experiments were published Jan. 16 in the journal Science .
First authors of the paper were Duke 's Ruopeng Liu , who developed the algorithm , and Chunlin Li. David R. Smith , William Bevan Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke , is the senior member of the research team .
Once the algorithm was developed , the latest cloaking device was completed from conception to fabrication in nine days , compared to the four months required to create the original , and more rudimentary , device .
This powerful new algorithm will make it possible to custom - design unique metamaterials with specific cloaking characteristics , the researchers said .
" The difference between the original device and the latest model is like night and day , " Smith said .
" The new device can cloak a much wider spectrum of waves -- nearly limitless -- and will scale far more easily to infrared and visible light .
The approach we used should help us expand and improve our abilities to cloak different types of waves . "
Cloaking devices bend electromagnetic waves , such as light , in such a way that it appears as if the cloaked object is not there .
In the latest laboratory experiments , a beam of microwaves aimed through the cloaking device at a " bump " on a flat mirror surface bounced off the surface at the same angle as if the bump were not present .
Additionally , the device prevented the formation of scattered beams that would normally be expected from such a perturbation .
The underlying cloaking phenomenon is similar to the mirages seen ahead at a distance on a road on a hot day .
" You see what looks like water hovering over the road , but it is in reality a reflection from the sky , " Smith explained .
" In that example , the mirage you see is cloaking the road below .
In effect , we are creating an engineered mirage with this latest cloak design . "
Smith believes that cloaks should find numerous applications as the technology is perfected .
By eliminating the effects of obstructions , cloaking devices could improve wireless communications , or acoustic cloaks could serve as protective shields , preventing the penetration of vibrations , sound or seismic waves .
" The ability of the cloak to hide the bump is compelling , and offers a path towards the realization of forms of cloaking abilities approaching the optical , " Liu said .
" Though the designs of such metamaterials are extremely complex , especially when traditional approaches are used , we believe that we now have a way to rapidly and efficiently produce such materials . "
With appropriately fine - tuned metamaterials , electromagnetic radiation at frequencies ranging from visible light to radio could be redirected at will for virtually any application , Smith said .
This approach could also lead to the development of metamaterials that focus light to provide more powerful lenses .
The newest cloak , which measures 20 inches by 4 inches and less than an inch high , is actually made up of more than 10,000 individual pieces arranged in parallel rows .
Of those pieces , more than 6,000 are unique .
Each piece is made of the same fiberglass material used in circuit boards and etched with copper .
The algorithm determined the shape and placement of each piece .
Without the algorithm , properly designing and aligning the pieces would have been extremely difficult , Smith said .

Despite all of the recession hypes all over the world , you can actually do something for your local community , that also being hit by recession .
Why ?
The community has give your business a lot , and it ’s about time for you as a small business owner to give back to the community .
You might say , “ Come on – our business is struggling to ace recession , and you asked me to give back ? ”
Well , giving back does n’t always mean monetary gifts .
One of the most common ways for businesses to give back to their communities is through fundraising .
Of course , fundraising is always involving a certain amount of money for the fundraiser , in this case , your small business .
However , doing fundraising will arguably cost you less money , but more involvement , and doing it almost always yield better result than simply donate a sum of money for your local organisations .
Starting and organising a fundraising event
You can start by searching for fundraising ideas online .
You will not only yield loads of ideas , but also interesting twists along with the fundraising ideas , such as ‘ go green ’ fundraising , that not only impact the people , but also the environment .
If you are not sure how to do fundraising the right way , you can always partner with non-profit organisations to help organise the fundraiser .
If you are more of an adventurous type of business owner , you might want to consider DIY your fundraising event .
Again , you can search the Net for a free fundraising kit and tips and tricks on how to start and organise a successful ( and impacting ) fundraising events .
My recommendation of fundraising idea
I feel that fundraising is more impacting if it is focused on kids ( not mentioning it is a more fun kind of fundraising :D )
Fundraiser for kids always involve activities , such as painting with paint and brushes .
You can also ‘ enhance ’ your fundraising with ‘ going green ’ campaign that , in my opinion , will impact more , especially today .
You can start with ‘ green ’ and organic materials used in the kids ’ activities .
Why you should really consider doing fundraising
As a business owner , doing fundraising will help you impact more on your community .
Owing a business is a privilege , as you can reach more people through your brand name .
In return , your business will , somehow , receive the positive publicity and reputation from your fundraising events .
One word of advice – never focus on what you will get in return of your fundraising events ;
It will backfire you – your fundraising events will appear ‘ artificial ’ and ‘ fake ’ – things you do n’t want your local community feel about your business :)

The Netherlands does not want the diplomatic conflict with Britain over its ban on anti-Islam campaigner and MP Geert Wilders to escalate , Trouw reports on Friday .
The paper quotes a well - informed MP in The Hague who says the British government is extremely irritated by Dutch attempts to interfere in its right to ban undesirables .
And it quotes Dutch foreign minister Maxime Verhagen as saying that ‘ more pressure [ on the British ] would not have led to the desired result ’ .
The Netherlands will support Wilders if he decides to appeal agains the ban , Verhagen said .
Opposition right - wing Liberal ( VVD ) MPs have called for Verhagen to summon the British ambassador for a dressing down .
Deported
Wilders was deported from Britain on Thursday evening after attempting to attend a screening of his 15 - minute anti-Islam film Fitna .
Earlier , while being held at Heathrow airport , Wilders said he had been treated disgracefully .
‘[ British prime minister ]
Gordon Brown is the biggest coward in Europe , ’ the Telegraaf reported Wilders as saying .
‘ This is a very black day .
They are bowing down to Islam by refusing entry to critics . ’
On Monday it emerged that Britain had banned Wilders from the country because his presence could lead to public disorder and because of his extremist views .
Fitna
Wilders wants an end to Muslim immigration into the Netherlands and has called for the Koran , which he likens to Mein Kampf , to be banned .
Last month an Amsterdam court ruled that Wilders should be prosecuted for inciting hatred .
The screening went ahead on Thursday .
The Volkskrant said it was attended by around 25 people , of whom only four were members of parliament .
In total , the British parliament has 1,489 members .
The Volkskrant also pointed out than none of the three main political parties in Britain has commented on the row .
Yesterday the Volkskrant reported that Dutch anti-racist organisation Nederland Bekent Kleur has accused Wilders of hypocrisy because he recently tried to have a Muslim religious leader banned from the Netherlands .
Michael Jackson Negotiating $ 214 Million Concert Tour
What ?
The ' King of Pop ' could be going back on tour IF he signs a $ 214 million dollar contract to perform at 30 concerts in London .
It was 1996 when Jackson last toured and since then has made very few public appearances .
Does Michael have it in him to commit to 30 concerts ?
We wonder if there will be a special bailout clause , should the celebrity decide to ' call in sick ' .
Jackson , who is carrying a huge debt load , should be chomping at the bit to sign on the dotted line .
Sources say that Jackson feels like enough time has passed and that people have forgiven his past scandals , which involved criminal investigations of sexual abuse against minors .
A rep for his team has said they are only in the discussion phase at this time .
Assuming he is physically able to undertake the venture , have you forgiven Michael - is it time for a big comeback ?
One more thing .
Did you know that the singer is ... the big 50 ?
Check out young Michael below .

AROUND THE WEB

The race is on to breed maize which can tolerate the heat of future summers
Half the world 's population could face a climate - induced food crisis by 2100 , a new report by US scientists warns .
Rapid warming is likely to reduce crop yields in the tropics and subtropics , according to Prof David Battisti of the University of Washington , Seattle .
The most extreme summers of the last century will become the norm , he calculates , using 23 climate models .
We must urgently create crops tolerant to heat and drought if we are to adapt in time , he writes in Science journal .
We 're taking the worst of what we 've seen historically and saying that in the future it is going to be a lot worse , unless there is some kind of adaptation
Prof Rosamond Naylor , Stanford University
" The stresses on global food production from temperature alone are going to be huge , " said Mr Battisti , a professor of atmospheric sciences .
" And that does n't take into account water supplies stressed by the higher temperatures . "
He collaborated with Professor Rosamond Naylor , director of Stanford University 's Program on Food Security and the Environment , to examine the impact of climate change on the world 's food security .
Beyond extreme
The duo combined direct observations with projections from 23 global climate models that contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) 2007 global assessment .
They calculate there is greater than 90 % probability that by 2100 , the average growing - season temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will be higher than any temperatures recorded there to date .
" We are taking the worst of what we 've seen historically and saying that in the future it is going to be a lot worse unless there is some kind of adaptation , " said Professor Naylor .
We do have long enough to adjust these kind of temperature rises ...
But it requires a huge effort and it requires us to start now
Dr Geoff Hawtin , International Centre for Tropical Agriculture
" This is a compelling reason for us to invest in adaptation , because it is clear that this is the direction we are going in terms of temperature and it will take decades to develop new food crop varieties that can better withstand a warmer climate . "
In the tropics , the higher temperatures could be expected to cut yields of the primary food crops , maize and rice , by 20 - 40 % , the researchers said .
Rising temperatures also are likely to reduce soil moisture , cutting yields even further .
Currently three billion people live in the tropics and subtropics , and their number is expected nearly to double by the end of the century .
" You are talking about hundreds of millions of additional people looking for food because they wo n't be able to find it where they find it now , " said Professor Battisti .
Crop failures would not be limited to the tropics , the scientists concluded .
As an example , they cite record temperatures that struck Western Europe in June , July and August of 2003 , killing an estimated 52,000 people .
In France and Italy , the heatwave cut wheat yields and fodder production by one - third .
Scientists say such temperatures could be normal for France by 2100 .
" I think what startled me the most is that when we looked at our historic examples there were ways to address the problem within a given year .
People could always turn somewhere else to find food , " Professor Naylor said .
" But in the future there 's not going to be any place to turn unless we rethink our food supplies . "

" You could also mitigate it and not let it happen in the first place , but we 're not doing a very good job of that . "
" This is a very important report , " said Dr Geoff Hawtin , director general of the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture ( CIAT ) and a former executive secretary of the Global Crop Diversity Trust .
" What worries me is the uncertainty about the speed at which the growing season temperatures will rise .
African farmers will be among the first to feel the heat of predicted droughts " We do have long enough to adjust to these kinds of temperature increases - they are well within our capabilities .
But it requires a huge effort - much bigger than we are making currently - and it requires us to start now , " he told BBC News .
" We do n't know where the tipping points are - they could come quite quickly . "
Along with some other experts , Dr Hawtin believes that maintaining the maximum level of genetic diversity in crops and seedbanks is a good insurance policy , providing options for developing future strains .
" We are not doing enough , " he said .
" We 've done a fairly good job on cereal crops , but we have a long way to go on minor crops that could turn out to be of major importance in the future .
" We need to understand more about the physiology of drought and heat resistance in plants - maize , beans , legumes , sorghum , millet - anything which grows in an environment subject to drought .
" We need to take genes for heat tolerance , for example , and put them together in crops .
" And we have to start now . "
Harsh reality
As the summers get hotter , said Dr Hawtin : " We ca n't just move all our crops north ( or south ) because a lot of crops are photosensitive .
Flowering is triggered by day length - so you would run into all sorts of problems if you tried that .
" And even if Russia and Canada turn out to be the world 's bread baskets , the cost of transporting the food to Africa will be too much .
People in these areas can't afford food now . "
Researchers at CIAT are part of the global Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) network , aiming to create new , improved crop varieties able to survive the extreme growing seasons predicted throughout the coming century .
Approaches range from conventional crop breeding to genetic modification .
A number of other public research institutions and commercial companies are also working on drought - and heat - tolerant varieties .
Agrichemical giant Monsanto said this week it had made a " significant step " in creating a drought - tolerant maize which could be available as early as 2012 .
The genetically modified ( GM ) corn , which Monsanto claims will " reset the bar " in farming productivity , has moved to the final stage of development , the company said .
However , the claims were dismissed as " hype and misinformation " , by Bill Freese , a science analyst at the Centre for Food Safety in Washington DC .
Farmers in tropical countries such as Senegal will suffer most , the study predicts

Astronomers think they have finally solved the cosmic chicken - and - egg problem of what came first -- the giant black holes lying at the center of many big galaxies or the galaxies that feed them ?
The answer : the black holes .
The finding , which surprised even the scientists involved , implies that black holes grow the galaxies surrounding them , like a garden springing from a single seed or a man growing a suit of clothes .
The problem with that idea , according to the scientific team that presented the findings Wednesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , is that nobody has come up with an explanation for how a black hole could sprout a galaxy .
Advertisement
“ That is hard to imagine , ” said Chris Carilli of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
A black hole is the remains of a giant star that has collapsed -- typically after exploding in a supernova -- to what is known as a singularity , in which the gravity is so extreme that nothing , not even light , can escape .
The researchers based their work on past studies showing that for any given galaxy there is a constant ratio between the masses of a central black hole and the “ bulge ” of stars and gas relatively close to the galaxy ’s center .
In the nearby universe , that ratio is the same for black holes ranging from a few million times the mass of the sun to behemoths billions of times its mass , as is the case with the gigantic black hole at the heart of our own Milky Way galaxy .
“ The big question , ” according to Caltech astronomer Dominik Riechers , “ has been whether one grows before the other or if they grow together . ”
Advertisement
To find out , Carilli , Riechers and others on their team used telescopes that capture radio waves instead of visible light to study the first galaxies in the universe .
Those date to the time when the universe , which is now 13.7 billion years old , was less than 1 billion years old .
They found these ancient galaxies by studying the degree to which their light was shifted toward the red end of the spectrum .
The greater the redshift , which is a measure of how fast the galaxy is speeding away from us , the older the galaxy .
Next , they weighed the black hole and the galaxy ’s bulge , a challenging calculation that is done by observing the movements of the galaxy ’s clouds of gas , which are influenced by gravity .
In four early galaxies -- which are so distant that they appear to us in their youth -- the ratio between the black hole and the galaxy bulge was different from what was expected , the scientists said .
“ The black holes in these young galaxies are much more massive compared to the bulges than those seen in the nearby universe , ” according to Fabian Walter of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany and another member of the team .
Advertisement
That , according to the scientists , means the black holes started growing first .
Carilli and Riechers said much more work needs to be done to confirm the discovery .
For one thing , more early galaxies must be found and studied .
This will take time , since the calculations done on just the four studied so far required hundreds of hours of viewing time on various radio - wave dishes , including the Very Large Array in New Mexico .
Researchers also need to better understand the relationship between a black hole and its galaxy bulge .
Two radio telescopes under construction , the Expanded Very Large Array -- an upgrade to the New Mexico site -- and the Atacama Large Millimeter / Submillimeter Array in Chile , will make it easier to make detailed images .

There are other possible explanations for the difference in the ratio besides the idea that the black hole chicken came before the galaxy egg , Riechers said .
One guess is that fundamental laws of nature , such as the force of gravity , may have been different long ago , although that is considered a longshot .

" The abuse was rampant .
Physical , sexual , emotional — we experienced all three .
Some of it at the hands of the men , some of it at the hands of the wives . "
They spoke out as child protection workers continued to interview 416 children removed this week from the Fundamentalist Church of the Latter Day Saints ranch at Eldorado , Texas , because they were at risk of , or were already victims of , neglect and sexual abuse .
The ranch is associated with self - proclaimed prophet Warren Jeffs , now serving 10 years ' jail for facilitating the rape of a 14 - year - old girl in an arranged marriage .
The Mackert sisters grew up alongside Jeffs in Colorado City , near Arizona 's border with Mormon - dominated Utah .
Former Utah journalist Andrea Moore - Emmett said 13 major groups practised polygamy , which has been abandoned by the mainstream Mormon church .
Ms Moore - Emmett said she fled Utah after publishing a book , God 's Brothel , detailing the abuse of women and children in fundamentalist communities .
She said polygamy was " normalised " in Utah , where the sects were viewed simply as people practising their religion .
" Women are vessels to be worn out in childbirth , and girls are having children at age 14 , 15 , 16 , " she said .
" We have a high tolerance for religious freedom … and anything goes in the name of religion . "
Kathleen Mackert , 50 , who said she had undergone extensive therapy since leaving the group after her husband 's work moved the couple away , said she was relatively lucky being forcibly married to a stepbrother only 10 years her senior .
" Literally , one day I was called into my father 's office and he told me God had given the prophet a revelation that I was to marry my brother , " she said .
" Everything was controlled .
Those girls there , they do n't see a way out .
When I was growing up the community was not nearly as closed off and fanatical as they are now , so it 's my belief the abuse is even worse now .
" The thing about that religion , it attracts a lot of people who are dysfunctional . "
Rena Mackert , 54 , now lives in hiding in the US .
She said her mother 's family had for generations practised polygamy .
" You are taught that you can all but kill a child for deliberate disobedience .
The men have their power taken away by ( Warren ) Jeffs .
The only thing they have control over is their wives and children .
It 's power , it 's control and it 's sex , " she said .
" This is about under - age children being bartered as sex slaves , taken across state lines to marry into other compounds .
It 's just that they tried to cover it up under the label of freedom of religion . "
The Utah Attorney - General 's office has employed special investigators to look into the sects and claims some responsibility for last year 's prosecution of Jeffs .
Attorney - General spokesman Paul Murphy said several new probes were under way and Arizona was prosecuting eight men for sex offences relating to under - age marriage .
He said the families supported themselves through welfare claims .
" I met a woman the other day who had 17 children , and another with 14 .
Multiply that by several wives and you have a pretty big family . "
Ms Moore - Emmett was critical of Utah officials and said the state did little because polygamy was so normalised .
" The politicians are Mormon .
Mormons have abandoned polygamy .
However , it 's in their scripture and they all expect to live it in the hereafter . "
Ms Mackert said welfare workers dealing with the Eldorado children would need to avoid make - up , jewellery and wearing their hair loosely — all " signs of the devil " — or else they would not be trusted .
Middle - aged men having sex with 12 - to 15 - year - olds was too much for Ben
Johnston , a hulking 6 - foot - 5 - inch Texan , and more than a year ago he blew
the whistle on his employer , DynCorp , a U.S. contracting company doing
business in Bosnia .
According to the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act ( RICO ) lawsuit filed in Texas on behalf of the former DynCorp aircraft mechanic , " in the latter part of 1999 Johnston learned that employees and supervisors from DynCorpwere engaging in perverse , illegal and inhumane behavior [ and ] were purchasing illegal weapons , women , forged passports and [ participating in other immoral acts .
Johnston witnessed coworkers and supervisors literally
buying and selling women for their own personal enjoyment , and employees
would brag about the various ages and talents of the individual slaves they
had purchased . "
Rather than acknowledge and reward
Johnston 's effort to get this behavior
stopped , DynCorp fired him , forcing him into protective custody by the U.S .
Army Criminal Investigation Division ( CID ) until the investigators could get him safely out of Kosovo and returned to the
United States .
That departure from the war - torn country was a far cry from what
Johnston imagined a year earlier when he arrived in
Bosnia to begin a three - year U.S. Air Force contract with DynCorp as an aircraft - maintenance technician for Apache and Blackhawk helicopters .
For more than 50 years DynCorp , based in
Reston , Va. , has been a worldwide force providing maintenance support to the
U.S. military through contract field teams ( CFTs ) .
As one of the federal government 's top 25 contractors , DynCorp has received nearly $ 1 billion since 1995 for these services and has deployed 181 personnel to
Bosnia during the last six years .
Although DynCorp long has been respected for such work , according to
Johnston and internal DynCorp communications it appears that extracurricular sexcapades on the part of its employees were tolerated by some as part of its business in
Bosnia .
But DynCorp was nervous .
For instance , an internal e-mail from DynCorp
employee Darrin Mills , who apparently was sent to
Bosnia to look into reported problems , said , " I met with Col. Braun [ a base supervisor ] yesterday .
He is very concerned about the CID investigation ; however , he views it mostly as a DynCorp problem .
What he wanted to talk about most was how I am going to fix the maintenance problems here and how the investigation is going to impact our ability to fix his airplanes . "
The Mills e-mail continued : " The first
thing he told me is that ' they are tired of having smoke blown up their ass . '
They do n't want anymore empty promises . "
An e-mail from Dyncorp's
Bosnia site supervisor , John Hirtz ( later fired for
alleged sexual indiscretions ) , explains DynCorp 's position in
Bosnia .
" The
bottom line is that DynCorp has taken what used to be a real positive program that has very high visibility with every Army unit in the world and turned it into a bag of worms .
Poor quality was the major issue . "
Johnston was on the ground and saw firsthand what the military was
complaining about .
" My main problem , " he explains , " was [ sexual
misbehavior ] with the kids , but I was n't too happy with them ripping off the
government , either .
DynCorp is just as immoral and elite as possible , and any rule they can break they do .
There was this one guy who would hide parts so we would have to wait for parts and , when the military would question why it was taking so long , he 'd pull out the part and say ' Hey , you need to install this . '
They'd have us replace windows in helicopters that were n't bad just to get paid .
They had one kid , James Harlin , over there who was right out of high school and he did n't even know the names and purposes of the basic tools .
Soldiers that are paid $ 18,000 a year know more than this kid , but this is the way they [ DynCorp ] grease their pockets .
What they say in
Bosnia is that DynCorp just needs a warm body - that 's the DynCorp slogan .
Even if you do n't do an eight - hour day , they 'll sign you in for it because that 's how they bill the government .
It 's a total fraud . "
Remember ,
Johnston was fired by this company .
He laughs bitterly recalling
the work habits of a DynCorp employee in
Bosnia who " weighed 400 pounds
and would stick cheeseburgers in his pockets and eat them while he worked .
The problem was he would literally fall asleep every five minutes .
One time he fell asleep with a torch in his hand and burned a hole through the plastic on an aircraft . "
This same man , according to
Johnston , " owned a girl who could n't have been more than 14 years old .
It 's a sick sight anyway to see any grown man [ having sex ] with a child , but to see some 45 - year - old man who weighs 400 pounds with a little girl , it just makes you sick . "
It is precisely these allegations that
Johnston believes got him fired .
Johnston reports that he had been in
Bosnia only a few days when he became aware of misbehavior in which many of his DynCorp colleagues were involved .
He tells INSIGHT , " I noticed there were problems as soon as I got there , and I tried to be covert because I knew it was a rougher crowd than I 'd ever dealt with .
It 's not like I do n't drink or anything , but DynCorp employees would come to work drunk .
A DynCorp van would pick us up every morning and you could smell the alcohol on them .
There were big - time drinking issues .
I always told these guys what I thought of what they were doing , and I guess they just thought I was a self - righteous fool or something , but I did n't care what they thought . "
The mix of drunkenness and working on multimillion - dollar aircraft upon which the lives of
U.S. military personnel depended was a serious enough issue , but
Johnston drew the line when it came to buying young girls and women as sex slaves .
" I heard talk about the prostitution right away , but it took some time before I understood that they were buying these girls .
I 'd tell them that it was wrong and that it was no different than slavery - that you can't buy women .
But they 'd buy the women 's passports and they [ then ] owned them and would sell them to each other . "
" At first , " explains
Johnston , " I just told the guys it was wrong .
Then I went to
my supervisors , including John Hirtz , although at the time I did n't realize how
deep into it he was .
Later I learned that he had videotaped himself having sex with two girls and CID has that video as evidence .
Hirtz is the guy who would take new employees to the brothels and set them up so he got his women free .
The Serbian mafia would give Hirtz the women free and , when one of the guys was leaving the country , Hirtz would go to the mafia and make sure that the guys did n't owe them any money . "
" None of the girls , " continues
Johnston , " were from
Bosnia .
They were from
Russia ,
Romania and other places , and they were imported in by DynCorp and the Serbian mafia .
These guys would say ' I gotta go to
Serbia this weekend topick up three girls . '
They talk about it and brag about how much they pay for them - usually between $ 600 and $ 800 .
In fact , there was this one guy who had to be 60 years old who had a girl who could n't have been 14 .
DynCorp leadership was 100 percent in bed with the mafia over there .
I did n't get any results from talking to DynCorp officials , so I went to Army CID and I drove around with them , pointing out everyone 's houses who owned women and weapons . "
That 's when
Johnston 's life took a dramatic turn .
On June 2 , 2000 , members of the 48th Military Police Detachment conducted a sting on the DynCorp hangar at Comanche Base Camp , one of two
U.S. bases in
Bosnia , and all DynCorp personnel were detained for questioning .
CID spent several weeks working the investigation and the results appear to support
Johnston 's allegations .
For example , according to DynCorp employee Kevin Werner 's sworn statement to CID , " during my last six months I have come to know a man we call ' Debeli , ' which is Bosnian for fat boy .
He is the operator of a nightclub by the name of Harley 's that offers prostitution .
Women are sold hourly , nightly or permanently . "
Werner admitted to having purchased a woman to get her out of prostitution
and named other DynCorp employees who also had paid to own women .
He
further admitted to having purchased weapons ( against the law in
Bosnia ) and it was Werner who turned over to CID the videotape made by Hirtz .
Werner apparently intended to use the video as leverage in the event that Hirtz decided to fire him .
Werner tells CID , " I told him [ Hirtz ]
I had a copy and that all I wanted was to be treated fairly .
If I was going to be fired or laid off , I
wanted it to be because of my work performance and not because he was not happy with me . "
According to Hirtz 's own sworn statement to CID , there appears to be little
doubt that he did indeed rape one of the girls with whom he is shown having
sexual intercourse in his homemade video .
CID : Did you have sexual intercourse with the second woman on the tape ?
Hirtz : Yes
CID : Did you have intercourse with the second woman after she said " no " to you ?
Hirtz : I do n't recall her saying that .
I do n't think it was her saying " no . "
CID : Who do you think said " no " ?
Hirtz : I do n't know .
CID : According to what you witnessed on the videotape played for you in which you were having sexual intercourse with the second woman , did you have sexual intercourse with the second woman after she said " no " to you ?
Hirtz : Yes .
CID : Did you know you were being videotaped ?
Hirtz : Yes .
I set it up .
CID : Did you know it is wrong to force yourself upon someone without their
consent ?
Hirtz : Yes .
The CID agents did not ask any of the men involved what the ages of the
" women " were who had been purchased or used for prostitution .
According to CID , which sought guidance from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate in
Bosnia , " under the Dayton Peace Accord , the contractors were protected from Bosnian law which did not apply to them .
They knew of no [
U.S. ] federal laws that would apply to these individuals at this time . "
However , CID took another look and , according to the investigation report ,
under Paragraph 5 of the NATO Agreement Between the Republic of
Bosnia - Herzegovina and
Croatia regarding the status of NATO and its
personnel , contractors " were not immune from local prosecution if the acts were committed outside the scope of their official duties . "
Incredibly , the CID case was closed in June 2000 and turned over to the
Bosnian authorities .
DynCorp says it conducted its own investigation , and Hirtz and Werner were fired by DynCorp and returned to the
United States but were not prosecuted .
Experts in slave trafficking are n't buying the CID's
interpretation of the law .
Widney Brown , an advocate for Human Rights Watch , tells INSIGHT " our
government has an obligation to tell these companies that this behavior is
wrong and they will be held accountable .
They should be sending a clear
message that it wo n't be tolerated .
One would hope that these people would n't need to be told that they can't buy women , but you have to start off by laying the ground rules .
Rape is a crime in any jurisdiction and there should not be impunity for anyone .
Firing someone is not sufficient punishment .
This is a very distressing story - especially when you think that these people and organizations are going into these countries to try and make it better , to restore a rule of law and some civility . "
Christine Dolan , founder of the International Humanitarian Campaign Against
the Exploitation of Children , a Washington - based nonprofit organization , tells
Insight : " What is surprising to me is that Dyncorp has kept this contract .
The
U.S. says it wants to eradicate trafficking of people , has established an office
in the State Department for this purpose , and yet neither State nor the
government - contracting authorities have stepped in and done an investigation of this matter . "
Dolan says , " It 's not just Americans who are participating in these illegal acts .
But what makes this more egregious for the
U.S. is that our purpose in those
regions is to restore some sense of civility .
Now you 've got employees of
U.S .
contractors in bed with the local mafia and buying kids for sex !
That these
guys have some kind of immunity from prosecution is morally outrageous .
How can men be allowed to get away with rape simply because of location ?
Rape is a crime no matter where it occurs and it's important to remember that even prostitution is against the law in
Bosnia .
The message we 're sending to kids is that it 's okay for
America 's representatives to rape children .
We talk about the future of the children , helping to build economies , democracy , the rule of law , and at the same time we fail to prosecute cases like this .
That is immoral and hypocritical , and if DynCorp is involved in this in any way it should forfeit its contract and pay restitution in the form of training about trafficking . "
Charlene Wheeless , a spokeswoman for DynCorp , vehemently denies any
culpability on the part of the company , According to Wheeless , " The notion that a company such as DynCorp would turn a blind eye to illegal behavior by our employees is incomprehensible .
DynCorp adheres to a core set of values that has served as the backbone of our corporation for the last 55 years , helping us become one of the largest and most respected professional - services and outsourcing companies in the world .
We can't stress strongly enough that , as an employee - owned corporation , we take ethics very seriously .
DynCorp stands by its decision to terminate [ whistle - blower ]
Ben Johnston , who was terminated for cause . "
What was the " cause " for which
Johnston was fired ?
He received his only
reprimand from DynCorp one day prior to the sting on the DynCorp hangar
when
Johnston was working with CID .
A week later he received a letter of
discharge for bringing " discredit to the company and the U.S. Army while
working in
Tuzla , Bosnia -
Herzegovina . "
The discharge notice did not say how
Johnston " brought discredit to the company . "
It soon developed conveniently , according to
Johnston 's attorneys , that he was implicated by a DynCorp employee for illegal activity in
Bosnia .
Harlin , the
young high - school graduate Johnston complained had no experience in aircraft maintenance and did n't even know the purposes of the basic tools , provided a sworn statement to CID about Johnston .
Asked if anyone ever had offered to sell him a weapon , Harlin fingered Johnston and DynCorp employee Tom Oliver , who also had disapproved of the behavior of DynCorp employees .
Harlin even alleged that
Johnston was " hanging out with Kevin Werner . "
Although Werner had no problem revealing the names and illegal activities of
other DynCorp employees , Werner did not mention
Johnston 's name in his
sworn statement .
Kevin Glasheen ,
Johnston 's attorney , says flatly of this : " It 's DynCorp 's effort
to undermine Ben 's credibility .
But I think once the jury hears this case , that
accusation is only going to make them more angry at DynCorp .
In order to
make our claim , we have to show that DynCorp was retaliating against Ben ,
and that fits under racketeering .
There is a lot of evidence that shows this was what they were doing and that it went all the way up the management chain . "
According to Glasheen , " DynCorp says that whatever these guys were doing
is n't corporate activity and they 're not responsible for it .
But this problem
permeated their business and management and they made business decisions to further the scheme and to cover it up .
We have to show that there was a causal connection between Ben 's whistle - blowing about the sex trade and his being fired .
We can do that .
We 're here to prove a retaliation case , not convict DynCorp of participating in the sex - slave trade .
" What you have here is a Lord of the Flies mentality .
Basically you 've got a
bunch of strong men who are raping and manipulating young girls who have
been kidnapped from their homes .
Who 's the bad guy ?
Is it the guy who buys
the girl to give her freedom , the one who kidnaps her and sells her or the one who liberates her and ends up having sex with her ?
And what does it mean when the
U.S. steps up and says , ' We do n't have any jurisdiction ' ?
That 's absurd . "
The outraged attorney pauses for breath .
" This is more than one twisted mind .
There was a real corporate culture with a deep commitment to a cover-up .
And it 's outrageous that DynCorp still is being paid by the government on this contract .
The worst thing I 've seen is a DynCorp e-mail after this first came up where they 're saying how they have turned this thing into a marketing success , that they have convinced the government that they could handle something like this . "
Johnston is not the only DynCorp employee to blow the whistle and sue the
billion - dollar government contractor .
Kathryn Bolkovac , a U.N. International
Police Force monitor hired by the
U.S. company on another U.N. - related
contract , has filed a lawsuit in
Great Britain against DynCorp for wrongful
termination .
DynCorp had a $ 15 million contract to hire and train police officers for duty in
Bosnia at the time she reported such officers were paying for prostitutes and participating in sex - trafficking .
Many of these were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity , but none have been prosecuted , as they also enjoy immunity from prosecution in
Bosnia .
DynCorp has admitted it fired five employees for similar illegal activities prior
to
Johnston 's charges .
But
Johnston worries about what this company 's culture does to the reputation of the
United States .
" The Bosnians think we 're all trash .
It 's a shame .
When I was there as a soldier they loved us , but DynCorp employees have changed how they think about us .
I tried to tell them that this is not how all Americans act , but it 's hard to convince them when you see what they 're seeing .
The fact is , DynCorp is the worst diplomat you could possibly have over there . "
Johnston 's attorney looks to the outcome .
" How this all ends , " says Glasheen , " will say a lot about what we stand for and what we wo n't stand for . "

An 11 - year - old American boy has been charged with killing his father 's pregnant girlfriend with his hunting gun as she lay in bed at the family farmhouse in Pennsylvania .
Jordan Brown is alleged to have shot 26 - year - old Kenzie Marie Houk , who was eight months pregnant , before catching the school bus on Friday morning , according to the Lawrence County district attorney , John Bongivengo .
Her family and friends said there had been tensions between her and the boy .
" There was an issue with jealousy , " said Kenzie Marie 's brother - in - law , Jason Kraner , 34 .
Bongivengo said Jason was charged with criminal homicide and the criminal homicide of an unborn child and was being held in Lawrence County jail .
A preliminary hearing is set for Thursday .
The case has highlighted growing concerns about children 's access to firearms .
The fifth - grader was picked up from school on Friday by Pennsylvania state police after they found Kenzie Marie 's body .
Her four - year - old daughter had told tree cutters on the property that she thought her mother was dead , Bongivengo said .
On Saturday , Jordan told police he had seen a suspicious black truck , causing investigators to look into a false lead for about five hours .
Inconsistencies in Jason 's description of the vehicle led police to re-interview the victim 's seven - year - old daughter , who implicated the boy in the killing , the attorney said .
" She did n't actually eyewitness the shooting .
She saw him with what she believed to be a shotgun and heard a loud bang , " Bongivengo said .
He said the shotgun was found in what police believed was the boy 's bedroom .
The youth model 20 - gauge shotgun , which is said to have belonged to Jordan , is designed for children and such weapons do not have to be registered .
Jordan 's attorney , Dennis Elisco , said the evidence pointed to the gunshot wound being " consistent " with the boy 's hunting gun , but he wanted to see stronger proof .
" I believe Jordan did not do this and I 'm looking forward to seeing the physical evidence to see if it matches with what I think happened , " he said after talking to the boy in jail .
Police said they had no motive for the shooting , and Bongivengo would not say whether the boy confessed .
" An 11 - year - old kid , what would give him the motive to shoot someone ? " Kenzie Marie 's father , Jack , asked .
" Maybe he was just jealous of my daughter and the baby and thought he would be overpowered . "
Jack
Houk said the boy and his father used to practise shooting behind their farmhouse and the pair enjoyed hunting together .
He said he did not know of any recent problems between the boy and his daughter , but there had been " some tension " in the beginning .
Houk said his daughter had been working hard to forge a relationship with the boy .
The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday 29 January 2009
In the article below we said that George Mitchell , who has recently been appointed as Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy , successfully completed the task of overseeing the decommissioning of weapons in the Northern Ireland peace process .
To clarify : Mitchell was chair of the international body whose 1996 report suggested that decommissioning of paramilitary weapons should take place at the same time as all - party negotiations and he chaired the peace talks that led to the Good Friday agreement in 1998 in which the participants reaffirmed their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations .
In 2005 the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning headed by General John de Chastelain reported that the IRA had completed disarmament .
President Barack Obama yesterday promised the US will " actively and aggressively " work for an elusive Middle East peace deal and will dispatch a high - powered envoy to the region as a matter of urgency .
Speaking to diplomats at the state department on his second day in office , he set out his widely - awaited views on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , ending the near silence he had maintained over the last few weeks .
Putting the conflict at the heart of US foreign policy for the first time in eight years , he said he would invest time , political capital and cash in the peace effort .
Intent on reshaping foreign policy as quickly as possible , he named the veteran mediator George Mitchell as his Middle East envoy .
He also named another veteran diplomat , Richard Holbrooke , as his special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He pledged to continue US support for Israel but his tone was more balanced than that of George Bush , who uncritically sided with Israel .
Obama , speaking alongside his secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , called for a durable ceasefire in Gaza .
He urged Hamas to stop firing rockets into Israel , as Bush had done , but he also called on Israel to " complete the withdrawal of its forces from Gaza " .
The president expressed concern at the loss of life among Israelis and Palestinians , and at the suffering in Gaza .
He said his heart went out to " civilians who are going without food , water or medical care " .
He said he would help Egypt to try to curb smuggling of weapons through underground tunnels to Gaza and would also provide and seek donations from other countries for the development of Gaza .
Obama 's promise of intervention comes at a time when feelings are running high in the region over the high death toll in Gaza .
Though there is a ceasefire in place , it remains fragile .
It is also a politically difficult time in the region , with Israelis scheduled to go to the polls next month and the Palestinians badly divided .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , welcomed Obama 's comments but a Hamas spokesman in Beirut , Osama Hamdan , told al - Jazeera that Obama 's comments did not represent change and , unless he did so , he would be doomed to the same failure as Bush .
Obama signalled a willingness to pick up from where President Bill Clinton left off .
Clinton tried to broker a peace deal in 2000 and 20001 between the then Palestinian president Yasser Arafat and the then Israeli prime minister , Ehud Barak , but ran out of time .
Bush only intermittently engaged in the Middle East , choosing to side almost uncritically with Israel .
He held a peace conference at Annapolis , Maryland , in 2007 , but failed to throw his weight behind it .
At the state department , Obama confirmed that Mitchell , 75 , the former senator , whose appointment had been leaked to the press this week , would be his Middle East envoy .
Mitchell , appointed by Bill Clinton to help as a mediator in the Northern Ireland peace process , played a pivotal role in Belfast .
He won the respect of both the IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries for his efforts at bringing about decommissioning .
He also reported to Bill Clinton on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , calling for the Palestinian authority to crack down on militant groups but for Israel too to freeze the expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank .
Mitchell told diplomats at the state department : " I believe deeply that with committed persevering and patient diplomacy peace and stability can be achieved in the Middle East . "
The appointment of Mitchell undercuts the role of Tony Blair , who since 2007 has been working as a Middle East mediator of the Quartet , which is made up of the UN , the US , the EU and Russia .
But Blair yesterday welcomed Mitchell 's appointment .
A spokesman for Blair said it would renew their close and productive relationship in Northern Ireland .
" It shows the true commitment President Obama and Secretary Clinton have to making real progress in the Middle East , " the spokesman said .
As well as naming Mitchell , Obama and Clinton yesterday confirmed that Holbrooke , 67 , another veteran of the Bill Clinton administration who was US ambassador to the United Nations and brokered the Bosnia peace agreement , is to be a special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Holbrooke said Americans and their foreign partners in Afghanistan were fighting " a ruthless and determined enemy without any scruples at all , an enemy that is willing to behead women who dare to teach in a school to young girls , an enemy that has done some of the most odious things on Earth .
And across the border lurks the greater enemy still : the people who committed the atrocities of 11 September 2001 . "
In our modern throwaway society , many perfectly good materials end up sitting in a landfill while new materials are constantly created and used in their place .
Some creative green builders , artists , scientists and other innovators are turning the tables on that trend , gathering up all the discarded odds and ends they can find to create stunning homes , temples , sculpture and even fuel .
Here are 10 examples of incredibly creative recycling projects that convert ordinary objects into art and transform trash into something far more useful .
Buddhist Temple Made of Beer Bottles
The Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew temple in the Sisaket province of Thailand is made from over one million recycled green and brown glass beer bottles .
The monks accomplished two goals in one by cleaning up local pollution and creating a useful structure for themselves .
Everything from the water tower to the tourist bathroom is made from Heineken and Chang beer bottles .
Bridge Made of Recycled Paper Tubes
Japanese architect Shigeru Ban constructed a bridge over the Gardon River in southern France using primarily cardboard tubes .
Ban , who was already known for using eco-friendly , lightweight materials , said that he wanted to show people that paper can be strong and lasting .
Fragile though this paper bridge may look , it could hold up to 20 people at once .
The bridge was open to the public for six months in 2007 before being disassembled for the rainy season .
Rich Art ’s Recycled Outdoor Gallery
Outsider artist Richard Tracy – known as Rich Art – has been turning trash into spectacular sculptures for 20 years .
Tracy picks through neighbors ’ trash in hopes of finding some discarded item that might serve as the inspiration for a new addition to his sprawling outdoor art gallery , which attracts thousands of visitors each year .
Styrofoam , tomato cages , roller skates and tea carts have been spared a lifetime in the landfill by their inclusion in this wacky gallery .
Shipping Containers as Sleek , Modern Homes
They may be ugly , rectangular , often rusting boxes , but with a little ingenuity and care shipping containers can be transformed into beautiful , functional modern homes .
There ’s a huge surplus of empty shipping containers around the country due to the fact that it ’s too expensive for countries to ship empty containers back to where they came from .
The photo above shows four stacked shipping containers put together for office and living space by architects Pieter Peelings and Silvia Mertens .

Jumbo Jet Hostel
A jumbo jet that had seen better days sat unused on the runway at the Arlanda Airport in Sweden until an intrepid businessman decided he had an ideal use for it .
Oscar Diös turned the 1976 Boeing 747-200 into a hostel , citing the need for inexpensive lodging and lack of affordable land near the airport .
The interior was dismantled , sanitized and divided into 25 rooms along with a café .
The rooms are officially available to book starting mid-January 2009 for about $ 45 USD per night .
HA Schult ’s ‘ Trash People ’
From this collection of recycled art , the ‘ trash people ’ created by HA Schult are truly amazing .
Along with 30 assistants , Schult created these sorta creepy sculptures from crushed cans , computer parts and anything else he could get his hands on .
The 50 life - size figures have traveled the world , from the Pyramids of Giza to the Great Wall of China as an art installation meant to provoke thought about the amount of garbage we humans create and how it affects the world .
Upcycled Dresses Made of Maps and Coffee Filters
They may not actually be wearable , but these diaphanous , delicate dresses made of recycled paper certainly are stunning .
London - based artist Susan Stockwell likes the original purpose of her materials to be obvious , thus the use of dirty coffee filters , used tea bags and worn maps .
The dresses boast details like rosettes , sashes and ruffled collars and call to mind the fashions of centuries past .
It ’s an interesting display of ‘ upcycling ’ , the practice of taking something disposable and transforming it into something of greater value .
Dr. Evermor ’s ‘ Forevertron ’ Scrap Metal Park
The world ’s largest scrap metal sculpture can be found at Dr. Evermor ’s “ park ” in Wisconsin .
It ’s 50 feet tall , 120 feet wide , 60 feet deep and weighs 320 tons and is made entirely of salvaged pieces of machinery between 50 and 100 years old .
Among its components are a decontamination chamber from the Apollo space mission and a pair of bipolar electric dynamos made by Thomas Edison .
The park also has many more recycled sculptures including a band of birds , some of which actually play music .
Dr. Evermor – real name Tom Every – has been collecting scrapped machines and other mechanical bits and pieces for decades .
Dirty Diapers Transformed into Diesel
Disposable diapers pile up in landfills fast , to the tune of 21 billion annually in the US alone .
While many more parents are beginning to choose cloth and other alternatives , a Quebec company called AMEC has come up with an innovative way to deal with a good chunk of the disposables that would otherwise end up in the trash : turning them into diesel fuel .
It can be done through a process called pyrolysis , which involves heating the diapers up in an enclosed , controlled environment .
AMEC expects to gain about 11,000 tons of diesel fuel from the first 30,000 diapers converted .
Due to the closed system , there are no emissions and experts say as the process improves , it could very well become an economically viable form of fuel .
Nek Chand ’s Industrial Waste Rock Garden
What began as a rock garden in Chandigarh , India quickly became a showcase of art made from recycled materials collected by artist Nek Chand from demolition sites around the city .
Chand ’s rock garden grew into a 12 - acre complex of courtyards filled with hundreds of his sculptures of dancers , animals and musicians .
The Rock Garden still collects recycled materials , especially rags and ceramics , from around the city .
Cheney 's dramatic language came while speaking in his office in a non-descript suburban office building in McLean .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Cheney warns of new attacks
Former Vice President Dick Cheney warned that there is a “ high probability ” that terrorists will attempt a catastrophic nuclear or biological attack in coming years , and said he fears the Obama administration ’s policies will make it more likely the attempt will succeed .
In an interview Tuesday with Politico , Cheney unyieldingly defended the Bush administration ’s support for the Guantanamo Bay prison and coercive interrogation of terrorism suspects .

And he asserted that President Obama will either backtrack on his stated intentions to end those policies or put the country at risk in ways more severe than most Americans — and , he charged , many members of Obama ’s own team — understand .
“ When we get people who are more concerned about reading the rights to an Al Qaeda terrorist than they are with protecting the United States against people who are absolutely committed to do anything they can to kill Americans , then I worry , ” Cheney said .
Protecting the country ’s security is “ a tough , mean , dirty , nasty business , ” he said .
“ These are evil people .
And we ’re not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek . ”
Citing intelligence reports , Cheney said at least 61 of the inmates who were released from Guantanamo during the Bush administration — “ that ’s about 11 or 12 percent ” — have “ gone back into the business of being terrorists . ”
The 200 or so inmates still there , he claimed , are “ the hard core ” whose “ recidivism rate would be much higher . ”
( Lawyers for Guantanamo detainees have strongly disputed the recidivism figures , asserting that the Pentagon data have inconsistencies and omissions . )
Cheney called Guantanamo a “ first - class program , ” and “ a necessary facility ” that is operated legally and with better food and treatment than the jails in inmates ' native countries .
But he said he worried that “ instead of sitting down and carefully evaluating the policies , ” Obama officials are unwisely following “ campaign rhetoric ” and preparing to release terrorism suspects or afford them legal protections granted to more conventional defendants in crime cases .
The choice , he alleged , reflects a naive mindset among the new team in Washington : “ The United States needs to be not so much loved as it needs to be respected .
Sometimes , that requires us to take actions that generate controversy .
I ’m not at all sure that that ’s what the Obama administration believes . ”
The dire portrait Cheney painted of the country ’s security situation was made even grimmer by his comments agreeing with analysts who believe this recession may be a once - in - a - century disaster .
“ It ’s unlike anything I ’ve ever seen , ” Cheney said .
“ The combination of the financial crisis that started last year , coupled now with , obviously , a major recession , I think we ’re a long way from having solved these problems . ”
The interview , less than two weeks after the Bush administration ceded power to Obama , found the man who is arguably the most controversial — and almost surely the most influential — vice president in U.S. history in a self - vindicating mood .
He expressed confidence that files will some day be publicly accessible offering specific evidence that waterboarding and other policies he promoted — over sharp internal dissent from colleagues and harsh public criticism — were directly responsible for averting new Sept. 11 - style attacks .
Not content to wait for a historical verdict , Cheney said he is set to plunge into his own memoirs , feeling liberated to describe behind - the - scenes roles over several decades in government now that the “ statute of limitations has expired ” on many of the most sensitive episodes .
His comments made unmistakable that Cheney — likely more than former President Bush , who has not yet given post - White House interviews — is willing and even eager to spar with the new administration and its supporters over the issues he cares most about .
His standing in this public debate is beset by contradictions .
Cheney for years has had intimate access to the sort of highly classified national security intelligence that Obama and his teams are only recently seeing .
But many of the top Democratic legal and national security players have long viewed Cheney as a man who became unhinged by his fears , responsible for major misjudgments in Iraq and Afghanistan , willing to bend or break legal precedents and constitutional principles to advance his aims .
Polls show he is one of the most unpopular people in national life .
In the interview , Cheney revealed no doubts about his own course — and many about the new administration’s .
“ If it had n’t been for what we did — with respect to the terrorist surveillance program , or enhanced interrogation techniques for high - value detainees , the Patriot Act , and so forth — then we would have been attacked again , ” he said .
“ Those policies we put in place , in my opinion , were absolutely crucial to getting us through the last seven - plus years without a major - casualty attack on the U.S. ”
Cheney said “ the ultimate threat to the country ” is “ a 9/11 - type event where the terrorists are armed with something much more dangerous than an airline ticket and a box cutter – a nuclear weapon or a biological agent of some kind ” that is deployed in the middle of an American city .
“ That ’s the one that would involve the deaths of perhaps hundreds of thousands of people , and the one you have to spend a hell of a lot of time guarding against , ” he said .
“ I think there ’s a high probability of such an attempt .
Whether or not they can pull it off depends whether or not we keep in place policies that have allowed us to defeat all further attempts , since 9/11 , to launch mass - casualty attacks against the United States . ”
If Cheney ’s language was dramatic , the setting for the comments was almost bizarrely pedestrian .
His office is in a non-descript suburban office building in McLean , Va. , in a suite that could just as easily house a dental clinic .
The office is across the hall from a quick - copy store .
The door is marked by nothing except a paper sign , held up by tape , saying the unit is occupied by the General Services Administration .
At several points , Cheney resisted singling out Obama personally for criticism , at one point saying he wants to give him a break after just two weeks in office .
He said he admires Obama ’s choice to keep Defense Secretary Robert Gates on the job .
But if he treated Obama gingerly , Cheney was eager to engage in the broader philosophical debate he was accustomed to with Democrats and even many in his own party about the right way to navigate a dangerous planet .
He said he fears the people populating Obama ’s ranks put too much faith in negotiation , persuasion , and good intentions .
“ I think there are some who probably actually believe that if we just go talk nice to these folks , everything ’s going to be okay , ” he said .
He said his own experience tempers his belief in diplomacy .
“ I think they ’re optimistic .
All new administrations are optimistic .
We were , ” he said .
“ They may be able , in some cases , to make progress diplomatically that we weren’t , ” Cheney said .
“ But , on the other hand , I think they ’re likely to find — just as we did — that lots of times the diplomacy does n’t work .
Or diplomacy does n’t work without there being an implied threat of something more serious if it fails . ”
As examples of the dangerous world he sees — and one he predicted Obama and aides would find “ sobering ” — were Russia ’s backsliding into authoritarianism and away from democracy , and the ongoing showdowns over the nuclear intentions of Iran and North Korea .
But it was the choice over Guantanamo that most dominated Cheney ’s comments .
“ If you release the hard - core Al Qaeda terrorists that are held at Guantanamo , I think they go back into the business of trying to kill more Americans and mount further mass - casualty attacks , ” he said .
“ If you turn ’em loose and they go kill more Americans , who ’s responsible for that ? ”
Of one alternative — moving prisoners to the U.S. prisons —
Cheney said he has heard from few members of Congress eager for Guantanamo transfers to their home - state prisons , and asked : “ Is that really a good idea to take hardened Al Qaeda terrorists who ’ve already killed thousands of Americans and put ’em in San Quentin or some other prison facility where they can spread their venom even more widely than it already is ? ”
While Cheney ’s words were dire , his own mood was relaxed , even loquacious .
He was not on crutches — much less the wheelchair he rode to Obama ’s Inauguration — from an injury while moving a box of books into his new home .
Suddenly a man of leisure , Cheney has a Kindle , Amazon ’s wireless reading device , and said he used it recently to read James M. McPherson ’s new “ Tried by War : Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief . ”
About a week ago , he had a phone conversation with former President George W. Bush , the first time the two had talked since they appeared together at a rally at Andrews Air Force Base just after Obama ’s swearing - in .
“ He ’s fine , ” Cheney said .
“ We had a pleasant chat on the phone .
It was a private , personal conversation – not about policy .
We ’re both citizens – civilians . ”
Other highlights of the 90 - minute interview :
* What Cheney called “ the trillion - dollar so - called stimulus bill ” : “ It looks to me like there ’s a lot of stuff in there that has nothing to do with stimulus – it ’s a sort of a wish list of a lot of my congressional Democratic friends , ” he said .
* The potential consequences of $ 1 trillion in deficit stimulus spending : “ It ’s huge , obviously – potentially huge .
You worry about what ultimately happens to inflation .
You worry about what ’s going to happen to the ability of the government to borrow money . … I ’m nervous . ”
* Whether the Bush administration should have done more about the economy : “ We did worry about it , to some extent . …
I do n’t think anybody actually foresaw something of this size and dimension occurring .
It ’s also global .
We only control part of the world economy – a very important part . ”
* On the chance of progress in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process in the foreseeable future : “ I think it ’s unlikely . ”
After leaving office , Cheney and his wife , Lynne , went first to his home in Wyoming , then returned to Washington to enjoy their grandchildren .
He ’s working on a book about his career , which has included stints as a House member , White House chief of staff and secretary of Defense .
His daughter , Liz Cheney , the former principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , supervised the interview and at one point was looking for a tape recorder .
“ I ’m not a very good press aide , ” she joshed .
Cheney found one on his own .
“ See , you do n’t need staff , ” she said .
I played Metal Gear Online for fifteen minutes .
In that timeframe I was killed ruthlessly and I struggled with the controls .
The sign up process for MGO took over five hours for me to complete .
I blame the popularity of Metal Gear Solid 4 and weak servers , unable to carry the load of thousands of drooling fans at once .
Things are probably different now .
When I played ( all fifteen minutes ) Konami did n’t have any downloadable content ready .
Soon , they will .
On January 27 , a new mission will be added to MGO .
It ’s called Bomb Mission .
If you ’re on the attack , the point is to find a bomb placed on the map and detonate it .
If you ’re on the defensive the goal is to find the bomb , sit on it , and hope that a chicken bursts out of it * .
The content is completely free and will update automatically when you sign into the game next week .
* Actually , you defuse the bomb with coolant .
KONAMI ANNOUNCES FREE BOMB MISSION FOR
METAL GEAR ™ ONLINE
Available on January 27th , All - New Mission Enhances MGO Experience By Requiring Players to Eliminate the Defending Team , Protect the Base , and Plant Bombs to Destroy the Defending Team Stronghold
Konami announced today that an all - new mission for the hit online tactical shooter , Metal Gear Online , the online multi-player player experience that is included free in the retail version of Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , will be available for download on January 27th .
Free to all registered Metal Gear Online users , the Bomb Mission provides players with an all - new combat experience that expands the playability and adds variety to the online phenomenon .
The new mission will automatically be implemented during the regular Metal Gear™ Online maintenance when players sign into their MGO accounts .
In the new mission , the offensive team 's objectives will be to detonate a bomb at a targeted location in the map and protect it until it explodes .
The defending team must protect its stronghold and prevent the planted bombs from detonating by using a special coolant to nullify an activated bomb and stop the attacking team from approaching the base .
To complete the mission and come out victorious the attacking team must detonate the bomb within the mission time limit if they fail the defending team wins .

The so - called ratchet effect , described most comprehensively by Robert Higgs , is the phenomenon of rapid government growth in the face of crises , followed by a lack of its proportional reduction in the post - crisis stage .
Hitherto investigated primarily through the lens of historical analysis , it also opens broad — and probably still largely unexplored — opportunities for praxeological research .
By reflecting on the past century and the beginnings of the present one , one immediately notices that creating occasions for " ratcheting up " the size of the government was a ( perhaps unintended ) gift bestowed by some political factions upon other political factions — the beginnings of wide - scale American twentieth - century statism , whose pinnacle was the introduction of income tax and the establishment of the FED , paved the way for the Great Depression and , consequently , for the New Deal ; economic downturns associated with the outbreaks of World Wars I and II provided public legitimacy for unprecedentedly deep and mostly irreversible regulations ; the bursting of the credit bubble inflated by the FED prompted the powers that be to make attempts at fighting the resultant chaos with an even more intensive use of the same statist means that had originally led to its emergence .
Thus , we can see that the ratchet effect is a historical fact , a fact that currently finds yet another corroboration right in front of our eyes .
Should it lead us to the depressing conclusion that we are helpless against the ever - growing Leviathan ?
Personally , I would recommend not losing hope , not only because hope dies last , but also because , at least in the case under consideration , it has knowledge on its side .
The ratchet effect is a historical observation , not an apodictic law of praxeology .
There have been times in the most recent history when statism actually shrunk and receded — a fine example would be the happenings in the countries of the former Soviet Bloc at the turn of the 80s and 90s .
And yet , a pessimist could claim that these happenings were perfectly consonant with what could be expected in the period following a protracted crisis spanning the entire era of real socialism — admittedly , it is true that statism receded , but not quite to the pre-war level .
So the " ratcheting - up " effect did take place after all .
The above remark should inspire an optimist to further the elaboration of the ratchet effect theory on the basis of a meticulous praxeological analysis : if one can classify as a crisis not only a relative and temporary downturn taking place within the framework of a given economic regime , but also the whole period of a regime based on economically misbegotten foundations , then a completely different periodization of history becomes possible ( and in the long run , perhaps even a complete reversal of its disturbing tendencies ) .
The point is to make the public regard any putative post - crisis stage as an extension of the crisis — which is possible at least insofar as the feeling of living through a crisis is subjective ( for example , a hermit would not regard shortages of electricity and gas as indications of a crisis , and , conversely , a citizen of Lichtenstein would presumably be disturbed by the emergence of welfare state mechanisms in his everyday environment ) .
For instance , if Poles in the early 90s had been generally aware that it is only the tip of the statist iceberg that had melted away , they could have pressed for further ( and quicker ) dismantling of the post - communist molochs , as well as for a much broader expansion of the area of free human action .
Consequently , the Polish privatization plan could have been done in a Rothbardian , rather than a Balcerowicz - esque fashion .
In other words , as long as the feeling of crisis , as well as the firm conviction that the cause of crisis is statism , are present in public opinion , it should be possible to implode every consecutive incarnation of a statist regime , each of which is more liberal than the previous one , but not yet liberal enough ( i.e. , still unacceptably repressive of human freedom , and hence " crisis - like " ) .
Given the possibility of the above scenario , there exists a viable way of shrinking the Leviathan to a minimum , or even eliminating it altogether ( depending on which of these options is acceptable for the general populace — that is , the implementation of which of them would be taken as an indication that the crisis of freedom is finally over ) .
Here we are dealing with the reverse ratchet effect , brought about by a change in the perception of politico - economic processes — instead of interpreting them as a series of alternating crises and periods of normalization , we see in them a cascade of accumulating and ever - growing slumps ( which admittedly shrink over certain narrow time intervals , but also consistently expand over the long run ) .
Again , a pessimist could say that at present nothing indicates that the second of the abovementioned conditions necessary for the reversal of statization — that is , the awareness that the cause of crisis is precisely statism , or , more specifically , monetary socialism — could be met by contemporary American society .
The inauguration of the President - elect , and hence the inauguration of the notorious " stimulus plan , " based on curing the disease by ingesting more of the poison responsible for its onset , was greeted with general applause and tears of joy .
They , in Central Europe — the pessimist might say — got their chance to trigger the reverse ratchet effect twenty years ago .
We , in America , will not get our chance even today .
And yet , I think that even faced with such gloomy observations , there is no reason to be defeatist .
Appearances notwithstanding , the moment of breaking the veil of economic delusions seems closer every day .
Firstly , today we have at our disposal a wonderful area of informational freedom , in which reliable , logical knowledge does not need accreditation and need not be afraid of censorship , while its scope , breadth and speed of dissemination know no limits .
This area is the Internet .
We should not downplay it too rashly as something that we have known for years and that ( allegedly ) has already become a commonplace medium .
Internet is still a less influential source of information than TV , radio or print .
Moreover , the consolidation of certain environments and the creation of certain repositories of knowledge ( including those associated with the Austrian school of economics ) is still a relatively new and rapidly expanding phenomenon , even on the short timescale of the World Wide Web 's existence .
Secondly , the persuasive power of the academic world , including its part that has long been in the service of statism , is on a continual decrease .
It is the result of the good old law of diminishing marginal utility — today , higher education is a mass phenomenon , rightly losing its aura of elitism and intellectual prestige .
The more we approach our own education from a healthy distance , the more distanced we can become from the influence of various television or press experts , pundits and talking heads — which is a most positive phenomenon , indicative of independent thinking .
Furthermore , as some suggest , we are soon to witness a revolutionary expansion of distance learning , followed by the ultimate breakdown of the academic cartel and the nationalized accreditation system , whose result will be a radical growth of respect for the kind of knowledge that is uncomfortable for the statists .
Thirdly and finally , the globally rising aversion to imperialistic and neocolonial actions , such as the American aggression in Iraq and the Russian interferences in Georgia and Chechnya , may eventually lead to the intensification of secessionist tendencies worldwide , including the regions whose inhabitants have hitherto expressed no such claims .
It should be a welcome phenomenon for all those who contend that political and administrative fragmentation is conducive to free economy , fair competition and monetary discipline .
To sum up , despite gloomy appearances , the future should be seen in bright colors .
Although the American crisis will deepen — and it is hard to forecast how long it will last — it should culminate with the correct identification of the causes of disease , and then , perhaps — if enthusiasm luckily meets knowledge — we shall witness the largest reverse ratchet effect ever recorded in the annals of history .

The Best of Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski
For security reasons , we must remain circumspect about exactly how this video got to Neatorama headquarters from outer - space .
It 's footage of an act almost as heinous and terrifying as cat juggling .
This time , it 's a cat in zero gravity Note that the audio has been removed to protect the innocent .
User Friendly , today Could the two be related somehow ?
Feb. 26 , 2009  --
Not long after he adopted a baby from Samoa , Michael Nyberg knew something was wrong .
The girl , whom he named Elleia , started saying the names of her parents and siblings , talking about how they all slept in a house together .
Nyberg said the adoption agency had told him that the 4 - year - old had been abandoned by her family , left in foster care for months .
" She starts talking about things that did n't add up , " he said .
" She cried herself to sleep every night for the first three weeks she lived with us , " he said .
" And I thought this does n't sound like a little girl that 's been in foster care . "
It was not until later , after he grew to love Elleia and think of her as his own daughter , that Nyberg learned the girl 's Samoan family never planned to give her up .
Her biological parents , federal prosecutors say , were duped by an adoption agency into releasing their rights as parents , always thinking that their daughter would return to them .
" She was supposed to be our daughter , " he said .
" I totally fell in love with her , just like my own flesh and blood . "
Elleia , who is called Sei in Samoa , is among dozens of Samoan children who prosecutors say were sent to the United States as part of an adoption scam that has left a string of broken - hearted families in both countries and dozens of children in limbo .
Probation Sentence in Samoan Adoption Scam Case
Four employees of a Wyoming - based adoption agency , Focus on Children , were sentenced on Wednesday in federal court in Utah to five years on probation for their role in the scam .
Scott and Karen Banks , Coleen Bartlett and Karalee Thornock have all pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of aiding and abetting the improper entry of an alien .
A fifth defendant , Dan Wakefield , who helped find the children to be adopted in Samoa , will be sentenced next month .
Prosecutors say the adoption workers and others tricked unwitting Samoan parents into giving up their children for adoption , telling them that the children were being sent on an educational program in the United States and that the children would return to Samoa .
The families did n't know they were giving up their rights to their children forever .
American families paid thousands of dollars for the adoptions .
U.S. District Judge David Sam ordered the four defendants never to work in the adoption business again and to contribute to a trust fund for the children .
Sam said the case " cries out for a sentence that 's restorative rather than punitive . "
" We do n't want to put these people in prison and have them kept from doing anything , " he said .
" They can address the interests of the children to restore the damage that has been done . "
But the sentence has left families in both countries with mixed feelings , some of them outraged at what they view as a light sentence for tearing apart families .
U.S. Mom : Defendants Deserved Jail
" People who steal children deserve to go to jail , " said Elizabeth , one adoptive parent who adopted who asked that only her first name be used .
" No child should be subjected to their entire world being turned upside down .
The pain we see on our child 's face will be the worst moment of our lives , " she said .
A 2007 federal indictment charged the defendants with 135 counts of conspiracy , fraud and immigration violations .
The indictment covered the adoption of 37 children between 2002 and 2005 .
Prosecutors characterized the plea agreement as a creative solution to an unusual crime , and some parents say prison time would not be appropriate , saying the defendants have their own children .
The government " believes that the best interests of the children [ and finding a way to achieve that interest ] trumps the concept of punishment alone , " prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum .
" We have victims on both sides of this adoption scheme , all of whom acted in good faith , " said U.S. Attorney Brett Tolson .
" Birth parents in Samoa believed they were sending their children to take advantage of opportunities in the United States .
… Samoan families did not view the placement as permanent .
They thought their kids would come home . "
But it 's difficult to say what is best for the children .
For now , most of the children remain with their American families , many of whom are terrified that the criminal case will allow the Samoan families to nullify the adoptions .
U.S. officials told ABC
News that they did not think the adoptions would be disrupted .
Patti Sawyer , a single mother from Wisconsin , said she had no idea that the little girl she fell in love with came from a loving family .
" When I was first introduced to my daughter I was told she was found in a public bathroom .
In reality , she was from a very happy family , eight brothers and sisters , who turned her over to give her an opportunity , " she said .
Sawyer said she is concerned that if she takes her daughter back to Samoa to visit her biological family , she may not be able to bring her back to the U.S.
She is hoping to convince the girl 's Samoan family to let her finish her education here , visit home , and share her life with two sets of parents .
" I 've told her she has a mom and dad in Samoa .
They love her .
She has two families , " said Sawyer .
" She says I want to see my family .
She says she does n't remember her brothers and sisters or the games they used to play . "
Of the families who were involved in the case , only Nyberg has sent his child back to her family in Samoa .
Nyberg said the decision to return Elleia to her family in Samoa was " excruciating , " yet he knew it was the right thing to do .
" To see the tears when they came around the corner and saw that little girl , and to know how much they missed her .
It was just a great experience to have that reunion , " he said .
But he now says he feels like the girl 's birth parents are members of his own family .
" The beautiful thing is I have developed a strong relationship with this family on the opposite side of the world , " he said .
" Her parents are my brother and sister .
We have a daughter we share ....
She is truly my little girl and to not have her with me is a really difficult thing , but I know that she is where she needs to be right now . "
­ For some of us , death is something we 've only seen on television or on the silver screen .
Our perceptions of dying have been shaped by actors gunning for awards in dramatic deathbed scenes or bad guys getting their just deserts as they go down in a blast of bullets .
We 've postponed turning pages of best - selling books to keep our heroes alive and listened to the heartbreak of loss on the radio .
Dying is on the news as well : celebrities dying of overdoses , princesses dying in car accidents and ordinary people dying in terrorist attacks .
Death is a concept even young students grapple with in history class , trying to understand the impact of millions dead because of war , disease , natural disasters or concentration camps .
Others of us have witnessed dying in an up close and personal way .
We 've lost grandparents and parents to degenerative diseases , we 've lost siblings and friends to car accidents or we 've known someone who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
When death happens , it often seems unfair .
It may also seem unnatural because from the time of our births , we spend a good deal of effort trying to prevent death .
We receive childhood vaccines so we do n't get sick ; we hear strict admonitions to look both ways before crossing the street ; we swallow broccoli grudgingly knowing that it 's good for us .
As we become teenagers , we learn about risk factors that could shorten our lives , from tobacco and alcohol use to unsafe sex and reckless driving .
And when we round the bend to adulthood , we start swallowing vitamins and prescription drugs and subscribing to bizarre exercise and beauty regimes in an effort to trick death .

­ But death is n't an adversary we can conquer or a battle that is to be won .
Rather , it 's a natural part of life that occurs sooner or later because our bodies were n't made to last forever .
Also , it 's the event that gives life meaning .
Without the timeline of death , it could be argued , we 'd never get around to doing very much at all .
In that way , death puts a lot of pressure on us , and we may never feel we 're actually ready for it .
Additionally , death is a mysterious business ; after all , the only ones who know anything about it are n't around to share their knowledge .
In this article , we 'll take a look at what we know about the scientific process of dying so far .
Death may not always be pretty , but it 's a fate that awaits us all .
So what exactly is death ?
Gary McGraw explains why there ’s more to software security than watching the bug parade march by .

The 2009 Software Security Bug Parade
The 2009 CWE / SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors was recently released with much fanfare .
Lists of " the most significant " software security bugs are certainly not a new phenomenon , with the OWASP top ten ( first published in 2004 ) garnering a lion 's share of the attention .
Certainly the idea of knowing your enemy ( in this case , software vulnerabilities ) is important in software security .
However , as I have pointed out in previous iterations of this column , there 's more to software security than watching the bug parade march by .
Today , I present the top eleven reasons why generic top N bug parade lists may be less helpful than you think .
But first , a history lesson …
Bug Parades of Christmas Past1
The idea of collecting and organizing information about computer security vulnerabilities has a long history .
One of the first ( unclassified ) studies of computer security and privacy was the RISOS ( Research into Secure Operating Systems ) project from 19762 .
The problem of creating lists and taxonomies has been of great interest since then .
Well - known research projects include the " Protection Analysis " work of Bisbey and Hollingworth ( 1978 ) and Carl Landwehr 's Naval Research Lab taxonomy from 1993 .
Plenty of taxonomy work has been done on the attack side of the equation too , including Cheswick and Bellovin 's attack classes ( 2003 ) and my work with Hoglund on attack patterns ( 2004 ) .
More recent strain of work on vulnerabilities includes Aslam 's classification scheme ( 1995 ) , PLOVER ( Preliminary List of Vulnerability Examples for Researchers ) from 2005 , and the Common Weakness Enumeration ( CWE ) project ( ongoing ) .
A number of practitioners have developed top ten lists and other related collections based on experience in the field .
Two of the most popular and useful lists are the 19 Sins3 and the OWASP top ten .
To this assembly of lists , piles , and collections we can add the list of the day — the CWE / SANS top 25 .
Top Eleven Reasons Why Top Ten Lists Don't Work
Before I start , there are some important good things about top ten lists that are worthy of mention .
The notion of knowing your enemy is essential in security ( as it is in warfare ) , and top ten lists can help get software people started thinking about attacks , attackers , and the vulnerabilities they go after .
These days almost any attention paid to the problem is good attention , and the fact that the technical media is paying attention to software security at all is a good thing .
Top ten lists help in that respect .
Without further ado , however , here are eleven reasons why top ten lists do n't work :
Executives do n't care about technical bugs .
Security is about risk management .
Risk management involves getting your head out of the technical weeds and understanding which applications really matter to your organization from a business perspective .
Geeky pontification about top ten lists does very little ( if anything ) to manage business risk .
Putting " controls " around " top generic technical problems " may not be the best course of action .
Too much focus on bugs .
Software security practitioners have known for years that software defects lead to serious security problems .
What we all seem to forget sometimes is that defects come in two basic flavors ( divided roughly 50/50 in terms of prevalence ) : bugs in the code and flaws in the design .
Top ten lists tend to focus on bugs , to the detriment of any attention for design - level problems .
Vulnerability lists help auditors more than developers .
Teaching someone how to do the right thing is much more cost effective and efficient than attempting to teach someone how not to do an infinite set of wrong things .
Software people react more positively to being shown how to do things right than they do to a bug parade .
On the other hand , big lists of bugs certainly make auditing code easier .
But how efficient is that ?
One person 's top bug is another person 's yawner .
( This point is closely related to number 1 . )
Software defects do have serious and important business impact , but impact is not an objective variable that carries across all organizations .
In my experience , a list of " top N defects " is very powerful in any given organization , but actual lists differ according to the dev group , coding habits , tech stacks , standards , and a host of other variables .
You 'll be very lucky if your real list of top bugs aligns with any generic list .
Using bug parade lists for training leads to awareness but does not educate .
( This point is closely related to number 3 . )
Developers and architects are much better off understanding and learning how to do things right ( defensive programming ) than they are when presented with a laundry list of defects , even when those defects are shown in living color .
In the early days , Biology was about taxonomies and zoos .
In modern times , Biology is about cell mechanisms , DNA , and evolution .
Likewise , modern software security needs to be more about the mechanics of building systems that work than it is about collections of no -nos .
Bug lists change with the prevailing technology winds .
Though top ten lists can certainly be updated ( witness the OWASP top ten ) , rapid changes in technology make lists of particular problems obsolete very quickly .
In this sense , education about building things properly ( and about how things like stacks really work ) again trumps lists of specifics .
Top ten lists mix levels .
Taxonomies are always superior to lists , especially when they are simple .
Thinking about seven top level concerns ( as presented in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms ) is much less confusing from an intellectual perspective than equating " Buffer Overflows " and " Failing to Protect Network Traffic " as the 19 Sins work does .
Lists of bugs have lower fidelity when it comes to activities required to build secure software .
Automated tools can find bugs — let them .
Teaching all developers the 700 + bad things in the Common Weakness Enumeration ( or the even larger set of permutations allowed by languages like C++ ) is a futile exercise .
We can start by using static analysis tools to remember all of the potential bugs and alert us to their presence .
Better even than that would be adopting programming languages that do n't suck .
( For a real world story about language issues , see Microsoft 's Missed Opportunity . )
Metrics built on top ten lists are misleading .
The notion of coming up with metrics for software security is of critical importance .
But as all business school graduates know ( and not enough geeks , sadly ) , bad metrics can do more harm than no metrics .
Using the OWASP top 10 or the CWE / SANS top 25 to drive your software security initiative will be a major mistake .
See points 1 and 4 for more .
When it comes to testing , security requirements are more important than vulnerability lists .
Security testing should be driven from requirements and abuse cases rather than from hoping to discover particular technical bugs in code .
Proper use of threat modeling and architectural risk analysis drives effective traceable tests .
Ten is not enough .
A myopic focus on ten bugs makes little sense .
Adding 15 more to the pile may not do much to help .
As the CWE / SANS top 25 website says , " The CWE site also contains data on more than 700 additional programming errors , design errors , and architecture errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities . "
Enough said .
