I am a climate scientist who worked in the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia in the 1990s .
I have been reflecting on the bigger lessons to be learned from the stolen emails , some of which were mine .
One thing the episode has made clear is that it has become difficult to disentangle political arguments about climate policies from scientific arguments about the evidence for man-made climate change and the confidence placed in predictions of future change .
The quality of both political debate and scientific practice suffers as a consequence .
Surveys of public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic about man-made climate change continue to tell us something politicians know only too well :
The citizens they rule over have minds of their own .
In the U.K. , a recent survey suggested that only 41 % believed humans are causing climate change , 32 % remained unsure and 15 % were convinced we are n't .
Similar surveys in the U.S. have shown a recent reduction in the number of people believing in man-made climate change .
One reaction to this " unreasonableness " is to get scientists to speak louder , more often , or more dramatically about climate change .
Another reaction from government bodies and interest groups is to use ever - more - emotional campaigning .
Thus both the U.K. government 's recent " bedtime stories " adverts , and Plane Stupid 's Internet campaign showing polar bears falling past twin towers , have attracted widespread criticism for being too provocative and scary .
These instinctive reactions fail to place the various aspects of our knowledge about climate change — scientific insights , political values , cultural moods , personal beliefs — in right relationship with each other .
Too often , when we think we are arguing over scientific evidence for climate change , we are in fact disagreeing about our different political preferences , ethical principles and value systems .
If we build the foundations of our climate - change policies so confidently and so single - mindedly on scientific claims about what the future holds and what therefore " has to be done , " then science will inevitably become the field on which political battles are waged .
The mantra becomes :
Get the science right , reduce the scientific uncertainties , compel everyone to believe it .
. . and we will have won .
Not only is this an unrealistic view about how policy gets made , it also places much too great a burden on science , certainly on climate science with all of its struggles with complexity , contingency and uncertainty .
The Associated Press , a organization with so little respect for fair use that they expect you to pay for a license to quote as little as five words from its articles , describes how it relied on fair use to do reporting on Sarah Palin 's memoir Glowing Rouge :
" The AP was determined to get the first copy , " Oreskes [ a senior managing editor ] wrote , detailing how the writers learned a store had " inadvertently placed the book on sale five days before its official Nov. 17 release date . "
" They bought a copy , ripped it from its spine and scanned it into the system so it could be read and electronically searched , " he wrote .
As Rebecca Tushnet notes , this is fair use .
And so is quoting the AP .
Actually , the AP likes fair use after all

But with uranium at $ 46 / pound , it is n't economically feasible . "

Shootaring Canyon Mill , in Utah , is in the process of changing its license to operational .
Uranium One Utah , Inc. , owns Shootaring , also closed since the early 1980s , and the company vice president , Chris Sattler , says the company presently does n't have enough resources in the region to keep its mill running profitably .
Uranium
One is instead concentrating on projects in Wyoming and Kazakhstan , which -- along with Russia , Australia , and Canada -- provide most of the world 's uranium .
Denison Mines ' White Mesa Mill in Utah , 80 miles west of Piñon Ridge , has a monopoly but is not operating at full capacity , says CEO Ron Hochstein .
Transportation costs from outlying mines are prohibitive , and uranium prices are too low , so processing uranium waste products from Canada and the U.S. -- also known as " alternate feed " -- helps keep the mill alive .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
With just one more permit from the State of Colorado , Energy Fuels Resources Corporation founder and CEO George Glasier can break ground for the first new U.S. uranium mill since the Cold War .
Glasier 's Piñon Ridge Mill , in Colorado's Paradox Valley , has been long in the making .
EFR has spent nearly $ 9 million on development of the mill , with construction expected to cost another $ 130 million , possibly beginning in 2011 .
CH2M
Hill has designed the computerized mill to process up to 1,000 tons of uranium daily , five pounds of uranium to the ton .
The mill 's design is so environmentally friendly and technologically advanced , there 's nothing like it in the world , Glasier says .
He 's already talking to overseas customers : " The Chinese are acquiring uranium assets everywhere they can , " he says .
And here at home , he estimates that , in the country 's clean energy future , electric utilities will generate enough need to boost uranium from its present $ 46 to a more robust $ 70 per pound .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission already has 22 applications for new nuclear plants nationwide ; globally there are 53 new plants under construction and 436 operational .
Though this is exactly the kind of project that might normally lead neighbors to say , " Not in my back yard , " there 's local precedent in Paradox Valley and throughout Montrose County .
Union Carbide once ran a uranium mill nearby , which the Environmental Protection Agency later made one of its Superfund sites , spending $ 120 million to clean up hazardous materials there .
Montrose County also supplied uranium for Madame Curie , the Manhattan Project , and Little Boy and Fat Man , the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , says local geologist Mike Thompson .
It 's definitely an area with a past .
What 's more , though Glasier is now a gentleman rancher , in his former life -- which included a series of uranium industry corporate counsel gigs in Denver -- he helped acquire properties for the White Mesa Mill in Utah , the last U.S. uranium mill constructed and the only mill currently operating .
Then , 17 years ago , he left it all to build a herd of 1,000 Black Angus alongside western Colorado 's San Miguel River , an area of flat valleys and red sandstone cliffs 60 miles northwest of Telluride and two hours from the nearest Wal - Mart .
Which means , today , he 's actually building this mill in his own community .
With the door already open , Glasier has courted his community by speaking to business groups , holding a barbecue with live music in a local park , and giving tours of the blank building site .
When the county awarded Glasier a land use permit in September , it was viewed as a vote of local confidence .
" I 'm considered a local , " he says .
He has served on the irrigation ditch company board , as town attorney ( pro bono ) for the 1,400 - population Naturita ( which has returned the favor by granting him back - up water rights for the proposed mill ) , and " helped put together a pretty good application for a job corps center . "
But jobs are elusive .
With a 7.3 % unemployment rate , nearly 1,000 county residents are out of work .
" In a small town , you know them all , " says Terri Tooker , Naturita Chamber of Commerce president .
" The area certainly needs an economic boost . "
State economist Alexandra Hall agrees .
But she also marvels at recent developments : " Our country has been through periods when it 's been completely taboo to talk about adding nuclear power plants . "
The mill is expected to provide 85 jobs , and 200 more are likely to come from its mines .
Calculating ripple effect , the Western Small Miners Association hopes for 1,392 new jobs total , from housing construction to schools .
Many of Glasier 's neighbors will likely be his employees , and nearly everyone has past ties to uranium .
In 2008 , Montrose County mineworkers averaged $ 55,927 annual pay , but local bloggers -- some the children of deceased uranium miners -- have alluded to the tradeoff of adequate income versus shortened lives .
( Uranium workers here have had a cancer rate that 's estimated to be five times higher than average . )
There have been high - profile opposition efforts : Actress Daryl Hannah showed up at a hearing to denounce the proposed mill .
And one anti-mill website lists 21 opposed organizations , including Sierra Club , Earth Justice , and Uranium Watch .
But Colorado Governor Bill Ritter ( D ) says he believes a new mill can be safe , U.S. Senator Mark Udall ( D - Co. ) promises hawk - like vigilance , and Colorado 's Department of Public Health and Environment anticipates taking 14 careful months to review EFR 's mill application .
The White House defers comment to the Department of Energy , which says , through spokesperson Jennifer Lee , " Unlike the first half of the 20th century , several federal and state agencies are actively involved in protecting uranium mill and mine workers and the public from potential harm : the EPA , NRC , NRC Agreement States , the Department of Labor Mines Safety and Health Administration , and the DOE . "
Many local residents , like Tomcat Mine owner John Reams , hope the permitting process moves quickly .
Reams laid off 20 uranium miners from his Montrose County mine last month because Utah's White Mesa Mill stopped buying ore .
So he welcomes the new mill .
But he initially questioned if others would : " At first , we were wondering .
We know the people doing it , but it was quite an obstacle to mount , to get the local people and get through the county . "
Glasier acknowledges a debt to his neighbors for trusting him this far , and he says they wo n't be sorry .
" There 's a 95 % chance we 'll get the license and build the mill , " he says .
" Credit 's available ; we have mines ready to go into production . "
Noting that the U.S. is the world 's largest uranium consumer , while Russia is the main supplier , Glasier adds , " We 've got to start producing uranium again . "
Hunched over a sewing machine , Jennipher Alupot is an unlikely poster girl for the women 's rights movement .
In fact , the young Ugandan mother is totally unaware of how her story – almost too horrific to be believed – has caused waves across the country and down the corridors of power , ultimately giving thousands of abused women the chance of justice .
For seven years , Jennipher was forced to breastfeed the puppies of her husband 's hunting dogs .
After drinking and smoking heavily , Nathan Alowoi would appear at the marital bed , bind his young wife 's legs and hands together and force the mewling animals to her nipple .
He had handed over two cows to his father - in - law as part of the " bride price " for his new wife .
So , he reasoned , if the cows were no longer around to provide milk then his new purchase would have to provide for the pups .
" I had to feed them all through the night ; then in the morning he would untie me , " his wife , now 26 , explains matter - of - factly .

Her ordeal began out in the rural east in 2002 with the arrival of her first - born , a daughter called Achom .
There was a reprieve with the second child , a boy named after his father as tradition dictates and thus protected from the indignity of having to share his mother 's breast with the puppies .
But when the third child , another son , Olinga , was born , a new litter was brought to suckle .
That baby , she recalls , started having fits and foaming at the mouth .
Olinga died just before his second birthday .
" I think it could have been something to do with the dogs , " his mother says .
Jennipher had tried to resist her husband before and had alerted her own family , her in - laws and tribal elders to her suffering .
She had even dared to go to the police in the nearest town , Pallisa .
All in vain .
After her baby son's death , she hoped her husband 's perversion might at least end .
Then this March , she gave birth to another daughter , Apunyo , and the abuse started up once more , only more violently .
One night when she protested , her husband pierced her with a spear under the chin .
This time she snapped .
She fled to the women 's refuge in Pallisa .
Not only did the centre – supported by ActionAid , one of the charities in this year 's Independent Christmas Appeal – give Jennipher and her baby daughter a roof over their heads , but they are also helping her bring legal action against her husband .
The case made front - page headlines around the East African nation , with commentators lining up to denounce the shocking abuse .
A bill to tighten up domestic violence laws that had been languishing in the Ugandan parliament for more years , was rushed through last month .
" That bill was passed because of Jennipher , " said Caroline Odoi , ActionAid 's coordinator in Pallisa .
" Her case opened so many people 's eyes ; it unblocked everything . "
" The women 's movement built up the pressure very effectively , " agreed Sylvia Tamale , the dean of law at Makerere University in the capital , Kampala .
" Our government generally just pays lip service to women 's rights ; they only take action when it becomes politically expedient . "

Although the particularly grim abuse that Jennipher suffered appears to be a one - off , domestic violence against women is widespread in Uganda .
According to a 2006 government survey , more than two in three women have suffered some form of abuse at the hands of a spouse .
Mifumi , a group campaigning for women 's rights in the country , believes the " bride price " practice is a leading contributor to the spiralling levels of domestic violence in Uganda .
Tribal custom dictates that a prospective husband sends a delegation to his chosen bride 's home .
Her family then set a value on their daughter 's worth , usually expressed in a mixture of livestock and shillings .
The haggling begins , and continues until a deal is struck .
" Bride price renders the notion that a man has purchased a wife , including her sexual consent , labour and obedience , " says Atuki Turner , Mifumi 's director .
At the women 's refuge in Pallisa , legal officer Hope Iceduna , sees first - hand the legacy of this custom : a steady stream of women arriving at her office .
There was Florence , thrown out of her home after telling her husband of many years she was HIV - positive .
He then demanded a refund of the bride price , but the cattle had long since died , the money long since spent ; so instead he tried to appropriate some of her father 's land .
There was Annette , " inherited " by the brother of her deceased husband , because the family still considered her their property ; and Grace , whose in - laws tried to seize her marital home once her husband died .
The bride price can often complicate efforts to get justice for these mistreated and dispossessed women .
Sometimes a magistrate can rule that a bride price must be refunded , before the case will even be heard .
The women 's centre in Pallisa was established in June 2008 .
From then until the beginning of 2009 , it dealt with 79 complaints – an average of 13 a month .
In the first 11 months of this year , it has handled 310 – an average of 28 .
Most of the complaints are resolved through mediation in Ms Iceduna 's office , where the parties in dispute perch on plastic chairs and set out their case .
A dozen or so have made it to court .
ActionAid has been campaigning at the regional level , working with the district 's tribal leaders to draw up a revised charter of traditional customs .
One of the key goals is to transform the " bride price " into a " bride prize " .
" If it 's a gift there are no strings attached and it is not refundable , " Ms Odoi , the charity 's point person in Pallisa , explains .
At one recent meeting around 40 clan heads – some in military fatigues , others in traditional caps – gathered in a church strung with festive bunting , to discuss the new best practices .
The chair wrote up the proposals on a flipchart in red marker pen , and with schoolboy diligence the clan heads copied it down .
Item number one on the agenda was the age girls should marry and the minimum age for losing their virginity .
Next came the issue of female inheritance and the traditional tasks around the home that should be passed on from mother to daughter alongside formal schooling .
The eighth point for discussion read : " There should be NO bride price but a non-refundable bride prize or kichaitma , hence the dowry should be abolished . "
The ensuing floor debate threw up some interesting queries .
" What if our clan agrees to this but our daughter marries someone from a different tribe ? " said one .
" Does this mean my daughter is worth nothing ? " said another .
And " What happens if the day after I pay kichaitma , my bride runs off ? "
The chair 's response to the last concern was blunt .
" Well , it 's up to you to make sure she 's satisfied and has no reason to leave you , " he says to laughs from the audience .
There was a show of hands .
All were in favour of abolishing the bride price .
So did this mean the practice is no more – at least in the area around Pallisa ?
" We represent our communities , " one clan leader said firmly .
" And whatever we agree here , we will take back and they will accept . "
The reality of weeding out such a deep - rooted tradtion might be slightly more complicated , but Ms Odoi is confident change is coming .
Alongside the negotiations with the male chieftains , ActionAid is also working to empower women , from running adult literacy lessons to forming community circles where women can air their concerns .
Back at the women 's refuge , Jennipher is coming to the end of her seventh month there .
Her case is currently before the Human Rights Commission , but if it fails there , she can seek justice within the framework of the newly passed Domestic Violence Act – which is simply awaiting the signature of President Yoweri Museveni to become law .
ActionAid are helping to build Jennipher a two - bedroom house , to which she hopes to move in the new year , and she is being taught to be a seamstress so she can support herself .
As she cuddles baby Apunyo , she talks of her hopes for 2010 .
" My two eldest children are still with their father .
I miss them a lot .
I want just to be together with all my children again . "

Microsoft cuts off thousands of Xbox players caught downloading pirated games
Microsoft is clamping down on piracy by banning up to one million customers from using its services if they are caught playing illegal games .
The technology giant said gamers who install hardware to play pirated games on the Xbox 360 console would be barred from using its Live service .
The online service allows multiple players to compete against each other over the internet and is central to the Xbox 360's popularity .
Popular : More than 34 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide .
Microsoft is now clamping down on piracy
However , any banned users would still be able to use their consoles to play games without connecting to the internet .
There are more than 20 million Xbox Live customers worldwide and video game websites have suggested that up to a million people would be affected .
The Xbox 360 has Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technology that can detect pirated software .
Modifying Xbox 360 consoles by physically attaching extra chips or other hardware to play pirated games is a booming industry .
Although Microsoft can do little to prevent users modifying their machines , it hopes to discourage the practice by blocking those who ' violate terms of use ' from accessing its online services .
Microsoft said in a statement that only a ' small percentage ' of its customers would be affected .
' All consumers should know that piracy is illegal and that modifying their Xbox 360 console to play pirated discs violates the Xbox Live terms of use , will void their warranty and result in a ban from Xbox Live , ' the company said .
' The health of the video game business depends on customers paying for the genuine products and services they receive from manufacturers , retailers , and the third parties that support them . '
The Xbox was launched in 2002 as Microsoft 's rival to the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo's GameCube , with the more powerful Xbox 360 going on sale three years later .
More than 34 million have been sold around the world .

Decoding json on Silverlight with System .
Json ( plus implicit conversion operators in IronPython )
As I explained we 're writing a Silverlight application that communicates with our Django server and exchanges a lot of json with it .
Unfortunately , due to what is apparently just an oversight , the codecs module is incomplete for IronPython on Silverlight .
This means that recent versions of simplejson do n't work .
What we 've been using is an older version of simplejson , that pulls in the obsolete and huge sre module in as one of its dependencies .
On top of bloating up our application and adding several seconds to the startup importing it all the performance is not exactly blazing .
Fortunately part of the Silverlight SDK is System .
Json.dll .
Using this API from IronPython is pretty simple .
The following code defines a loads function ( load string - the same API as simplejson ) that takes a string and parses it .
import clr clr .
AddReference ( ' System.Json ' ) from System import Boolean from System .
Json import JsonValue , JsonType String = clr .
GetClrType ( str ) def loads ( inString ) : thing = JsonValue .
Parse ( inString ) return handle_value ( thing ) def handle_value ( inValue ) : if inValue is None : return None elif inValue .
JsonType == JsonType .
String : return clr .
Convert ( inValue , String ) elif inValue .
JsonType == JsonType .
Boolean : return Boolean .
Parse ( str ( inValue ) ) elif inValue .
JsonType == JsonType .
Number : return get_number ( inValue .
ToString ( ) ) elif inValue .
JsonType == JsonType .
Object : return dict ( ( pair .
Key , handle_value ( pair .
Value ) ) for pair in inValue ) elif inValue .
JsonType == JsonType .
Array : return [ handle_value ( value ) for value in inValue ] #
Should be unreachable - but if it happens I want to know about it !
raise TypeError ( inValue ) def get_number ( inString ) : try : return int ( inString ) except ValueError : return float ( inString )
As with my custom json emitter there is a lot it does n't do .
It handles the following types :
None
lists
dictionaries
strings
floats and integers
booleans
If you want it to handle decmials or dates you 'll have to add that yourself .
How it works is mostly straightforward , but there is one little piece of ' magic ' in there .
When you call ToString ( ) ( or str ( ) they do the same thing ) you get the original json back .
For numbers and booleans this is fine as we can easily turn them into the objects they represent .
For strings this is a nuisance as we get double quoted , escaped strings .
The correct way to get the value we want is to use implicit conversion .
In C# this looks something like :
string value = jsonArray [ " key " ] ;
Declaring the result as a string calls the appropriate JsonValue implicit conversion operator for us .
IronPython does n't have implicit conversion operators as we do n't declare types and with a dynamic type system you rarely need to cast .
Up until version 2.6 it was n't possible to call implicit operators , but in IronPython 2.6 we gained a new function in the clr module ; clr .
Convert :
>>> print clr.Convert.__doc__ object Convert ( object o , Type toType )
Attempts to convert the provided object to the specified type .
Conversions that will be attempted include standard Python conversions as well as .NET implicit and explicit conversions .
If the conversion cannot be performed a TypeError will be raised .
The implicit conversion to string is done with the code :
clr .
Convert ( jsonValue , clr .
GetClrType ( str ) )
I cover some of the other goodies new in IronPython 2.6 ( like CompileSubclassTypes ) in Dark Corners of IronPython .
I have n't yet written the code to do json encoding , but the JsonValue class ( and friends ) can be used for encoding as well as decoding , so I expect the code will pretty much be the opposite of the snippet shown above ...
Django :
Tear down and re-sync the database
Django includes the useful management command syncdb for creating the database tables and columns used by your application .
If you add new tables ( model classes ) then re-running syncdb will add them for you .
Unfortunately if you modify columns of existing tables , or add new columns , then syncdb is n't man enough for the job .
For modifying the schema of production systems migrations are the way to go .
I played a bit with South for Django , which is pretty straightforward .
For a system still in development , and changing rapidly , migrations are overkill .
We have a script for populating the database with test data , which we update as the schema evolves .
( In parallel with this we have a script that imports the original data from the legacy application we are replacing - again updating the script as our app is capable of handling more of the original schema . )
For development what we really want to do is to tear down our development database and re-run syncdb .
Running syncdb requires manual input , to create a superuser , so preferably we want to disable this so that the whole process can be automated .
I found various recipes online to do this , but mostly using an obsolete technique to disable superuser creation .
In the end I used a combination of this recipe to programatically clear the databases ( using the sql generated by sqlclear ) and this recipe to disable super user creation .
Note
The code also skips clearing the authentication table as we are using Django authentication unmodified .
Comment out the line that does this if you are n't using Django authentication or want to clear it anyway .
#!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys import StringIO import settings from django.core .
management import setup_environ , call_command setup_environ ( settings ) from django.db import connection from django.db.models import get_apps , signals app_labels = [ app .
__name__ . split ( '.' ) [ - 2 ] for app in get_apps ( ) ]
#
Skip clearing the users table app_labels .
remove ( ' auth ' ) sys .
stdout = buffer = StringIO . StringIO ( ) call_command ( ' sqlclear ' , * app_labels ) sys .
stdout = sys .
__stdout__ queries = buffer .
getvalue ( ) . split ( ' ; ' ) [ 1 : - 2 ] cursor = connection . cursor ( ) for query in queries : cursor .
execute ( query . strip ( ) ) from django.db.models import signals from django.contrib.auth.management import create_superuser from django.contrib.auth import models as auth_app # Prevent interactive question about wanting a superuser created .
signals .
post_syncdb .
disconnect ( create_superuser , sender = auth_app , dispatch_uid = " django.contrib.auth.management.create_superuser " ) call_command ( ' syncdb ' )
It was n't all plain sailing .
We 're using MySQL ( God help us ) and our development machines are all running Mac OS X .
On Mac OS X MySQL identifiers , including table names , are case insensitive .
Whilst I would object strongly to a case sensitive programming language this actually makes working at the sql console slightly less annoying so it is n't a problem in itself .
We define our data model using standard Django model classes :
from django.db import models class NewTableName ( models .
Model ) : NewColumnName = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 , db_column = " OriginalSpaltennamen " ) class Meta : db_table = ' UrsprunglichenTabellennamen '
The Meta.db_table specifies the table name that will actually be used in the database .
We use the original table and column names where possible as the end users will have to modify some existing tools to work with the new system and this minimizes the changes .
As you can see both the original table and new table names are mixed case .
For some reason , which I never got to the bottom of , where the model classes have foreign key relationships syncdb will create these tables with all lowercase names .
This could be Django , MySQL or the Python connector to MySQL ( or any combination of these ) and I never worked out why .
Unfortunately sqlclear will only generate sql to drop tables where the casing specified in the model exactly matches the casing in the database .
I worked round it by changing all our Meta.db_table entries to be all lowercase .
Not what you would call ideal but acceptable .
Now everytime we update our database schema we can simply run this script .
It drops all existing tables and then re-creates them with all the changes .
Note Carl Meyer suggests using call_command ( ' syncdb ' , interactive = False ) instead of the signals.post_syncdb.disconnect code .
It 's certainly shorter but I have n't tried it yet .
In the comments Stavros Korokithakis points out that the reset admin command will reset individual apps and regenerate them .
If you have several apps in a project this script is still simpler , but if you only need to reset one then you might as well just use ./ manage .py reset < appname > .
It takes the - - no - input switch if you want to supress the user prompts .

After several days of intriguing developments in the civil suit against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger , lawyer David Cornwell has issued a statement in response to recent court filings made by his accuser .
The full text of the statement is right here .
Cornwell deals with the recent news of a hollow settlement offer to drop the case in exchange for a settlement offer by disclosing that a very different offer had been made in July — a demand for payment in the amount of $ 2.8 million .
And it ’s now abundantly clear that Roethlisberger ’s lawyers plan to go after the accuser ’s attorney , Calvin Dunlap .
“ Given her admitted and obviously unstable mental state and the possibility that she is being manipulated by an unscrupulous lawyer , ” Cornwell says , “ we remain willing to give [ the accuser ] a limited benefit of the doubt ( relating to her motivations only because her allegations are demonstrably false ) .
Her lawyer , however , does not deserve and will not receive similar consideration . ”
Bottom line ?
Even if the case is dropped today , it looks like Roethlisberger ’s lawyers plan to pursue Dunlap through all means available .
This means that , as a practical matter , the accuser and her lawyer will be digging in their heels and fighting , until the bitter end .
14 - jähriger Demonstrant leidet unter Amnesie : Erinnerung ausgelöscht
Ein 14 - Jähriger geht auf eine Demo , sieben Stunden später liegt er mit Gehirnerschütterung im Krankenhaus .
Was passierte , weiß er nicht .
Zur fraglichen Zeit war er in Polizeigewahrsam .
Sieben Stunden im Leben von Noel sind weg .
Einfach gestrichen .
Stattdessen - ein schwarzes Loch .
Das Letzte , an das sich der 14 - jährige Schüler erinnern kann :
Er sitzt mit seinem Freund Tobias in der U - Bahn und isst Popcorn .
Es ist Freitagnachmittag , der 20 .
November .
Die Jungs sind auf dem Weg zum Hotel Adlon am Brandenburger Tor , wo Studierende im Rahmen des Bildungsstreiks ein Managertreffen stören wollen .
Sie sind dort mit vier Freunden verabredet .
Ob er am Adlon angekommen ist , daran erinnert sich Noel nicht .
Und auch der Rest des Tages ist in seinem Kopf wie ausradiert .
Erst um Mitternacht setzt das Erinnerungsvermögen des Schülers wieder ein .
Er liegt im Westend - Krankenhaus , seine linke Schläfe ist geschwollen .
Die Ärzte diagnostizieren eine Gehirnerschütterung .
Was die Amnesie ausgelöst hat , ist unklar .
Noel ist vollkommen durcheinander .
" Was mach ich hier ?
Was ist passiert ?
War was mit der Polizei ? " , fragt er seine Eltern noch in der Klinik .
Marco und Anna B. wissen keine Antwort - bis heute nicht .
Zumindest müsste die Polizei etwas darüber wissen , wie es zu der Kopfverletzung und dem wohl darauf zurückzuführenden Gedächtnisverlust kam .
Denn die Zeit , in der der Vorfall geschehen sein muss , lässt sich ziemlich genau eingrenzen : zwischen 18 und 19.45 Uhr .
Und während dieser knapp zwei Stunden war der Junge in Polizeigewahrsam .
Noels Freunde sagen , sie hätten ihn um kurz nach 18 Uhr auf der Straße Unter den Linden aus den Augen verloren .
Noel habe Flyer für die tags drauf stattfindende Silvio - Meier - Demonstration verteilt .
Um 18.10 Uhr wird er laut Polizei " auf der Straße Unter den Linden / Glinkastraße / Neustädtische Straße " festgenommen .
Dazu teilt deren Pressestelle auf Anfrage mit : Der Jugendliche sei im Zusammenhang mit der Protestaktion gegen das Managertreffen im Adlon von Beamten beobachtet worden , wie er versuchte , Flyer an einem BVG - Bus anzubringen .
Die Polizei beanstandet die kleinen Flugblätter : " Das Fehlen des Impressums stellt einen Verstoß gegen das Pressegesetz dar . "
Deshalb sei gegen Noel eine Ordnungswidrigkeitenanzeige erstattet worden .
Der Jugendliche habe sich nicht in Begleitung befunden , so die Pressestelle der Polizei weiter .
Die Festnahme sei durch einen uniformierten Beamten erfolgt , der ihn einem " Bearbeitungstrupp " übergeben habe .
In einem Gruppenwagen sei Noel von zwei Beamten des Trupps nach Hause transportiert worden .
Dort hätten die Beamten aber keinen Erziehungsberechtigten angetroffen .
Deshalb sei der Junge " gegen 19.30 Uhr " beim Jugendnotdienst in Charlottenburg abgegeben worden .
" Es gab keine Hinweise auf eine körperliche oder geistige Einschränkung seitens des Jugendlichen " , betont die Pressestelle .
Der Bericht des Jugendnotdienstes , der der taz vorliegt , liest sich ganz anders .
Um 19.45 Uhr sei Noel von einer Polizistin und einem Polizisten gebracht worden , heißt es. Die Beamten hätten gesagt , der Junge sei auf einer Demonstration festgenommen worden .
Er habe dort selbst geschriebene Flugblätter verteilt .
Bereits auf der Fahrt sei den Polizisten aufgefallen , dass Noel etwas desorientiert wirkte .
So habe er immer das Gleiche gefragt und die Antworten anscheinend nicht registriert , so der Bericht des Notdienstes .
Wenige Minuten nach Noels Eintreffen ruft eine Sozialarbeiterin den Rettungswagen , der den Jungen ins Krankenhaus bringt .
Noel habe über " sehr starke Kopfschmerzen " geklagt , so der Bericht .
" Er umfasste immer wieder seinen Kopf , sagte , dass ihm der Kopf platze , war sehr unruhig und die Augen tränten ihm .
Sein Gesicht war rotgefärbt . "
Er wisse nicht , was an dem Nachmittag geschehen sei , habe der Junge gesagt .
Normalerweise bekommt der Jugendnotdienst von der Polizei einen Tätigkeitsbericht , aus dem hervorgeht , warum der Jugendliche gebracht wird und was vorgefallen ist .
Nicht in diesem Fall .
" Wir wissen nicht , was passiert ist " , sagt Notdienst - Mitarbeiterin Beate Köhn .
" Das ist ungewöhnlich . "
Als der Jugendnotdienst am nächsten Tag beim Polizeiabschnitt 53 nachfragt , lautet die Auskunft :
Es gebe keinen Tätigkeitsbericht , weil Noel " von einer mobilen Einsatzgruppe " aufgegriffen worden sei .
Nicht nur dass es keinen Tätigkeitsbericht gibt , erstaunt .
Mobile Einsatzgruppe ist der Fachausdruck für Zivilfahnder , die zur Observation eingesetzt werden .
Dabei erklärt die Polizeipressestelle , Noel sei von einem uniformierten Beamten festgenommen worden .
" Es macht einem panische Angst , wenn man nicht weiß , was passiert ist " , sagt Noel - ein 1,86 Meter großer Jugendlicher mit kurzen schwarzen Haaren und wachem Blick .
An jenem Freitag trug er eine dunkelblaue Winterjacke , Jeans und weiße Turnschuhe .
Auf dem Kopf hatte er ein rotes Basecap .
Den Ausweis hatte er zu Hause vergessen .
Der 14 - Jährige werde oft für älter gehalten , erzählen seine Eltern .
Noel sei ziemlich schlagfertig .
" Er knickt nicht vor Autoritäten ein , verteidigt seine Positionen " , sagt seine Mutter Anna .
Nicht jeder könne das ab .
Auch mit Polizisten diskutiert Noel gern , sagt sein Vater Marco , der den Sohn oft zu Demos begleitet .
Auch am 20 .
November hat Noel mit Polizisten gesprochen , an der Absperrung vor dem Adlon .
Das berichten die Freunde , mit denen er unterwegs war .
Noel habe zwei vermeintliche Passanten als Zivilpolizisten identifiziert und sich mit ihnen unterhalten , sagt eine Freundin , die zu der Gruppe gehörte .
Diese Szene habe sich gegen 17.50 Uhr abgespielt .
" Die Zivilpolizisten gaben zu , dass sie welche waren .
Danach gingen wir weiter und erzählten anderen Demonstranten , dass es sich um Zivilpolizisten handelt . "
Tobias - der Junge , mit dem Noel von Anfang an unterwegs war - hat mitbekommen , wie sein Freund versuchte , Polizisten mit der Rückenkennung E3 einige seiner Flyer anzudrehen .
Die Beamten hätten ziemlich gereizt reagiert , sagt Tobias .
Ein Polizist - hier X genannt - habe Noel hinterhergerufen : " Dich merk ich mir an der roten Mütze . "
Auf dem Bebelplatz begegnen die Jugendlichen später der E3 - Einheit wieder - laut Polizei war Noel da schon festgenommen worden , wovon die Freunde aber nichts wissen .
Mit der Bemerkung : " Du bist doch der Kumpel von dem mit dem roten Käppi " , habe sich derselbe Beamte X vor ihm aufgebaut , berichtet Tobias , und ihn aufgefordert sich auszuweisen .
Und er habe auch nach dem Namen des Jungen mit dem roten Käppi gefragt , berichtet Tobias , der sich jedoch weigert , Noels Namen zu nennen .
Der Beamte habe ihm daraufhin mit einer Anzeige gedroht :
Er habe kein Recht auf Aussageverweigerung , sei erst 14 und solle nicht auf Möchtegern - Autonomer machen .
Der Einschüchterungsversuch funktioniert : " Nach Zögern nenne ich Noels Vor- und Nachnamen " , sagt Tobias .
Urplötzlich entspannt sich die Situation .
Der Beamte X " wirkte irgendwie erleichtert " .
Kurz darauf steigen die Beamten in den Gruppenwagen und fahren ab .
Warum X unbedingt Noels Namen brauchte , ist unklar : Lag der 14 - Jährige da schon desorientiert im Polizeiwagen und niemand wusste , wohin mit ihm ?
Und wenn es so war : Warum war Noel desorientiert ?
Die zweite Begegnung mit X habe sich gegen 18.45 abgespielt , schätzt eine Freundin , die dabei war .
Kurz darauf , gegen 19 Uhr , versuchen Polizisten erfolglos , Noel zu Hause abzuliefern .
War einer der Beamten X ?
" Warum hat ihn die Polizei nicht gleich ins Krankenhaus gebracht ? " , fragt sich sein Vater .
Marco und Anna B. fordern von der Polizei Aufklärung .
Noel kommt aus einem akademischen Elternhaus .
Sein Vater und seine Mutter sind in der Medienbranche tätig .
Seit einem
Jahr geht der 14 - Jährige auf Demos : gegen Nazis , gegen Atomkraft , für bessere Bildung , gegen Gentrifizierung und für den Erhalt des Mauerpark - alles , was links ist .
Anders als seinen älteren Bruder habe es Noel schon früh hinausgedrängt , sagt seine Mutter .
" Er hat fundierte Meinungen , aber Gewalt lehnt er ab . "
Weil die Eltern ihr Kind nicht zu Hause anbinden wollen , geht Vater Marco jetzt oft mit zu den Protesten .
Er hat Angst um seinen Sohn , Eltern aus dem Bekanntenkreis erginge es ähnlich .
" Die Jugendlichen auf den Demos werden immer jünger " , hat Anna beobachtet .
Ohne ihnen die politische Ernsthaftigkeit absprechen zu wollen , hat sie den Eindruck , dass die radikalen Demos für die Youngsters wie ein Pfadfinderlager sind .
" Sie ziehen sich schwarze Klamotten an und wissen gar nicht , was für ein Signal sie damit aussenden . "
Die Stimmung sei aufgepuscht : im schwarzen Block genauso wie bei der Polizei .
In diesem Winter wird es noch viele Antifa - Demonstrationen geben .
Anna B. schlägt vor , dass Polizisten der Einsatzhundertschaften und jugendliche Demonstranten fernab vom Einsatzgeschehen zu einem Erfahrungsaustausch zusammenkommen .
Das Treffen könnte beiden Seiten dazu dienen , mit Vorurteilen aufzuräumen und ohne Stress herauszufinden , wie es dem anderen ergeht .
" Statt Konfrontation Dialog " , wünscht sich die Mutter .
" Noel möchte auch immer mit Polizisten diskutieren , um deren menschliche Seite kennenzulernen . "

Advertisement Iranian riot police are reported to have arrested a number of pro-reform protesters in Tehran after demonstrations turned violent .
Police clashed with hundreds of people marching despite a ban on public gatherings since the disputed election in June , Reuters news agency said .
The re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked widespread protests and allegations of vote - rigging .
Defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi has continued to contest the result .
Mr Mousavi has issued statements opposing the election result , saying detention of protesters would not end opposition .
Power protest Witnesses said hundreds or even thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran on Tuesday afternoon , although curbs on the international media mean it is difficult to verify reports from Iran independently .
IRAN UNREST 12 June Presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled , alleging poll fraud Mass street protests saw at least 20 people killed , hundreds arrested , and foreign media restricted
Rafsanjani fans flames of dissent Guide : How Iran is ruled Large numbers of riot police were deployed to meet them , and militia men in civilian clothes also mingled with the crowd , the BBC's Jon Leyne reports .
In a new form of protest , activists were urged to turn off lights and domestic appliances at 2055 ( 1625 GMT ) .
They planned to switch on five minutes later appliances that consume large amounts of electricity , such as irons , toasters and microwave ovens .
Activist leaders hoped the resulting surge in demand could cause a power outage and cloak Tehran in darkness , allowing some the chance to protest on the streets .
The power protest is the latest in a series of efforts to continue demonstrating without breaking the law or risking arrest .
Following a government clampdown on protests shortly after the disputed election , many in Tehran took to their roofs after dark to shout Allahu Akbar ( God is Great ) in solidarity with the opposition .
Referendum call
The renewed street protests come shortly after Mr Mousavi issued one of his strongest critiques of Iran 's ruling elite since the election result was declared .
He said it was an insult to the nation to suggest that opposition members were only protesting because they were told to by foreign powers .
And he insisted that intimidation and threats would not silence his supporters .
Since the announcement that Mr Ahmadinejad had won June 's presidential election , Mr Mousavi - a reformist former prime minister of Iran - has received backing from several senior figures within the Iranian establishment .
Among them are two former presidents , Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami .
On Monday Mr Khatami called for a referendum on the legitimacy of the government .
Only the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , can organise a referendum , and he has already declared the election result valid .
Mr Khatami , quoted on Iranian websites , said millions of Iranians had lost faith in the electoral process .
But Iran 's powerful Revolutionary Guard , which answers to the Supreme Leader , has described the election as a turning point .
The head of the Guards ' political bureau said the election allowed the Guards to take power into their own hands .
Our correspondent says many Iranians will see the Revolutionary Guards ' confidence as confirming their own fears that the outcome of the election was just a thinly - veiled military coup .

Google Books deal will create largest online library in the world
Google has moved a step closer to creating the world 's biggest on - line library .
The search engine has struck a landmark deal in the U.S. with publishers and writers allowing it to digitally scan and store their books .
The controversial proposals have received preliminary approval from some British publishing bodies .
A screen grab from the current Google Books service .
The internet giant is attempting to create the world 's largest online library
But some authors in this country remain angry over what is seen as Google 's high - handed attitude to making books available online .
They are still unhappy that Google initially starting scanning books without permission - and fear that their copyright could be infringed .
Google has reached a provisional settlement with American writers ' groups which would allow books published in the U.S. , Britain , Canada or Australia to be available online to American users .
A deal for UK readers is likely to follow within 12 months .
Pages from Lewis Caroll 's Alice 's Adventures In Wonderland can be read on Google books .
Readers can then click ' Buy ' to find where this edition is available
The new service will allow scholars , students and readers to search , preview and purchase online access to the works .
Under the deal , authors receive a one - off payment for their work , followed by further reimbursement depending on how often their material is used .
Google has said it has already copied ten million books , seven million of which were out of print .
For legal reasons , it has not said which titles it has copied .
Google Books , as its online library service is known , already offers classics such as Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe to be read for free online .
These are directly scanned from the book with illustrations .
Google announced it had been converting books into digital form in 2004 , prompting legal action by a number of rights holders in the U.S .
Yesterday Mark Le Fanu , of the Society of Authors , said : ' The settlement is particularly aimed at making out - of - print books available online in a way that 's controlled and under which authors and publishers will get some payment . '
But not all publishers are welcoming the deal .
Anthony Cheetham , director of Atlantic Books , said : ' We should be extremely cautious about ceding rights to any organisation in this sort of default manner . '
But Simon Juden , of the Publishers Association , said failing to support the deal would have deprived British writers and rights holders of control over how their work was used .
So today we went to an estate sale and the person who ’d owned the house had died and was awesome / completely insane .
Usually when Victor and I go to estate sales Victor looks for treasures and I rifle through all the dead person ’s books to see if they were the kind of person I ’d hang out with .
Except this time I did n’t even get to the books before I found him .
And yes .
That is a GINORMOUS wolf / bear / pig thing and I wanted it immediately .
Like , I kind of dropped my jaw and rocked back on my heels in shock a little and Victor was all “ What the f… ? ” and I ’m like “ I MUST HAVE THAT ” and Victor ’s all “ WHAT ?!
Where would you even put that ?! ” and I ’m all “ In my office , obviously .
I ’m not sharing James Garfield with the rest of you ” and he ’s all “ You named it ?
WE JUST SAW IT . ” and I ’m all “ Well , it ’s pretty obvious his name is James Garfield ” and Victor gave me this hard stare and said “ That thing is not going in our house ” .
Because apparently Victor hates animals .
And patriotism .
Then I tried to convince him that it was too big of a bargain not to buy since the normal - sized boar next to him was $ 100 and James Garfield was slightly less than $ 100 so technically per pound he was practically a steal .
It was like they were giving him away .
And then Victor was all “ They should give him away .
Do you see what it says on the tag ?
‘ Damaged .
Major hair loss . ’
It ’s horrific . ” and I ’m all “ Yeah ?
Well I love you in spite of your major hair loss ” and he ’s all “ WTF ?
I do n’t even have major hair loss ” and I ’m all “ Yeah , but I did n’t know that when I married you .
Your grampa was practically bald by 30 so I just assumed you would be too and I happily married you anyway .
Because I love you .
Just like I love James Garfield ” .
Then he walked away and I could tell he wanted to slam a door in frustration but he could n’t because it was n’t our house .
And actually , now that I ’m writing this I ’m thinking that Victor was probably mad because he thought I was saying I love him just as much as I love James Garfield .
Which is just not true .
I love you way more than I love James Garfield , Victor .
I just meant that I love you the same way .
Blindly and with every fiber of my being .
So yeah , I think you owe me an apology .
I tried to convince the lady running the estate sale to let me have him for $ 25 but she just laughed .
Victor says she was laughing because she thought I was joking about actually wanting James Garfield but I think it was pretty obvious that she was laughing at the idea of lowering the price of James Garfield since clearly someone had left a zero off of the price tag to begin with .
I mean , honestly , this picture does n’t even convey how awesome James Garfield was .
He was so big that I could have put my arms around his neck and my hands would n’t have touched .
BECAUSE MY HANDS CAN’T CONTAIN THAT MUCH AWESOMENESS .
And also because I was afraid he ’d lose even more hair if I hugged him .
And also because he was hung way up near the ceiling .
Probably because when he was hung lower everyone was hugging him constantly .
Which is probably why he has all the hair - loss to begin with .
From too much love .
Anyway , we left without James Garfield .
My heart hurts a little .
Because I left a piece of it with James Garfield .
Victor says it ’s because I probably got some sort of atrial pig disease from standing under James Garfield for so long .
I think Victor would probably be more understanding if he was bald too .
Which is why tonight I ’m going to start cutting tiny patches out of his hair when he ’s sleeping .
And we totally could have used him as a holiday decoration too and we could have used his picture as our family Christmas card this year instead of having a family portrait .
James Garfield practically pays for himself .
Except when I pointed that out to Victor he reminded me that we do n’t actually send out Christmas cards so technically James Garfield would be costing us money .
And I ’m all “ But you ’re not considering the return on our investment in Christmas cards ” and he ’s all “ WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ?
Christmas cards are not an investment ” .
Well , not with that attitude they ’re not .
UPDATED : Oh holy crap , y’all .
Can you glue human hair back on ?
I need someone to answer me before 6 am .
I ’ve made a horrible mistake .
This kind of shit would never have happened if James Garfield was here .
Comment of the day :
My husband also has an issue with taxidermy .
Mine are nowhere near as awesome as James Garfield , although they do have festive holiday outfits .
My duck has a Christmas ascot , and my mink has a yamulka .
I think the duck is actually the Jewish one , but the ascot looks stupid on the mink .
Anyhow , I think you ’re out of luck with the glue situation .
Unless you somehow mock up a crafting accident and trip and fall into Victor ’s head with crazy glue on your hand .
That way it ’ll seem like the hair loss is part of the accident .
It ’d help it seem more realistic if you could sustain a minor injury .
Bruise your knee or something .

JERUSALEM ( JTA ) — A 14 - year - old Israeli cancer patient has been allowed to smoke marijuana to relieve the side effects of chemotherapy .
The Health Ministry last week approved a request to treat her side effects , including pain and loss of appetite , and she began receiving marijuana cigarettes last Friday , Haaretz reported Wednesday .
The girl , being treated for hematological cancer at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa , is one of 800 Israeli patients receiving medical marijuana ; fewer than 10 are under the age of 18 , according to Haaretz .
The Essen Motor Show is a world of wonder with all kinds of modified , custom and high - end automotive and motorcycle creations that push the boundaries of speed and performance .
So , it ’s really no surprise that the Asphaltfighters Stormbringer superbike , what is being called the world ’s fastest street motorcycle , would make its debut at this event .
So , what does it take to garner this elusive title ?
Top speed is rated north of 199 mph with acceleration times from a dead stop to 186 mph in just 13.9 seconds .
Sprint times from 0 - 60 mph take only 2.9 seconds , while it can hit 120 mph in a mere 6.5 seconds .
Based out of Aelen , Germany , the bike ’s builder , WARM UP , is a relatively obscure motorcycle company for those in the states , but this may all change with their latest introduction .
WARM UP starts with a Kawasaki ZX - 10 R which is then modified extensively .
Even though it still uses the 1,000 - cc four - cylinder four - valve engine , German tuner Sepp Buchner manages to mash out 220 hp / 161.9 kW .
In addition , a special booster mode actually allows the powerplant to put out 280 hp / 206 KW for short bursts of speed when the bike is above 180 km/h ( 111 mph ) .
The Ashphaltfighters Stormbringer weighs in at just 429 pounds when fully fueled for an exceptional power to weight ratio .
WARM UP not only created an exceptional lightweight design but also integrated some pretty revolutionary features that have previously never been seen before on a superbike .
Some of the highlights include a backup camera system which renders conventional rear - view mirrors obsolete , a heads - up windshield display that shows current speed , LED daytime running lights along with a single ultra-powerful Xenon headlamp that handles both high and low beams .
WARM UP is only doing a small production run of the Asphalt Stormbringer .
The limited nature of this superbike as well as its unparalleled performance and technology give it a pretty steep MSRP of 57,500 Euros ( about $ 86,670 USD ) .
The bike showcased at the 2009 Essen Motor Show features a semi-gloss and orange paint scheme which is fine by us , even if no other options are offered .
In any case , WARM UP believes wholeheartedly in a perfect union between rider and bike and provides individualized setups for all buyers .
The rider ’s dimensions are taken into account to adjust the Asphalt Stormbringer ’s suspension system , seat position and operating controls .
These guys even throw in color - coordinated gear which consists of a leather riding suit and aerodynamic carbon - fiber and Kevlar helmet .

WHEN it comes to home mortgage modifications , everyone seems to have a complaint .
Borrowers accuse mortgage servicers , which process the paperwork , of often losing important documents like pay stubs and bank statements .
Servicers assert that the borrowers fail to submit certain papers and claim that they did , or submit the wrong ones .
Now , an industry group is rolling out an online portal that could eliminate these issues .
Hope Now , a partnership of mortgage companies and nonprofit housing counselors , this month introduced “ LoanPort , ” which lets borrowers seeking a permanent mortgage modification upload digitized versions of their documents and track the progress of their application , with the help of a loan counselor .
“ With this , there ’s no ‘he said , she said ’ element with lost documents , ” said Faith Schwartz , the executive director of Hope Now , which is based in Washington .
But Howard Glaser , a principal of the Glaser Group , a consulting company in Washington , predicted that the initiative would be too small to have much impact on what he characterized as a broadly dysfunctional loan - modification effort .
Dear Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
Dear Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel :
We , the undersigned alliance for a robust public option , write to request that President Obama heed the will of the people and the organized progressive grassroots and take a strong leadership position in support of a robust public option .
The public has spoken and the majority of members of Congress have spoken : Health care reform must include a robust public option .

Notes from Underground
With Gazans closed off to the world , underground tunnels increasingly serve as their overpriced lifeline for everything from food and Coke to ovens and cars chopped into pieces .
Over 30,000 Palestinians work in 1,500 tunnels that have spawned their own secondary economy ; the industrious tunnel owners make money , but are still trapped .
" They have never seen beyond Gaza , " said Abu Mohammed , 57 , of the younger generation .
" They think like they are in a tunnel . "

First of all , your screen name .
Stop putting “ sassy ” into your screen name .
Stop putting “ citygirl ” into your screen name .
When registering , if you tried to use “ cubfan ” as your screen name and it came back telling you that you ’d have to settle for “ cubfan57836 , ” that should have been your first clue that you have picked a disgustingly unoriginal name .
If you ca n’t come up with something truly original , just throw in your initials and some random numbers and leave it at that .
You are not clever enough to think of something good , therefore you should not expect to be coupled with someone who is .
Speaking of Cub fans , stop saying you love sports and that you “ act just like a guy . ”
Unless you ’re going to show up on my doorstep with a six - pack and a handful of condoms , proclaiming “ shut the hell up and get on me , ” you do n’t act like a guy .
I do n’t care how guy - like you think you are , I can make you cry without even trying .
So stop .
Stop , stop , stop saying you ’re looking for a “ partner in crime . ”
Every time I see this inane , completely meaningless sentiment in the first line of your description , I click right past you .
Unless , while standing in line at the bank , you think to yourself that all you ’d need to pull off a heist is a good wheel man driving a fast car , you ’re not looking for a goddamned partner in crime .
And if you are thinking that , PUT IT IN YOUR PROFILE , because jesus h. christ that is hot .
Okay .
Your picture .
Look , I do n’t mean to be a dick , but let ’s be serious , here .
That one picture that was taken of you in just the right light , while your face was angled just perfectly , while you were wearing that dress that hides every ugly bump on your backside , IS NOT YOU .
You know how I can tell ?
There ’s ONLY ONE PICTURE OF YOU IN YOUR PROFILE .
If you ca n’t scrape up two pictures of yourself where you do n’t look like a hideous wildebeest , chances are you ’re a hideous wildebeest .
I ’m not taking that chance .
And if you do find that poor unsuspecting soul who believes you ’re as attractive as that picture says , then what have you accomplished ?
He gets to give you that disappointed look when he meets you in person .
And I do n’t care how funny you are , or how much you like sports , or what a great “ partner in crime ” you can be .
He ’s not going to stick around for long , because you have effectively lied to him .
Be honest , show us what you really look like .
Maybe you ’ll get less suckers emailing you , but at least the ones who do will know what they ’re getting into .
And that brings us to when we do make contact .
During the time we ’re emailing back and forth ( and I really ca n’t stress this enough , kids ) , we are JUST TWO PEOPLE EMAILING .
I am not your boyfriend at this point .
I owe you NOTHING .
If you notice that I ’m still online and active in my search before you and I even meet face - to - face , TOO FUCKING BAD .
This is not a horrible thing for me to do .
I have n’t even met you yet , so relax .
If you ’ll take a step back , you ’ll probably notice that you ’re doing the exact same thing .
Please do not freak out if I do n’t respond to your email right away .
This does not mean I ’m blowing you off , and it does not mean I ’m playing games .
It means I do n’t live in my fucking computer .
I have a life outside of cyberspace , so if you ’ve sent me a really funny and witty email filled with adorable emoticons , do n’t get pissed off if it takes me 24 hours to send you a “ LOL . ”
Relax and go outside for a few minutes .
All those angry thoughts you ’re thinking will soon seem really crazy , trust me .
They certainly do to me .
And if we do meet , and some kissy stuff happens , guess what ?
I still do n’t owe you ANYTHING .
Yes , I , too would love to believe that the very touch of my lips has the power to enslave members of the opposite sex .
But just because we mashed and dry - humped on your couch for an hour does n’t mean I ’m betrothed to you .
Maybe this will pan out and get more serious , but for now RELAX .
We just kissed .
If I go home and check my messages on Match , do n’t send me an “ I saw you online ” email and curse me out .
All that will do is make me go away in search of less troublesome company .
Sad , but true .
Deal .
Okay , to recap : Stop it , do n’t do that , relax .
Easy enough , right ?
this is in or around online dating hell
Comments on the straw man ...
These are thoughts that occur to me on first reading of Mark 's strawman .
1 . Lambda expressions .
It appears there are two forms ( which I call expression lambdas and statement lambdas ) .
I think that 's a good idea .
It is n't clear if the parens in the expression lambdas are a required part of the syntax , or just happen to appear in all the examples .
A grammar to accompany the proposal would clarify this .
I do n't have strong feelings either way , but I believe we would come to regret requiring the parens .
The strawman does n't say anything about it , but I believe it would be an error to require that each evaluation of a lambda expression creates a distinct object , as Mark suggested in a previous email .
I can explain in detail if it is n't clear why , but for a hint note that many of the examples of lambdas in the strawman could be statically allocated ( when the lambda is n't technically a closure ) .
The compiler should be free to do that , rather than requiring the programmer to reorganize the code to place each such lambda where it is evaluated only once .
There is too little detail to see how things fit together here .
I do n't know what the type of a lambda expression is or what the type ( and definite assignment , exception , completion , binary compatibility , runtime , etc ) rules are .
The devil is in the details .
2 . Function types .
The strawman does n't give any semantics for these , so it is hard to evaluate .
What is the syntax for checked exceptions that might be thrown by a function ?
How do I construct a class literal with these ?
Do they obey subtype rules that are covariant on return types ?
Contravariant on argument types ?
If it lacks either , it would reduce the flexibility of the ParallelArray APIs .
One option is that these types map to interfaces , as BGGA , in which case we know a coherent spec in this direction is possible .
I know some people would like to see method handles investigated as an implementation mechanism for function types , but I have n't seen any serious attempt at specifying that .
Some language work will be required to explain how variables of function type can be invoked .
Perhaps variables of function type are also added to the method namespace ?
It will be a bit messy ; the devil is in the details .
3 . Function conversion .
Again , too much is missing .
What is " appropriate type " and " as needed " ?
Is this conversion applied only to lambda expressions ( as in BGGA ) ?
Or does it also convert variables of " function types " ( sec 2 ) to " SAM types " , which suggests that function types are not interfaces ?
Is this an identity conversion ?
A subtype conversion ?
An assignment conversion ?
An argument conversion ?
A boxing conversion ?
In BGGA ( and therefore FCM ) it is a subtype conversion so that it can be integrated into type inference , but perhaps the strawman author has other ideas .
Keeping the effect on type inference in mind should help prune the design space , but the strawman gives no hint that this has been done .
What if the abstract method is generic ?
If SAMs include classes ( with a single abstract method ) , then how is the constructor selected , and where do its arguments come from ?
Can it be an inner class ?
A local class ?
Are the SAM 's members in scope within the body of the closure ?
If not , what is the reason to include ( abstract ) classes ?
Including ( abstract ) classes also interferes with the compiler 's ability to select the allocation time ( see second paragraph under 1 above ) .
Overall , I believe the issues with them and the rarity of use cases argues against supporting ( abstract ) classes as SAMs .
Again , the devil is in the details ; without details it is hard to see if or how function conversions fit with the rest of the strawman .
4 . Variable Capture .
Needs more refinement about what is meant by " effectively final " .
Despite the strawman 's reference , the JLS DA / DU rules can't be used for this purpose ; a new and separate dataflow specification would be required .
That is likely to be comparable in size to the existing JLS3 DA / DU analysis and require a significant effort to specify and implement correctly .
One simple approach is to define as " effectvely final " variables that are never subject to an assignment ( initialization in the declaration is not assignment ) , as the BGGA prototype does .
That is trivial to specify .
What appears to be intended here is n't ( ... devil ... details ) .
The strawman says that " A shared variable can be modiﬁed within the body of a lambda expression , although it must be deﬁnitely assigned - to before the lambda expression is evaluated . "
This is an error ; there is no reason to require a variable be definitely assigned if it is only written by the lambda .
5 . Scoping .
I presume all names ( except lambda parameters ) and accessibility are resolved as in the lexically enclosing scope ( i.e. no names inherited from the SAM ) .
But this is far from clear ( especially when used with abstract class SAMs ) .
6 . Exception transparency ala BGGA requires the type " Nothing " to be used as an exception parameter and also in the return type for conversion of a lambda whose body cannot complete normally , but there is no mention of " Nothing " in the strawman .
BGGA also introduces disjunctive types and related rules for type inference .
BGGA relies on function types being interfaces , but the strawman explicitly leaves that open , making me wonder what the strawman author has in mind .
There is not enough information to even guess what is envisioned here .
If disjunctive exception types are supported , then the coin specification for multicatch can be simplified .
It would allow the removal of the " final " requirement on disjunctive catch parameters .
8 . Extension methods .
I think more experience with alternatives would be valuable .
My primary concern with extension methods in this form is that it undermines one of their most valuable traits - the ability to retrofit functionality on APIs without requiring access to the source .
That is useful among other reasons to enable much more flexibility in future language changes .
As a separate matter , extension methods could be used as a basis for a much cleaner specification of array - index syntax for lists / maps .
It is n't clear if discussion of extension methods is appropriate here or in Coin .
0 . Overall impression .
Overall , my impression is that this strawman sets a stake in the ground about how the language features might fit together without actually working it out or verifying that the ideas are mutually compatible .
It appears to address the simplest use cases only .
There is not enough detail to evaluate most of it .
A great deal of work will be required to turn the ideas into a coherent language specification , and that will likely require a significant revision of the initial ideas .
Many of my questions would be answered in the effort ; it is n't clear what purpose was served by publishing the strawman .
Given the amount of language design work remaining and the short time frame ( 5 - 6 months to feature complete ) , does Sun plan to devote someone ( or a team ) with the appropriate skills ( or who have the time to develop those skills ) to the task ?
When can we expect the blanks in the strawman to be filled in ?
What resources and schedule are envisioned for the implementation / prototype ?
It would be nice to have a wiki to track progress .
I can easily imagine points being lost in discussion threads that branch from a message such as this one .
I 've provided hosting here : < http://www.javac.info/lambda/>, but I can easily imagine Sun could provide its own hosting facilities .
( I 've sent Mark the admin password separately ) .

( CNN ) --
The father of a man suspected in a botched terror attack aboard a Northwest Airlines flight contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria recently with concerns his son was planning something , a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday .
The father -- identified by a family source as Umaru Abdul Mutallab -- contacted the U.S. Embassy " a few weeks ago " saying his son , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , had " become radicalized , " the senior administration official , who is familiar with the case , told CNN .
Abdulmutallab , 23 , was charged in a federal criminal complaint Saturday with attempting to destroy the plane Friday on its final approach to Michigan 's Detroit Metropolitan Airport , and placing a destructive device on the aircraft , the Department of Justice said .
A family source told CNN that Mutallab -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC , one of Nigeria 's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in Nigeria 's capital , Abuja , and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official .
The family source said Mutallab went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son .
The source , who lives at the family home in Kaduna in northern Nigeria , said the son informed his family in the text message that he was leaving school in Dubai to move to Yemen .
He implied that he was leaving " for the course of Islam . "
The family member said Abdulmutallab " had no family consent or support , " adding he " absconded to Yemen . "
Mutallab 's information about his son was forwarded to the National Counter - Terrorism Center , and Abdulmutallab was added to a general watch list , the senior administration official said .
But the official said " the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no - fly list . "
Abdulmutallab was arrested Friday and made an initial court appearance Saturday afternoon at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor , where he was being treated for severe burns suffered when he ignited a small explosive device .
Read the federal criminal complaint and affidavit
The fire was put out and he was subdued by crew members and passengers , and the plane landed shortly thereafter .
He was taken into custody for questioning by the FBI , authorities said .
A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device contained PETN , also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate , a highly explosive chemical compound .
In addition , FBI agents recovered what appear to be the remnants of a syringe from the vicinity of Abdulmutallab 's seat , believed to have been part of the device .
Abdulmutallab was granted a multiple - year , multiple - entry tourist visa at the U.S. Embassy in London in June 2008 , the administration official said .
He was a student in London at the time , and there was " no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa , " the official said .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , in a statement Saturday , said , " The security of the public must always be our primary concern . "
Britain's Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Saturday he is following developments closely and has assured the public that police in Britain are working closely with U.S. investigators " to uncover the full background to the incident . "

When Abdulmutallab returned to Nigeria from London , he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in Egypt or Saudi Arabia , the family source said .
The family refused , because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people .
He went to Dubai , instead , the source said , where he sent a text message saying he had gone to Yemen to start a new life , and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his SIM card .
Abdulmutallab's father notified the U.S. Embassy with information on his son , saying the family feared he went to Yemen to participate in " some kind of jihad . "
A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday " was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used . "
Yemeni authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt , according to a Yemeni official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press .
But , the source said the country 's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect 's alleged link to the country is officially identified .
Earlier Saturday , the Netherlands ' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that Abdulmutallab had gone through " normal security procedures " in Amsterdam before boarding the flight to Detroit , Michigan , and those were " well - performed . "
The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups , the U.S. administration official said .
See passengers ' accounts
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Mississippi , who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security , said the attempted act of terrorism would be the focus of an oversight hearing next month .
" The committee will get to the bottom of what did and did not happen with Mr. Abdulmutallab and what security precautions need to take place in the future , " Thompson said .
In Nigeria , the government said Saturday that it " received with dismay the news of attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. airline " and has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident .
" While steps are being taken to verify the identity of the alleged suspect and his motives , our security agencies will cooperate fully with the American authorities in the on - going investigations , " said Dora Akunyili , Nigeria 's minister of information and communications .
" We state very clearly that as a nation , we abhor all forms of terrorism . "
Officials from the Nigerian Embassy in Washington , D.C. , have flown to Michigan " to gain Consular access " to the suspect , the embassy said in a statement Saturday .
The embassy said it plans to cooperate with U.S. authorities in the case .
An official with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration told CNN there will be increased security measures taken on international flights to the United States .
The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before the flight .
There will be no change in the number of carry - on bags allowed .
CNN 's Jeanne Meserve , Richard Quest , Nic Robertson and Elise Labott contributed to this report .
First , the Taliban fought with Kalashnikovs and RPGs .
Then they came with jury - rigged explosives .
Now , the militants have brought the most fearsome weapon of all : buns of steel .
“ Glad Tidings of Victory , ” a video released by the Taliban ’s Al - Emirat video production unit , shows the Afghan guerrillas strutting around an abandoned U.S. military base in Nuristan province .
Taking a filmed “ victory ” lap around an American facility might make some sense as a propaganda tool .
But taking a giggly victory lap on an elliptical in said base – as two Taliban enthusiastically do in the video – is a big infowar fail .
Since the U.S. began closing its remote bases in Nuristan , the Taliban have been showing off the alleged spoils of war they say they 've taken from the abandoned outposts .
The closures in Nuristan , planned for some time , were carried out as part of General Stanley McChrystal ’s strategy to refocus coalition resources on Afghan population centers rather than remote , sparsely - populated areas .
But given that U.S. outposts were often the subject of fierce attacks , particularly shortly before the announcement , the Taliban seized on the timing to frame the evacuations – and the items left behind – as the fruits of their military prowess , rather than a calculation about Nuristan ’s strategic value .
While some items can make for effective propaganda symbols , the display of lower body exercise machines , generally speaking , tends to dilute their impact .
So beware , all .
The Taliban are on the march – with sculpted thighs and firm buttocks .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 24/11/2009 ( 3962 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
AT first , those in the audience were just thankful they were n't the poor saps dragged up on stage to be publicly chided for leaving a cellphone on during the play .
But then , when Kris Robinson dropped to his knee and popped open the ring box , the elaborate ruse set up by staff at Prairie Theatre Exchange Tuesday night became clear .
BORIS , MINKEVICH@FREEPRESS.MB.CA
Kris Robinson proposes to a stunned Kayla Kowerko on stage .
The audience erupted and a stunned Kayla Kowerko covered her face in shock as Robinson proposed .
" I have n't heard you say anything yet ... " prompted PTE artistic director Bob Metcalfe from upstage .
" Yes ! " squeaked Kowerko .
The couple has been dating long - distance for a while -- Kowerko is a Winnipegger but Robinson lives in New York state .
She recently decided to move to New York , which prompted Robinson to make things official , enlisting the help of PTE staff for the surprise proposal .
Theatre staff hung around after work to witness it and the actors snuck out from backstage in full costume for the big moment .
Before the show -- a dramatic comedy about Canadian - American family relations aptly called Bordertown Cafe -- Metcalfe delivered his regular cellphone warning by whipping out his iPhone and consulting a new ' ap ' he claimed could identify every cellphone in the theatre that was still on .
As part of the pre-arranged plan , Metcalfe called the only phone still on -- Robinson's .
" There 's a long - standing tradition at PTE that if you leave your phone on , you have to come on stage and apologize to the audience , " scolded Metcalfe over the phone to Robinson in his seat .
Metcalfe also dragged an embarrassed Kowerko on stage and teased Robinson for being an uncivilized American .
" Kayla -- it 's Kayla , right ?
Are n't you embarrassed ? " asked Metcalfe .
" Kris , if I were you , I would get down on one knee and apologize to her . "
Robinson got on his knee and popped the question , which only Kowerko could hear over the gasps and claps .
After a hug and smooch on stage and big round of applause , the duo then returned to their seats .
" Let that be a lesson to you all , " joked Metcalfe .
" If you leave your cellphone on , you 'll end up married . "

The People Throughout most of its history , the United States has had influxes of immigration .
The ethnic mix is 83 % white ( generally of European descent , but also from the Middle East and Latin America ) , 12 % African - American , 3 % Asian and about 1 % Native American .
Today the biggest immigrant groups are from Latin countries .
Meeting and Greeting American greetings are generally quite informal .
This is not intended to show lack of respect , but rather a manifestation of the American belief that everyone is equal .
Although it is expected in business situations , some Americans do not shake hands at social events .
Instead , they may greet you with a casual " Hello " or " How are you ? " or even just " Hi . "
In larger groups , many may not greet you at all .
In social situations , Americans rarely shake hands upon leaving .
The only proper answers to the greetings " How do you do ? " " How are you ? " or " How are you doing ? " are " Fine , " " Great , " or " Very well , thank you . "
This is not a request for information about your well - being ; it is simply a pleasantry .
" See you later " is just an expression .
People say this even if they never plan to see you again .
When saying good - bye , Americans may say " We 'll have to get together " or " Let 's do lunch . "
This is simply a friendly gesture .
Unless your American colleague specifies a time and date , do n't expect an invitation .
If you want to have lunch , you should take the initiative to schedule it .
Stand while being introduced .
Only the elderly , the ill and physically unable persons remain seated while greeting or being introduced .
It is good to include some information about a person you are introducing .
Example : " Susan Olson , I 'd like you to meet John Harmon .
He designed the brochure we are using for this campaign . "
Use professional titles when you are introducing people to each other .
Example : " Judge Susan Olson , meet Dr. John Harmon . "
If you are introducing yourself , do not use your professional title .
Handshakes are usually brief .
Light handshakes are considered distasteful .
Use a firm grip .
Eye contact is important when shaking someone ’s hand .
Body Language Keep your distance when conversing .
If an American feels you are standing too close , he or she may step back without even thinking about it .
People who like to touch really like touching , and people who do not like to touch really dislike being touched .
You will need to watch your colleagues for clues on what they are comfortable with .
Americans are generally uncomfortable with same - sex touching , especially between males .
Holding the middle finger up by itself is considered insulting and vulgar .
Americans smile a great deal , even at strangers .
They like to have their smiles returned .
Men and women will sit with legs crossed at the ankles or knees , or one ankle crossed on the knee .
Some Americans are known as " back slappers " -- they give others a light slap on the back to show friendship .
Corporate Culture
In a country that prides itself on its individualism , companies are organized and structured with many different styles depending on the industry , the company 's history and its current leaders .
In the United States , business relationships are formed between companies rather than between people .
Americans do business where they get the best deal and the best service .
It is not important to develop a personal relationship in order to establish a long and successful business relationship .
Americans view the business card as a source of future information and tend to exchange cards casually .
There is no set ritual for exchanging business cards .
Americans prefer directness in communication .
When Americans say " yes " or " no , " they mean precisely that .
" Maybe " really does mean " it might happen " ; it does not mean " no . "
It is always proper to ask questions if you do not understand something .
Americans ask questions -- lots of them .
They are not ashamed to admit what they do know .
Americans will assume you understand something if you do not tell them otherwise .
Americans are often uncomfortable with silence .
Silence is avoided in social or business meetings .
It is rude to interrupt someone who is talking .
Say , " Excuse me " during a pause and wait to be recognized .
Interruptions , however , are common .
Do not be surprised if someone finishes your sentence if you hesitate when you are speaking .
Americans put a great deal of value on the written word .
American law almost always requires contracts to be written out .
Verbal contracts are rarely legally binding .
Make sure you read the fine print .
Do not enter into any contract without hiring a lawyer .
No savvy American businessperson would dream of signing a contract before consulting a lawyer .
It is very important in written communication to spell names correctly and have correct titles .
If you are unsure of these , call the person 's assistant to get the correct spelling and title .
Keep appointments once they are made .
You may not get a second chance if you do not .
When you are doing business in the United States , you must be on time .
Americans view someone being late as rude , showing a lack of respect and having sloppy , undisciplined personal habits .
Being " on time " in business situations generally means being about five minutes early .
Five minutes late is acceptable with a brief apology .
Ten to fifteen minutes late requires a phone call to warn of the delay and to apologize .
It is very important to meet deadlines .
If you tell someone that you will have a report to them by a certain date , or that you will fax something to them immediately , they will take you at your word .
People who miss deadlines are viewed as irresponsible and undependable .
Meetings are generally informal and relaxed in manner , but serious in content .
Often an agenda will be distributed before a meeting , so the participants will be prepared to discuss certain topics .
A successful meeting is short and to the point .
Be prepared to begin business immediately , with little or no prior small talk .
Participation is expected in meetings .
A quiet person may be viewed as not prepared or as having nothing important to contribute .
Meetings often end with a summary and an action plan for the participants to execute .
A meeting is only considered successful if something concrete is decided .
Americans appreciate and are impressed by numbers .
Using statistics to support your opinions will help you be persuasive .
Generally , there is one negotiation leader who has the authority to make decisions .
Team negotiations are rare .
Americans may begin negotiations with unacceptable conditions or demands .
They are usually taking a starting position that gives them room to bargain .
The goal of most negotiations in the United States is to arrive at a signed contract .
Long - term relationships and benefits may not be the main objective .
The immediate deal may be the only important issue .
Negotiations may seem rushed to you .
Remember that " time is money " to Americans and that they may not think that building a relationship with potential business partners is necessary .
Americans are very comfortable picking up the telephone and immediately conducting business with someone they have never met and perhaps never will meet .
Dining and Entertainment Americans conduct business over breakfast , lunch and dinner .
Some socializing may start off the meal , but often the conversation will revolve around business .
In a business setting the person extending the invitation to a meal pays for it .
The fork is held in the left hand , tines facing down .
The knife is held in the right hand .
After cutting the food , the knife is laid down and the fork is switched to the right hand to eat the cut food .
Continental style ( where the fork stays in the left hand to eat the cut food ) is perfectly acceptable .
The guest of honor is often toasted and should reciprocate by giving a toast of thanks .
Your napkin should be placed on your lap shortly after you are seated and kept on your lap at all times during the meal .
Do not tuck your napkin under your chin .
Raise your hand or index finger and make eye contact to signal a server .
Dinner at an American home may be fairly informal .
Do not be late for a dinner party .
Arrive within 5 to 15 minutes after the time on the invitation .
Never arrive before the time you were invited .
If you are going to be more than 15 minutes late , phone your hosts and apologize .
Never begin eating until everyone is served and your hosts have begun .
Offer food or drink to others before helping yourself .
Serve all women at the table first .
If offered a second helping of food , feel free to take what you like .
Americans like people to eat a lot .
When you are invited to an event , it is very important to call or drop a note letting the host know if you will attend .
That said , Americans are notorious for not responding to invitations .
Do not be afraid of hurting someone 's feelings by responding " no " to an invitation .
People will be offended if you say you will attend and then do not come .
If an invitation reads " 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. , " leave very close to the ending time stated .
Americans tend to eat more quickly than people from other countries .
Dining in the United States is seldom the long , lingering event it is in much of the world .
The point is more often to eat rather than socialize and savor the meal .
Dress
The appropriate clothing for business varies widely .
Proper dress depends on the region of the country , a person 's company , his or her position within it and the industry in which he or she works .
The best approach is to be conservative until you have had a chance to observe what others wear in an office .
You can always get more casual after you get a sense of how people dress .
You cannot lose , however , if you begin with a very professional attire and manner .
Men : socks should match your suit .
No leg should show between pant hem and shoe .
Remove your hat when indoors .
Women : do not overdress for daytime or wear flashy or noisy jewelry .
American women do not wear a lot of makeup to the office .
Low - cut blouses , short skirts and tight clothing are not appropriate office attire .
Gifts Americans do not have as many customs and taboos concerning gifts as many other cultures have .
Gifts from your country will always be appreciated .
Good choices are local and regional arts and crafts , books , candies , specialty foods and wine or spirits ( if you are certain that the recipient drinks ) .
If you are invited to someone 's home for dinner or a party , bring flowers , a potted plant , a fruit basket , candy , wine , a book or a small household gift .
Many companies have policies that discourage their employees from giving or receiving gifts .
Most government employees are not allowed to accept gifts .
Do not be offended if someone cannot accept a gift .
Cash gifts are never appropriate .
Helpful Hints
It is considered rude to stare , ask questions or otherwise bring attention to someone 's disability .
Smoking is very unpopular in the United States .
Restaurants have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections .
Public and private buildings may ban smoking except in designated areas .
Some people do not allow smoking in their homes and will ask you to go outside if you want to have a cigarette .
Never smoke anywhere without asking permission from everyone present .
Names are not held as sacred in the United States .
Someone may mispronounce your name and laugh a bit as they do it .
Or someone may just call you by your given name if your family name is too difficult to pronounce .
There are several common names and nicknames that are used by both men and women .
Call the person 's assistant to ask if you are unsure of his or her gender .
" Please " and " thank you " are very important in the United States .
Say " please " and " thank you " to everyone for even the smallest kindness .
Americans say them regardless of rank or how much they are paying for something , and they expect others to do the same .
Say " Pardon me " or " Excuse me " if you touch someone or even get close to someone .
Americans also say this if they sneeze or cough or do not understand something someone has said .
Americans often share things in casual conversation , even with strangers , that may seem shockingly private .
Social conversation in the United States is light .
There is a standard format for small talk .
People ask brief questions and expect brief answers .
Americans become uncomfortable when one person talks for any length of time in a social situation .
If you feel uncomfortable with a question asked of you , simply smile and say , " In my country , that would be a strange question . "
American Women Women are leaders in all aspects of American life from business to education to government .
Never assume that a working woman is in a subordinate position .
American women are independent .
They will not appreciate any " special help " offered because of their gender .
Do not assume that a woman needs more time or more help than a man doing the same job .
American women pride themselves on the number of responsibilities they take on .
Do not assume that a working woman is no longer the primary caretaker of her family and children .
When addressing a woman , use the title " Ms. " unless you know that she prefers " Mrs. " or " Miss . "
Many women keep their maiden names after marriage .
Some use both their maiden and married names .
When going to dinner or lunch , the person who invites pays , whether it is a man or a woman .
Do not touch a woman in a business setting except to shake her hand .
Hugging and kissing , even of people you know very well , is best left for social occasions .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Many scientists believe that quantum entanglement is required in order for effective quantum computing .
Entanglement takes place when there is a connection that exists between two objects - even when they are spatially separated - that allows what happens to one to happen to the other .
The link is such that each entangled object cannot be adequately described without its counterpart .
So far , entangling qubits for practical use has been difficult , since scientists want to be able to entangle several qubits at once .
The idea of entangling more qubits appears to be gaining traction with a recent experiment conducted the University of Rome in Italy .
Giuseppe Vallone is a member of group that was able to entangle a two - photon , six - qubit cluster state .
“ The degree of entanglement increases with more qubits , ” Vallone tells PhysOrg.com .
“ If you want a bigger entanglement , you need to be able to work with more qubits .
This is moving us in that direction . ”
The results of the experiment can be found in Physical Review Letters : “ Experimental Entanglement and Nonlocality of a Two - Photon Six - Qubit Cluster State . ”
Vallone and his peers believe that this represents the first time a six - qubit linear cluster state built using a two - photon triple entangled state has been experimentally demonstrated .
The demonstration aims at creating a hybrid method of increasing entanglement by adding more qubits , but also limiting the decoherence that comes when a greater number of particles is involved with the system .
“ If we can increase the number of particles and degrees of freedom , ” Vallone explains , “ you can get a more highly entangled state , which would have a number of possible uses in a possible future quantum technology . ”
In order to set up the experiment , Vallone and his colleagues prepared a six - qubit state that was hyper - entangled using two photons with triple entanglement .
Longitudinal momentum and polarization were used to encode three qubits in each particle , and then a series of unitary transformations were performed in order to entangle some of the qubits .
The process was an extension of work that has been done to create four - qubit states .
To make sure entanglement had taken place , measurements had to be taken .
“ We measured each particle with the encoded qubits , and measured their states , ” Vallone says .
“ Entanglement is a correlation between different systems , and we were able to compare the measurements on the two photons and see that there was entanglement . ”
Going forward , Vallone hopes that the number of qubits used can be increased to eight .
“ When you increase the qubits , the computational power grows exponentially , ” Vallone says .
“ So it is important to see if we can get this effect with a higher number of qubits .
Now that we have shown that it can be done with six , the next step is go on to eight , and then add even more qubits . ”
This way , he continues , it should be possible to eventually use the method for practical quantum computation .
“ We are trying to use the two - photon state to perform a quantum algorithm that can be seen as a proof - of - principle demonstration of a quantum computer , and I think that we will be able to get there at some point . ”

Senate Health Care Debate Stalls as Republicans Invoke Delay Tactics Senate Democratic leaders still may not have the votes they need to pass bill .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 16 , 2009  -- The Democrats ' self - imposed deadline to pass health care legislation by Christmas is just around the corner , but delays abound and there are no guarantees that Senate leaders will have enough votes to pass the bill .
President Obama said in an interview with ABC News ' Charles Gibson today that if Congress fails to pass health care legislation that lowers costs , the federal government " will go bankrupt . "
He also painted a gloomy picture resulting from the failure of health care overhaul .
" Anybody who says that they are concerned about deficit , concerned about debt , concerned about loading up taxes on future generations , you have to be supportive of this health care bill because if we do n't do this , nobody argues with the fact that health care costs are going to consume the entire federal budget , " the president said .
Watch Charles Gibson 's interview with President Obama tonight on World News .
On Capitol Hill , Democrats faced further delays today as Republicans demanded that an amendment in the health care bill that would introduce a single - payer system be read on the Senate floor -- all 766 pages .
Such delays by GOP lawmakers could force senators to stay in session through Christmas or force Democrats to wait until next year to vote on their health care overhaul bill .
The amendment offered by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont would throw out Democrats ' health care plan and replace it with a single - payer system .
It was doomed for failure from the start , but liberal Democrats wanted the opportunity to vote to show that it did not have the votes to pass .
Normally , senators allow their amendments to be entered into the record without actually making the clerk read them .
But Republican Tom Coburn , the Oklahoma doctor who opposes Democrats ' health care overhaul efforts , objected when Democrats tried to enter an amendment into the record today , saying the amendment must be offered 72 hours in advance and with a full cost assessment .
He then invoked his right to require that the amendment be read out loud .
Senators resumed debate in the afternoon after Sanders withdrew his amendment , saying the Republican delaying tactic was an " outrage . "
The Vermont senator , whose vote Democrats will need to pass the health care bill , said today he has not yet signed on to the latest push by Democratic leaders .
" At this point I 'm not on board , " Sanders said at a press conference today .
" The function of private insurance companies is not to provide health care it's to make a profit . "
The debate is heating up in the Senate as some Democrats remain divided on what a health care bill should entail , even as it enters its final phase .
Obama said he likes the Senate health care compromise and wants it passed by Christmas , but he faces a revolt from some liberals who say the health care bill has been gutted to appease insurance companies .
" This is a bigger bailout for the insurance industry than AIG , " former Democratic National Committee chairman and medical doctor Howard Dean told " Good Morning America 's " George Stephanopoulos today .
" A very small number of people are going to get any insurance at all , until 2014 , if the bill works .
" This is an insurance company 's dream , this bill , " Dean continued .
" This is the Washington scramble , and I think it 's ill - advised . "
The White House today pushed back on Dean 's comments , saying his arguments " simply were n't true " and " flat - out wrong . "
" If this is an insurance company 's dream , I think the insurance companies have yet to get the memo , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters today .
" Insurance companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against this legislation .
...
If this is such a good deal for them , I 'm not entirely sure why they 're fighting it . "
" " I would ask Dr. Dean , is it -- how better do you address those that do n't have insurance , passing a bill that covers 30 million that do n't currently have it , or killing a bill ?
I do n't think any rational person would say killing a bill makes any sense at this point , " Gibbs added .
Democratic leaders will likely scrap the alternative they had developed for a government - run insurance option , the so - called Medicare buy - in , which , if included , would have allowed Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 to buy into Medicare .
The central tenets of that compromise reached last week among Democrats were stripped from the bill because of the objections of independent Sen .
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , who said he would not support the legislation if it contained that option " because it reportedly has some of the same infirmities that the public option did . "
Democratic leaders need Lieberman 's vote to avoid a Republican filibuster , but liberals are unhappy , saying the bill has been modified to please one senator .
Health Care Fight Continues
Democrats are also eyeing Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , whose amendment to impose tighter regulations on abortion coverage was voted down earlier this month .
Democrats are counting on his support to get the needed 60 votes but he has yet to say how he will vote .
Obama " made a strong case for passing health care reform now , " Nelson said today , according to the Associated Press .
" But I think it still remains to be seen if it was compelling .
" I do say if nothing is done , I 'm not sure what Plan B is , " he said .
" If Plan B is start over ... it 's quite possible that it just wo n't happen .
It seems to me that we have a chance right now to fix a flawed bill . "
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll released today shows that Americans are more skeptical about health care overhaul than before .
Of those polled , 53 percent said they see higher costs for themselves if a health care bill with the current proposals is passed .
About as many , 55 percent , say the overall cost of the national health care system would go up more sharply , and 50 percent see health care as better under the existing set - up .
Republicans , none of whom are likely to support the Senate health care bill , today cited polls to voice their opposition to the legislation .
Armed with a chart of public opinion polls from the past year , Sen. Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , said at a news conference today that the Democrats ' " problem is not the 40 of us .
Their problem is the American people . "
The Senate minority leader agreed with the president that passing a health care bill would be historic but called it " the wrong kind of history .
" The American people are asking us not to make a historic mistake , " McConnell told reporters .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , a leading critic of the Democrats ' efforts , made similar arguments on the Senate floor .
" Fifty - seven percent of seniors in America believe , and they are correct , that this proposal would weaken the benefits they have earned , " McCain said .
Democrats Divided over Health Care
Dean , a former presidential candidate , sent shockwaves when he said Tuesday in an interview with Vermont Public Radio that the removal of the Medicare buy - in means Democrats should just kill the health care bill and start over .
" This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate , " Dean said .
" Honestly , the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill , go back to the House , start the reconciliation process , where you only need 51 votes and it would be a much simpler bill . "
The former Democratic presidential candidate argued today on " GMA " that in the rush to pass a health care bill , lawmakers have essentially stripped it of true reforms -- mainly the choices it would give to people -- and given too much to special interest groups and insurance companies , the chief executives of which , Dean says , would get 27 percent of the money Americans contribute .
" We 've gotten to this stage ... in Washington where passing any bill is a victory , and that 's the problem , " Dean said .
" Decisions are being about the long - term future of this country for short - term political reasons , and that 's never a good sign . "
He said he also does n't see cost - control measures but , rather " a whole bunch of bureaucracies and a lot of promises , " and while there are some good elements in the current health care bill , " at this point , the bill does more harm than good . "
The former Vermont governor said he would suggest using money allocated for community health centers and wellness and prevention programs to help people buy insurance and that less power be transferred into the hands of the private insurance companies .
Dean , who said he believes the bill will pass the Senate , initially supported health care legislation .
" I 've been involved in this all along .
I put up with a lot of stuff I did n't like because I thought at the end of the day what was good about the bill outweighed what 's bad about the bill , " Dean said .
" I do n't believe that anymore . "
Several Democratic leaders who had been on the fence about the Senate health care bill expressed their support Tuesday after meeting with the president .
" I disagree with Howard Dean , " Sen . Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , said Tuesday in an interview with ABC News .
" Howard Dean is a medical doctor .
He has to know what it will mean when 30 million Americans are finally going to have health insurance , that peace of mind and protection for the first time in their lives .
For many of them , that is a dramatic step forward . "
Senate Democratic leaders argue that even without the option of expanding Medicare or providing government - run insurance to compete with the private sector , the bill will still cover millions of uninsured Americans and is worth passing .
" The president and vice president pointed out that you take your victories when you can and nothing prevents you from fighting on for the things you believe should have been achieved , " Sen .
Sheldon Whitehouse , D - R.I. , said Tuesday after the meeting at the White House .
" But why spurn a victory in hand ? "
Others say this health care bill will only be the start of more overhaul in the future .
" That old adage about ' Do n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good , ' I think that 's what we 're confronting here .
...
What we 're buying here ... is not a mansion .
We 're buying a modest home .
But it 's got a great foundation , " Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , said on MSNBC's " The Rachel Maddow Show " Tuesday .
" The key to this is that this modest home , we can put additions onto it in the future .
But if we do n't have the starter home , we 're never going to be able to put those additions on .
The time is now .
I plead with all of my progressive friends , now is the time to get over this hurdle . "
Obama Pushes Democrats on Health Care Bill
On Tuesday , following a meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House , Obama urged Democrats to find a consensus , saying the time for bickering is over .
" I am absolutely confident that if the American people know what 's in this bill , and the Senate knows what 's in this bill , it will pass , because it 's right for America , " the president said .
" We simply cannot allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the American people .
They are waiting for us to act . "
White House officials say Obama made the case to Democrats that this might be the last chance to make progress on health care overhaul before the 2010 elections , and before his political capital possibly diminishes later in his first term .
Abdallah Abu Rahmah , a leader of the weekly nonviolent protests in Bil’in , has finally been charged after being arrested nearly two weeks ago by the Israeli military .
Abu Rahmah ’s arrest has been part on an ongoing Israeli campaign against Palestinian nonviolent resistance leaders .
The charges against him could not be more creative .
From a Popular Struggle Coordination Committee press release :
Abdallah Abu Rahmah , a school teacher and coordinator of the Bil ’in Popular Committee Against the Wall , was indicted in an Israeli military court yesterday .
Abu Rahmah was slapped with an arms possession charge for collecting used tear gas canisters shot at demonstrators in Bil ’in by the army and showcasing them in his home .
An indictment was filed in a West Bank military court yesterday for incitement , stone throwing and arms possession charges against Bil ’in Popular Committee coordinator , Abdallah Abu Rahmah .
On receiving the indictment Adv. Gaby Lasky , Abu Rahmah ’s lawyer said that “ the army shoots at unarmed demonstrators , and when they try to show the world the violence used against them by collecting presenting the remnants – they are persecuted and prosecuted .
What ’s next ?
Charging protesters money for the bullets shot at them ? ”
Here is a photo of the " arms " in question :

In a thrilling development , we made a comic even though Wes was inducted into a dragon gang while Tony accidently ate his own hands .
The average American eats 17.6 pounds of turkey per year , more than double the figure for 1970 , according to the National Turkey Federation .
To feed the growing appetite , some 273 million turkeys will be raised in the United States in 2009 , and a good number of them will be consumed on Thanksgiving , after which many Americans will loll about , overstuffed , sleepy and in many cases intoxicated .
This is not what the Pilgrims had in mind .
The first Thanksgiving was a moment for the Pilgrims to thank God for allowing them to kill enough game and grow sufficient crops to get through the winter , says Anne Blue Wills , assistant professor of religion at Davidson College .
Those Pilgrims would have spent much of their day in church contemplating the mercies of God 's covenantal love , Wills argues .
Not until Sarah Hale , editor of Godey 's Lady 's Book and Magazine promoted for 50 years the idea of a regular Thanksgiving holiday did President Abraham Lincoln make it one in 1863 .
In the years since , the turkeys we eat have changed dramatically , and so has scientific knowledge of them .
Among the things you might not know :
1. Turkeys Can Fly
Wild turkeys feed on the ground , which might explain the myth of their flightlessness .
They can in fact soar for short bursts at up to 55 mph .
But their tendency to stay on or near the ground contributed to successful hunting that brought the wild population of turkeys down to about 30,000 in the 1930s .
There are now 7 million of them .
2. Dark Meat is Rare Because ...
Meat is muscle .
And muscle is fed by blood .
In the blood is myoglobin , which binds with oxygen and stores it in muscles for when it 's needed .
Myoglobin also makes meat dark .
Muscles that are used most , like those in drumsticks ( legs ) , have more myoglobin .
Domestic turkeys are too fat to fly , so they do n't use their breast muscles much , which is why breast meat is white .
The breast of a wild turkey is entirely different , darker ( and far tastier for those who are game ) .
3. Turkey Eggs Would n't Sell Chickens are champion egg- producers .
Turkeys , not so good .
Turkey eggs are bigger , so their nests tie up coop space .
And farmers have learned that they make more raising turkeys for meat rather than eggs .
Oh , and some turkeys are protective of their eggs , making the gathering more challenging .
4 . It 's Not the Turkey That Makes You Sleepy Turkey contains a natural chemical called tryptophan , which we need to build proteins for our bodies .
Indeed , tryptophan is also related to the production of serotonin , which helps us sleep .
But all meat has about the same amount of tryptophan .
Cheddar cheese has a lot more .
What really makes you sleepier after a Thanksgiving meal compared to other meals is eating too many carbohydrates , from potatoes to pies .
Alcohol can contribute , too .
5. Dinosaurs Had Wishbones , Too
The wishbone , called a furcula , is the fusion of two collarbones at the sternum .
It 's where a bird ’s flying muscles hook up .
It 's elastic and great for flapping .
Turns out T. Rex and the Velociraptor had wishbones , too .
While they did n't fly , this fairly recent discovery is one of the many bits of evidence that shows birds evolved from dinosaurs .
Sarah
Hale probably never thought about any of this back in the mid-1800s .
She just wanted the nation to celebrate a pious , patriotic holiday , said Wills , the Davidson College researcher .
Hale used columns and stories in her magazine to portray Thanksgiving as a triumph of domesticity and rural simplicity over urban sophistication .
She urged President Lincoln to create a single day on which all states would mark the holiday as a national event .
" The message is that the simple , pure , honest rural life , away from the temptations of the city , puts you in touch with true values , " Wills said .
" If we can just travel back to the old home place once a year we 'll be protected from temptations and evil . "
While some of that spirit might remain in the holiday , much indeed has changed about American culture in general and in how people view and partake in the holiday .
" For instance , " Wills said , " I do n't think football games and making the day after Thanksgiving the biggest shopping day of the year ever crossed her mind . "
Punctirus bracelet or necklace can never go unnoticed .

PRINCETON , NJ -- More Americans now say it is not the federal government 's responsibility to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage ( 50 % ) than say it is ( 47 % ) .
This is a first since Gallup began tracking this question , and a significant shift from as recently as three years ago , when two - thirds said ensuring healthcare coverage was the government 's responsibility .
Gallup has asked this question each November since 2001 as part of the Gallup Poll Social Series , and most recently in its Nov. 5 - 8 Health and Healthcare survey .
There have been some fluctuations from year to year , but this year marks the first time in the history of this trend that less than half of Americans say ensuring healthcare coverage for all is the federal government 's responsibility .
" Both Republicans and Democrats since 2006 have become less likely to choose the ' government responsibility ' option , though Democrats ' views have remained steady over the past year while Republicans ' support has declined further . "
The high point for the " government responsibility " viewpoint occurred in 2006 , when 69 % of Americans agreed .
In 2008 , this percentage fell to 54 % , its previous low reading .
This year , in the midst of robust debate on a potentially imminent healthcare reform law , the percentage of Americans agreeing that it is the government 's responsibility to make sure everyone has health insurance has fallen even further , by seven points , to 47 % .
Half of Americans now say this is not the government 's responsibility .
The reason behind this shift is unknown .
Certainly the federal government 's role in the nation 's healthcare system has been widely and vigorously debated over the last several months , including much focus on the " public option . "
These data suggest that one result of the debate has been a net decrease in Americans ' agreement that ensuring all Americans have healthcare coverage is an appropriate role for the federal government .
There are major differences in views on this issue by partisanship , as would be expected given the major partisan differences on most issues relating to the role of government in the U.S. today .
The views of Republicans and independents who lean Republican about the government 's healthcare role are almost a precise mirror image of the views of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic .
More than 7 out of 10 Republicans say it is not the responsibility of government to see that all Americans have healthcare coverage , while more than 7 out of 10 Democrats say it is .
A look at the trends on this question shows that both Republicans and Democrats since 2006 have become less likely to choose the " government responsibility " option , though Democrats ' views have remained steady over the past year while Republicans ' support has declined further .
The percentage of Republicans choosing the " government responsibility " option fell 20 percentage points between 2006 and the current survey , compared to a 13 - point drop among Democrats .
From a longer - range perspective , however , Democrats ' views today reflect essentially a return to the sentiment seen early in the decade , while Republicans now express significantly lower support .
Replace the Current System ?
A second question Gallup tracks each November asks Americans directly about " replacing the current healthcare system with a new government - run health care system . "
Throughout this decade , a plurality of Americans have consistently favored maintaining the current system , although support has fluctuated .
In November 2007 , the edge for the private system over the government - run system was just 7 points , vs. a 31 - point gap in 2004 .
The current 29 - point gap is thus at the high end of the historical range .
Almost 9 out of 10 Republicans and Republican leaners favor maintaining the current healthcare system based mostly on private health insurance .
Democrats and Democratic leaners favor the concept of replacing the current system with a government - run system , but Democratic opinion is less monolithic than Republican opinion ; more than a third of Democrats would favor maintaining the current system .
The alternatives outlined in this question are not directly a part of the current debate ; there has been no serious discussion on the part of those advocating healthcare reform of the possibility of dismantling the current system and turning it into one run completely by the government .
Still , the trend line gives a good perspective on the larger issue of shifting to a more European - style healthcare system , something that the majority of Americans at this point would clearly oppose .
Bottom Line
The wording of the healthcare bill the House passed last Saturday explicitly states that one of the bill 's purposes is to provide " affordable , quality healthcare for all Americans . "
The current poll results indicate that , with the renewed healthcare debate since President Obama took office , Americans have become less convinced that it is an appropriate goal for the federal government to take on the responsibility of ensuring that all Americans have healthcare coverage .
It is possible that the current debate has increased the average American 's awareness as to the nuances of the various roles the government could play in the healthcare system , helping make the generic " make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage " sound less appealing .
Plus , the current debate may have produced more skepticism among Americans that the government 's role in healthcare could or should be this broad .
Most polling shows that Americans tend to favor a " public option " in which the government would provide a healthcare plan that would not be mandatory but one of several options for those seeking healthcare insurance .
Americans apparently do not equate this with government 's guaranteeing that all Americans have healthcare coverage .
Finally , the current data confirm the basic premise that all in all , Americans do not support the idea of a government - run system as a full replacement for the current system based on private insurance .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,008 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Nov. 5 - 8 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
At first glance , there 's little to differentiate between the latest releases of the top Linux distributions : Red Hat 's Fedora 12 , Novell 's openSUSE 11.2 and Canonical 's Ubuntu 9.10 .
They each use the latest releases of open - source applications and are based on recent Linux kernels .
Each of the distros also includes open - source applications such as OpenOffice and Firefox .
However , a closer look reveals real differences -- in fact , each is meant for a different audience .
Underneath the hood , each of the three uses the 2.6.31 Linux kernel , but above that , their differences begin to surface .
Fedora and Ubuntu , for example , use GNOME 2.28 ( the latest version ) for their default desktop , while openSUSE uses KDE 4.3.1 .
How we tested
To put them through their paces , I installed each distribution natively on a Dell Inspiron 530S powered by a 2.2GHz Intel Pentium E2200 dual - core processor with an 800M Hz front - side bus .
The test machine had 4GB of RAM , a 500GB SATA drive and an integrated Intel 3100 GMA chipset .
I also ran the trio on an identical system with MEPIS Linux as the host operating system , in Sun 's VirtualBox 3.0.12 virtual machine .
Finally , I took turning running Fedora and openSUSE on my Lenovo ThinkPad R61 laptop and ran Ubuntu on my Dell Mini 9 netbook .
I had no trouble installing any of the distributions or updating them from release candidates to final versions .
In each case , all I had to do was to put in the CD , DVD or USB memory stick , boot the PC from the installation media and let the distros install themselves .
In the same way , none of them had any trouble at all with Gigabit Ethernet or 802.11g Wi -Fi hardware .
I was also able to easily log the systems into my hybrid Active Directory / Samba domain - based network .
This network is based on servers running Windows Server 2008 R2 , Windows Server 2003 , SUSE Linux 11 and CentOS 5.4 , a RHEL clone .
Even on this complex LAN , which also included NAS devices and several Canon and HP printers , each distribution ran flawlessly with the SMB ( Server Message Block ) and NFS ( Network File System ) servers .
In addition , I was able to manage each of them from other PCs with the OpenSSH remote control program .
Of course , which Linux distro you select depends on your own needs and preferences .
Hopefully , the three reviews that follow will help you make that choice .
In a move officials are saying is meant to coincide with its much more talked about Afghanistan escalation , the White House has reportedly approved an expansion of the CIA drone attacks against Northern Pakistan .
The expansion means an increase in attacks in North and South Waziristan , and officials hinted at the possibility of striking against Balochistan , a move often spoken of .
Pakistan has publicly objected to the Waziristan strikes , even while it has privately made deals with the US to cooperate in the strikes .
Attacking Balochistan , however , would be a game - changer , as the Pakistani government has vowed to stop such strikes .
The US has claimed that the Taliban leadership is in the Baloch capital of Quetta , while the Pakistani government says that there is no evidence the so - called Quetta Shura even exists .
Previously the US has suggested a ground invasion of the key city , but even drone strikes will be hugely controversial in a nation whose public has only reluctantly tolerated the Waziristan strikes .
Par temps de grand froid , l'AS Nancy - Lorraine ( L1 ) utilise jusqu'à 2 000 litres de fioul par jour pour éviter que la pelouse du stade Marcel - Picot ne gèle , l'amende en cas de match annulé au dernier moment pouvant atteindre 250 000 euros , a indiqué le club lundi 21 décembre .
La pelouse du club lorrain est ainsi bâchée et chauffée depuis le 12 décembre , et les quatre moteurs diffusant l'air chaud sous la bâche consomment environ 2 000 litres de fuel par jour , explique son directeur général , Nicolas Holveck .
S'il ne met pas tout en œuvre pour maintenir un terrain praticable et que la rencontre est annulée au dernier moment , le club risque de recevoir une amende de la Ligue de football de 40 000 euros , plus les frais de dédommagement de l'équipe adverse .
En cas de match télévisé , les frais peuvent s'élever à 250 000 euros , poursuit M. Holveck .
PELOUSE CHAUFFANTE À SOCHAUX
A Metz ( L2 ) , le stade Saint - Symphorien est bâché et chauffé depuis le 14 décembre afin d'être maintenu à 1,5 °C .
Avec les températures descendues à - 15 °C , 1 200 litres de fuel ( à 60 centimes le litre ) ont été utilisés pour le match prévu lundi soir , indique Jean - François Girard , responsable du stade .
Le match a finalement été reporté en raison des chutes de neige qui ont rendu le terrain impraticable .
" Cela peut paraître irraisonnable , mais si nous ne faisons pas tout pour conserver un terrain praticable , la ligue nous met une amende " de 30 000 euros , voire plus si le match devait être télévisé , les frais totaux pouvant grimper jusqu'à 50 000 euros en comptant le dédommagement à l'équipe adverse , souligne - t - il , précisant que la bâche coûte à elle seule 30 000 euros .
Sochaux ( L1 ) est le seul club français équipé d'une pelouse chauffante .
Près de 28 km de câbles en aluminium sont installés sous la pelouse du stade Bonal , chauffée dès que la température extérieure descend à 3 °C , expliquent les responsables .
Environ 60 000 euros d'électricité par an sont ainsi nécessaires , avec un investissement initial de 350 000 euros pour le câblage .

THE Parade is coming to town this next weekend .
Â Yes , the Santa Claus Parade through Toronto ’sÂ downtown streets . Â
It starts Sunday November 14th at 12:30 PM up at Christie and Bloor .
Mind – there are some changes to the route .
The swing down University now swerves East at Dundas and proceeds to Yonge where it goes down to Front as usual .
See the new route map here .
There is a pre-Parade Free Breakfast at Yonge Dundas Square where MacDonalds and Presidents Choice are treating from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM .
The parade will come by about 1:00 PM .
If you are a photographer and want to get some wonderful candids and people shots this is the place to be .

First there are lots of colorful floats and some great kids excitement to be found .
Â
My favorite is the marching bands and the all the cheerleaders and flagbearers creating great fun
Of course there are clowns and color blooms to add to the festivities :
But here is a hint forÂ people spotters – catch the start and end of the parade and the kids drawing with free chalk in the road waiting for the parade and Santa ’s arrival – great photo stuffings to be found at these spots and times .
Nearly 200 years after their invention , and decades after first being proposed as a method of harnessing solar energy , 60 sun-powered Stirling engines are about to begin generating electricity outside Phoenix , Ariz . , for the first time .
Such engines , which harness heat to expand a gas and drive pistons , are not used widely today other than in pacemakers and long - distance robotic spacecraft .
The 1.5 megawatt ( MW ) demonstration site , known as Maricopa Solar , is set to begin operations early January 2010 , with units provided by the Arizona - based Stirling Energy Systems ( SES ) .
While 1.5 MW is only a fraction of the power that may be generated at sites SES has contracted to develop in California and Texas , spokesperson Janette Coates says this is a necessary first step in the technology ’s commercialization .
“ It ’s important for our industry to see — and our partners and investors — that we can take a small - scale plant and get it operational before we break ground on larger ones , ” she says .
That 's because Stirling heat engines have a reputation for being a bit impractical .
First invented by Robert Stirling in 1816 , the engines use a heat source to warm gas , which expands and is pushed into another chamber .
When the gas cools and contracts , it flows back .
The expansion and contraction pushes a piston , which in turn produces electricity .
In 1996 , SES bought solar Stirling design and engineering patents from companies such as McDonnell - Douglas and Boeing .
SES then partnered with Sandia National Laboratories , and over the next decade tweaked and refined the technology .
In the SES SunCatcher , a circle of curved mirrors , resembling an upturned satellite dish , tracks the sun on two axes and reflects the sun ’s heat onto a single focus point , the power conversion unit ( PCU ) .
The PCU contains four cylinders , in which hydrogen gas expands and contracts to move pistons .
Stirling engines are significantly more efficient at converting sunlight into energy than most photovoltaic panels or concentrating solar power plants , whether parabolic trough or tower designs .
The test units have reached 31 percent efficiency , compared to 16 percent for parabolic troughs and about 14 - 18 percent for PV panels in use today ( though newer designs not yet on the market range from 24 to as high as 41 percent ) .
The high efficiency numbers alone , however , have not made Stirling an easy sell .
The systems have been criticized as being too expensive , unreliable and requiring extensive maintenance thanks to many moving parts .
Also , ground has not yet been broken on either California site for which SES signed purchase power agreements in 2005 , adding to skepticism that these systems will ever become commercially viable .
“ At these high temperatures , with this many moving parts , people doubted whether SES could really pull it off , ” says Reese Tisdale , research director for solar power at Cambridge , Mass . - based Emerging Energy Research .
The relatively small Arizona plant is intended to allay those concerns .
Proponents of the technology point to the advantages it has over other forms of solar power , particularly concentrating solar power ( CSP ) , which also captures the sun ’s heat .
Most CSP systems require significant amounts of water , which has proven to be a challenge in desert regions of the U.S. where solar power is most attractive , while Stirling engines require none other than small amounts for cleaning the mirrors .
In addition , if one engine goes down , it has minimal impact on overall production .
SES faced a manufacturing challenge in preparing its SunCatchers for mass production though .
“ The systems at Sandia were basically hand - built , ” says Charles Andraka , a Sandia engineer and Stirling expert who worked with SES on the system ’s design .
For the Phoenix site , he notes , Sandia and SES engineers built 60 units in three months .
“ We have to do that many in a day for the larger plants . ”
In order to do this , SES turned to the experts in rapid production of engines and related parts : the automotive industry .
In partnership with automotive companies such as Tower Automotive and Linamar Corporation , SES managed to reduce the parts in the PCU by 60 percent ( to about 650 ) and slash the weight of the entire system by roughly 2,250 kilograms .
Andraka highlights one example of the upgrade : in the original engines , he points out , gas passed over the outside of the engine , with pieces of tubes and fittings at either end , requiring a total of approximately 20 parts .
“ On the new engine , the gas passage is a part of the block with no external parts .
It ’s much more reliable , much cheaper to assemble , with fewer parts and fewer places to leak , ” Andraka says .
The new systems have been running on test sites for more than 100,000 hours .
Maricopa Solar also represents just one scalable module ; each multi-megawatt field will be grouped first in 60 - engine units that come together to generate 1.5 MW , then those larger units are linked to each other to produce up to 9 MW .
Explains Coates , “ With the large 750 MW commissions , we wo n’t have to wait until we have 750 MW of dishes before we start producing power .
This means that the utility can get the power prior to the full build - out , which can take years to complete . ”
This is in comparison to parabolic trough or tower CSP technology , which does n’t generate electricity until the entire system is complete .
Meanwhile , Tessera Solar , SES ’s sister company in charge of development , is renegotiating contracts with utilities in California but expects to supply power at or below the cost of other solar technologies , and they plan to break ground on bigger solar Stirling engine power plants in Texas and California in 2010 .
Tisdale says he remains somewhat skeptical , but also optimistic : “ This 1.5 MW site is key to demonstrating that it works . ”
The morale of our American troops is at an all - time low .
For years , we 've been involved in two wars ; one in a country that no one has conquered since war was invented , and one in a country where no one has gotten along since people were invented .
And the troops know they 're stuck there .
Their Commander - in - Chief moves slower than two Twilight vampires in a singles chat room .
If Obama started stopping a war tomorrow , he might manage to pull the troops out before they 're replaced with the steam - men our feral grandchildren will build .
I do n't know about you , but if I was fighting in a shitty war , I sure would feel better if someone put together the Craked.com in Association with Captain Freedom and Presented by Me For - The - Troops YouTube Classic Theater .
Wait a minute : holy shit :
You can learn a lot from YouTube .
For example , I learned that when our God was giving the Iraqi people hand - eye- coordination , he took inspiration from three cats tied to a vacuum cleaner .
I 've never meant this more : " Nice jumping jacks , assholes ! "
So now that you and the troops have had a nice laugh at the expense of others , let 's move on to change absolutely nothing .
Below is more laughter at the expense of others .
We 're Americans , not some kind of changey homunists .
If we change anything , it 's going to be the gravy in the center of our hot dogs and the medical duration of our erections .
Put that in your turban and smoke it , Iraq .
While you 've been over there getting occupied and learning how to move your arms and legs at the same time , we 've been hard this whole time .
Name : Flap Birdo , International Superstar of Failure Real Name : Furthest Guy on the Right Technique : Flap knows that this " jumping jack " the American troops speak of has something to do with jumping .
His brain relays this message to his limbs , and each of them violently interprets it differently .
If I was an anthropologist , I 'd say he was panicking and that this was an ancient biological defense to dismember yourself and explode your body on your enemy as a final revenge .
But since I 'm not an anthropologist , I 'll say that this guy is so uncoordinated that he can't piss his pants without a funnel .
Name : Clappy " The Seal " Ahmdghudj Real Name : Second Guy from the Right Technique : " The Seal " saw that clapping was involved in this exercise .
But he did n't have a word for it .
In a country whose leading cultural export is mustard gas and lamb sex , there 's not a lot of opportunities for clapping .
If someone died every time an Iraqi person applauded , it would kill fewer people than vitamins .
" The Seal " is really making up for lost time , though .
He 's clapping in front of his chest , over his head ... where has this clapping been his whole life !?
It 's like someone taught a monkey where its genitals were , but without all the elegance .
Name : Princess Ballet Real Name : The Third One from the Right Technique : Forming a circle with his arms and clumsily plie'ing , Princess Ballet creates a beautiful song about his body 's inability to do the simplest of tasks .
This is so far from a jumping jack that if you told me this was a robot trying to make ice cream inside itself , I 'd thank you for making sense of it .
And then we'd kill it together , as ice cream - filled friends .
Wait , now that I think about it , all these guys look like malfunctioning robots .
Are they working out on an Iraqi Showtime Pizza burial ground ?
Name : Rocket Virginbuster Real Name :
That is his real name .
Technique :
When a white guy does a jumping jack , he 's all , " I 'm effectively doing a jumping jack . "
When an Iraqi does a jumping jack , he 's like , " I 'm an idiot , motherfucker ! "
Name : Chuck Chasewagon Real Name : Parts Unknown Technique : Whenever an Iraqi is asked to perform a physical action , they respond with a flipper - handed seizure .
And under Iraqi law -- or as we know it " Thunderdome " - - it 's legal for every household to own an assault rifle .
Those two things do n't go together .
They have to have 50 goats in the house just to soak up all the accidental bullets .
Growing up in Iraq is like growing up as a stop sign in Arkansas .
When the Iraqi family gets together for dinner , they do n't talk about how your day was .
They talk about which one of those bullet wounds is fresh , because we just had these carpets painted !
You 're the reason we can't have nice things , like this VCD copy of HÇtch , the Turkish remake of Hitch featuring Miami Vice and Han Solo .
Name : Tap Razzmatazz Real Name : Sixth Fellow from the Right Technique : Remember that episode of the Cosby Show where Bill Cosby is challenged to tapdance ?
Well , that previous sentence is exactly what " jumping jack " translates to in Arabic .
Name : Swandive Real Name : Saul Swandivenstein
Technique :
While every other Iraqi guy is throwing themselves into the air like retarded human popcorn , Swandive carefully puts his hands together and slides them straight up .
It 's just as wrong , but with less effort .
This guy sucks so hard at jumping jacks that when he 's done with his workout , he has an egg , three gallons of milk and semen in his stomach .
Name : Impossible Achmed Real Name : Eighth from the Right Technique : This Iraqi was doing nearly perfect jumping jacks , which any scientist will tell you must be a hallucination .
It 's so impossible that when most people watch it , a portal opens next to them and a future version of themselves screams , " I 'm too late ! "
Let 's look at the facts : Being Iraqi and doing a jumping jack is like being American and transforming into a dinosaur boat .
The fact that he can do this does nothing less than prove genies .
We now know that magical men live in lamps and can grant wishes .
And if anyone ever manages to produce a more reasonable theory , do n't trust that guy .
He clearly has a fucking genie .
Name : Scimitar Napmaster Real Name : Ninth from the Right Technique : When Napmaster realizes that he 's doing something wrong , he gently keeps his feet planted and makes rings with his arms .
I 've gotten better workouts waving goodbye to the pizza delivery man .
If this is the Iraqi idea of physical fitness , is it any wonder that these guys ' heads pop off when you hang them ?
Slam !
Oh my god , if Saddam still had a head , that burn would have backdrafted his whole face off !
Note : Much like the people who start these wars , you never know how much you should believe YouTube .
We 'll let historians work out whether or not this too - insane - to - be - real video is actually too insane to be real .
Because even if the world was tricked by an elaborate jumping jack hoax , the people who managed to convince a platoon of soldiers to line up and do jumping jacks wrong still deserve the Silver Star of Morale Soaring Hilarity .
If anyone has any proof that this video was created by professional military jumping jack impersonators , here 's what you do : keep it to yourself and hold this can of peanuts .
The last thing our troops need right now is to find out the Internet was lying from some butthole holding a can of snakes .
That 's right , you 're not as hard to trick as you thought , butthole .

India has the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world
Millions of Indian mobile phones with no valid unique identification code have been blocked for security reasons .
The International Mobile Equipment Identity ( IMEI ) number is a 15 - digit code which appears on the operator 's network whenever a call is made .
The absence of this number makes it impossible to trace either the caller or the phone or to access call details .
Indian intelligence agencies say phones without the code have been used in attacks by militant groups .
Mobile phones without the code were blocked at midnight - operators were asked to bar calls to them " in the wake of increased threat perception from militants " .
Cheap
It is estimated that India has more than 25 million phones without codes .
Phones with no codes or invalid numbers are mostly cheap , unbranded phones .
Millions are manufactured in India or imported , mostly from China .
Correspondents say these phones are popular because they are usually much cheaper than the branded ones .
Many phone subscribers said they were being wrongly penalised because they were not aware that every handset had to have a code .
The Cellular Operators ' Association of India has asked the government to extend the deadline for blocking the numbers so that it can install identity numbers on unbranded devices .
According to estimates by the Indian Cellular Association , unbranded phones account for nearly 30 % of all sales in India .
India has the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world , with more than 488 million subscribers .
Every month millions of new subscribers are added to the list .
I 'm finally back in Davis , but unfortunately one of the first things I did once I got here was come down with a miserable head cold .
I therefore took the opportunity to play with my Arduino micro-controller , which I have n't really gotten a big chance to mess around with for a while .
For those who do n't know , an Arduino is a very small computer , except it 's designed to be hooked up to other basic electronics , i.e. LEDs and switches , instead of computer monitors and keyboards ( which are actually possible ) .
Last year I went down to Halted , and splurged on a 16x2 alphanumeric liquid crystal display for it , so I can quite easily display text on it , at the cost of 6 of the 14 I /O pins .
HD44780 based screens , like mine , have a pretty complete character set ( page 17 - 18 ) .
On the off chance you need a few more specific characters that they do n't happen to have , they have the ability for you to program 8 custom characters , simply by feeding it the 5x8 bitmap of the character .
This is useful for when you want something iconic like a smiley face , but others have gotten more creative by using them to make bar graphs , etc , since you can program anything you want into it .
The idea came to me : with 8 custom characters , you could essentially make a 20x16 matrix display , which would be perfect for the Game of Life .
100 lines of C code later , I had a working Life engine .
Another 60 to add extra features like checking for when it's in a steady state , and this is what I end up with : How I store the world is n't especially elegant .
I use an entire byte for each grid , where I really only need two bits for the basic engine ( current state and the state for the next step ) .
I thought about doing all the crazy bit packing needed to access each individual bit , but decided against it .
Instead , I stored the current state as a 1 , then as I calculated the state for the next step , stored it as a 2 .
Once I finished working through the whole world , divide everything by 2 , and all you have left is the next steps state .
That 's 320 bytes , for those of you counting at home .
I then ran into the problem that , eventually , the world is going to end up being a lot of steady state blocks , or oscillators , which posed a problem .
If I was only worried about it being frozen , I could just keep track to see if anything changed while calculating the next step , and set a flag , but the oscillators will change , rather uninterestingly , every step .
According to Wikipedia , the oscillators can have a period of up to 30 , but I figured the only ones I was really worried about were 2 and 3 , since anything more than that was unlikely on such a small world , and probably pretty cool anyways .
To deal with this issue , every 6 steps I save a copy of the world and compare it to the world from 6 ticks ago .
Now if the only thing left is oscillators , they will end up in the same state 6 steps later , and the engine will catch it and reset the world .
That is another 320 bytes , which is 8 times what I really need , and now means I 'm using 640 bytes of only 1 k of RAM just to store the world .
Not great , but since that 's all I 'm doing , it 's ok , right ?
Calculating each step only takes a few milliseconds , so I have a 300 ms delay on the end of each tick , so it could be run quite a bit faster .
For those who are interested in seeing the code for it , here it is :

Few things are more discouraging than working really hard to accomplish a goal , but feeling absolutely no progress .
There is no better way to say it than the overused cliché ‘ you are ‘ spinning your tires ’ .
Thus enters the power of focus .
Financially , many of us are no more focused than the average horse .
The horse looks all over the place , wanders here and there , and walks wherever he pleases .
Hence the need for blinders .
Blinders force the horse to focus only on the object directly in front of the animal .
Many of our finances are simply a collection of good ideas and good advice .
We are so lightly invested in so many different things that ultimately we are failing at all of them .
We might have a little life insurance because someone said we should .
The kids are getting some money for an allowance because that is supposed to teach them financial responsibility .
The pastor said you should be giving , so you do .
Retirement is important so you allocate some dollars into a Roth IRA and then a few into a 401 K because you never completely could decide which was better .
You give nice gifts because that is what a good human should do .
You make your minimum payments on your credit cards .
Write a check for your house .
And well , by the middle of the month , you have a little of a lot of good things that , as a result , are just a little of nothing .
Focus is the solution .
Choose only one financial task and invest all your resources into that task .
For example , if you are in debt make sure you are minimally covered on essentials and drop everything else .
Like a military commander , you are going to call some troops away from a job over there and reassign them over here .
Reassign every extra dollar towards debt repayment .
This means to drop your retirement savings for a time while you focus on becoming debt free .
Moreover , choose one debt ( i.e. one credit card ) that will receive all of your focus .
Why does focus make a powerful difference in our finances ?
Focus leads to results .
Results lead to motivation .
Motivation leads to more focus .
Once you have discovered and learned how to leverage the power of focus the effects are far reaching .
Six questions to help you decide where you should focus your time and energy :
What is the most emotionally burdensome thing to you ?
Are you up late at night because a specific credit card company keeps calling ?
Start with whatever would make you feel most liberated .
What item carries the most cost ?
You might have a high interest credit card and it really bothers you paying so much in fees .
Make that your priority .
What is the most immediate need ?
Do you really feel like you need a little cash for breathing room ?
Do you have a vehicle about to be repossessed ?
Focus on the time sensitive tasks .
What do ‘ experts ’ advise ?
You could be struggling to know where to start .
Just get on the Dave Ramsey Baby Step plan and Ramsey will lay out the seven steps for you .
Just find out where you are and start .
What are those around you saying ?
Friends might be mentioning that you really need to get your car or credit cards paid off .
They might be concerned that you are not saving for retirement .
While their advice is not definitive , if enough people comment on the same factor it might just be worth your consideration .
What frees up the most money ?
If you have a truck payment that is completely out of line , focus there ( focus might be focus on selling the car ) because once that problem is resolved you will have ample resources to attack all the smaller issues .
While these factors might lead you to think a couple of places are a good place to start , resist the urge to do more than one thing at once .
Focus only on one item and you will see the most results .
Why do you think financial focus is hard for many of us ?
How do you decide where you should focus your energy ?

John Carmack is the programming wiz at id Software , the Mesquite , Texas - based company that pioneered the first - person shooter game genre that has generated billions of dollars in the game industry since 1993 .
Now Carmack has returned to the game that started it all : Doom .
He has taken the original game and ported the code to run on the iPhone , his favorite new game platform .
Although he is working on big console and PC game projects for id ( and its new owner ZeniMax ) such as Doom 4 and Rage , Carmack stole time to create the iPhone game , Doom Classic .
With 36 levels , this shooting game is a repeat of the original title where you play a space marine who has to wade knee deep in the dead and hold off an onslaught of demons after a mining colony on Mars accidentally opens a portal into Hell .
Doom Classic is now available on the iPhone .
Here ’s our interview with Carmack about how he made it .
VB : Can you tell us how you got Doom Classic onto the iPhone ?
JC : This is one of those cases where I ’m loving the iPhone work with the classic games because it gives me some real solid ammunition for the first time on the tangible benefits of what we as a company get from having released the source code for our games all those years ago .
I have always had to make the argument that we get good will and there are intangible benefits .
With both Wolfenstein 3D Classic and Doom Classic for the iPhone , instead of going to find the original source code , resurrect it , and make it compile on an auto compiler , I was able to start with this well maintained cross - platform source code base that people have been improving for years .
It did not take me long at all to take the work I had done with Wolfenstein 3D Classic and the open - source Doom code that I started with and get the game up and running on the iPhone in less than a week .
The remaining work on it was about trying to polish the interface in terms of making the controls as responsive as I could get them on the iPhone , improving the performance and working on the networking .
VB : How long did it take , and how many people worked on it ?
JC : It was just me doing the code , and I Shanghaied one of the artists to do icons and things like that .
The development all told is hard to estimate .
I jumped around doing other things .
It was maybe six weeks of serious work .
The reason it took so long was because we tried to be good businesspeople and worked around other release dates .
I kind of wish we had n’t .
I thought if we rushed it out after two months of Wolfenstein 3D Classic sales on the iPhone , then that might have been a better release time .
But the scheduling just was n’t right for me to put the last couple of days into it .
It was only last month where we said we had to get it done and I spent two more days on it and then submitted it to Apple .
VB : Did you take any lessons from your earlier iPhone games like Doom Resurrection and apply it to this ?
JC : There were certainly technical details like running in multiple threads .
I got more skilled on the platform itself .
We went back and forth on the music on Wolfenstein 3D Classic and Doom Classic .
We wound up sharing some code back and forth on that .
Most of the technical work was learning how the iPhone plays out relative to the underlying hardware .
What are the system software and hardware issues ?
It ’s a continuous process of experimenting with user - interface design .
I started with the Wolfenstein 3D Classic interface but there are a few new wrinkles .
I made positive steps , but a lot of people played Wolfenstein 3D Classic on the iPhone .
So any changes I made to the interface really ticked some people off .
If you spent 10 hours playing Wolfenstein 3D Classic , any change in the interface means it wo n’t feel right to you .
So I regret I did n’t have the exact same interface .
VB : Is the interface different from Doom Resurrection ?
JC : It ’s completely different .
Doom Resurrection pulls the user through the world and you just aim at targets .
It ’s on rails .
Doom Classic is much more like Wolfenstein 3D Classic , a shooter with free form movement .
You move around , turn , change weapons and shoot .
VB : How does it work on the older iPhone and the newer iPhone 3GS model ?
JC : It works fine on the older iPhone .
The biggest performance glitch you have on this game is that the Apple system software handles multitouch really really poorly .
Apple is aware of this now .
The 3.1 iPhone system software made some improvements on it .
But fully a third of the CPU time can be sucked up by the multitouch when you have two thumbs on the screen .
It ’s appallingly bad .
They are making some steps to address that .
A large chunk of the processing is completely out of my hands .
A later release — I ’m not sure when Apple has it scheduled — will have a direct , low - level interface into the touchscreen .
That will make all of that wasted processing vanish .
The bottom line is , the game plays great on every iPod Touch and iPhone ever made .
VB : Does it have better performance on the iPhone 3GS ?
JC : No .
There is no win on that .
The other phones can still play the game at 30 frames per second .
You never drop a frame on a 3GS .
But there are no extra features .
I am excited about doing a tech demo for the 3GS .
I believe I can actually retarget some of the mega - texture content creation stuff that we are creating for the big id tech 5 games .
I do n’t know if I want to make a game out of it or if I want to throw it out there and say , gee , look at this .
I am excited about playing with that technology when I get time on my hands .
VB : If you target the iPhone 3GS as a base platform , you could probably do something interesting .
JC : I think we could do the real Xbox Doom 3 game on a 3GS if we targeted it exclusively .
That is pushing it a bit .
You could probably get that kind of visual fidelity .
VB : That ’s starting to get exciting , graphically .
JC : Yeah , very much so .
VB : How well have some of these games sold and , considering the time you put into them , is the trade - off pretty good and does it pay off ?
JC : The classic games , where I do n’t spend much time , are very lucrative .
We have been very happy with Wolfenstein 3D Classic sales .
Doom Resurrection was an experiment .
It was the very first game that id Software funded completely out of pocket .
We have always instead made publishers cough up money with a guarantee .
We were doing it ourselves .
We took money from our bank account and paid an outside development company .
That was a bit of a gamble .
It was before we saw the sales results from Wolfenstein 3D Classic .
But it did earn out completely and had hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit and it is still earning revenue .
We expect Doom Classic to be the biggest seller out of all of them .
It ’s the biggest intellectual property and has the biggest nostalgia factor .
We have made more money in the traditional cell phone market , the Java / Brew market , where we have sold a few million units .
But developing on those is so much less fun .
You have to cram everything into these ridiculously small memory limits and worry about compatibility across 300 handsets .
We are in the process of winding down our traditional cell phone development in favor of iPhone development .
VB : How do you feel about the iPhone platform now ?
JC : There are definitely a set of system software things that should improve like multitouch handling .
That ’s at the top of the list .
There are issues with Bluetooth support .
One of the spectacular things is that Graeme Divine , who used to work for me at id , is now at Apple in their software division .
I have a great man on the inside helping me get questions answered and things accomplished .
It will be very good for the evolution of the platform going forward .
VB : It sounds like Apple has really stepped up the game developer support ?
JC : Yes , they have .
Our relationship with Apple is kind of a rollercoaster .
We are very tight for periods .
Then I say something negative in a press interview and then the word goes out that no one is supposed to speak to me for six months or something .
But the iPhone relationship has been pretty good .
They have hired some good people to support game development explicitly .
They are doing a better job at that than they ever did on the Mac platform .
VB : They have had some new things like the free - to - play virtual goods model .
Does that interest you ?
JC : Every product we are doing is an experiment .
We did a free version that did n’t make any difference on Wolfenstein 3D Classic sales .
We originally wrote the setup for the in - app commerce but just made it a free update .
We are still feeling our way around on business models here .
Our current plan of record is to make discreet , separate apps with different price points .
Probably we will have in - app commerce .
We are not final on any of that .
That is subject to change on a whim .
VB : Apple said there are 100,000 apps today .
Others have had the problem of not getting noticed and not selling for a long period in the top ranks .
You seem to have less problem getting noticed .
You have brand recognition .
JC : There is no doubt that having a PR team and recognizable intellectual property helps .
But the iPhone is still a vastly superior platform for an unknown developer to break into than anywhere else .
If you look at the top 50 games , there are lots of quirky little games that do n’t have a major publisher behind them .
And they ’re doing great .
It ’s still a great platform for a few guys in a garage to make something for .
VB : Some developers try to increase loyalty by creating social networks around their games .
JC : Those are excellent moves on their part .
But it does n’t really fit with the older catalog titles that we are doing now .
I did spend time with our Quake Live team at id to figure out what experience we had with back - room infrastructure for Quake Live that we could apply to mobile titles .
We did n’t really come to a conclusion .
I hope to have one iPhone release a quarter , a combination of new titles and older titles .
There are so many things I ’d like to explore .
We do n’t have the time or resources to pursue all of them .
VB : So this Doom Classic game is a longer title ?
JC : Yes , it ’s longer .
It has the original Doom with three episodes and a fourth episode created later .
It is 36 levels .
We have a total of 110 commercial Doom levels if we count Final Doom and all of the others .
I ’m not sure yet what I am going to do with all of those .
We might stream them out an episode at a time .
We might do a super edition with everything .
We might try downloadable content .
We have n’t reached a firm direction on that .
VB : That answers some of the criticism that Doom Resurrection was too short .
Do you find people have an appetite for longer games on the iPhone ?
JC : We intentionally did not try to make Doom Resurrection very long .
It was fairly expensive as a development .
I would n’t be shocked if it was at that point the most expensive development cost for an iPhone game .
It cost quite a bit of money to develop .
It was an experiment to go out at $ 9.99 .
If iPhone games are going to approach the quality of console games , they will have to support higher price points .
But the market is n’t accepting that now .
I do n’t think we will have another $ 9.99 release in the coming year .
That influences what we can do .
VB : Is piracy a concern on the iPhone ?
JC : It could be I am reading the market wrong .
But it is not a concern to us .
At this point , we consider it to be like console game piracy , which is small .
Only fringe hackers will pirate games and go to the trouble , compared to the casual piracy on the PC which is rampant .
VB : So it sounds like you are having a lot of fun on the iPhone .
JC : I am having a lot of fun with the iPhone and I am sad I wo n’t spend much time on it for a couple of months at least .
We have major curnches coming up on Rage and Doom 4 .
But I am going to come back to it sometime next year .
Cuando Esmeralda , de 15 años , no regresó a su casa el 29 de octubre de 2001 después de trabajar haciendo la limpieza en una casa de Ciudad Juárez , su madre , Irma Monreal , fue a la policía para pedir ayuda y le dijeron : “ estará con el novio ” .
Una semana después fueron encontrados ocho cuerpos de mujeres asesinadas con claras señas de tortura sexual , entre ellos el de Esmeralda .
Desde entonces no se ha detenido a ningún responsable de los crímenes ni ha habido reparación de daños .
El caso “ campo algodonero ” , se ha convertido en símbolo de la violencia de género en la ciudad fronteriza en el estado de Chihuahua , en el norte de México , en donde desde 1993 han sido asesinadas más de 400 mujeres y niñas y más de 1.000 siguen desaparecidas .
Cruces a la vera del camino recuerdan asesinatos de mujeres en Lomas de Poleo , cerca de Ciudad Juárez , México .
“ Esa pretendida superioridad masculina en relación con a las mujeres es el origen del problema y se traduce en muchas formas de discriminación ; en los casos más extremos se convierten en agresión física y asesinato , que no afecta de manera exclusiva a México o América Central , pero se destaca en esa región por su magnitud y complejidad ” , resume el eurodiputado español Raúl Romeva i Rueda .
Por iniciativa suya , el Parlamento Europeo ( PE ) aprobó por mayoría una resolución que condenó los feminicidios en México y Centroamérica en el 2007 y definió el papel de la Unión Europea en la lucha contra este problema .
Inminente un fallo histórico
El día Mundial contra la Violencia de Género , este 25 de noviembre , coincide con el inminente fallo de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ( CIDH ) en el procedimiento contra el Estado mexicano por su negligencia en las investigaciones de tres mujeres asesinadas en la zona conocida como “ campo algodonero ” , un proceso que cuando comenzó el pasado 27 de abril recibió el beneplácito de la presidencia de la Unión Europea , que lo calificó como un hito importante en la lucha contra toda forma de violencia contra la mujer , por ser la primera vez que se analizan los asesinatos de mujeres en Ciudad Juárez .
“ Hay una falta de voluntad política para entender que éste es un tema de primer orden , las iniciativas en México para combatir el problema se han reducido y silenciándolo es imposible que se resuelva ” , advierte Romeva , que considera una mala señal la designación de Arturo Chávez Chávez como titular de la Procuraduría General de la República ( PGR ) .
Diversas organizaciones civiles acusan al funcionario de haber bloqueado las investigaciones sobre personas desaparecidas en Ciudad Juárez y destacan que durante su gestión como subprocurador de Justicia en el estado de Chihuahua , aumentaron los feminicidios y la impunidad .
“ La designación de una persona insensible al tema de la violencia contra las mujeres , denota que aquellos brotes de esperanza que surgieron hace dos años se han evaporado ” , dice el eurodiputado de Los Verdes de Cataluña .
Con el objetivo de hacer un balance sobre la situación de cara a la próxima cumbre de la Unión Europea y América Latina en mayo de 2010 en Madrid , Romeva convocó a la segunda Conferencia sobre Feminicidio “ ¡ Ni una muerta más ! ” , a la que acudieron representantes de la Comisión de derechos de la mujer del PE , Amnistía Internacional y la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos , así como expertas y activistas de distintas organizaciones de Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador y México .
La violencia de género ha aumentado
“ Hay un incremento en la violencia sexual contra las mujeres y contra defensoras de los derechos humanos como resultado de la militarización que el Estado mexicano está promoviendo en distintas partes del país en la lucha contra el narcotráfico , lo que indica que el Estado simula que hace algo para recibir recursos de la UE , pero en realidad no hay la voluntad de combatir el problema de violencia de género de manera efectiva ” , dice Andrea Medina Rosas , representante del Comité Latinoamericano y del Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer ( CLADEM ) .
La abogada exhorta a la Unión Europea a que revise la efectividad de las políticas que apoya con recursos .
México cuenta con un Tratado de Libre Comercio y una Asociación Estratégica con la Unión Europea , y esta previsto que el bloque destine al país 55 millones de euros durante el período 2007 - 2013 para fortalecer la cooperación .
“ Priman completamente los intereses comerciales sobre cualquier tipo de cuestión que tenga que ver con los derechos humanos ” , dice por su parte Daniel Tapia , de la Organización Ecuménica para la Paz y la Equidad con sede en Múnich , que desde el 2005 busca sensibilizar a la población alemana ante la impunidad y los feminicidios en México y Centroamérica .
El caso de Honduras , país que vive una crisis política desde el golpe de Estado el pasado 28 de junio , puso en manifiesto que la ruptura del orden constitucional ha dejado a las mujeres en una situación de total vulnerabilidad .
Honduras , junto con Guatemala y El Salvador , es calificado por expertos como “ el triángulo de la violencia en Centroamérica ” .
“ Hemos tenido unas 400 denuncias de violencia brutal por parte de la policía contra mujeres participantes en marchas de protesta contra el golpe de Estado .
Hay siete violaciones perpetradas por varios policías y la agresión sexualizada ha recrudecido ” , dice Mirta Kennedy , directora del Centro de Estudios de la Mujer Honduras CEMH .
“ Dos mujeres murieron a raíz de los gases lanzados por las fuerzas de seguridad en las marchas , una situación que agudiza la situación en un país que acumula unos 1.000 feminicidios y un total de 12 muertes violentas diarias ” , subraya Kennedy .
La resolución del Parlamento Europeo recomendó una serie de medidas para combatir el problema , entre ellas políticas públicas de promoción de la igualdad de género , investigación forense y reforma de los sistemas de Justicia , que arrojan pocos resultados .
Romeva concluye que el momento es muy delicado y es necesario llamar la atención sobre un problema que no está resuelto .

Two key senators criticized the most recent healthcare compromise Sunday , saying the policies replacing the public option are still unacceptable .
Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) both said a Medicare " buy - in " option for those aged 55 - 64 was a deal breaker .
ADVERTISEMENT
" I 'm concerned that it 's the forerunner of single payer , the ultimate single - payer plan , maybe even more directly than the public option , " Nelson said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . " Lieberman said Democrats should stop looking for a public option " compromise " and simply scrap the idea altogether .
" You 've got to take out the Medicare buy - in .
You 've got to forget about the public option , " he said .
If Democrats stick to relying primarily on the bill 's subsidies , the legislation would pass easily and with bipartisan support , Lieberman argued .
Nelson 's comments are somewhat surprising , considering he was one of the 10 Democrats tasked with putting together the compromise .
He said this morning that he participated simply " to be a friend of the process . " " What we 've put together is something to get scored , " he said .
Most Democrats still do n't know what exactly the compromise entails .
Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) has sent the bill to the Congressional Budget Office but will not release the details until a score is final .
Lieberman said this morning that Reid fears the new compromise proposals would " get mauled " if they 're released without a score to back them up .
Indeed , another senate centrist said this morning that her vote would be decided by the results of the CBO score .
Speaking on " Fox News Sunday , " Sen . ( D - Mo. ) said she would not vote for any bill that does n't reduce the deficit and bring down healthcare costs .
If those two criteria are n't met , " we 'll have to go back to the drawing board , " she said .
Meanwhile , Sen. ( D- W.Va. ) remained optimistic , arguing that as a final vote nears senators will come around .
"
The closer you get , the more you have to look at the whole bill , and you say , ' I have to do this for the nation , ' " he said .
Russian communists stand in line in Red square to attend a wreath laying ceremony at the tomb of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin marking the 130th anniversary of his birthday at the Kremlin wall in Moscow , December 21 , 2009 .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) -
The grandson of Josef Stalin is suing the radio station Ekho Moskvy , it said on Saturday , in a second attempt to stem media criticism of the leader whom many Russians still revere for victory in World War Two .
Yevgeny Dzhugashvili is seeking 10 million roubles ’ ( $ 326,900 ) compensation and an apology from Ekho Moskvy over comments made by presenter Matvey Ganapolsky on a program in October , who said :
“ Stalin signed an order that children can be shot from the age of 12 as enemies of the nation .
Which of the bastards dares say a single word in his defense ? ”
Ekho Moskvy said it had been notified of the lawsuit .
Earlier this year a Russian court threw out a similar case by Dzhugashvili against Novaya Gazeta newspaper which said Stalin had personally ordered the killings of thousands of Soviet citizens .
Historians said at the time the court ’s decision was a victory in Russia where they say there is a creeping attempt to paint a more benevolent picture of the Soviet Union ’s most feared leader , under whose rule millions perished .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin weighed into the fierce national debate on Stalin ’s legacy this month , praising him for industrializing the Soviet Union and winning World War Two , but condemning his repression .
Some 37 percent of Russians look on Stalin with respect , sympathy or even admiration , according to a WCIOM poll published this week .
Roughly a quarter of the population dislikes , fears or hates him and the rest are indifferent .
Abstract
This paper describes a storage management system that is flexible and efficient .
The representation of run-time tags yields fast allocation , type testing , and field extraction , and the memory model reduces virtual memory paging during garbage collection .
The storage management system coexists gracefully with other languages ' run-time systems , facilitating the use of multiple languages within a single program .
No special support from the operating system or virtual memory manager is required beyond the ability to obtain additional memory on demand .
The system incorporates a generational garbage collector with a tunable number of dynamically - resizable generations .
The collector handles large objects efficiently , supports collection of incrementally - compiled code , supports weak pairs , and allows stacks to contain nonpointer data .
The system 's hybrid type representation employs typed pointers and typed objects for tagging individual objects , and BIBOP typing for classifying objects accordi ...
Well , my friends , the day has arrived .
For thirteen weeks , you have been provided all the conceptual tools to take the leap into the deep end of the functional programming pool and float safely .
The great Dr. Erik Meijer has generously given his value time to teach us the fundamentals as delivered by Graham Hutton in his book
Programming in Haskell .
Of course , Erik merged his own extensive knowledge , unique perspective and experience into the educational weave : so , you got the best of two worlds .
We hope you enjoyed this series , the first in a new a format of Channel 9 content ( lectures ) .
The Channel 9 team and Niner nation thank our dear friend Erik for this stellar contribution to Channel 9 and programming education , generally .
Of course , we also thank Graham Hutton for writing the book ( and for guest lecturing Chapter 11 ) that Erik is both so fond of and which provided a basis for these lectures , which , by the way , were all done in true Channel 9 fashion :
They were recorded in single takes with Erik doing a brilliant job articulating , contextualizing , expanding on the fundamentals and being , well , Erik , one of our favorite geniuses , all in real time .
In Chapter 13 , Equational Reasoning ( and also revealing why Erik says ' uhm ' and ' you know ' so often ) , the grand finale , Dr. Meijer digs into referential transparency and being able to replace equals by equals in all contexts .
In some sense , the purity inherent in functional languages like Haskell makes it easy to express and implement equational reasoning .
In Haskell , our old friend " = " means " is equal to by definition " .
But what does equational reasoning
mean ?
It is clear that propositional logic is too weak for many applications and that equational logic is a first step towards a more powerful system * .
Is it ?
Dr. Meijer , please do explain .
Tune in .
Enjoy .

The protective effect could be the result of years of drinking this water Drinking water which contains the element lithium may reduce the risk of suicide , a Japanese study suggests .
Researchers examined levels of lithium in drinking water and suicide rates in the prefecture of Oita , which has a population of more than one million .
The suicide rate was significantly lower in those areas with the highest levels of the element , they wrote in the British Journal of Psychiatry .
High doses of lithium are already used to treat serious mood disorders .
But the team from the universities of Oita and Hiroshima found that even relatively low levels appeared to have a positive impact of suicide rates .
Levels ranged from 0.7 to 59 micrograms per litre .
The researchers speculated that while these levels were low , there may be a cumulative protective effect on the brain from years of drinking this tap water .
Added element
At least one previous study has suggested an association between lithium in tap water and suicide .
That research on data collected from the 1980s also found a significantly lower rate of suicide in areas with relatively high lithium levels .
Any suggestion that it should be added , even in tiny amounts , to drinking water should be treated with caution and researched very thoroughly
Sophie Corlett
Mind
The Japanese researchers called for further research in other countries but they stopped short of any suggestion that lithium be added to drinking water .
The discussion around adding fluoride to water to protect dental health has proved controversial - criticised by some as mass involuntary medication .
In an accompanying editorial , Professor Allan Young of Vancouver 's Institute for Mental Health said " this intriguing data should provoke further research .
" Large - scale trials involving the addition of lithium to drinking water supplies may then be feasible , although this would undoubtedly be subject to considerable debate .
Following up on these findings will not be straightforward or inexpensive , but the eventual benefits for community mental health may be considerable . "
Sophie Corlett , external relations director at mental health charity Mind said the research " certainly merits more investigation .
" We already know that lithium can act as a powerful mood stabiliser for people with bipolar disorder , and treating people with lithium is also associated with lower suicide rates .
" However , lithium also has significant and an unpleasant side effects in higher doses , and can be toxic .
Any suggestion that it should be added , even in tiny amounts , to drinking water should be treated with caution and researched very thoroughly . "

The '00s will be remembered as the decade when the videogame industry got flipped on its head .
Going into the year 2000 , the general feeling was that the game industry was ready to put away childish things .
The era of Nintendo and kiddie entertainment was over , and the videogames of the future were about multimillion - dollar budgets , mind - blowing photorealism and " digital actors " playing out their parts with human realism thanks to " emotion engines , " etc .
Instead , it went down like this :
A whole bunch of companies dumped a whole lot of money down the next - gen sinkhole , and the number of publishers that could be counted on to deliver bleeding - edge entertainment without going broke in the process dwindled to just a few .
Meanwhile , many more publishers came to the belated realization that all those simple , accessible games from days gone by were n't obsolete ; in fact , there were untold millions of people playing Solitaire on their computers , just waiting for something better to come out .
Our list of the most influential games of the past decade includes , therefore , many games that made big leaps and defined what would come to be traditional aspects of the big - budget grand adventure , and others that pushed the reset button on game design .
Portal ( 2007 ) — — — —— —-
This senior thesis cum sleeper hit showed that students could hit it big in the games business – not after years of obscurity but immediately .
But the space - bending puzzles of Portal will also have an influence on the way games are sold .
Valve could have padded out the four hours of gameplay with extraneous cut scenes or boss battles , but instead it let the game be concise ( and a bargain at $ 20 ) .
Portal proved that quality can trump quantity .

What the hell is Happy Farm , you ask ?
Why , it 's only the Chinese social network farming game that inspired a dozen Facebook clones – the biggest of which , Farmville , has more than 70 million active users .
Whether or not social games are the next big thing , Happy Farm 's blend of planting , growing and harvesting crops turned out to be the simple game - design formula that had gigantic repercussions .

13 . Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty ( 2001 ) — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
This game 's winding , twisted narrative was a total mess , but gosh darn it , it stuck its flag in the ground and proclaimed that videogame stories had the right to be twisted messes .
Nobody actually knows what the hell happened when Raiden went creeping around Big Shell , but Hideo Kojima was right to suggest by extreme example that action games did n't have to just be about a good guy kicking the asses of generic bad guys .
Every videogame story that subverts a player 's expectations owes a debt to the ground broken by Metal Gear Solid 2 .

12 . Half - Life 2 ( 2004 ) — — — — — — ——
If Halo is the game of choice for the trigger - happy , Half - Life 2 is the thinking man 's shooter , the game that got our brains churning .
Puzzles relied on physics , the well - written story was n't spoon - fed , and the protagonist saw the world through prescription lenses .
Half - Life 2 ensured that we'd never think about the first - person shooter in the same way again .

11 . Silent Hill 2 ( 2001 ) — — — — — —
——
–
Separating itself from the formulaic , zombie - laden schlock that was beginning to define the horror - game genre , this PlayStation 2 game was grounded in a certain kind of horrific reality .
Following the story of the troubled and lost James Sunderland , this psychological horror game exposed the truth behind his relationship with his deceased wife .
Silent Hill 2's story tackled taboo subjects like domestic abuse and incest , setting the bar for horror games to come by scaring the player not with hallways full of dessicated monsters but with the horrors found in the hearts of men .

10 . Metroid Prime ( 2002 ) — — — — — —
——
–
Gamers who bemoaned Metroid 's rebirth as an FPS took cold comfort in Nintendo 's assertion that the game was a first - person adventure , not a shooter .
We did n't know what this meant until Metroid Prime dropped .
Then it all became clear :
It was n't about gunplay but exploration , puzzle - solving , platforming and story .
By breaking the genre free from the clutches of Doom , this GameCube title took one massive stride forward for first - person games .

9. Geometry Wars : Retro Evolved ( 2005 ) — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
After finding out that the rushed - to - market launch lineup of the Xbox 360 pretty much sucked , early adopters turned en masse to a genre of game that was supposed to have died a decade ago : the arcade - style , high - score shooter .
The cheap , download - only Geometry Wars had an addictive learning curve and online leaderboards that turned friends into bitter rivals .
It established Xbox Live Arcade as the home of casual games for hard - core players .
– Chris Kohler
8. Wii Sports ( 2006 ) — — — — —— —-
If any one game single - handedly reversed Nintendo 's fortunes , this is it .
Wii was going to live or die on whether or not consumers bought into the novelty of motion controls , and the five mini - games in this killer app ensured that millions of people instantly understood the appeal , usually with massive grins on their faces the first time they returned a serve or bowled a strike .
Without Wii Sports , there would be no Wii ; without the Wii , the videogame landscape would be dramatically different .
– Chris Kohler
7. Bejeweled ( 2001 ) — — — —— —-
Among all the things that happened to gamers during the decade , having to fight with our moms , wives and sisters for computer time is one of the strangest .
It 's hard to nail down a specific game that bears the most responsibility , but for well over 100 million people , the gateway drug was PopCap 's gem-matching puzzle game Bejeweled .
( As famously parodied in an early Penny Arcade strip . )
– Chris Kohler
6. Halo ( 2001 ) — — — — —-
Nintendo's Goldeneye 007 was the game that took multiplayer first - person shooting on game consoles and made it mainstream .
But it was Halo that truly rallied the troops .
When the futuristic shooter debuted alongside the Xbox in 2001 , its well - tuned controls made Halo the rallying point for a new generation of gamers .
Of course , the tangle of CAT - 5 cables at every Halo LAN party was also ground zero for the culture of frat - boy gamers that plague Xbox Live .
You win some , you lose some .

5. Brain Age ( 2005 ) — — — — — ——
The '00s were shaping up to be the era of the big - budget blockbuster game .
Development teams made up of hundreds of people would spend years and millions of dollars on productions that would rival feature films .
Yet one of the most emblematic games of the decade was produced by a team of nine people in just a few months .
Brain
Age , an addictive series of puzzles , brainteasers and math problems , promised to be a sort of daily calisthenic regimen for your gray matter .
The series has sold almost 18 million copies , roughly the same number as Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
As a killer app that sold the Nintendo DS to a grown - up audience , it 's the most extreme example of how Nintendo has bucked the dominant trends and made a killing doing it .
Brain
Age also ushered in the era of games that are ( supposedly ) good for you , like Wii Fit ( over 22.5 million served ) .
The game might be based on dubious neuroscience , but it suggests that all neurons are firing properly at Nintendo HQ .

4. World of Warcraft ( 2004 ) — — — — — — —
——
–
The MMORPG had its genesis in the '90s with EverQuest and Ultima Online .
But Blizzard 's World of Warcraft blew them all away , taking MMOs from niche pursuit to mainstream passion .
Besides establishing that a critical mass of players will pay $ 15 per month to play a single videogame if it is sufficiently complex , WoW created a gold standard by which all other massively multiplayer games are measured .
By grouping players into alliances and guilds , WoW created strong social circles among its devotees , who are so deeply involved in the culture that they attend the yearly BlizzCon convention .
The game has influenced many other publishers to jump feet - first into the MMO genre .
Most , so far , have failed miserably .

3. Guitar Hero ( 2005 ) — — — — —
——
–
Not very long ago , Red Octane and Harmonix were tiny companies producing Dance Dance Revolution control mats and experimental music games that critics loved and nobody bought , respectively .
Everyone 's fortunes changed when the two firms teamed up to create a rock ' n ' roll game with a controller in the shape of a guitar .
Similar games had been moderately popular in Japan for years , but had never really taken off .
Guitar
Hero was the sleeper hit of the year , and just as it was exploding , the two companies parted ways .
Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the Coke and Pepsi of music games , waging an all - out war for market share while continuing to raise the bar for music games in general .
The games are breathing new life into the music biz , letting artists expose their songs to a new audience and bringing in new revenue from downloads .
But more importantly , Guitar Hero took music games from a tiny niche to one of the biggest game genres around .

2. Grand Theft Auto III ( 2001 ) — — — — — — — —
——
–
Few games this decade generated such controversy – or inspired so many other designers .
Yes , any game released a month after Sept. 11 , 2001 , that allowed players to kill civilians and public servants was certain to be controversial .
But beneath those attention - grabbing elements was a revolutionary open - world gameplay system .
Grand Theft Auto III defined the " sandbox , " a sprawling playground with sports cars instead of swingsets , rocket launchers instead of monkey bars .
Players were n't forced to advance the Scarface - style criminal narrative ; they could just amuse themselves in Liberty City .
Forget the avalanche of clones :
It 's hard to find any third - person action adventure game nowadays that does n't crib at least something from the GTA formula .
– Daniel Feit
1. The Sims ( 2000 ) — — — — ——
–
It 's the most popular game franchise that debuted this decade , with more than 100 million copies sold .
Yet many people do n't even consider The Sims to be a game at all .
Will Wright 's people simulator so completely disrupted our beliefs about what a videogame had to be that non-gamers with no expectations had the easiest time wrapping their heads around it .
Sims has had a profound influence on videogames in a dozen different ways .
The simplified human models with their carefully calibrated hierarchies of needs were revolutionary .
The open - ended , accessible game design was the cornerstone of what came to be known as casual games .
It was a sandbox game of unprecedented flexibility , allowing every player to create his own goals and play style .
It was a platform for both modular add - on packages and user - created content .
It was a highly visible property that was ported to every platform in existence , and is the basis for an upcoming feature film .
The Sims , to a greater extent than anything else released this decade , broadened the definition of what a game could be .

Standard Chartered is on track for record profits in 2009 even though the emerging markets bank had been dogged by concerns about its exposure to Dubai .
The London - based bank told the City today it had achieved " record levels of income and operating profit before tax " in the 11 months to November and insisted that any losses it suffered in Dubai were unlikely to have an impact on its profits .
Analysts are forecasting a profit rise of 6 % to $ 5.1 bn ( £ 3 bn ) by the year - end .
Richard Meddings , Standard Chartered 's finance director , said of the potential losses in Dubai : " The situation is fluid and in its early stages , but given the profile of our exposures , we do n't expect any impairment to be material . "
Standard Chartered was described by one banking analyst as " simply the best , better than all the rest " .
Ian Gordon , banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribas , said : " The reason why Standard Chartered has enjoyed remarkably low levels of " peak " impairments during this crisis is that it is first and foremost a trade bank , not a balance sheet lender " .
He noted that the trading update ahead of its full year results to be published early next year was consistent with the market 's expectations and would not lead to any change in his forecasts .
Meddings said the bank 's exposure to the United Arab Emirates was $ 12bn and " very well spread and well diversified across multiple customer accounts " .
Standard Chartered is the first London - listed bank to make a formal statement on its exposure to Dubai amid speculation that Royal Bank of Scotland , soon to be 84 % owned by the taxpayer , has the greatest exposure .
Standard Chartered 's shares , which have been knocked by the uncertainty over Dubai , were up 2.85 % at lunchtime , after a day in which the government announced a plan to tax bankers ' bonuses .
Speaking before confirmation of the new tax , Meddings said : " We are absolute advocates of performance - related pay and incentivised performance .
It 's the way to incentivise high energy levels and high performance for the benefit of the bank as a whole and its shareholders . "
The bank , which has not taken any direct taxpayer bailouts during the crisis but had to close down its off - balance sheet vehicle Whistlejacket , is positioning itself for growth in Asia and the other emerging markets where it has a presence .
Peter Sands , chief executive , said : " Our markets are returning to growth as economic conditions improve , although it is still too early to forecast a sustained recovery and we therefore retain a degree of caution as to the macro economic outlook " .
" The group is very well positioned to benefit from the opportunities in our markets as they continue to recover , " said Sands .
A feature - length documentary about Second Life , Life 2.0 , has just been announced as a Festival Spotlight entry at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival .
As any movie geek can tell you , this is spectacular news :
Sundance is easily the world 's most prestigious and important indie film fest , launching the careers of movie luminaries like Steven Soderbergh , Quentin Tarantino , and the Coen Brothers , and the best platform for independent filmmakers seeking distribution deals with Hollywood studios and beyond .
Here 's the movie 's official site ; check out the tantalizing trailer below :
" Life 2.0 " documentary teaser from Jason Spingarn - Koff on Vimeo
Jason Spingarn - Koff , the director of Life 2.0 , is duly overjoyed to show his film at Sundance : " A huge honor and dream come true ! " he tells me by email .
" I joined Second Life more than three years ago and found it endlessly fascinating – something that until now seemed largely science fiction . "
( In SL , his avatar name is Jay Spire . )
" There was clearly a story that needed to be told , though it often seemed impossible because many people within SL are extremely guarded about their real identities .
It took more than six months to find the main characters , exploring the world while my avatar carried around a virtual movie camera .
I 'm enormously grateful for my subjects who opened up their lives , real and virtual , to share their stories . "
Not bad for a movie that was first financed with some seed money from a SL fundraiser , where all of $ 100 was collected .
As I say , Sundance is the best launchpad to get a distribution deal , so the chances of Life 2.0 screening in theaters or on a TV network soon are very good .
Meantime , you can follow its progress on the movie 's Facebook page .
Summary and some stills courtesy Jason after the break :
Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez says the Big Ten will soon make a more aggressive push toward adding a 12th member .
Speaking to Wisconsin's athletic board on Friday , Alvarez , the former longtime Badgers football coach , said the conference already has investigated possibilities for expansion " from all over the country . "
And though he places no timetable on the search , Alvarez thinks conference commissioner Jim Delany will respond to a group of athletic directors and coaches who want expansion .
" I have a sense he is going to take this year to really be more aggressive about it , " Alvarez told the board .
" I just think everybody feels [ expansion ] is the direction to go , coaches and administrators . "
Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has been the most vocal advocate of a 12th Big Ten team , and he has support from several of his fellow coaches .
A 12th team would allow the Big Ten to split into divisions and hold a conference championship game .
The Big Ten typically ends its football season two weeks before the other BCS conferences , though the addition of a permanent bye week in 2010 will shrink the gap by a week .
" We 're irrelevant for the last three weeks of the football season because we 're not playing , " Alvarez said Friday .
Paterno has stumped for expansion several times , but Delany -- who was unavailable for comment -- told ESPN.com this spring that the league has no immediate plans to add a 12th team .
" There 's not an obvious move , " Delany said in May .
" There might be to some coaches , including Coach Paterno , but it 's not as obvious to the university presidents and to the athletic directors .
" There are a lot [ of schools ] that could take a lot away , but there are n't a lot that could bring so much to make the choice an easy one .
You have to have a lot to make something go like this , and it's broader than really a championship game or a basketball tournament . "
The Big Ten most recently expanded with Penn State , which began competing as a league member in football in 1993 .
The league has made runs at Notre Dame but has n't had serious discussions for several years .

Love the animation / narration style and the atmosphere it creates .
The story / script has n't grabbed me right away , but look forward to seeing where you take it .
Definitely a lot of talent on display .

' I shared a room with my sister , 2 years younger than me .
I must have been 5 , and she wet the bed pretty much every night .
She 'd cry out , and Mom would tiptoe into the room , tall .
She'd ...'
Here she stops , swallows , rolls her eyes and makes an impatient gesture with her hand .
She swallows again .
' Mom would help her change into fresh pajamas ; sit her at the end of my bed , warming my toes .
She 'd change the sheets and tuck her in and whisper Goodnight and disappear again , tall .
She leans forward and drinks the beer in one swallow , continuing briskly as though to finish the messy business and put her heart back under wraps .
So I wet the bed myself one night .
I cried out , and Mom came in .
She was n't gentle and kind , like I thought she 'd be .
She was n't rough , either , just abrupt and tired and disappointed that it was me who 'd called out .
She could have been wondering what triggered it .
If she 'd been softer I might have done it again the next night .
But she was n't , so I did n't and I 'd forgotten about it till now .
I have nothing to say , so I hug her .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The mother of a three - year - old boy who was struck 11 times with a metal bar by a boy of the same age has won the right to compensation , despite authorities twice refusing to pay out on the grounds the perpetrator was too young to have known what he was doing .
The compensation ruling is the first of its kind under the English legal system , according to lawyers representing the victim .
Jay Jones , of Wirral , Merseyside , needed stitches to his face and head after he was repeatedly attacked while the boys were left alone in a car .
His mother Renai Williams said the Tribunals Service ruled in her favour despite the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ( CICA ) twice refusing to pay out after disputing whether such a young child could be guilty of a crime of violence .
She said the injuries were so bad they left her son looking like the “ Elephant Man . ”
“ This has been a long and hard - fought process .
We have been knocked back twice by the CICA because , in my opinion , they did n’t take my son ’s case seriously , ” she told BBC television .
“ My son was hit 11 times on his head and face with a car jack , his attacker kept on lashing out even though Jay was screaming out in pain and covered in blood .
“ It was a vicious attack with such force that his attacker , who was also only three himself , managed to crack the car windscreen . ”
Jay ’s assailant cannot be named for legal reasons .
And because of his age he cannot be prosecuted for the offence and is currently in the care of social services .
The age of criminal responsibility in England , Wales and Northern Ireland is 10 .
Representing the battered child , Michelle Armstrong of Kirwans Solicitors said the incident was a deliberate act of violence that would have constituted a crime had it not been for the age of the attacker .
“ He suffered nightmares and bed - wetting for months afterwards and was terrified to go anywhere on his own , or near windows , because it reminded him of being in the car , ” she said .
Armstrong said the CICA rejected the case after questioning whether the actions of a three - year - old perpetrator could constitute a “ crime of violence . ”
“ We argued that the age of the perpetrator was irrelevant when claiming compensation from the CICA .
And it was on this point that we won , ” she said in a statement .
“ The next step in the process will be to present evidence of the injuries and the effects of the incident on the child , including medical evidence , to a Tribunal Judge so that a compensation award can be considered . ”
LITTLE ROCK , Ark. -
A police officer in a small Arkansas town used a stun gun on an unruly 10 - year - old girl after he said her mother gave him permission to do so .
Now the town 's mayor is calling for an investigation into whether the Taser use was appropriate .
According to a report by Officer Dustin Bradshaw , obtained Wednesday by the Associated Press , police were called to the Ozark home Nov. 11 because of a domestic disturbance .
When he arrived , the girl was curled up on the floor , screaming , the report said .
Bradshaw 's report said the girl screamed , kicked and resisted any time her mother tried to get her in the shower before bed .
� Her mother told me to tase her if I needed to , � Bradshaw wrote .
The child was �violently kicking and verbally combative� when Bradshaw tried to take her into custody , and she kicked him in the groin .
So he delivered �a very brief drive stun to her back , � the report said .
The names of the girl and her mother were redacted in the report .
Ozark Mayor Vernon McDaniel said Wednesday that the girl was n't injured and is now at the Western Arkansas Youth Shelter in Cecil .
But McDaniel said he wants Arkansas State Police � and if they decline , the FBI � to investigate the incident .
� People here feel like that he made a mistake in using a Taser , and maybe he did , but we will not know until we get an impartial investigation , � McDaniel said .
The state police declined his request Tuesday , saying it only gets involved if the officer in question was accused of misconduct or targeted in an internal investigation .
Police Chief Jim Noggle said no disciplinary action was taken against Bradshaw .
He said Tasers are a safe way to subdue people who are a danger to themselves or others .
� We did n't use the Taser to punish the child � just to bring the child under control so she would n't hurt herself or somebody else , � Noggle said .
If the officer tried to forcefully put the girl in handcuffs , he could have accidentally broken her arm or leg , Noggle said .
He said a touch of the stun gun � �less than a second � � stopped the girl from being unruly , and she was handcuffed , he said .
� She got up immediately and they put her in the patrol car , � McDaniel said .
Noggle said the girl will face disorderly conduct charges as a juvenile in the incident .
The girl 's father , Anthony Medlock , told the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette that his daughter has emotional problems , but that she did n't have a weapon and should n't have been Tasered .
� My daughter does not deserve to be tased and be treated like an animal , � said Medlock , who is divorced from the girl 's mother and does not have custody .
Steve Tuttle , a spokesman for Taser , said it 's up to individual law enforcement agencies to decide when Taser use is appropriate .
In some cases , a Taser �presents the safer response to resistance compared with the alternatives such as fists , kicks , baton strikes , bean bag guns , chemical agents , or canine response , � Tuttle said in a statement .
The police chief , who has been Tasered twice himself during training sessions , said his department has never had to Taser a child or elderly person before , but that in some instances , that could be necessary to ensure safety .
� We do n't want to do things like this , � Noggle said .
� This is something we have to do .
We 're required to maintain order and keep the peace . �
Stephen Toulmin , an influential philosopher who conducted wide - ranging inquiries into ethics , science and moral reasoning and developed a new approach to analyzing arguments known as the Toulmin model of argumentation , died on Dec. 4 in Los Angeles .
He was 87 .
The cause was heart failure , said his son Greg .
Mr. Toulmin , a disciple of Ludwig Wittgenstein , earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics and physics , and throughout his long philosophical career showed a marked inclination to ground his ideas in real - world situations .
In the introduction to a 1986 edition of his first book , “ An Examination of the Place of Reason in Ethics ” ( 1950 ) , he wrote that “ having been trained as a natural scientist , I had always hoped to relate philosophical issues to practical experience , and could never wholly side with Hume the philosopher against Hume the backgammon player . ”
His bent , he wrote , was toward “ practical moral reasoning . ”
Although he wrote on disparate topics like the history of science , international relations , medical ethics and Wittgenstein ’s Vienna , he was best known for “ The Uses of Argument , ” published in 1958 .
In it , he criticized formal logic as an overly abstract , inadequate representation of how human beings actually argue .
He also challenged its claims to universality , as well as its faith in absolute truth and moral certainty .

Sen . Jim Bunning has placed an additional hold on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's nomination to a second term .
Bunning 's office confirmed that the Kentucky Republican is joining with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) , who caucuses with Democrats , to seek to block Bernanke 's confirmation to a second term atop the Federal Reserve Board .
Bernanke has come under fire from lawmakers on the left and the right , who have expressed varying concerns about his record as Fed chairman , though his course to a second term was eased somewhat on Thursday when a number of members of the Senate Banking Committee , including Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) , expressed support for him during a confirmation hearing .

Bunning blasted Bernanke , whose nomination he did not support when President George W. Bush nominated him , during the Banking hearing .
“ I will do everything I can to stop your nomination , and drag out this process as long as I can , " Bunning said .
Sanders announced he 'd place a hold , an informal parliamentary move in which a senator seeks to prevent bringing a nomination to the floor for a vote , on Bernanke on Wednesday evening .
" Notre Dame just fired a coach with a 6 - 6 record , " Sanders told reporters Thursday .
" Well , Ben Bernanke had much worse than a 6 - 6 record .
" The liberal blog firedoglake first reported on Thursday that one or two Republican senators had placed an anonymous hold on Bernanke 's nomination .

Zinc Dimes , Tungsten Gold & Lost Respect By Jim Willie CB
Nov 18 2009 4:00 PM www.GoldenJackass.com
Use the above link to subscribe to the paid research reports , which include coverage of several smallcap companies positioned to rise during the ongoing panicky attempt to sustain an unsustainable system burdened by numerous imbalances aggravated by global village forces .
An historically unprecedented mess has been created by compromised central bankers and inept economic advisors , whose interference has irreversibly altered and damaged the world financial system , urgently pushed after the removed anchor of money to gold .
Analysis features Gold , Crude Oil , USDollar , Treasury bonds , and inter-market dynamics with the US Economy and US Federal Reserve monetary policy .
In 1964 the USGovt introduced the zinc dimes clad with silver .
They at least admitted the debauchery publicly .
Now pre-1964 silver coins are all considered different , and valued differently too , higher .
Rome committed the same coinage fraud 1900 years ago .
Their Empire went bust as the city burned almost concurrently .
Ayn Rand is a guiding light for Alan Greenspan , the enabling destroyer of the US banking system , destroyer of the US household archipelago , and dispatcher of the US industrial base to Asia .
He is the hero icon worshipped by Wall Street .
The irony is thick , that his career was spent following Old Europe orders that delivered the slow motion coup de grace to the American Empire .
Ayn Rand wrote " If you want to know when a society is set to vanish , watch the money .
Whenever destroyers appear among men , they start by destroying money , for money is men ’s protection and the base of moral existence .
Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owner a counterfeit pile of papers . "
The Chinese are learning this lesson the hard way , challenged to convert their USTreasury Bonds and USAgency Mortgage Bonds into true wealth before the paper becomes untradable .
Actually , the bonds will eventually be redeemed by the USFed with newly printed money , when an avalanche occurs of foreigners seeking redemption en masse .
For almost ten years they have been exchanging their finished products to the US & West for paper with ink on it , in questionable stored wealth .
The Chinese are cashing in on their paper , trading it for new global power .
NEW TUNGSTEN MINE DISCOVERY
The tungsten deposits come in very high grade ore , located in shallow rectangular deposits dispersed widely across the world , segregated in unusual vault heap leach mineralizations .
In October , the Hong Kong bankers discovered some gold bars shipped from the United States were actually tungsten with gold plating .
This is the exact same Modus Operandi as the silver clad zinc dimes from 45 years ago .
History repeats itself .
The parallels to mortgage bond fraud with either subprime borrowers or multiple property titles used in bond securitization is easy to spot .
A consistent theme runs through the American management of finance and dissemination of fraudulent assets on a global basis .
Tungsten gold bars is a feat difficult to surpass .
Credit must be given for not leaving any potential for fraud untapped .
Refer to insider flash trading , naked shorting of bank stocks , commodity trading on behalf of the USGovt , and much more .
No disrespect is intended for the trillion $ counterfeits of superstar grade .
Refer defense appropriations , USTreasury Bond sales beyond issuance , and missing Fannie Mae funds .
These are legacy crimes .
The initial discovery was something like four gold bars , which the Hong Kong bankers drilled invasively to test the contents .
Reminds me of drilling the earth and measuring how many grams of gold per tonne .
The HK bankers hoped to have 99 % gold yield in their drill program for the resident bars .
They found something like 1 % instead and 99 % tungsten .
By the way , tungsten sells for less than $ 70 per ton , which makes its swaps for gold to be 60 x more profitable than silver bar swaps .
Another handy usage for the Gold / Silver ratio in calculations .
The hunt was on .
Now not a single assayer on the planet is available , as all are tied up .
They have been commissioned to test the gold bars shipped from the United States of Fraudulent Banker America in their own bullion vaults .
They use basic methods of four drill holes with direct assay of shavings , but also less invasive methods like electro - magnetic waves to examine the metal lattice structure .
When highest level methods are needed , they turn to mass spectrometry .
NOW ALMOST NO GOLD BARS WILL LEAVE THE LONDON OR NEW YORK METALS EXCHANGES WITHOUT SOME AUTHENTICATION , AS DISTRUST IS WIDESPREAD .
The global bankers must deal with toxic bonds and phony gold bars .
Talk circulates that the entire contents of Fort Knox might have swapped a decade ago .
Evidence is being accumulated and compiled .
The assayers have also been commissioned to assist in authentication of gold bar delivery the world over from the US exchanges .
Current estimates among the gold trader community run well past a few hundred thousand ' salted ' gold bars , maybe over a million .
So the introduction to sophisticated Wall Street methods of currency management during the Decade of Prosperity had a side game running simultaneously .
In an age where the lines between patriotism and treason are blurred , this tungsten episode brings new meaning to the word HEIST .
BREAKDOWN AT GOLD EXCHANGES
The bust cometh , and it will be spectacular .
The stories told in the press will be peculiar , since not told objectively .
The headlines might be a comedy , with phony reports of foreign subterfuge , when the perpetrators are home grown .
The focal point for attacks is actually London at their metals exchange .
The early October events included numerous offers by exchange officials to settle gold contract deliveries in cash with a 25 % extra vig bonus .
Much gold was drained from London on demanded delivery , thanks to a small army of lawyers , a small blizzard of contracts , and a few key judges at the courts .
They were all Asians , the majority Chinese .
Gold was taken , thus enforcing futures contracts , which happen to be binding contracts .
The pressure at the end of November will be worse to make good on gold contract deliveries .
Recall the stories back in April for a Deutsche Bank rescue by the Euro Central Bank with a very large ( over one million oz gold position ) provision made .
DBank was in trouble .
The pressures are mounting every couple months .
Next March will be a climax of the breakdown , or else June .
Breakdowns come from extreme pressures .
Each delivery month event includes more gold removed from the London exchange , more gold demanded from it , and more movement toward a breakdown .
So the next events have even more pressure , with less gold supply and continued relentless demand .
Recall also that the exchange , along with the COMEX in the Untied States , exempt certain parties from maintaining 80 % collateral when they short gold & silver with paper contracts .
Thus the name suppression , or better yet corruption .
They are being caught in their naked shorting game .
The December 1st events surrounding settlement delivery demands will be more contentious and stressful than October 1st .
In sequential manner , the March event will be even more pressure packed , with precious little physical gold in store and more targeted Chinese delivery demanded .
The June event will be even more pressure packed still , a backup date for a potential breakdown if it does not occur in March .
The common denominator for the parties demanding gold delivery in London is simple : they are all Asians , all , as in all , and the great majority are Chinese .
One can safely conclude that the US and British banks will be broken with the nexus being their gold management , which underpins the USDollar .
Other pressure is sure to mount .
Not the kind of pressure you might imagine .
Pressure is mounting for senior bank executives and politicians to start revealing the identities , deeds , locations , and dates of the gold tungsten swap , the mortgage bond firehose , and other pervasive frauds protected by the USGovt and British Govt .
GOLD & SILVER BREAKOUTS
The gold & silver prices are moving in lead fashion , and have done so among the currencies for at least the last three months .
The major currencies fiddle and diddle , but gold & silver continue to rise .
The Chinese , according to word from connected sources , intend to push the gold price and the silver price relentless upward without explosive parabolic moves and without painful huge selloff corrections .
That way , the army of public investors will not lose heart , and will remain on the path , in full phalanx support of the Chinese Govt initiative .
The Euro currency has hit the 150 level in mid-October and in mid-November , only to fall back a little .
The Euro is not ready for a powerful move to 160 just yet .
Such an advance would bring with it a painful effect to German exporters again , not desired .
As a result , the gold price in Europe has made significant moves , and is in the process of challenging the 785 high from February .
The key to a massive gold bull market is confirmation in terms of other currencies .
The gold breakout is being led globally in US $ terms , since it is the weakest currency among the majors .
GOLD IS TAKING ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE AS THE PREMIER GLOBAL CURRENCY , AFTER A BREAKDOWN IN THE MONETARY SYSTEM AND INSOLVENCY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM .
My 1130 midterm target for gold has been hit , stated at least three times this summer and autumn in public articles .
One must wonder if a sizeable selloff in gold is coming .
My view is that given the lack of sudden sharp upward thrusts in the gold price , the prospect of a sharp correction is lessened .
Charts tend to show symmetry oftentimes .
Besides , the Beijing Put is becoming well - known in the financial circles .
The Chinese are using some reverse technical analysis , buying heavily when the gold chart indicates imminent weakness .
That way the clueless Western gold sellers will be denied their cheaper re-entry , and will be forced to buy at higher levels .
The Chinese are employing an unusual pattern .
They are accumulating gold .
The Chinese will continue to buy gold with both hands until the supply is exhausted of turkeys who fail to comprehend the Paradigm Shift , fail to comprehend the USDollar revolt , fail to comprehend the broken Western banks , fail to comprehend the endless stimulus , and fail to dismiss the mindless gold bubble argument that seems to be floating around in recent propaganda ploys .
Its author overlooks the USTreasury bubble of gigantic proportions .
Whether or not a notable pullback correction comes for gold , who knows ?
who cares ?
This is not a time to go in & out , selling & buying back a gold position .
It is a time to acknowledge a powerful global shift that will send the USDollar into the dungeon , and deliver gold to unheardof heights .
The next target for gold is 1300 .
The targets for gold are dictated by the size of the jumps from the head and shoulder of the inverted Head & Shoulders pattern .
The lost respect from the gold bullion bar fraud , the Weimar output of printed money , the monetization dependence from global isolation , and the lack of leadership all tend to pull the USDollar down .
More accurately , these factors will push gold up into a dominant currency position fully recognized , as nations struggle to rebuild their banks after toxic US infection that does not end .
G- 20 CONFIRMS PARADIGM SHIFT
The Scotland gathering of bankers had some key signals to report .
Note the signal how they ignored the USDollar as a topic in the open chambers .
Conclude they wish for benign neglect , where the US $ can find its true value much lower , and eventually depart as the global reserve currency .
Note the signal how they urged continued global stimulus .
Conclude they wish for the major governments to continue to debauch , undermine , and destroy the major currencies such as the USDollar , British Pound , European Union Euro , Swiss Franc , and Japanese Yen .
Conclude they wish for the emerging market economies to be given massive assistance by the industrialized submerged market economies .
The more the prominent older nations render harm to their banking systems , economies , and balance sheets , the easier it will be for Brazil , Russia , India , and China to conduct the business of walking the earth as new leaders .
The new BRIC nations will build their dominant positions one brick at a time .
The Paradigm Shift is away from the USDollar , with power shifting from West to East and in particular toward the BRIC nations .
Their most recent visible victory is killing off the G - 8 Meeting , which does not convene anymore .
Not only does the G - 20 serve as the global banker conference forum , but the Chinese have a lead voice , precisely as they demanded .
Creditors win their way .
The commodity currencies are in a different earth zone .
My analysis has stated that the prominent older nations , the so - called industrialized nations , will not raise their official interest rates .
They will only talk , since their banks are insolvent and their government debt securities are caught in asset bubbles .
The Euro Central Bank is the most likely to raise interest rates , but only as part of a more diverse strategy to split the EU iteself .
The German nation has been drained by $ 40 billion per year for each of the last ten years , and resentment is strong .
The Australians and Norwegians hiked their official interest rates in recent weeks .
They have commodities to fortify their national economies , and do not concentrate on the sale of inked paper in tainted export .
The Paradigm Shift is toward a more legitimate group of currencies .
It is toward currencies backed by hard assets .
The currency basket from the Intl Monetary Fund seems like the temporary device .
It is actually a Straw Man carrying a straw basket .
Before the grand shift is complete to at least one hard asset currency , the doomed currencies will be bound together with IMF twine .
The bankers believe the IMF straw basket will give them the power to control the decline of the USDollar , or protect themselves from that decline .
The strategy might succeed .
It will surely enable the gold price to climb versus all currencies .
Gold will be like Moses in a basket as a baby , except moving upstream .
The candidates for hard asset currencies are the New Russian Ruble , the Gulf Dinar , maybe even a New Nordic Euro .
The process will take time , as some bumpy roads lie ahead , and military protection is required .
EXIT STRATEGY & WEIMAR DOLLARS
No exit strategy is available either to the Untied States or the British .
The USFed conducted its helpless display to announce the USEconomy remains weak with slack capacity , and that an ultra - low official interest rate would be firmly fixed for a long time still .
No surprise here !
What they did not say is that , like with Japan , they have no possible exit plan .
Now almost twenty years later , Japan is stuck with a near 0 % rate .
If the USFed raises interest rates , they pop the biggest financial bubble on the planet , USTreasury Bonds .
The USFed is further hindered since Wall Street is playing the Dollar Carry Trade .
They are borrowing 0 % money in US $ and investing in commodities like crude oil and US stock indexes .
Other players are using the free borrowed money to invest in gold .
In fact , just today St Louis Fed President Bullard stated his expectation of no further USFed rate hike until year 2012 .
The Exit Strategy will lead to a road paved by Weimar Dollars .
The world 's major financial centers outside the central bank accomplices are ditching their dollars .
They are diversifying out of US $ - based bonds of all types .
They are accumulating gold .
Some are investing in facilities that are vertically integrated with commodity production , transport , and trade .
Like China !
The USGovt is investing , by contrast , in clunker cars , still more houses , dead car industry , spoiled AIG insurer , a mortgage cesspool Fannie Mae , pork projects ( see unused airport in Johnstown Pennsylvania ) , and a dubious war on terrorism .
Quite a contrast !
With the news spreading globally about tungsten - laced gold bars , or actually gold - plated tungsten bars , the reputation of the Untied States will grow more tarnished .
In time , the only friend of the USDept Treasury to finance its steady stream of Trillion$ in debt will be the Printing Pre$ $ .
Without the printed money to pull off the auctions , they would be utter loud failures .
Without the USDollar Swap Facility , foreign central banks would not have funds to use in Treasury auctions .
Without the funds from foreign USAgency Mortgage Bonds sold to the USFed for freshly printed USDollars , the foreign central banks would not have funds to use in Treasury auctions .
Without the Permanent Market Operations used to scoop up all the unsold bonds stuck with primary dealers , one week routinely after each auction , dealers would be unable to participate in the next Treasury auctions .
They would suffer from bond constipation .
The key event in the next few months , pushed by the foreign disgust at fraud more pervasive than ever conceived by ordinary man , is THE EXPOSURE OF MONETIZATION for support of the USTreasury Bond .
The debt monetization remains a dirty secret , well concealed by the USGovt and the financial press .
What comes is isolation , and to those isolated , their best friend will be a Printing Pre$ $ .
Exposure comes , with detrimental impact to the USDollar .
The resulting tarnish to the USGovt image and Wall Street reputation will be reflected on the USDollar .
In time it will fully resemble a Third World currency .
The process will take time , but hyper - inflation is coming to US shores .
Where are the Deflation Knuckleheads who tended to dominate the web journals last spring and summer , in incredible dense vapid clueless fashion ???
What a tremendously misguided group .
They follow religiously the deteriorating economies , miss the twin storm , ignore the power of the unprecedented monetary inflation , and somehow overlook the entire global movement if not revolt against the USDollar in a grand Paradigm Shift .
They represent the worst economists in the alternative media on web journals .
Their tunnel vision on the falling asset price effect left them vulnerable to missing a tsunami on their own doorstep , incredibly .
They still do not offer an explanation of why crude is at the $ 80 price level again .
Supplies of oil are nowhere as great as the false USGovt statistics indicate , but the entire world is hedging at the same time against the US $ with oil assets .
OBAMA VISITS THE LEAD US CREDITOR During the president visit to Beijing , Obama has been reminded of who the master creditor is .
It is China .
In public no discussions are made of the Chinese concentrated pressure in London at the metal exchange .
Taboo topic .
The US President has slipped on three key topics , with mention of the human rights issue , currency manipulation , and the future of communism .
The US has no place to lecture any other nation .
China is actually moving toward capitalism , while America has forgotten what capitalism is , and marches with right foot in fascist mud and left foot in communism mud .
The Chinese serve as the spearhead to displace the USDollar from its perch as the global reserve currency .
They realize fully that the battle that must be won is over the Gold - Dollar fiery rod .
The Chinese might be orchestrating a gold price move to 1150 and a silver price move to 19 just to slap the US face a little during the state visit .

France has been stunned by the fate of la petite Typhaine , a little girl lost in a disturbing saga of parental brutality , brazen lies and the failings of the social safeguards which are meant to protect children .
The case , which bears striking similarities to the death of Baby P and the false abduction of Shannon Matthews , revolves around Typhaine , a five - year - old with a cheeky round face .
She was reported to have been abducted from under her mother 's nose on 14 June .
According to her mother , Anne-Sophie Faucheur , 24 , the little girl " vanished in the space of a second " as she ran a few yards ahead of her on the streets of Maubeuge , a depressed industrial town in northern France .
When the investigation made no progress , Ms Faucheur gave a tearful press conference in which she accused the police of feet - dragging and incompetence .
" One thing is sure , " she said , sobbing in front of the TV cameras .
" We will get her back .
We miss her so much .
She is in our hearts always . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sitting beside her , nodding in sympathy , was her partner , Nicolas Willot , Typhaine 's stepfather , who is also 24 .
This week , almost six months later , Willot , a hospital porter and voluntary fireman , led French and Belgian police to Typhaine 's shallow grave in woodland in south central Belgium , 50 miles from their home .
A few days earlier he told French investigators that Typhaine had died after she was hurled naked into a cold shower by her mother .
This was , he said , a punishment for wetting the bed – a punishment that " went wrong " .
Ms Faucheur at first insisted that there had been an " accident in the shower " .
She later confessed that her partner 's version was correct .
The case is one of a series in recent years involving child abuse or extreme neglect amongst poor white French families , especially in the depressed ex-industrial towns of northern France .
The case has also revived disturbing memories for the people of Belgium .
The body of little Typhaine was found close to the village of Marcinelle , once the home of the convicted child murderer , Marc Dutroux .
Mr Willot told police the girl had frequently been " tortured " by her mother and that she had become the " whipping child of the family " ( which included an older sister and a baby half - sister ) .
If so , Typhaine 's martyrdom had not lasted long .
One of the most disturbing facts of the case is that Ms Faucheur had herself kidnapped her daughter from outside a kindergarten in Lille only five months before .
Until then , the little girl had been living with her paternal grandmother and her natural father , François Taton .
No attempt was made by the French legal system or social services or Mr Taton himself to reclaim the child .
When Ms Faucheur and Mr Taton separated four years earlier , they had agreed informally to take one daughter each .
Typhaine had gone with her father and her mother is said to have hardly known her before turning up at the school gates in Lille .

Ms Faucheur abducted the child by telling teachers that Typhaine 's father was ill and could not come to collect her .
Awkward questions are now being asked about why nothing was done to challenge Ms Faucheur 's action , or at least investigate Typhaine 's well - being in her new home .
Raphael
Théry , a lawyer representing Typhaine 's father , said that his client had decided to accept the situation because " he placed his confidence in the mother .
If a mother comes to claim her child , you imagine it is to give her affection and love " .
It is now believed that Typhaine had been dead for four days before her disappearance was reported to police .
Her body was kept for at least two days in the cellar of the family house at Aulnoye - Aymeries , near Maubeuge .
While Typhaine 's body still lay in the cellar , her mother invited friends and family to a restaurant to celebrate the christening of her baby daughter .
When they asked why Typhaine was not there , Ms Faucheur said that the little girl had been left at home to watch videos in case her natural father " took advantage of the party " to steal her back .
Willot explained to police that he had loaded the dead child into his van when he set out on one of his frequent trips across the border to Belgium to buy cheaper petrol .
His choice of a burial place near the village once inhabited by Marc Dutroux , convicted in 2004 for multiple child murders , is believed to be a macabre coincidence .
The websites of French newspapers have been flooded with messages expressing shock at the " cold - blooded cheek " of the child 's mother , who " made us all believe in her suffering " .
But many messages also query the legal and social welfare systems ' failure to see the danger signs .
The same questions are being asked by investigators and local politicians .
" It is easy to be wise after the event but there was a disturbing pattern , " said one politician , who asked not be named .
" Apart from the unchallenged abduction by her mother , there was the fact that Typhaine did not go to school and was rarely seen outside the house . "
Even now , investigators are not convinced they have uncovered the full facts of the case .
They fear that both mother and stepfather may have systematically mistreated Typhaine .
For the time being , the couple have been accused of " mistreatment causing accidental death " .
A postmortem examination on the child 's body will attempt to decide whether her injuries point to something more deliberate .
Sorry it ’s a day late , but here it is anyhow – a lovely Christmas comic , just for you !
Enjoy , and Happy Holidays !
Ever since Hubble got its new set of eyes , the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) , astronomers have been treated to a wealth of new scientific data of the Deep Field , a portion of the night skies just 1/12th of the surface of the Moon .
The new observation instrument is very effective at its job , mostly because of its massively improved infrared detection capabilities .
This allows it to determine the “ redshift ” of the specific cosmic object that is being studied , and thus find out its age .
Now , astronomers believe they may have discovered a galaxy that is more than 13.2 billion years old , the oldest ever found .
Until now , the record was held by a gamma ray burst ( GRB ) with a redshift of 8.2 , which was discovered this April .
The redshift is essentially the process through which electromagnetic radiation ( in this case light ) shifts its energy to longer , less energetic wavelengths , such as the infrared wavelength .
This is generally caused b the Doppler effect , or by other classes of cosmic , gravity - induced phenomena .
Just recently , astronomers at the University of California in Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) , led by expert Garth Illingworth , have announced in the journal arXiv that they found a cosmic source with a redshift of 10 .
The objects were found in the Hubble Deep Field images , and the science group says that the recently identified galaxies must have existed when the Universe was about three to four percent its current age , of 13.7 billion years .
“ Even though it 's not really unexpected , finding galaxies at such early times is hugely exciting .
There 's no smoking gun , but we 're confident that this is what we 're really seeing , ” Illingworth explains .
However , his team 's announcement was not the first of a 10 - redshift galaxy .
Other teams also announced the discovery of such old galaxies in the Deep Field , Nature News reports .
For example , Arizona State University in Tempe expert Rogier Windhorst and his team managed to discover more than 20 galaxies with a redshift of 10 in the same data set that the UCSC group used .
Granted , the two galactic groups that the teams found do not overlap .
Difficulties , the experts say , arise from the fact that , at this point , it 's still unclear how these distant galaxies should be defined .
Illingworth says that Windhorst 's team might have not taken into account a large number of factors pertaining to the accuracy of the investigation .
For example , the UCSC expert says , some of the 20 galaxies that Windhorst and his team believe they found at the beginning of the Universe may lie too close to more luminous , nearer galaxies , which may have tainted the results of the team 's calculations .
“ That could have confused their software and caused them to get a lot of objects that just were not real high - redshift galaxies , ” Illingworth believes .
He also adds that 20 galaxies this old in such a small patch of skies would imply that the early universe had a much higher rate of stellar formation .
“ This does n't accord with what we would expect theoretically or logically , ” he adds .
When the Black List , Hollywood 's annual ranking of the top unproduced scripts , was unveiled Friday , it lent the full weight of its authority to Christopher Weekes .
Weekes ' screenplay " The Muppet Man , " about the life and loves of Jim Henson , had landed the top spot , ahead of a number of up - and - coming writers and even established names like Aaron Sorkin .
That kind of honor comes with a host of benefits , not the least of which is giving a valuable boost to the project ( last year 's winner , a quirky character piece called " The Beaver , " was catapulted toward production by its Black List win , with Mel Gibson now starring , Jodie Foster directing and Summit Entertainment , the studio behind the " Twilight " franchise , distributing the film ) .
" The Muppet Man , " which takes an almost fairy - tale view of the romance between the late Jim Henson and his longtime wife Jane , faces a far tougher climb .
Weekes was discovered by managers Britton Rizzio and Kelly McCormack after they had seen an indie movie of his at a film festival in 2008 .
They soon found he had written , entirely on spec , a script about one of the most enigmatic and private of contemporary artists without having ever met or even read much about him ( there exists no major published biography about Henson ) .
Instead ,
Weeks conjured the story mostly out of his imagination , basing it on a series of photos he'd studied and whatever strands of information he could find on things like Wikipedia .
" Even though I was just 10 when he died , Jim Henson had been this Walt Disney - like figure in my life , and I wanted to create a version of him as seen through these kind of rose - colored glasses , " Weekes said Friday from Australia .
As whimsical as the script is said to be ( it also folded into the narrative invented particulars of the romance between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy , including a depiction of a hungover Kermit heartbroken by Miss Piggy 's impending marriage to another beau ) , it also wanders into a legal and creative thicket .
Weekes had written a story about individuals -- Jim and Jane Henson -- to whom he did not hold rights .
Equally problematic , Weekes had included a number of Muppet characters to which Disney owns the rights .
That kind of thing is , to say the least , usually frowned upon .
" He basically did what all your representatives tell you not to do , " Sarah Hammer , who used to represent Weekes as an agent , says with a laugh .
And sure enough , when the project was sold to the Jim Henson Co. shortly after -- " the only place it could go , " says Rizzio -- it was welcomed but quickly found itself mired in creative differences .
The production banner , according to people familiar with the meetings , wanted to turn the story into more of a Muppet romp -- even a musical -- and excise the Jim and Jane Henson relationship .
And Weekes had written an intimate , if not dark , character study .
As the novice Weekes found out , it 's not easy being green .
Lisa Henson , the daughter of Jim and Jane Henson who helps run the Jim Henson Co. , maintains that the problems can be resolved by simply combining two different visions , though even she acknowledges that the story that came to her was not one that the company liked .
Capcom Reveals Megaman 10 with a Vengeance !

More than two - thirds of British troops returning from Afghanistan are suffering severe and permanent hearing damage , according to the most comprehensive study into one of the less well - known side - effects of the conflict in Helmand .
Internal defence documents reveal that of 1,250 Royal Marine commandos who served in Afghanistan , 69 % suffered hearing damage due to the intense noise of combat .
The findings indicate that complaints such as tinnitus or almost complete deafness among combat troops are considerably greater than previously reported .
One audiologist said the report revealed that hearing loss was endemic among Afghan veterans , with many suffering defects that could bar them from frontline service .
The intensity of the conflict in Helmand and its close - combat fighting , roadside devices and the noise of low - flying coalition aircraft caused the problems , according to the Ministry of Defence study .
The report , dated 7 December and written by military consultant surgeon Chris Pearson , warns that the known scale of the problem might prove to be the " tip of the iceberg " because only the most severe forms of hearing loss , grave enough to bar troops from frontline service , are officially reported .
Professor Mark Haggard , honorary vice - president of Deafness Research UK , which is working with the MoD to resolve the problem , said : " The issue has become systemic , endemic .
Combat gunfire and explosions mean significant numbers are turning up with significant hearing problems . "
Hearing tests were conducted on 1,254 troops from 42 Commando Royal Marines following their six - month tour in Helmand between April and October 2008 .
Analysis by the defence audiology service found that 865 of the Marines displayed signs of severe hearing damage caused by loud noise .
Of these , 410 were classified as having more extreme cases .
Pearson , who is calling for further studies into the issue , concluded that 69 % of the Royal Marines had " audiometric evidence consistent with NIHL [ noise - induced hearing loss ] " .
British employers must not subject staff to noise levels over 85 decibels for prolonged periods .
Haggard said the blast of a gun or " medium " explosion measured 140dB , equivalent to hearing a jet plane taking off about 40 m away .
The sound of a pneumatic drill at two metres distance measures 126 dB while an alarm clock is 90dB .
The normal pain threshold is around 120dB .
The MoD study , The Extent of Operational NIHL , also points towards major problems among reservists deployed to Helmand .
Pearson 's report reveals that one in 10 Territorial Army recruits also experienced a significant degree of hearing loss following their tour of duty which was " unlikely to be due to anything other than noise or blast " .
Tests comparing the Royal Marines from Afghanistan with service personnel from an RAF base in the UK found that 17.7 % had severe ear damage compared with 5.2 % of the RAF personnel .
The MoD report also scrutinised in detail the medical records of 73 soldiers who had served in Helmand province and found that 67 had problems with their hearing .
Of these 39 were diagnosed with noise - induced hearing loss with 16 new cases of hearing problems thought to be from " blast injury " .
An MoD spokesman said they were trying out new ear protection for personnel on operations to protect them from the effects of loud explosions and gunfire .
He said : " The system uses a custom moulded earplug with an inbuilt microphone to cut the noise impact of loud explosions while still giving the wearer the ability to hear colleagues .
Feedback from trials with soldiers in training and in theatre have allowed the rapid development of new , easy - to - fit earplugs that stay in place . "
Over the last 10 years , the internet has utterly transformed the world .
But as we embrace this new - found connectedness , asks Johann Hari , are we losing our culture ?
On the first day of the Noughties , I sent my first email .
I sent it from a different world – one in which spam was something my nan ate from a can , blackberries were a fruit you picked from a tree , and where if you told somebody you wanted to poke them , they 'd punch you in the face .
On the day I joined the club , there were 200 million people with email accounts .
Today , there are 3.2 billion .
It seemed to me that day to be a fad .
Today , it seems like a second skin , spreading out over all my friends , all my colleagues , and all the world .
The internet has transformed the way we think about ourselves – the groups we belong to , the information we know , the people we date , and even our sexual fantasies .
The story of this decade is the story – in all its strange sinews – of the World Wide Web .
The only parallel that can help us understand the change we are living through is the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1450 .
Until that moment , every book had to be written out by hand , by a tiny clique of monks who were known as scribes .
They were the filter through which all knowledge could be transmitted or received .
This gave the Church near - total power over writing .
Any sophisticated communication happened on their terms , through their men .
But the invention of moveable type erased that world from history .
Suddenly , the circle of people with access to information widened dramatically .
The Bible could be bought and owned by any literate person – and holding it in their own hands in their own homes , they began to develop their own ideas about it .
The Protestant rebellion against Catholic theocracy rose and racked Europe in a way that could never have happened if the limited scribblings of the scribes were the only way Europeans could talk to each other .
In the longer term , the printing press went even further and delivered popular nationalism into the world .
The scribes wrote in Latin , and their work spoke to a tiny pan-national European elite who identified with each other not by country but by religious creed .
The new presses made it possible to write in – and standardise – languages .
Places like " France " or " Germany " could talk to each other in print and begin to develop a consciousness that they were one people with shared interests .
The internet might look at times like a new - fangled way to go shopping or look at porn .
But just as Gutenberg shifted power over information from the Church to anyone with a printing press , the internet has shifted power over information to anyone with an internet connection .
Today , you can publish anything you like , to anyone on earth , for almost nothing .
You can whip up a group of people with the same interest as you in a few hours .
You can talk to anyone else on Earth , via Skype , for as long as you like , for nothing .
If global warming gives us that long , the long - term implications will take centuries to tease out , but for most of us the effects have been felt at first in our personal lives .
It has cut straight to one of the most intimate relationships we have – how to find a partner .
In 2001 , I met my then - boyfriend online , and we were too embarrassed to tell anyone that that was how we 'd met .
Today , every singleton seems to have a portfolio of dating profiles : five million people in Britain alone are currently seeking love online , and 15 per cent of couples met in cyberspace .
It has made dating more likely to succeed and simultaneously more brutal .
In the past , you had to hope that your friends would somehow introduce you to a suitable person , or that you would magically bump into them in a club .
Today , you can find the four other people who like Salman Rushdie novels , or hiking in the Lake District , or reiki " healing " , on www.mybestfriend.com.
But I suspect that at the same time dating has become more like shopping for men or women : we have become more ruthless in assessing people according to a checklist – too bland !
Not rich enough !
Too posh ! – and dismissing the chance of a chalk - and - cheese attraction .
The internet has transformed the way we interact with our friends , too .
When I sent that first email I was at university , and my main way of communicating with my friends if their phone was off was to leave a written note – on a piece of paper !
– on their door .
When I told this to my 10 - year - old nephew , he gasped , as if I was describing how we had to hunt and kill our own food and then cook it on an open fire built from damp twigs .
Now , we are " in touch " with our friends more than ever : I can tell you what Jess had for lunch , what Rob is listening to at the moment , and how Chris is getting on with his holiday in France .
But I have n't actually spoken to them : I have glimpsed their Facebook or Twitter feeds , while myself listening to the radio , brushing my teeth , or trying to write this article .
Social networking sites are a genuinely new way of interacting : you can feel close to somebody without actually speaking to them from one month to the next .
It also keeps people in your orbit who would normally have slipped away .
I know , for example , that the girl I used to sit next to at primary school has spilled coffee on her laptop three hours ago , and a woman I met at a checkpoint in Gaza is glad Lloyd was voted off The X Factor .
At some point in my life , some of these people will loop back into real interaction with me , maybe , but for now they remain a constant comforting source of inane babble .
But is it more ?
Recently , an old friend I had n't seen for 10 years committed suicide .
I instinctively went to her Facebook page , and so , it seemed , had everyone else who knew her , leaving messages of regret and love and loss .
I found myself reading over her old status updates .
She was clearly trying to communicate pain and isolation – but we all missed it , leaving inane comments and thumbs up and tossed sheep below every plea for help .
Could we have known , if we had read it less casually ?
Or am I projecting backwards ?
The contrast between the transitory nature of a Facebook status update and the permanence of death made me wonder if all this social networking is actually a way of keeping people at a distance – a way of having a " friend " but not having any of the commitments and duties of friendship .
When the sci - fi novelist William Gibson first put forward the notion of " cyberspace " , he described it as a " consensual hallucination " , where we pretend we are together , when in reality we are alone .
It seemed true that night .
And yet , and yet ... the internet has a way of drawing people together who would previously have wandered around unconnected .
Obsessed with 17th - century Bulgarian furniture ?
Or the theme tune to The Littlest Hobo ?
Or the diplomatic history between Germany and Angola ?
Before , you would have talked only to yourself .
Today , there is a message board waiting for you , filled with like - minded people .
And yes , it often does translate into " real " meetings .
Just look at www.meetup.com or the dozens of sites where people with shared niches are meeting and becoming friends or falling in love .
It 's a starburst of human connections .
My favourite are " flashmobs " – groups of people who gather in a public place , at a time previously agreed online , to do something gorgeously silly .
I have seen a huge adult pillow fight in Belfast , a party on the Circle Line to celebrate the last night you were allowed to drink alcohol on the Tube , and a mass moonwalk at Liverpool Street station in memory of Michael Jackson .
But there 's a vicious downside too .
Before , paedophiles who wanted to swap porn , or anorexic girls who wanted to swap tips on how to starve themselves , or Coldplay fans , would have been isolated too .
The chances of meeting another person like them were vanishingly small .
Today they , too , come together at a click of a mouse .
The internet gathers the good , the bad , and the ugly , all alike .
2 .
Perhaps the most overwhelming aspect of the web is the sheer tsunami of information it contains .
Today , every laptop with an internet connection contains more information than the Great Library of Alexandria .
At its peak , that library contained 700,000 books , until the Christian Emperor Theodosius I ordered it burned down in 39 ( 12A ) D ; today , Google Books has over seven million – and that 's before you count everything else online .
In 1941 , Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short story imagining a " total library " containing all written information .
Seventy years later , it exists .
It 's hard to conceive of how privileged we are as the first generation of human beings who , for almost no cost , can pore through everything previous generations of humans have written down .
People travelled for thousands of miles and fought and died to get access to information we have , just a mouse - click away .
The truth is more accessible then ever .
At the height of the Vietnam War , only a few obscure bookshops stocked the critical writings of Noam Chomsky .
Today , every voter can read his deconstruction of the Afghan and Iraq wars for free – although it still has to contend with the endless machine of bogus news that dominates our discourse .
Yet the internet can at times seem to promote the spread of lies faster than the truth : the " movements " of 9/11 Truthers or Obama - is n 't - American " Birthers " have thrived in the bowels of the web .
Rumours and misinformation that would previously have passed through a few hundred people now fan out to millions and become regarded as Received Truths .
There 's an irony in the fact that Al Gore – who played a crucial role in bringing the internet to us – became the first major victim of this internet tendency to amplify lies and let them multiply .
As a Senator in the 1980s , Al Gore was fascinated by a system of connecting computers that he discovered had been pioneered by the Pentagon .
He was instrumental in getting funding for them to experiment in using this more widely – and if he had n't , the internet as we know it would n't exist .
When he was running for president in 2000 he understandably bragged about this – but a stream of bloggers falsely quoted him as claiming he had " invented the internet " .
The idea spread , and it was used as one of the main ways to ridicule and discredit him as a " liar " .
But the spreading of lies like slurry is n't unique to the internet : it was the print and broadcast media that told us incessantly Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
Yes , in an ocean of information it 's often hard to separate the bullshit from the clear blue water .
But at least online we have the opportunity to do it : in the old world , you had what the TV or print news gave you , and you had to leave your house and hunt hard for the rest .
But there 's a catch .
We expect this information to be free – no matter what it costs to produce .
This means the beating hearts have been ripped out of the news - paper and record industries .
Their products are scattered across the world for free .
This is obviously good news for the consumer in the short term – but only while enough other people pick up the tab by buying the dead trees and CDs .
As they fall away , there will be a hole left .
We will never know all the news stories that wo n't get written , or the songs that will never be recorded – and there will be many .
But what can be done ?
Attempts to erect pay walls now – as Rupert Murdoch is committed to starting – look like King Canute trying to hold back the flood of cyberspace .
Once it can be digitised , it will be copied .
On the web , information wants to be free – even if it means less of it will be produced .
Just as you are tempted by spin off into digital utopianism , these snags keep pulling you back .
The great 18th - century German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte ( Google him ) saw ahead to the moment all information would be available to everyone when he wrote : " When every useful discovery made at one end of the earth shall be at once made known to all the rest , then , without further interruption , without halt or regress , humanity shall move forward to a higher culture of which we can at present form no conception . "
But presented with all this information and all this knowledge , what is the single biggest thing we turn the internet to provide ?
Porn .
Half of all web traffic is to sex sites .
As the musical Avenue Q puts it : " Why do you think the net was born ?
/ Porn , porn , porn / So grab your dick and double - click / The internet is for porn . "
Before , porn was something you had to seek out , in highly embarrassing circumstances , and it was soft - core .
( I saw porn twice in my teenage years ; I remember both times . )
Today , the most hard - core imagery is constantly seeping into your inbox , where the invisible hand of the market is offering to you an invisible round - the - clock hand job .
How is this changing us ?
There is something healthy about openly sexual images breaking into puritanical societies : half of all Saudi men , for example , watch online porn , even as women are forced to cover their faces outside .
Yet porn injects teenagers at an impressionable age with wildly unrealistic expectations of sex .
Go to any provincial city centre club on a Saturday night and you 'll see plenty of teenage girls harming themselves by trying to live up to it .
And what about the boys ?
Professor Jennings Bryant , a US psychologist , wanted to discover what happens to men when they are exposed to massive amounts of porn .
His test subjects quickly became bored with vanilla porn , and started to seek out more and more extreme strands .
Men who before had said they found violent or rape - fantasy porn unacceptable were soon " enjoying " it .
It suggests a dark side to this Dionysian frenzy that we are only beginning to see .
This endless pornucopia of splayed women is only one way in which the internet addles our attention span .
The journalist Maggie Jackson observed that the internet has reduced us to a kind of mass ADHD , writing : " The way we live is eroding our capacity for deep , sustained , perceptive attention – the building block of intimacy , wisdom , and cultural progress . "
It 's not hard to understand what she means .
In the time I have been writing this article , I have received 36 emails , four texts , two phone calls , and seven instant messenger chat requests .
We live in a state of " permanent partial attention " , where we are trying to focus on five different windows at once .
But as human beings , we 're not very good at it .
We evolved to focus on one big task at a time .
We can adjust to a degree : if you look at brain scans of " digital natives " – kids who were born in the internet age – they look different to us " digital migrants " , who came to it as adults .
They can focus on more scattered distractions for longer .
But we can only adjust so far .
Researchers at Loughborough University recently found it takes 64 seconds for a person to recover their train of thought after it is interrupted by an email .
If you check your email every five minutes , you lose 8.5 hours a week .
At times , it feels like we are all desperately trying to recover our lost thread , before the next email hits .
That 's why , much as I love the internet , I try to keep myself on a quite strict digital diet .
I aim to only read my messages once in the morning and once at night .
( I lapsed today , as I do about half the time . )
I do n't own a Blackberry , or even a laptop .
I wo n't get a phone where I could neurotically check my messages .
I try to keep the internet confined to the corner of my work room , and when I fail , I feel my life leaching away from me on Twitter or Google or blogs , while piles of great books go unread .
There 's another strange aspect to internet communication : our systems of etiquette have n't caught up .
I find it much easier to get into arguments with people online than I ever would on the phone , or in the flesh .
It 's partly because you can't hear their tone of voice : you can read hostility where there is none .
( This is one of the reasons we have invented the abhorrent " emoticons " , those smiley or frowning faces made out of punctuation marks .
We need to show people that , however it sounds on a cold screen , we are friendly . )
We write emails as casually as we make a phone call – but we read them with the seriousness with which we take a letter .
Something written in a casual second can be reread and reread for hours .
We need to develop a new system of netiquette – but how ?
From this smorgasbord of small observations , does anything as vast as the changes wrought by Gutenberg become visible , even at any early stage ?
Just as the printing press made new identities – Protestant or national – possible , I think you can see the embryo of new identities emerging online , and then tumbling out into the world .
Here comes another irony : contemporary jihadism defines itself in opposition to modernity , yet it is in part the product of the internet .
If a Muslim boy living in Bradford in 1980 thought he had more in common with a boy in Gaza , he would have been very odd .
Yet today , he can spend all day talking to the boy in Gaza on Skype ; he can watch videos of atrocities in Gaza 24/ 7 ; he can spend most of his time networking with like - minded Islamists scattered across the globe .
The idea of an Umma – a global Muslim community – no longer seems so abstract .
The web has , in turn , made possible a global web of jihad .
Previous violent militants – like , say , the IRA – were shaped like national armies , with military command at the top , and footsoldiers at the bottom .
Al - Qa'ida is shaped like the internet : it is a diffuse group of loosely associated people with no central organising hub .
This kind of passionate post-national identity could flourish in other instances – like in a global environmental movement , for example ( although this would obviously be morally the opposite of al - Qa'ida ) .
I suspect this will be one of the trends that only grows from here , the dawn of the web .
The internet collapses space and time , in ways that will change the world 's politics .
Yet there is a fight looming about whether the internet will remain open enough to achieve this , or any of its greatest potential .
Today , we have a doctrine called " net neutrality " , which means all internet servers have to treat websites alike .
Once you are online , you get treated the same , whether you are the BBC or a blogger in an attic in Mumbai .
We can all plug and play .
But the telecoms corporations want to change this .
They are demanding the right to charge companies to have faster - streaming sites .
So ( say ) Facebook could pay a premium to ensure it will load quickly , while any site you set up would take ages and have patchier service .
John McCain is leading the charge for the telecoms companies – and , by a strange coincidence , he is the single biggest recipient of their political donations .
As Al Gore put it , these proposals threaten " the very fabric of the net " .
If they succeed , the egalitarian ethos of the web will be badly dented .
As I was trying to think through all the ambiguities of the internet , I found myself haunted by a thought .
What if you logged on tomorrow and the internet had vanished ?
In 2007 , the Russian government punished Estonia for removing a Soviet war memorial by launching a " cyberwar " – a bombardment of hacking and viruses that brought their computers down for weeks .
The country was in chaos .
Their banking , government and business all existed online .
Without their machines , they were paralysed .
What if somebody could do the same everywhere and bring the internet down worldwide ?
Would we be relieved to be suddenly freed from the endless pings of pointless emails ?
Would we find our concentration spans mysteriously widening again ?
Would we start to look at the people around us with a clear gaze , rather than at a torrent of status updates ?
Would we see the newspaper and record industries rise again , as people had to pay for their goods once more ?
Maybe .
But I suspect we would we feel oddly alone if the great global conversation with 3.2 billion other people – the conversation that has defined the Noughties – went dead .

The men's bid for asylum was thrown out by a judge
Two men have been jailed after becoming the first in the UK to be convicted of inciting racial hatred via a foreign website .
Simon Sheppard , 51 , of Selby in North Yorkshire , received four years and 10 months , and Stephen Whittle , 42 , of Preston , two years and four months .
The men printed leaflets and controlled US websites featuring racist material .
They fled to the US after being convicted at Leeds Crown Court last year , but failed in an asylum bid .
Sheppard , of Brook Street , Selby , was found guilty of 11 offences and Whittle , of Avenham Lane , Preston , was found guilty of five offences at a trial in July last year .
Such offences as these have , by their very nature , the potential to cause grave social harm
Judge Rodney Grant
The neo -Nazi asylum seekers Sheppard was convicted of a further five charges in January 2009 .
However , before the jury in the first trial could return verdicts , both men fled to Los Angeles International airport and attempted to claim political asylum .
Their bid was thrown out by a US immigration judge .
The men were charged with publishing and distributing racially inflammatory material , and possessing racially inflammatory material with a view to distribution .
Leeds Crown Court was told
Whittle wrote offensive articles that were then published on the internet by Sheppard .
The published material included images of murdered Jews alongside cartoons and articles ridiculing ethnic groups .
Judge Rodney Grant told the men their material was " abusive and insulting " and had the potential to cause " grave social harm " .
He added : " Such offences as these have , by their very nature , the potential to cause grave social harm , particularly in a society such as ours which has , for a number of years now , been multi-racial .
' Groundbreaking case '
" These are serious offences .
I can say without any hesitation that I have rarely seen , or had to read or consider , material which is so abusive and insulting ... towards racial groups within our own society . "
The investigation into Sheppard began when a complaint about a leaflet , called " Tales of the Holohoax " , was reported to police in 2004 after it was pushed through the door of a synagogue in Blackpool .
It was traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard .
Humberside Police later found a website featuring racially inflammatory material .
The pair thought that they could circumvent English law because their website was hosted in the US .
That , said Adil Khan , head of diversity and community cohesion at Humberside Police , makes their conviction a first .
" This case is groundbreaking , " he said .
" The fact is now that we 've been able to demonstrate that you 've got nowhere to hide ; people have been hiding on [ sic ] the fact that this server was in the US .
" Inciting racial hatred is a crime and one which seems to occur too regularly .
This kind of material will not be tolerated as this lengthy investigation shows . "

Stephen Watt ( alias JimJones / Unix Terrorist / PHC/etc ) was sentenced to 2 years in prison for his role in writing the blablah sniffer used by the folks involved in the TJX credit card incident .
From wired magazine
" While accused TJX hacker kingpin Albert Gonzalez awaits a possible sentence of 17 years or more in prison , one of his best friends and accomplices was sentenced on Tuesday in Boston to two years for his role in what the feds are calling “ the largest identity theft in our nation ’s history . ”
Stephen Watt , a 25 - year - old former Morgan Stanley software engineer , pleaded guilty last December to creating a custom sniffing program dubbed “ blabla ” that Gonzalez and other hackers used to siphon millions of credit and debit card numbers from TJX ’s network .
The breach cost TJX $ 200 million , according to its 2009 SEC filing .
Watt ’s lawyer had sought a sentence of probation .
But instead the 7 - foot - tall coder who once had a bright professional future got two years in federal prison and three years of probation .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney ’s office in Massachusetts said the judge also ordered Watt to pay restitution to TJX in the amount of $ 171.5 million . "

MANCHESTER will join some of the world 's biggest cities with a firework display to bring in the new decade .
The free , family event will take place in Exchange Square , in the city centre , on New Year 's Eve .
It is only the second year the city has put on an official event , on December 31 , since the Millennium .
Revellers enjoyed a ten - minute display last year following pressure for a public celebration .
In years before that , hundreds of people would routinely gather outside the town hall to celebrate New Year 's Eve – only to be greeted by a solitary rocket on the stroke of midnight .
World Tourist Attractions , who owns the square 's Wheel of Manchester , will fund this year 's £ 50,000 display to send out ' the noughties ' and welcome 2010 .
The winners of festive council - run talent contest Yule Tube – which is searching for ten acts to deliver the city 's Christmas message to the world – will be shown on the big screen as part of the celebrations .
Pat Karney , the council 's city centre spokesman , said : “ You do n’t need to go to Sydney , New York or even Edinburgh to welcome in the new decade in style – the best party is going to be right here in Manchester .
“ I do n’t know of any other English city which is going to be putting on a show as good as what we have planned – this is going to be the big one . ”

Apparently on a quest to to provide every Internet - related service itself , Google has now added the Google Public DNS service .
The search giant claims performance benefits for many users ( depending on their geographic / network location ) and security benefits for everyone who adopts the new service .
So should we all dive into our network settings and point our computers away from our ISP 's DNS servers and towards Google's ?
Not necessarily .
For almost two decades , the Internet did n't have a Domain Name System , and the translation from human - friendly names into the IP addresses that computers and routers use to make packets flow to the right destination happened through a local file on each computer .
In the late 1980s , a distributed system was created for this purpose : the DNS .
8.8.8.8
The distribution is possible through a hierarchical naming scheme , where different organizations manage different parts of the namespace .
So the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) manages the " root " or starting point of the system .
A set of root servers know which addresses the servers for the next level in the hierarchy live on : the Top Level Domains ( TLDs ) , such as .com , .net , and .jp .
The TLD servers in turn know where to find the servers that contain the information for the names registered under the TLD in question .
So the .com servers point to the google.com and arstechnica.com servers .
Those servers are the ones that know which address maps to www.google.com, mail.google.com , and the like .
It would be rather time - consuming to follow the entire delegation chain from the root servers through the TLD DNS servers and the DNS servers for the domain in question every time a browser wants to load a page , an image , or send an e-mail .
To avoid this , ISPs , many businesses , schools , and so on have caching nameservers .
Those follow the delegation chain to find a name - to - address mapping the first time , but then cache this information for some time .
Google Public DNS is a large set of those caching DNS servers placed around the world .
Interestingly , even though the number of caching DNS servers is apparently quite high , Google only uses two addresses for them : 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 .
( It looks like Google turned to Level3 to get some easy to remember addresses for this purpose , rather than use addresses out of their own , less - memorable address ranges . )
The routing system simply delivers packets addressed to either address to the closest Google Public DNS location .
So users in different places around the world will be talking to different instances of these addresses , making for faster round - trip times , which is important for good DNS performance .
This mechanism is called anycast .
Google uses clusters of servers at each of the anycast locations that collectively cache information , allowing requests to be rerouted from one server in the cluster to another .
This provides better caching and thus better performance than simply distributing incoming DNS queries over a set of independently operating servers .
Additionally , they 've developed a system that can refresh information that is about to expire ( all DNS records contain a " time to live " value ) , rather than removing stale information and then having to do a lengthy lookup when it 's requested again by a user .
The DNS protocol has some flaws that make it possible for attackers to inject false information in a DNS server cache , allowing the attacker to make users load pages of the attacker 's choice for a given domain name .
This can result in anything from unexpected porn banners on normally clean sites to phishing of bank logins .
The most recent DNS software is mostly resistant to this , but it's an ongoing battle until DNSSEC is widely deployed .
Open recursive ( caching ) DNS servers are especially vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks , but Google has implemented several mechanisms to counter these , including one system that was n't adopted in the IETF because there are some problems with it ( randomizing the case in DNS names ) .
Apparently Google is prepared to see how big these problems are in practice for the benefit of the IETF .
Unfortunately , despite the anycasting , advanced caching , and extensive security features , Google Public DNS is not the ideal DNS service .
For one thing , it 's not called " experimental " for nothing .
From my home , I can't reach 8.8.8.8 .
Packets end up ping - ponging between the addresses 9.9.9.18 and 9.9.9.17 .
Apparently some routing engineer at Google is a bit dyslexic .
( It does work from another location that I have access to . )
Also , despite Google 's claim that it provides NXDOMAIN responses whenever a domain name does n't exist , its servers actually respond with REFUSED when looking up a name that goes with a private address ( such as in the 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x ranges ) .
My Mac does n't seem to like this , so it keeps repeating those requests over and over .
OpenDNS , which also runs a network of public , open DNS servers , does n't have this problem .
OpenDNS also allows users to set up malware blocking and NXDOMAIN redirection through a dashboard .
You also generally do n't want to hard - configure your laptop or smartphone to use a fixed set of DNS servers , but rather use the ones provided locally at each place where you connect to the network .
This avoids the situation where the hardcoded DNS servers have bad performance , are blocked , or are improperly anycasted .
( Note that under Mac OS X , you can have different " locations " with different network settings , and you can set one up with automatic DNS configuration and one with Google Public DNS or OpenDNS . )
However , if your ISP 's DNS servers do n't perform well , it can be useful to set up alternative DNS servers in your local router or DHCP server , and computers and other devices will use it automatically without having to be configured .
Google 's setup instructions walk you through the process .
Last but not least , there 's the privacy aspect .
Two people that I talked to immediately brought this up : " Google already sees enough of my ' Net activity , thankyouverymuch . "
If that 's a concern of yours , Google has an extensive privacy page to set your mind at ease .
Dr Andrew Marshall , from the Environment Department at the University of York , first spotted the animal while surveying monkeys in the Magombera Forest when he disturbed a twig snake eating one .
The specimen was collected , tested and compared to two others found by scientists in the same area and has now been named Kinyongia magomberae ( the Magombera chameleon ) in research published in the African Journal of Herpetology .
Dr Marshall is co-author of the study alongside researchers from the Museo Tridentino di Scienze Naturali , the South African National Biodiversity Institute , Anglia Ruskin University and the University of Stellenbosch .
He said : " Discovering a new species is a rare event so to be involved in the identification and naming of this animal is very exciting .
" Chameleon species tend to be focused in small areas and , unfortunately , the habitat this one depends on , the Magombera Forest , is under threat .
Hopefully this discovery will support efforts to provide this area and others like it with greater protection . "
Dr Marshall , who is also Director of Conservation Science at the Flamingo Land theme park and zoo , is leading a research project investigating changes in the Magombera Forest .
The forest is an important resource for people in the area and home to wildlife , including endangered red colobus monkeys .
The project combines research into the biology of the forest with education for local people on how to manage it in a more sustainable way .
The ultimate aim is to develop protected status for the forest and find alternative ways of meeting the needs of local communities .
BOSTON , Dec. 3 ( UPI ) -- Retail giant Wall - Mart Stores Inc. settled a class-action lawsuit in Massachusetts by agreeing to pay $ 40 million to 87,500 employees for wages owed .
The suit , filed in 2001 , accused the world 's largest retailer of manipulating time cards , refusing to allow workers to go on breaks and failing to pay overtime , The Boston Globe reported Thursday .

In the settlement , both sides agreed not to comment on the case .
However , attorney Philip Gordon , who represented the employees , said in a filed affidavit the settlement " finally pays them their earned wages and it puts in place systems and processes to ensure that abuses like those alleged never happen again . "
The settlement includes payment to employees who worked between August 1995 and the settlement date .
Payments ranged from $ 400 to $ 2,500 , the newspaper said .
NO INDUSTRY spends more on information technology ( IT ) than financial services : about $ 500 billion globally , more than a fifth of the total ( see chart ) .
Many of the world 's computers , networking and storage systems live in the huge data centres run by banks .
“ Banks are essentially technology firms , ” says Hugo Banziger , chief risk officer at Deutsche Bank .
Yet the role of IT in the crisis is barely discussed .
It should be .
Corporate IT systems — collections of computers , applications and databases — always tend to be messy , but those of banks are particularly bad .
They were the first to adopt computers : decades - old mainframes are still in use .
Lots of product innovation means new systems , as does merger activity , which has proliferated in the industry in recent years : Citigroup had a notoriously fragmented IT set - up going into the crisis .
The need to comply with regulations , and the global presence of big banks , adds complexity .
The demands of financial markets make matters worse .
Hedging positions , trading derivatives and modelling financial products all require highly sophisticated programs that are only really suited to specific asset classes .
The code for new financial products has to be developed quickly .
Innovation often takes place on Excel spreadsheets on traders ' desktops .
“ The big task of management is to manage down the number of spreadsheets , ” says one risk chief , whose bank creates 1,000 product variations a year .
As a result , many banks have huge problems with data quality .
The same types of asset are often defined differently in different programs .
Numbers do not always add up .
Managers from different departments do not trust each other 's figures .
Finding one 's way through all these systems is detective work , says a former IT manager at a big British bank .
“ And sometimes the trail would go cold . ”
This fragmented IT landscape made it exceedingly difficult to track a bank 's overall risk exposure before and during the crisis .
Mainly as a result of the Basel 2 capital accords , many banks had put in new systems to calculate their aggregate exposure .
Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) spent more than $ 100 m to comply with Basel 2 .
But in most cases the aggregate risk was only calculated once a day and some figures were not worth the pixels they were made of .
During the turmoil many banks had to carry out big fact - finding missions to see where they stood .
“ Answering such questions as ‘ What is my exposure to this counterparty ? ' should take minutes .
But it often took hours , if not days , ” says Peyman Mestchian , managing partner at Chartis Research , an advisory firm .
Insiders at Lehman Brothers say its European arm lacked an integrated picture of its risk position in the days running up to its demise .
Whether the financial industry would have hit the brakes if it had had digital dashboards showing banks ' overall exposures in real time is a moot point .
Some managers might not have even looked .
And better IT would have done little to counteract the bigger forces behind the crisis , such as global economic imbalances .
Illustration by S. Kambayashi
Yet most in the industry agree that its woeful IT systems have , in Mr Banziger 's words , “ exacerbated the crisis ” .
The industry spent billions on being able to trade faster and make more money , but not nearly enough on creating the necessary transparency .
“ Banks had lots of tools to create leverage , but not many to manage risk , ” says Roger Portnoy of Daylight Venture Partners , a venture - capital firm that invests in risk - management start - ups .
Technology may have contributed to the crisis in other ways .
IT systems have led to a “ deskilling of the risk process ” , says Steve O'Sullivan of Accenture , a consultancy .
At one end of the credit chain , bank employees were not given the proper incentives to review on - screen loan - application forms ( a big British bank once had a surprising number of “ astronauts ” applying for loans because the job description was the first choice on a pull - down menu , says a former employee ) .
At the other end , computer - generated risk numbers gave executives a false sense of security .
Others think that IT has played an even more fundamental role in the crisis .
Because things are so interconnected , largely thanks to technology , a problem in one part of the system can quickly lead to problems elsewhere .
The global financial markets have evolved over the years into an inherently unstable network , says Till Guldimann , a strategist at SunGard , a software and IT services firm .
The rapid unwinding of positions by ultra -fast quantitative - trading programs at the start of the credit crunch in August 2007 is one example of this cascading effect .
Have chastened bankers learned their lesson ?
Some are now spending a lot of money on building integrated systems of the kind that a few banks , such as Deutsche , JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , had in place before the crisis .
Deutsche does not dump all its trading information into what is called a “ data warehouse ” and then painstakingly sift through it when need arises .
Instead , the firm has developed a system of “ feeds ” that give it access to information in almost real - time .
But many other banks are still in firefighting mode , says Mr Mestchian .
Much of the money invested in IT still goes into making things faster rather than more transparent .
And there is a question - mark over whether the biggest banks will ever really be able to get their systems in order .
Many banks have become too complex to be managed properly , says Glenn Woodcock , a director at Andromeda Capital Management and a former head of credit - risk infrastructure at RBS .
IT alone cannot fix that problem for them .

Ursaring ( Japanese : リングマ Ringuma ) is a Normal - type Pokémon introduced in Generation II .
It evolves from Teddiursa starting at level 30 .
Biology
Ursaring is a bipedal , ursine Pokémon .
Its broad body is covered in brown fur , except its muzzle , inner ears , and paw pads , which are a light tan .
It has narrow eyes , a triangular , black nose , and a wide mouth with small , visible fangs in the upper jaw .
The fur on Ursaring 's shoulders is longer and more structured , with rectangular extensions that resemble epaulettes .
A female Ursaring has longer fur on its shoulders than a male .
There is a large , tan , ring - shaped mark on its chest .
Ursaring 's forelimbs are long , ending in five claws each , while its hind legs are short and thick , ending in three claws each .
Its tail is large and spherical in shape .
Ursaring lives in mountainous forests , sleeping in treetops and gathering food throughout the day .
While it is skilled at climbing trees , it gathers food by snapping them and collecting whatever berries or fruits fall down .
It will mark trees bearing delicious fruit in its territory with its claws .
Ursaring 's sense of smell can distinguish any aroma , and as such , it can find food buried deep underground or in streams .
As demonstrated in the anime , Ursaring is highly protective of its young , and has been shown to become more aggressive during mating season .

Peter Sanders , Wall Street Journal : Boeing Co. said Thursday it had finished fixing the problem that had forced it to postpone the maiden flight of its long - delayed 787 Dreamliner .
But in making the repair , the aerospace giant got a fresh reminder of the complexities involved in working with the high - tech materials used to build the aircraft .
Damage to the area where the wings join the plane 's body emerged during stress testing earlier this year .
That prompted Boeing to delay flight testing of the aircraft and urgently search for a repair .
As Boeing raced to find a remedy this summer , it discovered another issue with the composite material in the plane 's wings , according to internal company documents and a person familiar with the matter .
Metal bolts inside the wings of one of the six test airplanes were found to have slightly damaged the surrounding material — causing so - called delamination , or cracking — the documents show .

on Tuesday testified he paid more than $ 15,000 for his wife to receive a plastic surgery procedure on her stomach , explaining how she nearly died during child birth several years ago and developed a severe hernia as a result of a Cesarean section .
The former Mayor of Detroit said his insurance would not cover a procedure to repair the damage .
" I wanted to make her feel beautiful .
That 's what that was . "
The testimony came as Kilpatrick answered questions from his attorney after days of grilling from prosecutors in a hearing on his restitution payments to the City of Detroit , a condition of his 2008 plea deal on charges of obstruction of justice and assault .
he wrote a series of cashier 's checks on April 9 to the Plastic Surgery Center of Dallas and an anesthesiologist .
That , just weeks after his attorney on March 24 filed a motion to reduce his monthly restitution payments from $ 6,000 to $ 3,000 a month .
" As far as my wife is concerned , ' Whatever you want , I 'll do it , ' " Kilpatrick testified Tuesday , later clarifying the request must be within reason .
While he discussed housing options with Carlita as the family prepared to move to Texas , Kilpatrick said he only recently learned of the final lease price she negotiated on their 5,886 - square - foot house .

" It was a miracle for me to even be in that home . "

Democratic commission recommends elimination of superdelegates
Eighteen months removed from a protracted presidential primary fight , a Democratic group convened to examine the nominating process has recommended that so - called superdelegates be eliminated .
The Democratic Change Commission , which was formed last August by President Barack Obama , plans to recommend that superdelegates -- also known as unpledged delegates -- will be required to vote in accordance with the electoral performance of the state from which they represent .
" We need to show deference to what the party members in our state have done , " said Missouri Sen .
Claire McCaskill , one of the co-chairs of the commission .
The elimination of free - agent superdelegates comes in response to the outcry from many within the party during the 2008 primary fight when then Sen .
Hillary Clinton made the argument to unpledged delegates that it was their responsibility to not vote as their state had voted but rather cast their votes for the candidate they thought would be the best person to represent the party .
Obama allies insisted this was an attempt to suborn the will of the people .
Clinton loyalists shot back that the creation of superdelegates was for just such a purpose -- a close race in which the will of the people is very closely divided .
The creation of superdelegates -- members of the Democratic National Committee , House Members and Senators and former party leaders -- in the early 1980s was designed to give the establishment of the Democratic party more say in the identity of the nominee .
Since their creation , superdelegates had never been a serious factor in a presidential race until the 2008 contest .
The Commission included several Obama loyalists including Jeff Berman , who spearheaded the delegate operation for the campaign , and David Plouffe who managed the then Illinois Senator 's candidacy .
North Carolina state Sen. Dan Blue , a member of the Commission , offered a dissenting voice on a call announcing the proposed changes .
" There is no escape when something unforeseen occurs , " said Blue of the potential consequences of eliminating unpledged delegates .
The Change Commission recommendations will now go before the Democratic National Committee 's Rules and Bylaws Committee .

THE DEPROLIFERATOR —
Most who champion nuclear disarmament were heartened by the election of Barack Obama .
His apparent abhorrence of nuclear weapons seemed forged in The Day After eighties .
Hopes soared after he delivered his celebrated Prague speech in April outlining his vision for a nuclear - free world .
The first step — negotiations on a treaty to continue the work of the recently expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) — may not have met the December deadline , but the treaty ’s conclusion is seen as imminent .
The new , improved model of START , the New York Times reports , “ would require each side to reduce deployed strategic nuclear warheads to roughly 1,600 [ and ] strategic bombers [ and ] missiles to below 800 . ”
Still , “ Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said on Thursday that there had been ‘ some slowing down ’ in negotiations by the other side . ”
According to the Moscow Times , he had urged U.S. officials to accept even deeper cuts .
Hmm , says the United States as it looks a gift horse in the mouth .
Turns out where teeth should be are the dreaded “ less intrusive verification measures . ”
Resolving those differences , though , could lead to subsequent negotiations for an even more ambitious treaty .
This one , reports the New York Times , “ would reduce the number of deployed [ as well as stored ] strategic warheads even further , perhaps to about 1,000 for each country . ”
Oddly enough , lowering the number of the smaller nuclear warheads , known as tactical ( ostensibly for battlefield use ) poses a stumbling block .
In fact , as the Arms Control Association ’s Daryl Kimball told the Times , agreeing on their reduction would make the START follow - up “ look like a walk in the park . ”
Seconding him , the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center ’s Henry Sokolski said , “ The idea that [ the Russians ] would give these things up lightly is a fool ’s errand . ”
( Never mind that an idea ca n’t be an errand . )
For starters , Russia views tactical nuclear weapons as a way for it to compensate for conventional supremacy on the part of the United States .
Neither is the NATO alliance , which sees tactical nukes as a token of U.S. affection , in any rush to wave them bye - bye .
For its part , Russia also just conducted a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ominously code - named “ Satan ” by NATO ) .
This was on the heels of a failed launch earlier this month that left a plume of light over Norway earlier this month .
Furthermore , according to Global Security Newswire , “ Russia intends to deploy a new nuclear - capable strategic bomber between 2025 and 2030 . ”
As if all that were n’t enough , Russia ’s new nuclear weapons doctrine might “ permit Moscow to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear attack ” ( also known as first use ) .
Between Russia ’s new bomber , first use , disagreements over verification procedures , and its tactical nukes ( as well as Europe ’s reliance on those ) , we can be excused our skepticism about a follow - up to the START agreement , not to mention a follow - up to the follow - up .
At least as troubling , from the point of view of the United States , what ’s to keep the START treaty from winding up as watered down as President Obama ’s feeble attempts at bank and healthcare reform ?

Diver in intensive care after being stung by deadly jellyfish the size of a peanut
A man is in intensive care after diving face - first into an extremely venomous , peanut - sized jellyfish in waters off north - east Australia .
The 29 - year - old , whose name has not been released , was flown to a hospital intensive care unit to treat the potentially fatal sting .
He was diving off a yacht near South Molle Island off Queensland when the accident happened .
Critical condition : A 29 - year - old man is in intensive care after diving face - first into the deadly Irukandji jellyfish ( pictured ) , which is the size of a peanut
As a precaution , he had been wearing a full - length ' stinger suit ' , a lightweight version of a wetsuit that covers everything but the face , feet and hands .
It helps protect against venomous jellyfish that are common in northern Australia 's waters during the Southern Hemisphere summer .
But when he dove into the water near South Molle Island , he was immediately stung in the face by a potentially lethal Irukandji jellyfish .
He was taken back to the island , where a rescue team rushed to his aid .
' The crew said he was shivering and in shock and in a great deal of pain , ' Central Queensland Helicopter Rescue Service spokeswoman Leonie Hansen said .
The man , from Brisbane , was in serious condition today at Mackay Base Hospital in Mackay , 600 miles north of Brisbane , a hospital spokeswoman said .
Australia is well - known for its myriad deadly creatures , but the Irukandji remains rather mysterious .
It is a distant relative of the more notorious and widely feared box jellyfish , the sting of which can kill an adult within two minutes .
But the Irukandji is virtually impossible to see and is tiny enough to pass through nets meant to keep jellyfish away from popular swimming spots .
Scenic :
The victim was diving off a yacht near South Molle island off Queensland when the accident happened
The jellyfish 's sting can lead to ' Irukandji syndrome ' , a set of symptoms that includes shooting pains in the muscles and chest , vomiting , restlessness and anxiety .
Some symptoms can last for more than a week , and the syndrome can occasionally lead to a rapid rise in blood pressure and heart failure .
In 2002 , two tourists were killed in separate incidents after being stung by the tiny creatures off northeast Australia - the first recorded Irukandji fatalities .
But because the jellyfish leave almost no mark on their victims , scientists believe they are responsible for many deaths that were attributed as drownings or heart attacks , said marine biologist Lisa Gershwin , who has spent 11 years studying the animals .
' It 's extremely serious , ' Gershwin said .
' One of the very worst stings I 've ever seen - sting as in permanent heart damage - was just three dots on the finger . '
The most common Irukandji measures just ten millimetres in length and has tentacles as thin as a strand of hair that can grow up to one metre , Gershwin said .
Scientists still do n't know whether it's the Irukandji 's body or tentacles that cause Irukandji syndrome , she said .
Even more discomforting for swimmers : there is no anti-venom , and people generally do n't realise they 've been stung at first .
The initial sting causes little pain , and it may be up to half an hour before a victim starts to feel the effects .
And those effects , Gershwin says , can be disastrous , with some stings causing blood pressures to soar as high as 280 over 180 .
The creatures are found worldwide , from North Wales to Cape Town in South Africa , Gershwin said .

Plastic bottles were ceremoniously removed from shelves in the sleepy Australian town of Bundanoon at the weekend as a ban on commercially - bottled water – believed to be a world first – came into force .
The ban , which is supported by local shopkeepers , means bottled water can no longer be bought in the town in the Southern Highlands , two hours from Sydney .
Instead , reusable bottles have gone on sale , which can be refilled for free at new drinking fountains .
Locals marched through the town on Saturday , led by a lone piper , to celebrate the start of the ban .
John Dee , a campaign spokesman , said : " While our politicians grapple with the enormity of dealing with climate change , what Bundanoon shows is that at the very local level we can sometimes do things to bring about real and measurable change . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ban was triggered by a Sydney drinks company 's plan to build a water extraction plant in the town .
Huw Kingston , a cafe owner , said townsfolk were horrified by " the idea of them taking water here , trucking it to Sydney and bringing it back in bottles to be sold in shops at 300 times the tap price " .
Bottled water is widely viewed as an environmental menace , because of the energy consumed in producing and transporting it , and because most bottles end up in landfill sites .
A New South Wales government study found the industry was responsible for releasing 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2006 .
In recent years , dozens of local authorities in Britain and the US have stopped spending public money on bottled water .
But Bundanoon , population 2,000 , is believed to be the first community to ban it completely .
Shelf space previously reserved for bottled water in the town 's supermarket , off - licence , cafes and newsagent is now occupied by the reusable bottles .
Filtered water fountains have been set up in the main street and at the local school ; bottles can also be refilled in shops , for a small fee .
Mr Dee said : " We 're saying to people , you can save money and save the environment at the same time .
The alternative does n't have a sexy brand , does n't have pictures of mountain streams on the front of it .
It comes out of your tap . "
Only two people voted against the ban .
One was concerned it would lead to more sugary drinks being consumed .
The other was Geoff Parker , director of the Australasian Bottled Water Institute .
Prince William to share Queen 's duties : Treasury document reveals secret plan to make him the ' Shadow King '
The Queen is to hand over a substantial part of her public duties to Prince William to help him prepare for the day when he becomes King , according to a confidential document obtained by The Mail on Sunday .
Secret papers reveal that plans to ease the strain on the 83 - year - old monarch and her 88 - year - old husband , Prince Philip , are at an advanced stage .
The disclosures come despite months of denials from the Palace that the Queen was planning to step back from her official work in favour of her 27 - year - old grandson .
Sidelined ?
The move will fuel rumours that the Queen believes William , rather than her son Charles , represents the best long - term interests of the monarchy
The information is contained in a briefing note written by Chancellor Alistair Darling ’s Treasury officials about new financial arrangements for Prince Charles and his sons .
Key paragraphs , disclosing the reason for the changes , are blacked out .
But this newspaper has obtained an uncensored version of the document which confirms that the Queen is grooming William as a ‘ Shadow King ’ .
Burden : The Queen , now aged 83 , is said to need relief from some duties
One blacked - out line states that ‘ the Princes [ William and Harry ] will increasingly incur expenditure when undertaking engagements on behalf of The Queen ’ .
Another censored section , stressing the key role for William , says that ‘ from next year , it is expected that HRH The Prince William will spend a significant part of his time on official engagements . . . we need to put the necessary provisions in place in anticipation of that ’.
The leak will add to speculation that the Queen believes William , rather than Charles , represents the best long - term interests of the monarchy , and will raise new questions about the timing of William ’s long - anticipated engagement to his girlfriend Kate Middleton .
The breach of secrecy caused alarm at the Palace last night , with a senior Royal source expressing concern that the private details had been leaked in ‘ unredacted ’ - the official term for uncensored - form .
The reaction reflects the extreme sensitivity over the issue of the Queen ’s future in public life - and how to promote Prince William without undermining the monarch or Prince Charles .
It is bound to lead to new speculation that when the Queen dies , the monarchy could skip a generation , with the Crown bypassing Charles and being handed straight to William , although Royal sources strongly discount this option .
The Treasury document was prepared for Mr Darling in the run-up to April ’s Budget .
The announcement that he was granting Charles tax relief worth hundreds of thousands of pounds , by allowing him to deduct his sons ’ official expenses from his tax return , was slipped out on Budget Day in a separate ministerial note and was picked up by newspapers only several days later .
The tax perk funds an office at St James ’s Palace , with six members of staff , which for the past few months has been organising the affairs of Princes William and Harry .
Previously , the Princes had been represented by Charles ’s staff .
Ominous sign : William in his RAF flying uniform , wants to ' make a difference '
Censored :
The blacked - out words in the Treasury note say ' But as Sir Michael¿s letter sets out , the Princes will increasingly incur expenditure when undertaking engagements on behalf of The Queen '
The briefing note , released following a Freedom of Information request , contained a third blacked - out section which showed that the entire operation to transfer duties to William was orchestrated by the Queen and Prince Charles .
It shows that the approach to the Government was made by Sir Michael Peat , Charles ’s private secretary , who is also a confidant of the Queen .

Publicly , the Palace has denied any plans for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to scale down their responsibilities , always insisting that the pair are in ‘ robust ’ health - although Royal sources have let it be known that the Queen would like other family members to bear much of the burden of her duties during the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 .
Enquiries direct to the Duke about his fitness have been met with a curt : ‘ Do I look bloody ill ? ’

‘ The Palace operates in secrecy , doing deals behind the back of the British people to ensure a smooth transition to the next King .
‘ In addition , we discover that at a time of recession , Charles is secretly lobbying for an exclusive tax break worth hundreds of thousands of pounds a year .
' The fact the Treasury attempted to cover up this lobbying shows they knew it would be scandalous if made public . ’

Iran emphasized supply reduction and interdiction for many years as it tried to contend with the flood of narcotics coming from Afghanistan in the 1990s and the first half of this decade .
This approach was matched with an emphasis on the punishment of people involved with drugs , from addicts to smugglers .
Imprisonment was common , and individuals holding more than 30 grams of heroin or 5 kilograms of opium could be executed .
To this day , the bulk of the Iranian prison population comprises individuals arrested for drug offenses .
For example , 31 percent of the 46,930 people imprisoned in the December - January period were addicts , Justice Minister Jamal Karimirad said in " Farhang - i Ashti " on February 22 , and another 40 percent were imprisoned for drug - related offenses .
Sound Policy ?
Not everybody is convinced of the wisdom of this approach .
Ayatollah Hassan Marashi , who previously served on the High Council for Judicial Development and in the judiciary , said many people who become drug dealers do so out of economic necessity , " Aftab - i Yazd " reported on January 28 .
Arresting and imprisoning such people is counterproductive because their families only sink deeper into poverty and sometimes turn to prostitution .
" Punishment does not correct people 's behavior , " he said .
" We pay no attention to the causes and we merely pursue the effects . "
Nonetheless , arresting addicts continues to be government policy .
Fada - Hussein Maleki , secretary - general of the Drug Control Headquarters , announced a nationwide plan to round up addicts that would begin in the new Iranian year ( after March 21 ) .
Maleki explained that some 3,000 of the addicts on Tehran 's streets are sick , and the overall plan is to detain and treat up to 550,000 of the most dangerous intravenous drug users , " Aftab - i Yazd " reported on January 26 .
Brigadier General Hamid Maleki , a counternarcotics official from the Iranian police , said Iran has spent more than $ 900 million to secure the frontier with Afghanistan and Pakistan by building border posts , watch towers , barbed - wire fences , and trenches .
Meanwhile , consumption habits are changing .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 's ( UNODC ) 2005 - 07 " Strategic Program Framework " for Iran that was released in June notes that opium ( smoked , injected , or consumed in tea ) , opium residue , and cannabis are the commonly abused drugs .
Abuse of heroin is on the rise , according to the UNODC , and it is sniffed , smoked , or injected .
Six months later , Abdullah Roshan , Tehran 's deputy governor for political and security affairs , said the price for compressed heroin ( crack ) has fallen and it is supplanting regular heroin as the drug of choice for addicts , " Aftab - i Yazd " reported on 27 December .
Roshan added that 700,000 tablets of the drug ecstasy had been confiscated in Tehran in the previous nine months .
Iranian officials routinely say there are 1.2 million drug addicts in the country , and an estimated 800,000 people abuse drugs occasionally .
The UNODC says roughly 2 percent of the country 's 68 million residents abuse drugs .
The State Department 's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs says in its " International Narcotics Control Strategy Report -- 2006 , " which was released on March 1 , that an estimated 3 million Iranians abuse opiates , with 60 percent of them addicted and the remaining 40 percent being casual users .
" The latest opiate seizure statistics from Iran suggest Iran is experiencing an epidemic of drug abuse , especially among its youth , " the report says .
Multilateral Initiatives
As it has tried to come to terms with the scale of the drug - control problem it faces , Tehran has become increasingly active in multilateral drug- control bodies -- such as the Dublin Group and the Paris Pact -- and it works closely with the UNODC .
The Dublin Group was established in 1990 as an informal coordination body that meets to exchange views on international drug affairs ( production , trafficking , and abuse ) , make recommendations on ways to contend with these problems , and coordinate members ' approaches to these problems .
Dublin Group members are the European Union , Australia , Canada , Japan , Norway , and the United States , and the UNODC participates in its meetings .

The Mini-Dublin Group for Southwest Asia includes Dublin Group members ' diplomatic representatives in Iran , and its meetings are attended by Iranian officials .
The Mini-Dublin Group works on the drug situation in Iran and related policy initiatives .
In addition to serving as a venue for analyzing priorities , coordinating cooperation , and making recommendations , these meetings serve as a venue for interacting with Iranian drug - control authorities .
Lesley Pallett , chief of the Drugs and International Crime Department at the British Foreign Commonwealth Office , described the Mini-Dublin Group as a " key point of contact " between the Iranian authorities and the international community when she was in Tehran in September .
At a December 5 Mini-Dublin Group meeting in Tehran , Iranian officials stressed the importance of creating a " security belt " around Afghanistan , ISNA reported .
Iranian drug- control chief Fada - Hussein Maleki said the United Kingdom should be able to secure Afghanistan 's borders , with cooperation from the country 's neighbors , because British troops are present in Afghanistan .
Maleki also praised the activities of the UNODC in Iran and said the cooperation of France , Germany , Italy , Iran , and the United Kingdom is increasing .
The Paris Pact is another multilateral drug- control group with which Iran is involved , and Tehran hosted a Paris Pact roundtable on September 13 - 14 .
The Paris Pact started with a meeting of 55 countries in the French capital in May 2003 , when they agreed on the need for strong and coordinated border - control activities and law enforcement along the main drug - trafficking routes .
UNODC subsequently launched the Paris Pact Initiative , with support from France , Italy , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
Counternarcotics enforcement experts , as well as delegations from 20 countries , the EU , the Economic Cooperation Organization , Interpol , and UNODC participated in the September meeting in Tehran .
Opiates trafficking and drug- control activities in Iran were discussed , as were the need to strengthen regional and international cooperation on drug control in Iran .
One of the newer initiatives mentioned at this event was the Nomak Project , which collects and analyses information on Southwest Asia heroin trafficking .
The UNODC has been working with Iran for approximately one decade and has had an office in Tehran since the late - 1990s .
According to its " Strategic Program Framework " for 2005 - 07 , its objectives are to assist Tehran in reducing narcotics trafficking , contribute to prevention , treatment , and rehabilitation in connection with drug abuse and HIV / AIDS , and to promote the rule of law .
UNODC has established quantifiable indicators for measuring the success of its efforts .
Roberto Arbitrio , head of the UNODC office in Tehran , told the September Paris Pact meeting that the strategy for Iran was developed in collaboration with the Mini-Dublin Group and with Iranian authorities .
Brigadier General Hamid Maleki , a counternarcotics official from the Iranian police , told the Paris Pact meeting that his country has spent more than $ 900 million to secure the frontier with Afghanistan and Pakistan by building border posts , watch towers , barbed - wire fences , and trenches .
Iran also trains Afghan border guards and counternarcotics personnel , equips border posts in Afghanistan , and provides motorcycles .
In mid-March , furthermore , the Iranian parliament authorized the government to lend $ 20 million to other countries for demand reduction and counternarcotics activities .
Iranian officials insist that the international community do more to defray the associated costs , because Iranian efforts prevent drugs from reaching Europe .
For example , Mohammad Mehdi Akhundzadeh , the Iranian ambassador in Vienna , said in a December 10 meeting with UNODC chief Antonio Maria Costa that international aid to Iran is " insufficient and trivial , " IRNA reported .
Absent more assistance , Iran works directly with countries that are fighting drugs , particularly Afghanistan .
Drug -control personnel from Iran , Afghanistan , and Pakistan met in Rawalpindi on December 6 to exchange information , Associated Press of Afghanistan reported .
Afghan Counternarcotics Minister Habibullah Qaderi visited Iran on January 3 to meet with his Iranian counterpart , discuss cooperation , and inspect the border , Mashhad radio reported .
Ezzatollah Wasafi , the governor of Farah Province in Afghanistan , visited Iran on January 14 and said he secured Tehran 's pledge to help his administration 's poppy eradication efforts , Mashhad radio reported .
On February 28 , Afghanistan signed an agreement with Iran , China , and Pakistan on border security in an effort to control smuggling , AFP reported .
Qaderi and Maleki met again in Vienna on March 18 , during the meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs ( CND ) , IRNA reported .
While some officials are critical of what they see as inadequate international assistance , others believe something more sinister is behind the drug - abuse problem in Iran .
Ayatollah Mohammad Emami -Kashani said in his February 24 Friday prayers sermon in Tehran , " Another instance of their conspiracy is narcotics , " state radio reported .
He did not identify the alleged conspirators but continued : " They plot methods of importing drugs into our country and promoting such ugly deeds among our youth so as to destroy the backing of Islam and Islamic ideology ....
They hatch plots to ruin our young people . "
At a dinner in Brussels on Thursday , the leaders of the European Union will choose the first President of the European Council .
The signs are that they will vote for Herman Van Rompuy , the prime minister of Belgium and – as we reveal today – a committed believer in just the sort of European federalism that the people of Britain loathe .
Mr Van Rompuy is the architect of his party 's manifesto , which calls for the abolition of " national symbols " in favour of EU licence plates , identity cards , sports events – and the imposition of a European anthem , Beethoven 's Ode to Joy , ripped out of its proper setting in his Ninth Symphony .
Britain thought it had won the battle over the national anthem when the compulsory singing of the Ode was removed from the draft constitution .
But , with Mr Van Rompuy installed in this new office , we can expect it to form part of a massive extension of the presence of the EU in our town halls , schools and at sporting events .

The mallard Anas platyrhynchos : a species with high levels of forced copulations .
Females have very elaborate vaginas ( left ) to counter males ’ phalluses ( right ) .
( Image : Patricia Brennan et al. )
Some female ducks and geese have evolved complex genitalia to thwart unwelcome mating attempts , according to a new study .
Males of some species , such as mallard , have a notorious habit of “ raping ” females .
They and other wildfowl are among the 3 % of bird species whose males have phalluses big enough to insert into the vaginas of females , whether or not the female consents .
Now , in the most detailed analysis yet of duck and goose vaginas , researchers have established that females of these species have evolved vaginal features to thwart unwelcome males .

Tim Birkhead at the University of Sheffield in the UK and colleagues examined vaginas and the corresponding phalluses from 16 wildfowl species .
They discovered that the longer and more elaborate the male member , the longer and more elaborate its female recipient was .
No-entry signs
Some vaginas had spiral channels that would impede sex by twisting in the opposite direction to that of the male phallus .
Others had as many as eight cul - de- sac pouches en route , that could prevent fertilisation by capturing unwelcome sperm .
Moreover , these features were only found in species renowned for forced sex .
All other species had simple male and female genitalia .
“ These structures are wonderfully devious , sending sperm down the wrong road or impeding penetration , ” says Birkhead .
He says that the features demonstrate an evolutionary “ arms race ” in which control over reproduction alternates between the sexes .
If the male develops a longer , more elaborate phallus to force copulation , females wrest back control by developing features to thwart males who rape .
“ It shows that females are not passive in averting exploitation by males with large phalluses , ” says Birkhead .
The study appears in the online version of the journal PLoS ONE .
I feel bad for my neighbors when Curb Your Enthusiasm comes on .
Last week 's " panties " episode had me howling so loudly I 'm sure I woke up the kid downstairs .
And last night 's " table read " boasted so many laugh - out - loud moments I may need to see it again to catch what I missed .
Larry David 's Seinfeld reunion is n't just a good idea that has filled Curb with more humor and energy this season ; the result is way better than if an actual reunion had ever taken place on NBC .
( Warning : Some spoilers ahead . )
Last night we saw Michael Richards make fun of his real - life scandal .
We watched Jason Alexander jam a writing instrument into various orifices .
We saw Jerry Seinfeld hear an incredibly dirty joke .
Julia Louis - Dreyfus uttered the F - word .
Aside from the reunion 's edgier pleasures , it was also fantastic to see Newman , Estelle Costanza , Kenny Bania and the old gang back on the old set .
The plot fits perfectly into David 's wacky world ; seeing Seinfeld alums interact with Marty Funkhauser , Cheryl and , paticularly , Leon , was delightfully cringeworthy .
( " Everything I ate tasted like peaches ! " " I forgot how to multiply ! " ) .
If Curb is n't the best comedy on television right now , it comes pretty close -- pretty , pretty , pretty close .
I 'll be sad to see the season end Sunday ... though I guess the kid downstairs could use the rest .

On the anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks , the Indian government has announced its own version of the UK's Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) - a massive expansion of communications surveillance for the internet age .
A pilot of the Centralised Monitoring System ( CMS ) will begin by June next year , communications minister Gurudas Kamat said on Thursday .
Like IMP , CMS will see a network of monitoring probes inserted throughout the country 's fixed line and wireless communications networks .
Again like the British project , which is scheduled for completion in 2016 , CMS probes will be configured centrally and allow intelligence and law enforcement agencies to easily intercept calls , texts and internet sessions .
" In the existing system secrecy can be easily compromised due to manual intervention at many stages while in CMS these functions will be performed on secured electronic link and there will be minimum manual intervention , " Kamat told the upper house of India 's legislature .
The system will also create huge silos of communications data ( who contacts whom , when , where and how ) to be analysed and mined .
But while UK ministers plan to outsource storage and initial processing to ISPs and phone companies , the Indian government plans its own series of regional and central databases .
Planning for CMS was begun in 2007 , but has gained momentum in the wake of the Mumbai attacks , when the terrorists received orders via VoIP .
The laws needed to legitimise such a system here are not expected to be introduced until the next Parliament .
A Home Office consultation on its plans over summer attracted a very negative response from the communications industry . ®

Canned beer has n’t been taken seriously by beer snobs or the general public for quite some time .
Cans have a reputation for ruining the beer ’s flavor by giving it a distinctly metallic taste .
Cans also have been associated with fizzy , cheap - tasting beer .
Bottled beer is perceived to be classier , and bottles offer a variety of fine - crafted beer .
Tom Young , brewmaster at Great Basin Brewing Company , remembers a World War II story his father told him about canned beer he received in the South Pacific .
“ One day they pull into this harbor , and they were talking for months about ‘ Hey , we ’re going to get this beer ration , ’ ” he said .
“ Sure enough , these pallets of beer cases come up , and it was Iron City .
He said , ‘ Man , it was the foulest tasting beer I ever had .
It was like chewing on a metallic stick . ’ ”
Can technology has come a long way since World War II .
Now aluminum cans have plastic liners to protect the beer from being tainted by its container .
Some think modern cans hardly affect beer taste and are comparable to bottled beer , if not better .
Despite that , Young said nine out of 10 people would say canned beer still tastes a bit off .
Robert Bates , owner of The Reno Homebrewer store , said people may complain there is a metallic flavor , but that comes from carbonic acid produced by over - carbonated beer , not from the can .
Despite a bit of over - carbonation , he said , cans are a far better container for beer than bottles .
Cans offer beer better protection from oxygen and light — the two greatest threats to beer quality .
“ I think it ’s the future , ” Bates said .
Bates remembers an experiment the local brewing club , Washoe Zephyr Zymurgists , conducted about 10 years ago .
“ We took bottled beer and canned beer , and we kept them in different conditions , ” he said .
“ We kept them cold , we kept them in the sun , we kept them warm ; and in a blind tasting , after a month , the stuff in the cans tasted the best .
It is an overall superior seal for the beer . ”

Can - do attitude
Big beer producers , such as Anheuser - Busch , have been putting their beer in cans for decades .
Microbrewers have begun to reap the benefits of canning beer .
Local beer - maker Buckbean Brewing Company ships its beer exclusively in cans .
Dan Kahn , head brewer at Buckbean , said the choice to can the beer happened almost by accident .
Before they opened in April 2008 , Kahn and his partner , Doug Booth , went to the Great American Beer Festival .
Back then , they assumed they would be bottling their beer like most microbreweries .
The two were brainstorming on special packages for their holiday products , spitballing ideas such as champagne - like bottles .
The idea of canning the beer was a joke , until they heard microbrew company Oscar Blues make the case for canned beer .
“ We went and saw the stuff that Oscar Blues was doing , and all of a sudden we were like , ‘ Maybe we should just do cans entirely , ’ ” said Kahn .
The more Kahn researched the idea , the more he liked it .
He said canned beer is superior in every way , not only for the protection of the beer , but production - wise , as well .
Canning beer has been impractical for microbrewers until recently .
Canning machines were only for large - scale production .
Small brewers would buy bottling machines from soda companies , which were better suited to a more limited production .
Kahn admits that pre-printed cans take up space , but their small - scale canning machine is much smaller than a comparable bottling system .
Bottles also mean cardboard six - pack holders that require machines or manpower to assemble .
Cans need a lot less packaging .
Two people are able to can about 400 cases a day at Buckbean .
If they bottled the beer , they would need at least two more people , and the cost would be twice as much .
Kahn also said since cans are lighter they are easier to transport .
Bottles can go over a truck ’s weight limit before filling the whole space , but cans can be transferred much more efficiently .
This is where cans outshine bottles the most — environmentally .
“ By far , cans blow everything away , ” said John Sagebiel , manager of environmental affairs at the University of Nevada , Reno .
Cans , unlike bottles , are easily sorted from other trash by inducing an electromagnetic field .
Also , recycling a can only takes 5 percent of the energy it takes to manufacture a new can , compared to 75 percent for glass .
Canned beer can also go more places .
Glass bottles are prohibited in certain places like beaches .
They are heavy , large and prone to shattering , which makes them impractical for hikers or backpackers .
Cans are collapsible after their contents are sucked out , making them perfect for carrying .
They also take much less energy to cool .
For all these reasons , New Belgium Brewing Company started canning its popular Fat Tire Amber Ale .
Grady Hull , New Belgium brewer , said the company wanted to can Fat Tire for a long time .
The brewery did have reservations , though .
“ A lot of people in the company kind of hesitated a bit because of the fear of it cheapening the image , ” he said .
Image control
Here is canned beer ’s biggest hurdle :
It is usually associated with cheap beer , or as Silver Peak head brewer Brandon Wright puts it , “ more accessible beer . ”
He said more high - quality beers are being put into cans .
This is helping canned beer ’s image , but it still has a long way to go .
“ What it could more be equated to is serving filet mignon at a hot dog stand , ” Wright said .
“ You know , it just does n’t work .
People wo n’t pay $ 20 for filet mignon , no matter how good it is , from a hotdog stand . ”
Presentation is still important , Wright said , and canned beer can still feel cheap .
Canned beer may never defeat its bottled brother in the beer battle for dominance .
Homebrewers only need a bottle - capper to seal their product , unlike the special machinery used for canning .
And though brewers are quick to sing the praises of canned beer , most , like Young from Great Basin , said they still prefer to drink beer out of bottle .
Wright said he would n’t have a problem drinking most beers from cans .
But other beers , such as the en-vogue Belgium - style beers , he would be more hesitant to buy in cans .
Some beers have a bit of yeast floating at the bottom , which helps carbonate and eat up extra oxygen in the bottle .
Though the yeast has no taste , Wright still finds it unappealing to drink .
It is easier to avoid this yeast in a bottle .
So what is the best , greenest , tastiest way to get a carefully crafted , premium beer ?
By drinking at your local brewpub .
Since it is transferred between containers the least number of times , the beer is best preserved and is kept at a more consistent temperature .
The beer does n’t travel far , and restaurant breweries reuse their containers by washing their beer glasses , lessening environmental impact .
You could also buy a refillable growler from them and take it home to reuse .
And thus the debate rages on .
Though cans have gotten a bum rap , craft breweries are bolstering their reputation by putting quality beer in the aluminum containers .
New Belgium is planning to put more of its brands into cans , and advancing beer technology is broadening breweries ’ options .
But for some the reputation of canned beer shall forever be sullied .
It ’s a debate that will be solved by a time - tested American tradition .
Not by marches , congressional debates or voting .
What it all comes down to is marketing dollars .
“ As much as I would love to believe , as a brewer , if you make a great beer then people will drink it , marketing is half , if not more , of the equation in selling beer , ” said Wright .
“ That ’s why Anheuser - Busch is top dog .
They ’re not the best beer out there , but they ’re the ‘ king of beers ’ because they have exceptional marketing and throw a lot of money at it .
“ In the brewing world there is a tough battle to be fought because the best brew in the country you probably never heard of , and I ca n’t say who he is for sure , but he does n’t have the money AB does , and that is the way the chips are stacked . ”

I finally got the chance to read The Persistence of Poverty by Charles Karelis .
Here is Tyler Cowen ’s review .
I ca n’t recommend this book enough .
It ’s deeply informative , and quite challenging to how we think of ordinary economic decision making theory .
It ’s a fun ride , and can easily be read in an afternoon .
Karelis proposes we start to distinguish between pleasure goods , and good that are relievers , and realize that some goods can act as both .
His thesis is that there is diminishing marginal utility in pleasure goods , but that relievers have increasing marginal utility .
“ … paying the first bill in a stack of overdue bills does little to relieve a guilty conscience . ”
Cake , Screaming
I did n’t quite understand what was going on with it from the book reviews , so let ’s do the story with a teensy bit of math .
Here ’s the normal story .
Picture you are in a room with 10 people .
Each of them has a slice of cake .
How much you are willing to pay for a slice of the cake is the ‘ marginal utility ’ of having it , and the more cake you have the less any more cake is worth to you .
You ’d be willing to pay a $ 1 for the first slice of cake , but you ’d only be will to pay 90 cents for the second slice .
You ’d only be willing to pay 10 cents for the 9th slice , and a penny for the 10th slice .
Eating the 10th slice of cake in that room would probably make you sick , hence you want it a lot less than the first slice , which is delicious .
That ’s declining marginal utility .
Now picture you are in a room with 10 people screaming .
You hate it when people scream , and you can pay a person to get them to stop screaming .
Would you pay in a similar way to the cake example ?
Would you pay a $ 1 to get the first person to stop screaming , and a penny for the 10th person to stop screaming ?
No .
Getting one person to stop screaming would make very little difference in how much you dislike being in the room .
Modern psychology tells us you might not even notice it .
You ’d probably only pay a penny to get that first guy to stop screaming .
However getting the second guy to stop screaming might be worth 10 cents .
And the last guy , the difference between some screaming and no screaming , might be worth the full dollar to you .
The more quiet it got , the more a marginal difference in how quiet it is would be worth to you .
There ’s increasing returns to this good ; the 10th guy not screaming is worth more than the first guy not screaming , which is the exact opposite dynamic of the 10th cake being less delicious than the first .
For those not involved with economic theory this might just elicit a shrug , but this mechanism turns everything on its head .
Let ’s say that instead of money , you are given 20 tokens to be used over 4 days , and each token gets you one slice of cake in room # 1 , and one person to stop screaming in room # 2 .
In the cake room , the optimal decision is to consumption smooth – eat five slices of cake each day , so you use the tokens { 5,5,5,5} .
In the screaming room , all the enjoyment is not in getting a room with half screaming but in getting a quiet room , and instead of consumption smoothing the optimal choice is to binge – pay 10 people to stop screaming the first two days , and deal with a loud room the last two days – { 10,10,0,0} .
This will hold even with ‘ nudges ’ , say offering two extra tokens if you have people consumption smooth , since the marginal utility is n’t increasing that much .
The utility of { 10,10,0,0} is greater than that of { 5,5,5,7} .
( And most interesting , instead of tokens , let ’s say you could work an hour for 1 token or take 65 cents in leisure over a 5 hour day .
In the cake room , you ’d probably work 3 hours , and relax 2 hours , as around that time you ’d have the marginal return from cake equally the marginal return from relaxing .
In the screaming room , you probably would n’t work at all – it ’s impossible enough to make enough to stop the screaming to the point where it is worthwhile to try .
Hence the persistence of poverty . )
His other point is that many goods have both characteristics .
Let ’s say you have 5 children .
In a large house , where each child has his or her own room , a child leaving the house to go out into the world gives you diminishing marginal utility .
The first room turns into an entertainment center , the second into a hobby room , and the third just sits empty .
But if you are in a cramped , small 2 bedroom place for all of you , the first child leaving might only make a slight bit a difference compared to the second child leaving .
By the time the 5th child leaves the home , you get the most marginal enjoyment of having your small place less cramped .
Karelis point is that this inflection point is where we should be thinking about poverty , because as the token example above mentions , normal policy mechanisms based on neoclassical microeconomic theory wo n’t necessarily hold .
Intellectual History
Karelis takes a moment to do some intellectual history digging and finds that the current economic obsession with decreasing marginal utility comes from Jeremy Bentham ’s equating happiness with the absence of unhappiness .
Bentham , and the Mills , thought of happiness as reciprocal to unhappiness , like the relationship between tall and short .
So to increase happiness is the same exact thing as to decrease unhappiness .
Maybe , maybe not .
But the problem is that this relationship is carried over to the goods that effect happiness and unhappiness .
Bentham : “ utility [ is ] that property in any object whereby it tends to produce … pleasure … or happiness .. or ( what comes to the same thing ) to prevent the happening of mischief , pain , evil , or unhappiness . ”
Stanley Jevons cites that passage 80 years later when he lays the foundation of what Alfred Marshall will later use to create modern economics .
Bentham usually showed a more ambiguous approach , noting that there are often ranges of postive experiences and negative experiences that do n’t necessarily net , but that ambiguity has n’t transfered to the current theory where the marginal rate at which pleasers please is information on the rate at which relievers relief .
And this approach , to see a cross-section within time and see that a baseline income can change incentives in a dramatic way , is a whole new dimension to think through .
And one with very testable hypotheses .
GARDEN GROVE , CA – Lee Joseph Flanders told the clerk at the corner liquor store last Wednesday that he was so thirsty he would “ give his right nut for a beer , ” but when he reached for his wallet to purchase a 32 - ounce Molson Lager , he came up a few dollars short .
GARDEN GROVE , CA – Lee Joseph Flanders told the clerk at the corner liquor store last Wednesday that he was so thirsty he would “ give his right nut for a beer , ” but when he reached for his wallet to purchase a 32 - ounce Molson Lager , he came up a few dollars short .
The clerk , assistant store manager Larry Moss , laughed and told him not to worry ; he would indeed accept the man ’s right testicle in payment .
“ I knew it was going to hurt , ” said Flanders , an engineering student at California State University , Long Beach , “ but man , I really , really needed to have a beer . ”
Flanders went outside to his pickup truck , where he kept a tool case and a first aid kit .
He returned moments later with an oozing orb wrapped in a red bandana , which he handed to Moss .
“ I thought he was joking , ” remembered Moss .
“ Then he sets this severed fleshy thing right on the counter in front of me , and I ’m like , ‘ Go ahead , take the beer and get the fuck out of here . ’”
Flanders limped out of the liquor store , carrying his bag of Molson in one hand and applying direct pressure with the other .
Moss then called the police to come and “ remove this guy ’s right nut ” from the premises .
Moss , who is recovering from dehydration resulting from incessant vomiting , was further dismayed to learn police had identified the testicle as coming from the suspect ’s “ left side . ”
“ It was bad enough he tossed one of his gonads at me , ” he said .
“ Now I find out he lied about which one it was . ”
Moss has banned Flanders from ever returning to his place of business .
“ If that nutjob ever sets foot in here again , ” he added , “ I ’m going to chew him a new asshole . ”

Dubai's property market has been a serious concern for investors Dubai 's government has announced it has been given a $ 10 bn ( £ 6.13 bn ) handout from United Arab Emirates neighbour Abu Dhabi to help it pay off its debts .
It will use $ 4.1 bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) of the money to bail out the government - owned investment company Dubai World .
The company 's property development operation , Nakheel , needed the money to pay investors in an Islamic bond which was due to mature on Monday .
The news lifted investor sentiment around the world .
Wall Street 's Dow Jones ended Monday trading up 0.3 % to a 14 - month high , while the UK's FTSE 100 added 1 % , with banking stocks among the biggest risers .
Market boost ANALYSIS Ben Thompson , Middle East business reporter , Dubai
It was a long time coming and many here wondered if it would come at all .
And so the news that Abu Dhabi would , once again , bail out Dubai came as a surprise .
Not least of course , because the government had gone to great lengths to distance itself from the debts of Dubai World .
The company - it said - was responsible for its own actions and its own debts .
And so why the sudden U - turn ?
Some say Abu Dhabi just could n't let Dubai fail .
Too much was at stake - for both national unity and the country 's international reputation .
The deal also comes with a promise to improve transparency and offer better protection to creditors .
Reforms that are long overdue , according to many analysts .
But in many respects , this bail - out raises more questions than it answers .
In the short term , Dubai now has the cash it needs to pay back its most pressing debts .
But in the long - term the city still owes much , much more .
Getting access to that extra cash will prove difficult , despite any reform and restructuring .
News of the payment earlier boosted share markets in the United Arab Emirates .
Dubai's main share index closed 10 % higher , while Abu Dhabi 's rose more than 7 % .
Meanwhile , the value of both the euro and the pound improved .
Both currencies have been unsettled in recent weeks by news of Dubai 's debts .
But the head of Middle East government ratings at Standard and Poor 's , Farouk Soussa , said the bail - out raised questions about government policy in Dubai .
" It 's a positive in terms of the debt being repaid , it 's a positive in terms of support from Abu Dhabi , but I believe the grey shadow cast over this is really the coherence of policy . "
There had been speculation that Abu Dhabi would have demanded certain assets in return for the money .
However , an unnamed Dubai government source , quoted by the Reuters news agency , said this was not the case .
" There are no conditions .
This is a government - to - government fund , the terms of that fund are internal to the government of Abu Dhabi and Dubai . " ' Crucial ' lifeline
The payment that was due on Monday was an Islamic - or sukuk - bond , designed to be compliant with Islamic law which prohibits interest payments .
There had been fears the Nakheel would not be able to pay off the bonds when they matured and analysts say Abu Dhabi 's bail - out came as a surprise .
Dubai 's fellow emirate has helped its neighbour out before .
Their relationship is close , as both are part of the seven - member UAE .
Their ruling families are from the same tribe .
But unlike Dubai , whose economy is largely a service sector one , Abu Dhabi has substantial oil reserves .
It will take time for the implications to unfold .
I highly doubt this kind of money has no strings attached
John Sfakianakis
On 25 November , Dubai 's government had said it would ask its creditors for a freeze on Dubai World 's $ 26bn ( £ 16 bn ) debt repayments .
In a statement earlier on Monday the chairman of Dubai's Supreme Fiscal Committee , Sheikh Ahmed bin Saaed al - Maktoum , said : " The government of Abu Dhabi has agreed to fund $ 10bn to the Dubai Financial Support Fund that will be used to satisfy a series of upcoming obligations on Dubai World . "
He added : " We are here today to reassure investors , financial and trade creditors , employees , and our citizens that our government will act at all times in accordance with market principles and internationally accepted business practices . "
He also announced the implementation of new bankruptcy law .
" This law will be available should Dubai World and its subsidiaries be unable to achieve an acceptable restructuring of its remaining obligations , " he said .
John Sfakianakis , the chief economist of Banque Saudi Fransi -Credit Agricole , in Riyadh , called the handout a " crucial and essential lifeline " .
He told Reuters : " That should bring in a lot of confidence , basically Abu Dhabi is footing the bill .
" It will take time for the implications to unfold .
I highly doubt this kind of money has no strings attached . "
Fahd Iqbal , the Gulf region strategist for EFG - Hermes , said the latest development did not necessarily change the " longer - term outlook " .
He added his investment banking firm still had other concerns regarding the " hit in confidence " Dubai had experienced , Reuters reported .

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration said late Wednesday it is still reviewing its policy on a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines , clarifying a previous statement indicating it would not sign the deal .
“ The administration is committed to a comprehensive review of its landmine policy .
That review is still on - going , ” State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in a statement on Wednesday .

“ The review is going to take some time , given that it is the first review of our policy conducted since 2003 , ” Kelly added .
“ While our review is ongoing , our current policy remains in effect , ” Kelly said , referring to the policy of not joining the treaty .
However , Kelly said on Tuesday that President Barack Obama ’s administration had completed the review and decided not to sign the treaty .
“ We determined that we would n’t be able to meet our national defense needs , nor our security commitments to our friends and allies if we signed this convention , ” he said .
The second conference reviewing the 1997 Ottawa Convention will be held from November 30 to December 4 in Cartagena , Colombia .

The Ottawa Convention bans the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines as well as their destruction .
Kelly said Wednesday that the administration “ needed to make a key early decision on whether to send a US observer ” to the review conference , pending the full review .
Washington is sending a team of observers to the meeting that will include experts from the Pentagon , the State Department , the Agency for International Development ( AID ) , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .

Senator Patrick Leahy criticized the administration on Tuesday for deciding not to join the treaty .

Thus , the lesson : when you choose to be a critical part of a system that has become this corrupt . . . you will not ameliorate or " save " it .
The system will necessarily and inevitably corrupt you .
~ Arthur Silber
I understand the arguments for getting involved politically .
They are multitudinous .
Some of them are almost entirely persuasive .
( Think Ron Paul . )
Some of them are downright frightening .
( Think about the threat of communism . )
Some of them I actually contribute money to .
Not because I think they 'll get anywhere with actually changing the system , but because I hope that they might be able to use the funds to get more publicity , and perhaps get the government 's " private " media outlets to respond a little .
Ron Paul did that .
That 's good .
Not great , but good .
It was better than nothing .
But in the end , belief in minarchism is nothing more than belief in the containable and non-threatening nature of a tiger cub .
Small government conservatives and libertarians want a tiger cub .
Well , who does n't ?
They 're cute .
I would love to play with a tiger cub .
What minarchists do n't understand is that tiger cubs grow big , and grown tigers are never tame .
You can't domesticate a tiger like a house cat .
You can always play with a grown house cat .
For the five percent of the day that it 's awake .
You cannot play with a tiger cub when it grows up .
Tigers are wild and always will be .
Government , because it is predicated on force and violence , will always be what it is : forceful and violent .
Its fangs ai n't cute anymore .
Every once in a while , you get an organization that lobbies government , ostensibly for the purpose of keeping the tiger at bay .
This is also understandable .
Yet , I wonder at its ultimate usefulness .
Not only that , but I wonder at what it turns the organization into , as it spends more and more time in the company of the tiger .
I do n't know much about the Home School Legal Defense Association , but what I 've read in this article is enough to cause suspicion .
If you care to follow the link , you 'll see that the bill this organization supported in 2005 was an attempt to free up homeschooled kids for service in the military .
Not only that , but the bill hints at a possible future requirement for getting a diploma prior to " graduation " from a homeschooling program .
According to Wikipedia , the organization started out as a way of fighting the tiger against compulsory schooling laws .
Now , bizarrely , it not only has this misplaced concern about the military 's lack of homeschooled warriors , but it has entered the fray of the " One Man , One Woman " marriage debate .
What any of this has to do with the separation of schooling and state is beyond me .
Speaking of the marriage debate , it is well known that many religious organizations had quite a lot to do with Proposition 8 , a ballot initiative that forces 47.5 % of the people living within a certain geographical area to do as commanded by 52.5 % of the people within that same geographical area .
Not even 47.5 % versus 52.5 % of all the people within that area ; merely 47.5 % versus 52.5 % of the people who bothered to gather the energy to go to the government 's polls to direct the government 's guns .
This time , the government 's guns are directed against gays .
( Finally !
That 's never happened before . )
A few years from now , those same guns may very well be directed against the conservatives who have won the current discriminatory battle .
It 's a sickening spectacle to watch from the sidelines .
It has been equally disappointing for me to watch the work of a remarkable organization called NYCCAN .
This organization was established to directly confront both the federal government and the civil government of New York City , due to their combined lack of a serious investigation into the worst terrorist attack in the history of America , and their inability to provide adequate information and health care to first responders and recovery workers .
This is an organization for which I actually did some footwork , handing out pamphlets in the streets of Manhattan to anybody willing to take them from me .
I did n't actually expect the referendum to get anywhere with City Hall .
In fact , I could see the outcome from a mile away .
What else could you expect when you work within a system designed by the very institution you 're investigating ?
I was not actually there to support the group 's efforts at petitioning the government .
I was there to add to the numbers , to help others take notice , and as I said , to hand out information to more people .
That 's what I believe in .
I wonder how many of my fellow protestors actually thought that 80,000 - plus signatures would really turn such a sclerotic , bureaucratic institution , which obviously has something to hide , toward a more favorable outcome .
Working with bureaucracy is what Ralph Nader has been doing for decades .
In an interview with Car & Driver , Nader looks back very briefly at the work he has accomplished in 50 years , pushing the big automobile corporations and the government they 've bought and paid for , to add a few more safety features to the ticking time bombs we 're all driving .
The result ?
According to Nader in this interview , cars are a bit safer .
That 's it .
That appears to be " it " for a lot of the above organizations .
Sometimes they get a little something in return .
Not all homeschoolers are arrested .
Religious conservatives , who have to put up with gays in television , film , music , magazines , newspapers , politics , the Internet , government schools , private schools , gym locker rooms , their neighborhoods , and oftentimes in their own families , have their precious , Western - style view of marriage intact for another year or so , complete with a massive government divorce bureaucracy .
Ralph Nader sleeps a little better at night , knowing that seatbelts are n't made of piano wire .
NYCCAN , unfortunately , has little to be thankful for .
I , on the other hand , have much more reason to be hopeful .
As a result of NYCCAN 's defeat at City Hall , they are now going to be looking at public relations as the next step .
" The secret to success for nonprofits and social activists [ lays ] in the ability to employ the business marketing tools that have proven effective in promoting social [ agendas ] and persuading the general public , without whose support such efforts rarely succeed . "
Fine by me .
Enough time has been wasted navigating the government 's legal maze .
As I stated above , my only purpose at the rally I attended was to help wake people up , not tame the tiger .
If you ever see me at a Tea Party , do n't expect me to be asking any questions of any politicians in attendance .
My remarks will only ever be directed at real people , encouraging my fellow peasants to come up with our own solutions .
How would it feel to attend one of these rallies and actually persuade several medically trained peasants to go with me to a separate room , where we could devise ways to circumvent the eventual socialization of health care ?
How much energy would that take , compared to five decades of griping about the corporate car industry ?
How much energy was wasted by religious conservatives , deathly afraid that God , who sits by and does nothing while a more than a million of His children are murdered in the Middle East , will raise holy hell if sexually active gay adults are slightly more legal in their sexual activity ?
How much time does it take to get your organization 's lawyers to sit down with government bureaucrats , and hammer out an obscure law making it a bit easier for homeschooled children to join the government 's death force ?
In contrast , how much time and energy did it take for me to keep quiet , stand still , and look people in the eye as they passed , handing out dozens of professionally printed brochures ?
How successful would conservatives have been if they had poured their time and energy into resisting this unstoppable war , instead of directing it against people no more violent than they ?
Why the hell has n't Ralph Nader lifted a finger to build his own damn car ?
Here 's hoping that more spontaneous organizations for consumer safety , auto production , homeschooling , freeschooling , unschooling , medicine , raising the alarm against the government 's massive lies , community building , house building , model airplane building , tiger care , toys for domestic cats , lettuce inspection , and on and on , will finally realize that their energies are best directed toward individuals , for their edification and benefit , and not for the " betterment " of government .
Anarchists should someday have just as much influence in television , film , music , magazines , newspapers , the Internet , their neighborhoods , and in families , as have feminists and gay activists .
We could use some good P.R. as NYCCAN is now doing .
We sure as hell do n't want to end up like Nader or HSLDA , do we ?
Let us be mindful of the time we have , and the energy we expend .
Let us see both politicians and ordinary individuals for who they really are , remember the lesson of The One True Ring , walk peacefully , quietly and quickly out of City Hall , and into the streets with the message of freedom on a professionally printed brochure .
No more campaigning .
No more running for a vacant Congressional seat .
No more searching for a legal loophole to sneak in a favored law .
No more letters , e-mails , or phone calls to your " representative . "
No more lobbying .
No more force .
No more violence .
No more wasted time .
No more wasted energy .
No more for me , thank you .
I 'm full .
And I 'm free .
Geddy Lee : Rush in the studio soon , Summer 2010 tour possible
Geddy Lee was a special guest at the 25th annual Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ) Miracle Day charity event yesterday in Toronto .
According to reports from a few lucky fans who were there and spoke to the man himself , Geddy said that Rush plans on entering the studio very , very soon and are hoping to then tour this summer .
While this is a tentative sort of statement and there has been no official announcement , it 's still very encouraging news and seems to corroborate Alex Lifeson 's comments from a couple of his interviews over the Summer .
In his Prog magazine interview Alex stated the following :
...
Tentatively , we start work on the next album in the fall - I did mention it to Ged before he went away on holiday and he sort of looked the other way .
Come September and we 'll certainly have some plans , we did the last record , or we started on the last album in the fall and I 'd like to do that again , start recording maybe .
I do n't know who might produce , that 's some ways off yet .
...
And more recently in an interview with Noisecreep.com
Alex said :
... Neil and his wife had a baby just a couple of weeks ago , so he 's asked if we can just wait a little bit until he gets settled and see how he feels about getting back to work or when to get back to work .
So we 're sort of playing it open right now .
... I would guess that sometime in the early fall we would get back together and start writing again , and then hopefully by next summer , we'd be ready to tour .
So all of this leads me to speculate that Neil must have given the thumbs up for getting back to work when the band met in Los Angeles for their November meeting .
My guess is that they wo n't start recording until after the Holidays at the earliest .
So assuming all of this is true , we can start speculating about who will produce , where they will record , when the album will be released , when / where they will tour , etc .
Let the speculation begin ! :)
The horrors of the US Agent Orange defoliation campaign in Vietnam , about which I wrote on Oct. 15 , could ultimately be dwarfed by the horrors caused by the depleted uranium weapons which the US began using in the 1991 Gulf War ( 300 tons ) , and which it has used much more extensively -- and in more urban , populated areas -- in the Iraq War and the now intensifying Afghanistan War .
Depleted uranium , despite its rather benign - sounding name , is not depleted of radioactivity or toxicity .
The term " depleted " refers only to its being depleted of the U - 235 isotope needed for fission reactions in nuclear reactors .
The nuclear waste material from nuclear power plants , DU as it is known , is what is removed from the power plants ' spent fuel rods and is essentially composed of the uranium isotope U - 238 as well as U - 236 ( a product of nuclear reactor fission , not found in nature ) , as well as other trace radioactive elements .
Once simply a nuisance for the industry , that still has no permanent way to dispose of the dangerous stuff , it turns out to be an ideal metal for a number of weapons uses , and has been capitalized on by the Pentagon .
1.7 times heavier than lead , and much harder than steel , and with the added property of burning at a super - hot temperature , DU has proven to be an ideal penetrator for warheads that need to pierce thick armor or dense concrete bunkers made of reinforced concrete and steel .
Once through the defenses , it burns at a temperature that incinerates anyone inside ( which is why we see the carbonized bodies of bodies in the wreckage of Iraqi tanks hit by US fire ) .
Accordingly it has found its way into 30 mm machine gun ammunition , especially that used by the A - 10 Warthog ground - attack fighter planes used extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan ( as well as Kosovo ) .
It is also the warhead of choice for Abrams tanks and is also reportedly used in GBU - 28 and the later GBU - 37 bunker buster bombs , each of which can have 1 - 2 tons of the stuff in its warhead .
DU is also used as ballast in cruise missiles , and this burns up when a missile detonates its conventional explosive .
Some cruise missiles are also designed to hit hardened targets and reportedly feature DU warheads , as does the AGM - 130 air - to - ground missile , which carries a one - ton penetrating warhead .
In addition , depleted uranium is used in large quantities in the armor of tanks and other equipment .
This material becomes a toxic source of CU pollution when these vehicles are attacked and burned .
While the Pentagon has continued to claim , against all scientific evidence , that there is no hazard posed by depleted uranium , US troops in Iraq have reportedly been instructed to avoid any sites where these weapons have been used -- destroyed Iraqi tanks , exploded bunkers , etc. -- and to wear masks if they do have to approach .
Many torched vehicles have been brought back to the US , where they have been buried in special sites reserved for dangerously contaminated nuclear materials .
( Thousands of tons of DU - contaminated sand from Kuwait , polluted with DU during the US destruction of Iraq 's tank forces in the 1991 war , were removed and shipped to a waste site in Idaho last year with little fanfare . )
Suspiciously , international health officials have been prevented or obstructed from doing medical studies of DU sites in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But an excellent series of articles several years ago by the Christian Science Monitor described how reporters from that newspaper had visited such sites in Iraq with Geiger - counters and had found them to be extremely " hot " with radioactivity .
The big danger with DU is not as a pure metal , but after it has exploded and burned , when the particles of uranium oxide , which are just as radioactive as the pure isotopes , can be inhaled or ingested .
Even the smallest particle of uranium in the body is both deadly poisonous as a chemical , and over time can cause cancer -- particularly in the lungs , but also the kidneys , testes and ovaries .
There are reports of a dramatic increase in the incidence of deformed babies being born in the city of Fallujah , where DU weapons were in wide use during the November 2004 assault on that city by US Marines .
The British TV station SKY UK , in a report last month that has received no mention in any mainstream American news organization , found a marked increase in birth defects at local hospitals .
Birth defects have also been high for years in the Basra area in the south of Iraq , where DU was used not just during America 's 2003 " shock and awe " attack on Iraq , but also in the 1991 Gulf War .
Further , a report sent to the UN General Assembly by Dr Nawal Majeed Al - Sammarai , Iraq 's Minister of Women 's Affairs since 2006 , stated that in September 2009 , Fallujah General Hospital had 170 babies born , 24 % of which died within their first week of life .
Worse yet , fully 75 % of the babies born that month were deformed .
This compares to August 2002 , six months before the US invasion , when 530 live births were reported with only six dying in the first week , and only one deformity .
Clearly something terrible is happening in Fallujah , and many doctors suspect it 's the depleted uranium dust that is permeating the city .
But the real impact of the first heavy use of depleted uranium weaponry in populous urban environments ( DU was used widely especially in 2003 in Baghdad , Samara , Mosul and other big Iraqi cities ) , will come over the years , as the toxic legacy of this latest American war crime begins to show up in rising numbers of cancers , birth defects and other genetic disorders in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Of course , as in the case of Agent Orange in Vietnam , the toxic effects of this latest battlefield use of toxic materials by the US military will also be felt for years to come by the men and women who were sent over to fight America 's latest wars .
As with Agent Orange , the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department have been assiduously denying the problem , and have been just as assiduously denying claims by veterans of the Gulf War and the two current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who claim their cancers and other diseases have anything to do with their exposure to DU .
The record on Agent Orange should lead us to be suspicious of the government 's claims .
The deformed and dead babies in Iraq should make us demand a cleanup of Iraq and Afghanistan , medical aid for the victims , and a ban on all depleted uranium weapons .

One of the most regularly recited pieces of popular neuroscience is that women are more likely to use both hemispheres of the brain to process language while men tend only to use one .
It turns out , this is a myth – it is simply not supported by the current evidence .
In 2008 , a meta - analysis study looked at all the evidence for differences in the balance of language processing in the brains of men and women .
It looked at studies on sex differences in handedness , brain structure , on perception of words heard exclusively in the left or right ears , and neural activity recorded by brain scans during language tasks .
When you look at all the studies together , there are no reliable sex differences in word processing or language - related brain activity .
Men and women did not differ in how their brains processed language .
I came across this study from a fantastic talk by neuroscientist Lise Eliot , author of the book Pink Brain , Blue Brain that tackles many of the sex difference stereotypes .
She notes how an initial study , published in Nature in 1995 , did find results in line with the common myth , but that these results were not replicated .
At the time , however , they got widely publicised – making headlines around the world – and they remain the basis for the common claim despite numerous subsequent studies that suggest this is not the case .
This , notes Eliot , is a common pattern in sex difference research .
Results that confirm our steroetypes get widely reported , others are largely ignored by the media .
I really recommend her talk over at Fora.tv and I will look forward to reading the book once I get my hands on a copy .

Maybe Buddy the Beagle should be renamed " Lucky " or " Hope . "
All names aside , one New Jersey family counts the 4 - year - old beagle as their miracle dog .
After spending 98 days stranded on the unihabited Gull Island in the Manasquan Inlet , the family pooch -- who had run off and withered away to little more than skin and bones -- was saved by a local man who goes by the nickname Muskrat Jack .
This story of loss , survival and hope began back on August 31 when the Kelley family , of Eatontown , was playing with Buddy on Dog Beach in Manasquan .
As the family attempted to switch the beagle 's leash , the dog bolted , perhaps after being spooked .
Lost dog posters went up right away but it took two months for someone to spot Buddy on Gull Island .
The beagle apparently had walked along railroad tracks connected to the deserted island to the popular fishing inlet .
In the weeks that followed , " the Coast Guard reported seeing him digging in the sand for clams and sand crabs , " said Edie Kelley , whose son Patrick cares for the dog .
What Buddy drank while stranded on the sandy island no one knows , but the dog went from being 35 pounds to just 19 when " Muskrat " Jack Neary lured the family pet into a trap he set Monday .
When asked what bait he used in the trap , Neary , who said he 's been trapping animals for 50 years , would only say " a secret formula . "
Whatever it was , it worked , though there was n't much of Buddy left .
" A bag of bones , " said Neary , describing the dog as " a little lonely , cold , forlorn little dog curled up sleeping . "
Neary said the Coast Guard also told him that Buddy " would occassionally pick up a dead seagull " to eat .
" This is obviously a miracle , " said Kelley , whose son was thrilled to have the beagle home again .
A veterinarian checked Buddy out and declared the pooch to be fine .
The vet told the Kelleys to feed the beagle multiple times a day for at least two weeks .
" He 's the same old Buddy , " said Charlie Kelley , quickly adding that this story was a good lesson for his two granddaughters : " Do n't give up hope . "

It is not clear what the " Pre Plus " brings that warrants the " plus , " but it is unlikely that the device will be much different than the current Pre.
Additionally , Verizon is " tweaking " their network so it can withstand the high data usage of iPhone users.users have criticized the carrier unmercifully over dropped calls and slow receiving of emails and text messages through their iPhones .
AT&T also has an inferior 3G map , and speeds are lacking .

Those unexpected items and the feeling you 're paying and doing all the work .
Self - service checkouts are expanding throughout the UK , but many of us are n't happy with them .
So why is the relationship so fraught ?
Unexpected item in the bagging area ?
Totally expected feeling of rage pumping through your body ?
You 're not alone .
New research suggests 48 % of Britons think self - service checkouts are a nightmare , neither quick nor convenient .
Quite the opposite in fact , and their complaints are all too familiar .
COMMON GRIPES
Don't scan items properly - 46 % Ca n't use own bags - 39 % Customer doing all the work - 13 % Always have to get help - 12 % Source : Fatcheese Firstly , there 's the bag struggle .
Shoppers who follow the " bag for life " mantra may feel they are n't as welcome as they would expect .
Self - service checkouts often do n't recognise them and shoppers may even be charged for plastic bags they have n't used .
Then there 's the barcode blindness the machines experience with maddening regularity .
There 's nearly always something they refuse to scan , leaving customers repeatedly swiping , running the risk of repetitive strain injury and feeling a pang of sympathy for those who do this for a living .
' Arrest me '
Finally scanned ?
Now try and put it in the carrier bag .
The phrase " unexpected item in the bagging area " is so synonymous with the 21st Century shopping experience it 's become a T - shirt slogan .
What 's so unexpected anyway ?
You only swiped the item a second ago and were charged for it .
To queue for a self - service till , or the real person tills " It 's like the machine is very publicly saying ' you are too stupid to do this - go home now ' .
It 's far from ideal , " says Bjorn Weber , of retail analysts Planet Retail .
Finally , after the palaver of paying , there 's the nervousness about leaving the shop .
Did I scan it all correctly ?
Did I select the right type of bread roll from the menu ?
Will I feel the long arm of the store ( manager ) on my shoulder as I walk out the shop ?
" I spend half my time worrying that security will arrest me for selecting the wrong price Blueberry muffin , " said shopper Sharon Adams when consulted in a survey on self - service tills conducted by Fatcheese .
But it 's not as simple as all - out hate for these tills .
The people who like them , really like them , say the supermarkets .
And they 're probably counting among them that contingent of people who have always secretly hankered after trying their hand as a checkout assistant .
The buzz Self - service checkouts present an opportunity for these frustrated souls .
On the rare occasion a basket of shopping goes through without any hitches there 's a disproportional sense of satisfaction .
Or am I the only one who feels this ?
However , this occasional buzz does n't make up for the time spent battling with the machines .
But whether we want them or not , they are here and their numbers are set to grow .
First introduced in the UK in the 1990s , the number of self - service checkouts is set to double in the next few years .
This is because they offer supermarkets quick cost savings and in today 's economic and highly competitive retail climate , that has got to be a good thing .
Old - style self - service - it meant choosing your own groceries Tesco , the UK 's biggest supermarket , also leads the do - it - yourself checkout league , with self - service counters in 256 stores .
The tills process 25 % of all transactions in those shops .
Sainsbury 's has them in 220 stores and is planning more .
And while it may seem extremely trusting to get us to scan our own goods , the machines have in - built weight controls as security measures .
Waitrose offers a variation on the theme .
It has no such tills but has a Quick Check service where people scan and pack items as they shop .
The aim is to really cut back on time at the till .
Supermarkets say the move towards self - service checkouts is not all about cutting costs .
They argue the tills can speed up your shopping trip , says Ahmed Zaman , from shopping website Fatcheese , which conducted the research .
" But many shoppers have yet to be convinced that they really save time , " he says .
That 's because they only do in extremely selective circumstances - if you have one item and can walk straight up to a self - service till for example .
Face - to - face time " People perceive self - service checkouts to be quicker but that 's because they are actually doing the work , " says Mr Weber .
" In reality they take longer than someone serving you , but it 's annoying for the shopper to stand around waiting .
" This is even the case in countries like the US , where they 've had such checkouts for years and shoppers are very experienced at using them . "
People 's dislike of such tills could also be down to something that is very British , he believes .
Despite Brit 's reputation for being reserved , we like to speak to the people serving us .
Some like a bit of banter " If you go to a supermarket in Germany or Spain or Italy , customers might acknowledge the person on the till but they wo n't speak to them , " says Mr Weber .
" It 's different in the UK , people do speak to them and like to have a conversation . "
In the past shopping was all about such personal service , but over the years it has become more and more impersonal .
From grocery shops , to supermarkets , to shopping on the internet and now the expansion of self - service tills , face - to - face time has been reduced or even excised completely from the shopping experience .
Are we becoming antisocial ?
Not really , our choice is just expanding , says Mr Weber .
The key to success is still providing a good service and clued - up retailers are moving the staff they take off tills on to the shop floor .
" That 's where the real service takes place , " he says .
" Not at the checkout . "
No benefits
And the expansion of such tills does not signal the end of manned ones , not in Britain anyway as it is a distinctly different market for most other countries .
Tesco has one express store , opened in Northampton in October , that is self - service only and supervised by just one member of staff .
It 's just a trial , it says , and there are no plans to open any of its larger supermarkets without checkout staff , like in the US .
" Staffing is important in the UK , " says Mr Weber .
" Supermarkets know long queues do n't benefit them .
If it 's busy they will open more manned tills . "
Not surprisingly , the supermarkets agree .
" We 'd never get completely rid of manned tills , " says the Sainsbury 's spokeswoman .
" For us it 's all about offering people the choice .
Self - service checkouts are very popular with the customers who use them a lot , but we realise people either like them or they do n't . "
But for many self - service haters , it comes down to two things .
Do n't say something is time - saving when it hardly ever is .
Also , they 're not getting paid , so do n't make them do the work .
Here is a selection of your comments .
Ever a buy a birthday card using one of these ?
Do n't bother as there 's no weight in the card and the bagging area then freaks out as you 've not put your card in the bag .
The joys of self service .
Martin , March I love self - service checkouts .
I can buy those embarrassing items without anyone knowing , do n't have to stand behind women or old people fiddling with their purses , and can avoid all form of contact or " conversation " with the checkout assistants .
Mike Wright , Birmingham
There 's many good reasons to despise self service tills , and I can't think of a good thing to say about them ( the exception being Waitrose , where the hand scanners as you shop method does work ) .
I wish all the stores would just dump them and make room for tills that are faster and less frustrating - you know , ones with human staff .
My local supermarket now has four self service tills which have to be manned by , um , four staff , because the tills are so awful ...
Nic Brough , London , UK " Unexpected item in the bagging area " - what a surprise , it 's the bag I brought to put my shopping in !
Encouraged to help the environment and enticed by extra " green " reward points , I bring a couple of bags to take my purchases home in , only to find it confuses the machine to the extent it wo n't work .
If a bag is an unexpected item in the area that bears its name , what exactly is expected ?!?!
Richard Travis , Manchester I always use self - service checkouts , I rarely have issues and it is much much quicker .
I do n't understand why people moan about these tills , after all its a choice , if you do n't like them , do n't use them .
Sarah , Essex I HATE THESE MACHINES !
and no I 'm not a old duffer who can't work them !
I hate the fact that almost every time you use them you need to ask for help because the machines are not calibrated properly , and I for one miss the communication with the person sat at the till .
Get shot of these evil unsociable machines .
Karl Duvall , Liverpool I use these machines for small amounts of shopping .
What annoys me most about them is the way that they make you jump through their hoops - the back and forth with the bag and the ' unexpected item ' .
I needed a staff member to swipe their card to allow me to use my own bag last time .
Lastly , I 'll add they 're too talkative for me .
Sometimes I just wish they 'd shut - up and let me get on with it - ' unexpected item in the bagging area ' , ' do you have a loyalty card ' , ' please take your shopping ' , etc .
You can turn it off - but it never seems worth it for 5 items or less .
barnabyp , London , UK I would n't mind if they stopped the stupid animations and made the computer faster - I tend to scan , place the item in the bag and then wait for 5 seconds while the stupid animation of " putting the item in the bag " completes before it will let me scan my next item .
So basically I 'm saying it's the implementation that is the problem , not the concept itself .
Geoff Winkless , Leicestershire , UK I used a self - service checkout a few days ago and used my own bag .
I happily selected the " I use my own bag " button on the screen ( somewhat excited that I could scan my products , still in awe of barcodes ) .
Then the polite voice said " please place your bag in the bagging area " .
No problem .
Job done .
Then I had to wait for someone to come and actually verify that it was my own bag !
I had n't even tried to buy anything yet and already the light above my head was flashing red making me feel incompetent !
Did they have to make sure I was n't trying to obtain some extra nectar points by deception ?!
I 'd do it again , though , just because it took me back to my childhood and the time I would play ' Shop ' .

My local Tesco's has them and I hate them , they take the social point of speaking to the till operator , and feel like you have to rush .
But most annoying is that Supermarkets are saving money by not employing people which I think in this current climate is important !
Darren , Hemel I always opt for the self - checkout if I 'm not doing a large shop !
It really annoys my wife who would rather wait for longer and be served by a person but I quite like it .
Not having to answer questions like : ' what 's the weather like ? '
( look for yourself the window is just there ! ) or ' are you having a nice day ? '
( I'm in the supermarket on a Saturday - NO ! )
I know that the machine telling you off is patronising but I 'd rather a machine patronise me than a real person .
Alex Cootes , London I have used them , I always use my own bags , and I have nearly always needed assistance due to something not working correctly .
I like tehcnology , but I like flirting with the cute checkout asistsants far more ... so when a handsome face is on offer , I am afraid technology will lose out :D
Aaron jones , Worcester Big Brother gone mad ; I used one of these last week at a well known chain of supermarket .
Like usual i'd brought my own carrier bag .
I scanned my 2 items , pressed the ' have you used your own carrier bag button ' and had to wait 5 minutes for a supervisor to authorise the 1 extra loyalty point ( value 1/ 2p ) onto my card .
I thought these things were here to speed things up and reduce waiting time ?!!
Paul Haines , Bury St Edmunds , Suffolk
Hate them , hate them , HATE THEM !
The thing that makes me most angry is n't that they 're slow , inefficient , noisy , annoying and never work properly .
What I really resent is the way that the supermarkets pretend that it's all about efficiency and providing a better service .
But it is n't .
It 's about a machine costing less to run than a person has to be paid .
It 's so obviously a way for supermarkets to lay people off and replace them with machines .
The last time I tried to use one of those things I got so angry with it that I just left everything half processed and walked out of the store .
I have n't been back in since and I do n't intend to .
I went to a rival supermarket that is n't as good because I 'd rather pay more for inferior products than contribute to a process that devalues human workers .
Alice Wilkes , Bristol I am no technology luddite , but I hate these machines .
They constantly refuse to scan items , constantly go on about unexpected items etc .
However my biggest problem is that they make you do the work yourself .
For the amount we have to pay for our shopping the least you should be able to expect is someone to scan your items and to put them in the bag for you .
Maybe if they offered a 25 % discount on the bill I would think differently !

` Repay the climate debt !'
December 9 , 2009 -- Democracy Now !
ANJALI KAMAT : Angelica , maybe we can start with you .
Talk about the Danish text and your reaction .
ANGELICA NAVARRO , chief climate negotiator for Bolivia :
Well , I have to say that everybody was taken a little bit by surprise , but I also want to congratulate the very good work that the press has been doing , because we have learned it from the press , actually .
And the reaction has been quite straightforward from the G77 , and in two accounts : on process and on the content .
And on the process , I have to say that we are quite surprised , because this is not what we were expecting .
One hundred and ninety - two countries are united here to try to come to a deal .
And there is this pallid process that basically seems to be untransparent , undemocratic , nonparticipatory , top down , that it seems to be imposing itself on what we are trying to achieve with 192 countries .
We think that we have to come back to the real track , and that is a track with participation , inclusiveness and democracy .
That is for the process .
But in the content , we have serious also concerns on the content .
It seems that we are talking about just one agreement , disregarding the two tracks , two mandates and two results that we are trying to achieve here in Copenhagen .
I want to remind everybody that G77 and Bolivia , African Group and other groups have been calling very strongly to have the Kyoto Protocol survive — that is , that developed countries should come with their second commitment period , ambitious numbers for their reductions of emissions .
That is one of the results we want from here .
The second result that we want is , of course , an enhanced implementation of the convention through the process .
What the Danish text seems to do is a merger of the two , which impose new obligations to developing countries .
So we are the ones who are supposed now to be mitigating .
And I ’m asking , what will a developing country , rural men or women — Indigenous women in Bolivia does n’t even have electricity — will mitigate ?
And for what ?
So that developed countries can even have still have two , three cars ?
Or just like four times change their clothes in a year ?
What are they asking ?
Do they want all us to finance the problems they are causing ?
Why should I pay for them ?
But on top of that , why should we choose between building a school , a bridge or a hospital , and adapt ?
So that is what we think .
And on top of that , we think that the level of ambition that was what is proposed in the Danish leaked text is definitely not enough .
It will not solve the problem .
It will not solve the climate change .
AMY GOODMAN : Angelica Navarro , you took the stage by storm , to use a climate metaphor , in June in Bonn , Germany , when you talked about this issue of climate debt .
Explain what you mean by it .
ANGELICA NAVARRO : I just want to remind that actually historical responsibility is already in the convention .
And we were , if I ’m not mistaken , five countries that presented in Bonn , in a technical briefing , a historical responsibility quantification of what developed countries have done and what they should do as a result .
That was India , Brazil , China and Bolivia .
The Bolivian proposal , in specific , is climate debt .
What do I mean and what does Bolivia mean by that ?
It ’s basically that developed countries have over - consumed atmospheric — common atmospheric — space .
Twenty per cent of the population have actually emitted more than two - thirds of the emissions , and as a result , they have caused more than 90 per cent of the increase in temperatures .
As a result , developing countries , we are suffering .
Bolivia ’s glaciers are melting between 40 to 55 per cent .
We have extended droughts .
We have in the lowlands more flooding .
And we are losing between four to 17 per cent of our GDP in the worst years .
That is climate debt .
And what we are asking is repayment .
We are not asking for aid .
We are not asking — we are not begging for aid .
We want developed countries to comply with their obligation and pay their debt .
How are they going to pay it ?
The first part is to pay it through emission reductions domestically .
They have really to fulfill their obligations .
This is not money ...
They just have to comply with their obligations , ambitiously , for the first and second commitment period .
And the second part of the climate debt is adaptation debt .
Everything that we ’re already suffering , as Bolivia , as Indigenous people , in Africa and in other parts , that we can accept that is finance and transfer of technology , but not the peanuts that we are seeing on the table right now that is not even a fraction of what they have used to save their bank .
But apparently , finance and banks are more important than people and life .
And that is very sad , but it ’s like that , because we think that they are negotiating not an environmental agreement .
They seem to be negotiating an economic agreement .
AMY GOODMAN : Evo Morales , your president , is calling for a 49 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions ?
ANGELICA NAVARRO : Yes .
Actually , we have several numbers .
We are asking for the 49 per cent , and I ’m happy to be with Paraguay , because we are co-sponsoring the same , actually , submission .
This 49 per cent has to be in 2017 .
But even like that , developed countries will not be able to repay their debt .
They have to pay more .
We know they cannot do that , but the amount is so important that actually developed countries should do negative cuts .
How are they going to do that ?
We have to think about it .
The 49 per cent is just a fraction of what they are doing .
AMY GOODMAN : What is a negative cut ?
ANGELICA NAVARRO : Meaning that they have to reduce everything to zero , but on top of that they have to liberate atmospheric space they have occupied unrightfully , for developing countries to develop .
What they cannot pay in emission cuts , they can pay a little bit in finance and transfer of technology .
We can think on that .
And , of course , we have to go real on the numbers .
It ’s not only the cuts , but it ’s also the degrees that we want to talk about .
We are talking less than 1 per cent as Bolivia , because 2 per cent is the reality of the North .
Two per cent is 3 per cent for Africa or for the South .
You have to add at least one degree to what developed countries are proposing .
Let ’s get real on the reality of the South has come , and it has to come in numbers .

Interview with Bolivia 's climate change ambassador
`` For the capitalist system everything – nature , even other humans – is considered an object that you can use to obtain a profit . ''
By Robert S. Eshelman
December 9 , 2009 -- Bolivia Rising / The Nation --
On day three of COP15 , I spoke with Bolivia 's climate change ambassador Pablo Erick Solón Romero Oroza about his delegation 's position at COP15 , how negotiations are proceeding and why Bolivian president Evo Morales has called for a Universal Declaration of Rights for Mother Earth .
What are the demands of the Bolivian delegation at COP15 ?
We are asking , first , to discuss the main issue , which for us is Mother Earth .
We think that is the key issue .
Second , we are asking for a goal that will allow that will save all of humanity .
We think the goal that they have put on the table is going to save probably only half of humanity because a two degree Celsius increase and a rise in carbon levels in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million means a 50 % chance that there will be severe ecologic failure .
Third , we want that climate debt be paid .
It should be paid in terms of reduction of emissions , but real reductions , in terms of a transfer of technology and in terms of finance – and that brings me to our fourth point .
We see the numbers when it comes to finance are really too small .
Ten billion dollars when you compare it to what they have spent in terms of military budgets or to save Wall Street they spent trillions of dollars .
But to save the future of mankind , they are saying only US $ 10 billion .
The finally demand is that we really want really want to solve this problem .
We do n't want to make business out of this problem .
We are very against the idea of building a carbon market that will really not solve the problem .
We say let 's save humanity , let 's save the planet and , please , please do n't make profit out of this .
And what has been the reaction to these demands within the negotiations ?
Our demands are included in the negotiations .
But we are at a stage where all of our language that is in the negotiating texts has been bracketed , which means we are very far away from agreement on these issues .
And the process is moving very slow .
If you go into the drafting groups you will see that advances are being made in only a few areas .
Negotiations are difficult but if you really want to delay agreements you will do this sort of thing .
What is the Bolivian delegation 's strategy for pushing back against this resistance to your demands ?
Our position is that in order to have success , we need to have a very important movement of civil society groups that puts a lot of pressure on the governments of the United States and Europe .
If they do n't see this pressure then of course the outcome will be very bad .
But if there is pressure , the negotiations could change .
So I am sure that a lot of negotiators and authorities can change their positions if the pressure comes from the people and not from the corporations .
Because , here , what you see , is huge pressure from transnational companies who are thinking not of how to solve this problem but how to make a business of climate change .
President Morales has called for a Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth .
Why do you think there 's a need for such a document ?
Why , because this problem is about balance – balance between humankind and nature .
What we are seeing with climate change is that this balance has been broken .
Why , because humans act as if they are the only ones who have rights and treat our Mother Earth like , in the past century , slaves were treated – as persons that do n't have rights , as objects , instruments for exploitation .
So if you want to have a balanced relation , humans must recognise that we are not the only one 's that have rights , but also our Mother Earth .
We and nature are part of one system and what happens in one part of the system effects the other part .
This way of thinking has been strengthened because of the capitalist system .
For the capitalist system everything , nature – even other humans – is considered an object that you can use to obtain a profit .
With this system everything can be made into merchandise .
So what we are seeing is the consequence of this vision that you can change everything into merchandise , even nature , even your mother – Mother Earth .

Hardfire producer Gary Popkin sent an email to myself , John Clifton , and Richard Gage , saying that the north tower collapse does look very impressive from the truther point of view : that the top seems to be disintegrating and perhaps loses a lot of mass over the side .
I sent this email to those three men in response .
It covers that and several other points , and is a good place to start for people who wish to examine Gage 's claims on the shows .

Mike Williams of 911 myths.com has obtained , scanned , and made available those notes here and here ( pdfs ) .
Rodriguez has said that his story has n't changed since day one , yet in this interview , as with his statement to NIST , he makes no mention of suspicions of bombs in the basement , of suspicions that the attacks were a U.S. government " inside job " that was covered - up , or that his accounts were ever censored by the media .

This was for the inaugural edition of The Skeptic Zone , which is now Australia 's most popular podcast for social sciences .
Kylie had questions prepared , but Mark and I started chatting , and she decided that was interesting and entertaining enough to record as is .
I hope you agree !

Capitalism : An Apathy Story
Cindy Sheehan
This Thursday , in a move that would make Baron von Louis Rothschild blush with shame ( or burst with pride ) , Goldman Sachs will announce that it is more than doubling its bonus pool : from 11 billion in 2007 to 23 billion in 2008 .
I always thought the concept of the " Welfare Queen " was eliminated during the Clinton Regime ( where his SecTreas was a former chair of G S ) however , Goldman Sachs has received billions of dollars in taxpayer welfare and supposedly paid that back , except for the 13 billion that was funneled through AIG to Goldman through loan guarantees .
Well , would n't it be hunky dory if every loan we consumers took out from these banksters came with a guarantee that if we failed , our government would pay our loans off ?
To diffuse any citizenry guillotine brigades , the Chairman of G S says that one billion dollars of that money will be given to charity , without specifying which charity it will be going to , probably Billionaire Overseas Villa Fund , or something like that .
Well , empty rhetoric or the shiny keys of Madison Avenue hocus - pocus glitz are not fooling me any more .
However , I do n't think much PR spin will be needed around this newest bonus outrage .
There may be some international hell to pay , though , since 19 of the other G20 countries were rightly concerned about the image that out of control bonuses lends the already tarnished state of Robber Class deviltry , I am concerned that the threatening dumping of the dollar will begin to commence in earnest after this round .
Ta-da !
My new tattoo is almost healed .
This was my first time getting inked , and in Taiwan no less !
While I was at dinner at Dozo , my favorite restaurant in Taipei , I noticed that they have a similar hummingbird for their logo .
I still like mine better though .
My tattoo was done at Needle No 8 Tattoo Studio in Taipei by Benjamin , the shop owner , and Mason , my tattoo artist .
So , a little about my new tattoo :
The original design for the tattoo was based off the artwork of Si Scott , a graphic designer and illustrator from Manchester .
The Hummingbird Tattoo
I chose the hummingbird as a reminder to myself to always seek the joy in life .
Hummingbirds are thought to represent peace , love , and happiness .
These tiny little birds are often called new world birds because they are native to North America , Central and South America .
I really liked the idea of getting a tattoo that represents my North American heritage .
The ancient pagans believed that hummingbirds were sacred because of the tireless energy .
They remind us to find the good in life and to seek beauty each and every day .
Hummingbirds are also incredible travelers , and have been known to fly as far as 2000 miles to reach their destination .
This quality teaches us that we should always show persistence and determination in following our dreams and living out our lives to the fullest .
Where to go if you want to get inked in Taiwan :
There are dozens of tattoo studios in Taipei , including a special area of tattoo studios in the back alleys of Ximending .
However , I chose to go with Needle No 8 Tattoo Studio because they came recommended by a friend .
She had a stunning tattoo done on her back last year and I did n’t need much convincing after I saw hers .
I went in knowing the original design had too much detail for a tattoo , so I asked the artist , Benjamin , to leave in as much detail as possible .
I also wanted bright jewel tone colors incorporated into the design mainly because I ’m planning to add a peony to it within the next year .
Mason did the actual tattoo work in under four hours .
A word to the wise , while Mason does n’t speak any English , Benjamin ’s spoken English is quite good .
He will be the first to tell you that he does n’t speak English , but be persistent .
I promise , he knows far more than he lets on .
He ’s just a little shy .
As it turned out , I arrived on the evening of my appointment just as Benjamin and Mason were finishing up with their latest customer .
After chatting with him for a few minutes , he revealed that he was from Brunei and the ONLY reason he was in Taiwan was because he wanted his tattoo done by Mason and Benjamin .
Apparently , these guys are well known throughout Asia for their artwork and expertise .
Hearing his story was like music to my ears .
Since I got my tattoo , I ’ve sent a number of friends to see Benjamin and Mason at Needle No 8 .
They specialize in cover-ups , but they also have an incredible artist on site that does black and white portrait work as well .

( CNN ) --
Now that video game sales have eclipsed Hollywood box office revenues and sales of music CDs , you can bet your bitmaps some extraordinarily good games were released in 2009 .
In fact , therein lies the problem .
With more than 1,500 games released each year -- for computers , consoles and handheld devices -- it 's hard to narrow them down to a " Best of " list , let alone choose one as a holiday gift .
Video game trends for 2009 included sequels ( which is n't a bad thing in the gaming world ) , co-op play ( working together rather than against one another ) , social games ( though the music / rhythm genre is getting saturated ) and of course , the growth of handheld gaming .
But how do you know which games are worth getting blisters over and which ones will quickly become drink coasters ?
Fortunately , you 've come to the right place .
The following are the top picks for the best video games of the year ( each of which cost $ 59.99 unless otherwise specified ) , divided by genre for your convenience .
Best shooter
Activision 's " Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 " ( for Microsoft Xbox 360 , Sony PlayStation 3 , PC ; rated M ) is a gripping near - future military shooter that challenges you to face off against a Russian terrorist organization in locations such as Afghanistan , Rio de Janeiro and Washington .
Along with the single - player campaign are a handful of cooperative and competitive multiplayer maps and modes that give this first - person game plenty of replayability .
Runners - up : Valve / EA's " Left 4 Dead 2 " and 2K Games ' " Borderlands . "
Best action / adventure
" Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves , " from Sony 's Naughty Dog studio , provided the most memorable adventure in 2009 .
This outstanding PlayStation 3 sequel ( rated T ) once again stars Nathan Drake as he searches for a legendary jewel with extraordinary power .
With excellent dialogue , huge set pieces and plenty of action ( including multiplayer modes ) , this cinematic third - person tale makes you feel like the star of an interactive movie .
It also just won game of the year at Spike TV's Video Game Awards .
Runners - up : Ubisoft 's " Assassin's Creed II , " Warner Bros. / Eidos ' " Batman : Arkham Asylum " and Electronic Arts ' " Brutal Legend . "
Best platformer
For kids and kids at heart , Nintendo's " New Super Mario Bros. Wii " ( $ 49.99 ; rated E ) reinvents the classic " side - scroller " -- whereby characters run , jump and battle from the left side of the screen to the right -- by letting up to four gamers play at the same time .
Collect coins , don special suits and discover hidden passages as you race to save the kidnapped princess .
This Nintendo
Wii exclusive is simply one of the year 's most fun party games .
Runner - up : Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment 's " Scribblenauts . "
Best music game
By spinning , scratching and mixing with the included wireless turntable controller , Activision 's " DJ Hero " ( from $ 119.99 ; for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 2/3 , Nintendo Wii ) proved to be the most innovative and immersive music experience of 2009 , as you must " mash - up " two separate songs to create more than 100 mixes for the dance floor .

Runners - up are MTV Games / EA 's " The Beatles : Rock Band " and Activision 's " Band Hero . "

Runners - up are EA Sports ' " NHL 10 " and 2K Sports ' " NBA 2K10 . "
Best role - playing game
Outstanding storytelling , intense action and many dozens of hours of game play are all hallmarks of Bioware 's award - winning role - playing games -- and their latest is no exception .
" Dragon Age : Origins " ( for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC ; rated M ) is a fascinating fantasy adventure in which your decisions will affect how the single - player tale plays out .
Travel through a huge world , use might or magic to defeat foes and unravel an epic story along the way .
Best strategy game

Penguin has just released this trailer promoting Thomas Pynchon 's new novel , Inherent Vice , and the question everyone 's asking is if Pynchon , known for his Salinger - esque hatred of publicity , has come out of hiding to provide the voiceover .
Penguin is n't saying , offering GalleyCat only a " no comment " ; the producers of the video , Meerkat , say it " may or may not feature a cameo voiceover by the reclusive author himself " .
Pynchon might hate to be photographed , but he poked fun at himself with a cameo in the Simpsons ( he appeared with a paper bag over his head but said a few lines ) .
The trailer 's voiceover ends on a similarly wry note : " At that point it gets sort of peculiar .
Maybe you 'll just want to read the book .
Inherent Vice . Penguin Press . $ 27.95 ... $ 27.95 – really ?
That used to be like , three weeks of groceries , man .
What year is this again ? "
And the two voices sound pretty similar to me .
So I think it could well be him .
New York magazine reckons it " totally sounds like it might possibly be him , maybe " .
So what do you think ?
How Banks Fleece the Unemployed Just when you thought the big banks had maxed out their chutzpah account , think again .

While posting breathtaking profits in the last two quarters – Wells Fargo ’s $ 3.2 billion , Citigroup ’s $ 3 billion and Chase ’s $ 2.7 billion – U.S. banks have figured out a way to squeeze some extra dollars from those who can least afford it , the unemployed .
Here ’s how it works .
In the past two years , states have been overwhelmed with unemployment claims .
Always eager to serve , America ’s banks offered a deal the states could n’t refuse .
Sign a contract — which wo n’t cost you a dime — and send us your weekly unemployment funds , the banks said .
In return , we ’ll issue our VISA or MasterCard debit cards to your laid - off workers , on which we ’ll post their benefits electronically .
Thirty states signed on with the usual suspects — Citi , Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America — and some smaller ones , too .
More states are lining up .
In a stroke , states dropped all their costs for printing and mailing checks .
Andrew James , with North Carolina ’s Employment Security Commission , told me that in the past year , his state saved a whopping $ 10 million .
During the same time , Nevada saved $ 800,000 , Maryland $ 400,000 and West Virginia $ 340,000 .
But if the system is good for the states , it 's great for the banks .
A February 2009 Associated Press article noted that Missouri ’s Central Bank , which won that state ’s contract , could reap $ 6.3 million this year alone .
The banks profit from interest earned on the funds the states deposit with them until the money is posted onto the debit cards .
Then there ’s the money the banks get from retailers where the unemployed shop with their cards — from 2 percent to 3 percent per transaction .
But such sums are not large enough , it seems .
So the banks have figured how to extract more money from the millions of unemployed now using the debit cards .
The devil ’s in the fees .
Nickel and Diming
The cards can be beneficial to some of the unemployed , like those who otherwise would pay whopping fees to cash checks because they do n’t have bank accounts .
And , at first glance , many of the terms seem reasonable enough :
Free cash withdrawals from tellers at banks that honor VISA or MasterCard ( over 90 percent in the United States ) and from ATMs owned by the banks with the contracts ( plus one or two others in their networks ) .
However , in practice , the various fees add up .
For example , withdrawals are free — but only to a point .
In Maryland , Citicorp gets $ 1.50 a pop after four free ATM withdrawals a month ; in Nevada , Wells Fargo gets $ 1.25 after two free ones ; in Texas , Chase gets $ 1.50 after only one free withdrawal a week and Missouri ’s Central Bank , which offers no free ATM withdrawals , rakes in $ 1.75 each and every time .
If the bank offering the debit card does n’t have an ATM in a neighborhood or small town , it ’s even worse : Card - holders must use out - of - network ATMs , which spell double trouble .
A first fee goes to the bank with the contract —
Chase charges $ 2.75 in West Virginia and Wells Fargo gets $ 1.25 in Nevada .
A second fee — from $ 2 to $ 4 — goes to the out - of - network bank that owns the ATM , if the recipient does n’t have an account there .
Thus , one withdrawal can cost over $ 5 .
These expenses can mushroom , since recipients use ATMs six to 10 times a month , according to the AP article .
Penalties for transactions denied due to insufficient funds , whether at ATMs or stores , are another costly affront : $ 1.50 in West Virginia and Michigan , and $ 1 in Texas — though the banks , which use electronic systems — need n’t process anything .
Only a few plans , as in Kansas , charge nothing .
To avoid penalties , the jobless must find out how much money is on their cards .
But here ’s another catch : In Nevada , they get one free ATM balance inquiry a month .
After that , the price tag is 50 cents a throw .
In Michigan , it ’s $ 1 for every one after the first ( per week ) .
In Texas , inquiries are free at Chase ATMs , but 50 cents at all others .
So it ’s a costly Catch - 22 .
To avoid fees for declined transactions , the jobless must pay to know what 's on the card , to ensure that a purchase or other transaction wo n't exceed the total .
Lost Cards
If a card is lost , tack on more .
A few banks give the first one gratis , but the next cost $ 5 each ( in Kansas and Maryland ) or $ 7.50 ( in Michigan ) .
In North Carolina , Comerica gets $ 5 , period — no freebies allowed .
Most banks charge nothing for cash withdrawn inside , from tellers , but some levy fees after the first visit in a week or month : $ 5 in Texas and $ 4 in Michigan .
The promise that retailers will give free cash - backs to debit - card users often is another myth .
In Berkeley Springs , West Virginia , the one hardware store in town does n’t give cash back .
Nor do the two gas stations .
The 7 - 11 turns over $ 10 tops .
Food Lion allows up to $ 100 per purchase — but as the customer service rep told me , “ Only if we have the cash . ”
And , most stores ( even in big cities ) do n’t in the early morning or at night .
Could the debit - card terms change and the plans still work — for the banks , states and unemployed ?
Judi Conti , at the National Employment Law Project , says the states could easily negotiate better deals to reduce the fees .
Also , recipients should be able to decide if they want their payments in checks , direct deposits to their bank accounts – which carry no fees at all – or debit cards .
“ The banks , ” she contends , “ could do this and still make an honest profit . ”
At present , a few states offer direct deposits — but most do n’t .
The Workforce West Virginia spokesman told me his state was going to start this “ sometime soon . ”
When ?
It ’s not yet decided .
For now , those without jobs who are trying to stretch every dollar from unemployment insurance are finding the banks eager to nibble away at even those modest sums .

NC has had plates censored also .
" First in Freedom " was offensive to some hand wringer , so NC coveted the Wright brothers success , based on their long history of work in Ohio .
" First in Flight " replaced the horror of the celebration of human freedom from oppressive governments .
I find it funny how intolerant liberals cite the first amendment as a reason to deny free speech .

Interview
One thing is missing from the Global Warming Policy Foundation , launched at Westminster on Monday , chairman Lord Lawson admitted .
Mrs Thatcher 's Chancellor for six years acknowledged that there are n't many young people on board .
The average age of the Trustees is 74 .
You could almost say it pits the Old Aged vs the New Agers .
We got a brief opportunity to talk to Lawson at the launch event - more below .
The think tank is really Benny Piesar 's show .
The Liverpool anthropologist and policy academic , widely known for founding the CCNet mailing list , is the Foundation 's director .
The body may disappoint people who want the scientific controversies tackled head on .
It 's not going to look for the scientific ' smoking pistol ' that skeptics crave .
What 's the point , then ?
As with Lawson 's book An Appeal To Reason , which dissected the Stern report , it is going to take a look at the policies - and ask whether they 're worth it .
Lawson resents the assumption , which he said was expressed by state broadcaster the BBC , that if you accepted the majority view of scientists in the field then you had to accept the policies they proposed , too .
That 's for a democracy to decide .
But speaking to Lawson later , it was clear he did n't think some of the wilder predictions made for man-made global warming had any rational basis .
Lawson
" There is no scientific basis for some of the alarmism .
I 'm talking about the predictions of warming , and the measurement of the impacts .
There 's huge alarmism there . "
He referred to what he called a " a disgraceful television advertisement " from the Department of Energy and Climate Change .
He means the one with the drowning dog .
" We will certainly be actively involved in monitoring what is being said , in correcting errors where the are errors .
The only thing we will not be actively engaged in is what are the causes of the temperature changes on the planet : how much is CO2 , how much is solar radiation , how much is cosmic rays .
We wo n't be getting into all that . "
Lawson was Chancellor when Crispin Tickell , then British Ambassador to the UN , convinced Prime Minister Thatcher that man-made global warming was a problem .
Despite Tickell lacking any scientific background ( he read history at university ) Mrs Thatcher took the population campaigner 's views seriously enough to make a landmark speech on global warming .
This led to the foundation of a branch of the Met Office , the Hadley Centre at Exeter , to study the issue .
It remains one of the three leading climate institutes .
" [ Global Warming ] was n't really getting a head of steam back then .
It did after I left in the 1990s .
I left in 1989 , " he cautions .
But did Lawson anticipate , back then , that it would become this all - encompassing movement ?

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Five months after holding parliamentary elections , Lebanon is still without a government .
The pro-Western coalition that won the vote is floundering in the morass of Lebanon ’s sectarian politics , and the country is once again drifting toward crisis .
What is wrong with Lebanon , and why is it so hard to form a government ?
After the June 7 elections , a simplistic narrative emerged in the West : Because Hezbollah and its allies were defeated at the polls , the Shi’ite militant group would lose some of its luster and a pro-U.S. political coalition would rule Lebanon .
But in fact , Hezbollah remains the country ’s dominant military and political force .
Hezbollah holds the key to both domestic and external stability :
Its actions will determine whether there is another war with Israel or whether Lebanon will once again be wracked by internal conflict .
The current political vacuum gives Hezbollah free rein to continue its military buildup in southern Lebanon .
Saad Hariri , the Sunni leader and U.S. - backed prime - minister - designate , has been unable to form a Cabinet - with the defection of Druze chieftain Walid Jumblatt to the Hezbollah camp just the latest of Mr. Hariri ’s problems .
But this political maneuvering is only a symptom of a much deeper problem : an antiquated power - sharing system adopted six decades ago .
Political deadlock in Lebanon can devolve quickly into sectarian violence .
The last impasse over a government went on for 18 months .
During that time , Lebanon was without a president for six months - and the parliamentary vote to choose a new head of state was postponed 19 times .
The stalemate finally was broken in May 2008 , when Hezbollah ignited the worst internal fighting since the end of Lebanon ’s civil war .
In response to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora ’s orders outlawing Hezbollah ’s underground fiber - optic communication network and dismissing a Hezbollah - affiliated security chief at the Beirut airport , the militia dispatched hundreds of heavily armed fighters into the largely Sunni areas of West Beirut .
They quickly routed Sunni militiamen , seized their political offices and shut down media outlets owned by Mr. Hariri .
Each Lebanese faction accuses the other of serving external masters .
Indeed , Lebanon is part of the ongoing proxy war in the region - pitting Iran and Syria ( which support Hezbollah and its allies ) against the United States , Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab regimes ( which back a coalition of Sunni and Christian parties ) .
But although external players have a hand in the latest political paralysis , they do not deserve all the blame .
Syrian President Bashar Assad and Saudi King Abdullah recently reconciled in Damascus , but that did not break the impasse in Lebanon .
For the most part , the Lebanese did this to themselves - and they need to find a political settlement of their own .
Otherwise , the Sunni - Shi’ite rift in Lebanon will explode , especially because it has been fueled by years of sectarian bloodletting in Iraq .
Lebanon ’s problems are rooted in a 1943 power - sharing agreement installed when the country won its independence from French colonial rule .
The system was designed to keep a balance among 18 religious sects , dividing power between a Maronite Christian president , a Sunni prime minister and a Shi’ite speaker of Parliament .
This confessional system extends from the top ranks of government to the lowest rungs of civil service jobs and has barely changed since it was put in place .
When civil war broke out in 1975 , the political imbalance helped drive the major sects to form their own militias .
Because of the confessional system , Lebanese political institutions never got a chance to develop ; the country remained dependent on the powerful clans and feudal landlords that held sway in much of Lebanon .
The zaeem , or confessional leader who usually inherited rule from his father , became paramount during the war .
Confessionalism leads to a weak state .
It encourages horse trading and alliances with powerful patrons , and it is easily exploited by outside powers ( Syria , Iran , the United States and Saudi Arabia being the latest examples ) .
But most of the current players are too invested in this system to really change it .
Foreign patrons do not want change , either , because that could reduce their influence .
Even if the two factions defuse the latest stalemate and reach a compromise on a new government , another political crisis is sure to emerge unless Lebanon ’s leaders - and its people - tackle the root causes of the country ’s instability .
Eventually , the Lebanese will have to decide what kind of country they want : one built on sectarian gerrymandering or a more democratic way of sharing power .

Inner pacifism is the act of consciously striving for “ oneness ” of the mind ; realizing and minimizing inner conflict that mostly just leaves you feeling confused and upset .
Battling one ’s self leaves no winners .
For when you are divided against yourself , one side of you will necessarily lose .
How often do you experience a feeling or emotion that you believe you should n’t ?
Perhaps you ’re feeling down , then you say , “ I ’ve really got nothing to feel sad about . ”
Perhaps you ’re feeling stressed and anxious when , really , you think “ I should n’t be feeling like this . ”
For me , this inner conflict happens quite often .
And I think it happens to us all naturally .
This sentiment of inner conflict originates from our ideal conceptions about who we believe we “ should ” or “ should n’t ” be , and what we think we “ should ” or “ should n’t ” feel .
This inner conflict becomes normal in the process of each of us striving to be the best person we possibly can be .
Inner conflict is a mechanism of the mind , as if “ survival of the fittest . ”
We subconsciously utilize the division in our heads , this battle between conflicting emotions , as a cheap tool to attempt to determine which of the two emotions is best , supreme , the survivor .
But such inner conflict is an unhealthy process that reaps little rewards .
Conflicting emotions are natural , but being conflicted against yourself within your mind leaves no winners , for one side of you must ultimately lose .
The Battle Within
Have you ever noticed two sides of you battling within your own mind ?
Inner Pacifism is a philosophy of oneness of the mind .
It ’s the refusal to battle yourself over an emotion that you ’re feeling .
The intent of Inner Pacifism is to alleviate inner turmoil and frustration by refraining from battling one ’s self amid emotions or feelings that one considers unwanted , unwarranted , or unnecessary .
It ’s the refusal , at all costs , to do battle with one ’s self , in one ’s mind .
I believe that there is , perhaps , no feeling more stressful and straining than feeling strongly conflicted in one ’s own mind .
It ’s a detrimental cycle .
Below , the negative emotion that one is feeling is represented by X .
Y is the excuse , the rationale , or the reasoning that one puts forth to justify why they “ should n’t ” feel that way .
Z originates with one ’s ideals about who they should be and how they should feel .
But because one does n’t feel that way , the feeling of X is further exacerbated :
I feel “ __X__ , ”
but “ __X__ is n’t how I think I should feel , ”
because “ __Y__ , ” ( the excuse )
and so “ __Z__ is how I think I should feel . ”
But “ I just do n’t feel that way , ”
which makes me “ feel even more __X__ . ”
An example :
I feel “ depressed , ”
but “ depressed is n’t how I think I should feel , ”
because “ I have no reason to feel sad , or , People have it worse than me , ” ( the excuse )
and so “ happier is how I think I should feel . ”
But “ I just do n’t feel that way , ”
which makes me “ feel even more depressed . ”
The cyclical nature of this inner conflict is straining and stressful .
If you are feeling an emotion that is unpleasant or one that you believe should n’t exist , avoid the cyclical detriment of inner conflict .
Instead , explore why the unpleasant emotion exists .
Explore it , understand it , and finally , make peace with it .
For to tell yourself that although a particular emotion exists , that it should n’t for whatever reason , is no different than waging a war in one ’s own mind .
You are pitting two sides of yourself against each other , and one side is certain to lose .
Inner conflict reaps no winners .
Instead , try to practice Inner Pacifism and be at peace with yourself .
There is no worse feeling than feeling conflicted in your own mind .

The first major reaction to Eskom 's pruposed tariff increases to help cover their R30 billion shortfall and the costs of the planned new power plants , was that they should look to bank loans and investment before they look to sabotage the South African economy .
Thankfully Eskom seem to have taken this opinion to heart as they have recently gained loans to the value of about R7.8 billion from various local and international banks
Eskom Holdings Limited has negotiated and concluded Export Credit Agency ( ECA ) covered financing arrangements for Euro 705 million ( approximately R7.8 billion ) with 3 South African banks and 4 International banks .
These loans , covered under Euler Hermes Export Credit Cover , will be used to fund part of the foreign content of the Kusile boiler contract with Hitachi Power Europe ( HPE ) , which forms part of Eskom ’s ongoing investment in infrastructure .
The loan agreements were signed between Eskom as borrower and the following lenders :
 Euro Floating Rate Facility : KfW IPEX - Bank , HSBC , The Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ , Ltd and Deutsche Bank ;
 Euro Fixed Rate Facility : KfW IPEX - Bank ; and
 ZAR Floating Rate Facility : The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited acting through its Corporate and Investment Banking Division , Nedbank Capital and Rand Merchant Bank , a division of FirstRand Bank Limited .
KfW IPEX - Bank acted as Documentation Bank , the ECA Agent and the Euro Floating Rate Facility Agent .
The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited acted as the ZAR Floating Rate Facility Agent .
Australia New Zealand Banking Group Limited ( ANZ ) acted as advisor to Eskom for the structuring and coordination of the transaction .
The loans are re-payable over 12 years starting six months after the commissioning of each of unit of the Kusile Power Station .
Eskom ’s Acting Chairman Mpho Makwana emphasized that “ Given the current status of the international financial markets , this financing is a critical component of Eskom ’s plan that takes us closer to improved security of supply and economic success for South Africa . "
Removing Saddam was right , even without WMD - Blair
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It would have been right to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein even without evidence he had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) , Tony Blair has said .
The former prime minister said it was the " notion " of Saddam as a threat to the region which tilted him in favour of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
But his words have attracted critics - among them Hans Blix , who was in charge of the UN team searching Iraq for WMD .
He said he thought Mr Blair used WMD as a " convenient justification " for war .
" Saddam 's removal was a gain but it 's the only gain that I can see from the war , " said Mr Blix .
I sympathise with the people who were against ... but you know , in the end I had to take the decision
Tony Blair Analysis : Blair 's bombshell
Speaking on BBC One 's Fern Britton Meets programme , Tony Blair was asked whether he would still have gone on with plans to join the US - led invasion had he known at the time that there were no WMD .
He said : " I would still have thought it right to remove him .
I mean obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments , about the nature of the threat . "
He added : " I can't really think we'd be better with him and his two sons still in charge , but it 's incredibly difficult ..
" That 's why I sympathise with the people who were against [ the war ] for perfectly good reasons and are against it now , but for me , you know , in the end I had to take the decision . "
Asked whether it was the idea of Saddam having WMDs which had tilted him in favour of war , Mr Blair said it was " the notion of him as a threat to the region of which the development of WMDs was obviously one " aspect .
' Worth it '
He added that there had been " 12 years of United Nations to and fro on this subject " of Iraq 's weapons and that Saddam had " used chemical weapons on his own people , so this was obviously the thing that was uppermost in my mind - the threat to the region " .
Meanwhile , Iraq 's foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , backed Mr Blair 's stance .
The foreign minister , a member of a government brought into being as a result of the invasion , was a senior Kurdish official during the 1990s .
In 1988 Saddam attacked the Kurds in northern Iraq using chemical weapons .
Mr Zebari told the BBC : " As Iraqis who have gone through the suffering and the agony of Saddam Hussein 's regime , we support Tony Blair 's statement .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" I believe it was worth it .
I believe Saddam Hussein 's regime was an affront to the international community , to the international consciousness because of the atrocities , the crimes , he has committed . "
But Mr Blix disagreed , saying he believed Mr Blair 's statement had a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity " .
" The war was sold on the weapons of mass destruction , and now you feel , or hear that it was only a question of deployment of arguments , as he said , it sounds a bit like a fig leaf that was held up , and if the fig leaf had not been there , then they would have tried to put another fig leaf there . "
Mr Blix added that the weapon inspectors were " pretty close " to showing that after 700 inspections , that there were no WMDs .
Cabinet support Conservative MP Richard Ottoway , a member of Parliament 's Intelligence and Security Committee , said Mr Blair 's comments were a " cynical ploy to soften up public opinion " before his appearance at the Iraq Inquiry .

Mr Ottoway added that Mr Blair had misled parliament on " more than one occasion " and that people would be " dismayed " that what was the " most significant foreign affairs initiative since World War II had been debated on a false premise " .
He added that some MPs may had made a different decision had they known the " full unvarnished truth " .
Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell agreed , saying he would have failed to obtain the support of the House of Commons .
Reg Keys , the father of a British soldier killed in Iraq in 2003 , said he was " absolutely flabbergasted " at Mr Blair 's statement and that he thought Mr Blair was trying to " struggling to find some moral high ground in order to justify the total farce of the Iraq invasion " .
And Carol Turner of the Stop the War Coalition said it was " extraordinary " that Mr Blair was admitting that he was prepared to tailor his arguments to fit the circumstances .
" It 's not a matter of applauding his honesty now ; it 's a matter of attacking his lack of honesty and integrity in the circumstances . "
Mr Blair is set to be the key witness to the Iraq inquiry , which is looking at the whole build - up to the war and its conduct and aftermath .
Fern Britton Meets ... Tony Blair is on BBC One on Sunday at 1000 GMT .

In September 1945 , Masaru Ibuka returned to Tokyo to begin work in the war - damaged capital .
A narrow room with a telephone switchboard located on the third floor of the Shirokiya Department Store ( Tokyu Department Store which closed on January 1999 ) in Nihombashi became the new workshop for Ibuka and his group .
Having barely survived the war fires , the building had cracks all over its concrete exterior .
Without windows , the new office was small and bleak .
Gradually , the office environment started to improve as the silicon steel boards , drilling machines and other equipment were transported from the Suzaka factory , and the personnel who had been tying up loose ends there joined the Shirokiya staff .
In October , Ibuka and his group established a new facility , called “ Tokyo Tsushin Kenkyujo ” ( Totsuken ) , or “ Tokyo Telecommunications Research Institute . ”
Although everyone was eager to work for the new company and to help rebuild post - war Japan with their engineering know - how , no one knew what to do at first .
Most of the salaries were paid out of Ibuka ’s small , and dwindling , savings .
To stay in business , they had to do something .
After the war , the Japanese were hungry for news around the world .
Many had war - damaged radios , or ones that had had the shortwave unit disconnected by the military police to prevent from tuning into enemy propaganda .
Ibuka ’s factory repaired radios and made shortwave converters or adapters that could easily make medium - wave radios into superheterodyne , or all - wave receivers .
Demand for such radios was rapidly increasing .
The shortwave adapters attracted wide attention , and the Asahi Shimbun featured them in its “ Blue Pencil ” column .
As a result , demand increased even further .
This article also brought Ibuka and Akio Morita back together again ( * ) .
As the war ended , Morita was back home at Kosugaya , in Aichi Prefecture .
One day , he read the column that mentioned Ibuka ’s name , and he wrote to his friend immediately .
Ibuka replied at once , urging Morita to come to Tokyo .
Since he had been offered a job as a lecturer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology ( Tokodai ) , Morita wasted no time in moving to Tokyo and in renewing their acquaintance .
In addition to work , radio repairs brought employees an extra reward as well .
They often received rice from houses they visited on service calls , in addition to a normal service fee .
This was treasured during a time of serious food shortages .
Subsequently , Ibuka ’s factory worked on an electric rice cooker ( pictured ) .
As the war plants had closed down , there was more electricity than was needed at the time .
This surplus fed Ibuka ’s desire to produce items which were needed for everyday life .
The electric rice cooker , made by merely interlocking aluminum electrodes which were connected to the bottom of a wooden tub , was a primitive product .
The result depended heavily on the kind of rice used and the weight of the water .
Tasty rice was a rarity , as the rice cooker produced mostly undercooked or overcooked rice .
It was a memorable first failure for Ibuka and his staff .
(*) Ibuka and Morita , the founders of Sony , first encounterd each other at the meetings of the Wartime Research Committee that was studying new types of weapons during the war .
The two men became close friens , thought Ibuka was more than a dozen years older .
Share prices in the City suffered their biggest fall since March today amid fears that a debt crisis in the millionaires ' playground of Dubai heralded a new phase in the global financial meltdown and a double - dip recession in 2010 .
With Alistair Darling admitting that he had been forced to rip up his already gloomy forecasts for the UK economy this year , the FTSE 100 index of leading shares dropped more than 170 points – wiping £ 44bn off their value .
The market turmoil – which saw jittery investors retreat to the traditional safe havens of bonds , the Swiss franc and the US dollar – followed news that the government - owned conglomerate Dubai World had asked its creditors for a six - month debt moratorium .
As concerns grew that a fledgling economic rally stimulated by rock - bottom global interest rates might have run its course , the price of crude oil fell by almost $ 2 a barrel and speculators shunned riskier markets in emerging countries .
Banks were the hardest hit stock market sector , and shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered – which are exposed to a property crash in Dubai – fell heavily .
The chancellor said in heated Commons exchanges that the UK would return to growth at the turn of the year after its weakest performance in the postwar era , but analysts said the problems in Dubai increased the risks of a double - dip recession in 2010 .
" The crisis in Dubai has brought up speculation about how many more skeletons might be left in the cupboard , " said Richard McGuire , a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London .
Graham Turner , of consultancy GFC Economics , said : " It gives you a picture of the fact that credit problem persists , despite everything that 's been done . "
Governments have cut interest rates , created new electronic money and allowed budget deficits to reach record levels in an attempt to boost growth after the near - collapse of the global financial system , but Turner said the problems in Dubai were indicative of widespread malaise .
" Despite having oil , it 's still the case that many of these countries had explosive credit growth .
It 's very clear that in 2010 , we 've got plenty more problems in store .
" Investors had recently begun to recover appetite for high - risk , high - return assets , showing more confidence in the global economy , including emerging markets .
Stocks and bonds had rallied since March , with the FTSE – which dropped by more than 3 % today – showing a gain of 50 % .
Andrew Clare , professor of asset management at Cass Business School , said : " This may be the first sign that people are thinking you can't get back to the debt - fuelled halcyon days of 2007 .
" I think this is just part of a wider problem .
I just do n't understand the basis for the market rally : equity prices had gone too far .
Investors are underpricing all the risks that are out there , and this is just one of them .
Some of those risks are going to come home to roost , and this is just the first .
" And next year they 're going to have the shock of realising that interest rates can go up as well as down ; and you 've also got places like the UK , where taxes are going to have to go up and public spending will have to be cut – and the US , too , has some difficult decisions to make . "
Darling confessed to MPs todaythat the severity of the recession caught him by surprise , paving the way for a drastic cut in the Treasury 's growth forecasts in his pre-budget report next month .
Despite expectations that output would expand by between 0.2 % and 0.4 % in the final three months of 2009 – the first growth in seven quarters – the chancellor will announce a 4.75 % decline in activity in his pre-budget report - much worse than the 3.5 % decline forecast in April 's budget .
The chancellor said today that " new data " showed the economy had been hit much harder than he had expected .
" At the time of the budget , my forecast for growth in 2009 was in line with the average of external forecasters .
Since then , new data has shown that most economies , ours included , suffered a severe shock in the first quarter of this year , " the chancellor told MPs .
The new 4.75 % projection would imply a return to modest growth in the final quarter of this year , after a recession that has now lasted for 18 months .
George Osborne , the chancellor 's Tory shadow , lambasted Labour 's response to the crisis .
" You say it was always obvious to you that because Britain had such a large financial sector we would be among the worst affected and that our recovery would be delayed .
Why then did the prime minister say Britain would be leading the world out of recession ? " he asked .
State Department guards in Afghanistan ( Photo : gawker.com )
September 1 , 2009
Drunken brawls , prostitutes , hazing and humiliation , taking vodka shots out of buttcracks � no , the perpetrators of these Animal House - like antics are n't some depraved frat brothers .
They are the private security contractors guarding Camp Sullivan , otherwise known as the US Embassy in Kabul .
These allegations , and many more , are contained in a letter sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday by the Project on Government Oversight , which has been investigating the embassy security contract held by ArmorGroup North America ( a subsidiary of Wackenhut , which is in turn owned by the security behemoth G4S ) .
The contractor was the subject of a congressional probe earlier this summer that found serious lapses in the company 's handling of the embassy security contract , which internal State Department documents said left the embassy compound " in jeopardy . "
Nevertheless , the government opted to extend the company 's 5 - year , $ 189 million contract for another year .
Underscoring the scope of the problems within ArmorGroup 's Afghanistan operation , POGO says that nearly a tenth of the company 's 450 - man embassy security force contacted the watchdog group to " express concerns about and provide evidence of a pattern of blatant , longstanding violations of the security contract , and of a pervasive breakdown in the chain of command and guard force discipline and morale . "
In the letter to Clinton , POGO executive director Danielle Brian writes :
This environment has resulted in chronic turnover by U.S. / ex - pat guards .
According to the State Department , " nearly 90 % of the incumbent US / Expats left within the first six months of contract performance . "
According to POGO sources , the U.S. / ex - pat guard turnover may be as high as 100 percent annually .
This untenable turnover prevents the guard force from developing team cohesion , and requires constant training for new replacement recruits .
The guards have come to POGO because they say they believe strongly in the mission , but are concerned that many good guards are quitting out of frustration or being fired for refusing to participate in the misconduct , and that those responsible for the misconduct are not being held accountable .
Brian 's letter suggests that Wackenhut Vice President Sam Brinkley , who testified before a Senate panel in June about ArmorGroup 's performance of the embassy contract , may have misled Congress .
Despite Wackenhut Vice President Sam Brinkley 's sworn Senate testimony that " �the Kabul contract has been fully - staffed since January 2009 � " the truth is that chronic understaffing of the guard force continues to be a major problem .
And evidence suggests Mr. Brinkley knew that .
Around March , according to numerous participants , he was confronted by some 50 guards at Camp Sullivan who complained to him directly about a severe , ongoing guard shortage .
Then , in an April 2009 memo to a State Department official , U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force Commander Werner Ilic reported that guard shortages had caused chronic sleep deprivation among his men .
He described a situation in which guards habitually face 14 - hour - day work cycles extending for as many as eight weeks in a row , frequently alternating between day and night shifts .
He concluded that " this ultimately diminishes the LGF's [ Local Guard Force 's ] ability to provide security . "
The contract with the State Department specifies that guards may not be on duty for longer than 12 consecutive hours .
Interviewees and documents reveal that short - staffing frequently results in the denial of contractually guaranteed leave and vacation , and that those who do not comply are threatened with termination or actually fired .
But criticisms of failing to meet manpower obligations are nothing compared to the bacchanalian activities ArmorGroup 's personnel were allegedly engaged in .
Guards have come to POGO with allegations and photographic evidence that some supervisors and guards are engaging in near - weekly deviant hazing and humiliation of subordinates .
Witnesses report that the highest levels of AGNA management in Kabul are aware of and have personally observed �or even engaged in �these activities , but have done nothing to stop them .
Indeed , management has condoned this misconduct , declining to take disciplinary action against those responsible and allowing two of the worst offending supervisors to resign and allegedly move on to work on other U.S. contracts .
The lewd and deviant behavior of approximately 30 supervisors and guards has resulted in complete distrust of leadership and a breakdown of the chain of command , compromising security .
Numerous emails , photographs , and videos portray a Lord of the Flies environment .
One email from a current guard describes scenes in which guards and supervisors are " peeing on people , eating potato chips out of [ buttock ] cracks , vodka shots out of [ buttock ] cracks ( there is video of that one ) , broken doors after drnken [ sic ] brawls , threats and intimidation from those leaders participating in this activity� . "
Photograph after photograph shows guards �including supervisors �at parties in various stages of nudity , sometimes fondling each other .
These parties take place just a few yards from the housing of other supervisors .
Multiple guards say this deviant hazing has created a climate of fear and coercion , with those who declined to participate often ridiculed , humiliated , demoted , or even fired .
The result is an environment that is dangerous and volatile .
Some guards have reported barricading themselves in their rooms for fear that those carrying out the hazing will harm them physically .
Others have reported that AGNA management has begun to conduct a witch hunt to identify employees who have provided information about this atmosphere to POGO .
These allegations raise serious questions about why ArmorGroup has been allowed to retain this important contract , which gives the company the responsibility for protecting the lives of the hundreds of diplomats , officials , and others who work within the embassy compound .
Also in question is the State Department 's ability to provide adequate oversight of contractors under its jurisdiction .
It should at least be able to ensure that its embassy does n't provide the backdrop for a Contractors Gone Wild video .
POGO is calling on the State Department to launch an independent investigation of the Kabul embassy contract and to " consider initiating suspension and debarment proceedings against the companies ArmorGroup North America . "
As for the State Department officials who were supposed to be providing oversight , the watchdog says they , too , should be held accountable .
Perhaps as punishment they ought to be forced to watch the buttcrack vodka shot video .
UPDATE : The State Department responds .
Plus :
Why did a top State official tell Congress in June that ArmorGroup 's performance in Afghanistan " has been and is sound " when internal documents suggest he had reason to belive otherwise ?

OT ALERT "
VIRUS in the VOTING MACHINES : Tainted Results in NY - 23 "
GOUVERNEUR , NY -
The computerized voting machines used by many voters in the 23rd district had a computer virus - tainting the results , not just from those machines known to have been infected , but casting doubt on the accuracy of counts retrieved from any of the machines .
Cathleen Rogers , the Democratic Elections Commissioner in Hamilton County stated that they discovered a problem with their voting machines the week prior to the election and that the " virus " was fixed by a Technical Support representative from Dominion , the manufacturer .
The Dominion / Sequoia Voting Systems representative " reprogrammed " their machines in time for them to use in the Nov. 3rd Special Election .
None of the machines ( from the same manufacturer ) used in the other counties within the 23rd district were looked at nor were they recertified after the " reprogramming " that occurred in Hamilton County .
Republican Commissioner Judith Peck refused to speculate on whether the code that governs the counts could have been tampered with .
She indicated that " as far as I know , the machine in question was not functioning properly and was repaired " by the technician .

COMPANY WITH TIES TO CHAVEZ UPDATED SOFTWARE DAYS BEFORE ELECTION TO “ FIX ” THE PROBLEM by John Charlton ( Nov. 19 , 2009 , 7:00 PM ET ) — Nathan Barker of The Gouverner Times has reported a series of facts which seemingly support Dough Hoffman ’s allegations that there was massive Election fraud in the special election for the NY - 23 House seat : 1 . The software used in the voting machines is made by a company controlled by the Venezuelan dictator , Chavez ; 2 . A virus was found in the machines used in one district , only days before the election ; 3 . Other districts were not informed of the existence of the virus ; 4 . The voting machines lack security for introduction of multiple ballots at a time , 5 .
And election officials lack expertise to determine whether the company ’s fix of the problems was done in a manner which returned the voting machines ’ capacity to tally impartially election - night results .
Barker reported nearly 3 hours ago that the voting machines used to tally the vote in the NY - 23 Congressional district were found to have been infected by a virus only days before the election : Read more here .

So , e-vote machines can be hacked ?
You 're kidding !!!
Hugo Chavez hacked the NY - 23 , he was up for Owens .
How about : e-vote machines were hackable since they were introduced , NOT just in the Hoffman election !
The bigger picture is , you 're saying they 're hackable .
Thanks !
They 're not just hackable when a Republican loses .
I thought I saw Hugo Chavez with an " Vote for change - Owens " t- shirt on !

If helping people to learn how and where to register and then helping them to know when , where and how to vote is stealing , then the HAVA is stealing and it's bi-partisan .
By the way , it came about AFTER the theft of the 2000 election which the GOP operatives proudly and loudly announced before hand they would GUARANTEE for George W. Bush .
Then , in 2008 , those who worked for him in Ohio carried out similar if not many of very the same tactics .
Ca n't call 'em shy !

The IE team is busy working on the next version of the world 's most popular browser .
IE 8 is the most widely used browser on Windows .
IE 9 is currently in the oven and the IE team is ready to talk about what they 're working on .
Here , JavaScript engine team members John Montgomery , Steve Lucco and Shanku Niyogi give us an early look at the new JS engine that will ship with IE 9 .
As of the interview , it is on par with the latest performance numbers of the latest Firefox beta and making progress in catching up to Chrome 's latest V8 .
Again , this is a really early look at where the JS engine is and where it 's going ( and what they 've done , architecturally , to speed up IE 's JS engine ) .
Enjoy !
Beginning today , Google will now personalize the search results of anyone who uses its search engine , regardless of whether they ’ve opted - in to a previously existing personalization feature .
Searchers will have the ability to opt - out completely , and there are various protections designed to safeguard privacy .
However , being opt - out rather than opt - in will likely raise some concerns .
The company has an announcement here .
Below , a deeper look .
How Search Personalization Works
For those unfamiliar with how personalized search works , see my Google Search History Expands , Becomes Web History .
It goes into great detail about how Google personalizes results .
The short story is this .
By watching what you click on in search results , Google can learn that you favor particular sites .
For example , if you often search and click on links from Amazon that appear in Google ’s results , over time , Google learns that you really like Amazon .
In reaction , it gives Amazon a ranking boost .
That means you start seeing more Amazon listings , perhaps for searches where Amazon was n’t showing up before .
The results are custom tailored for each individual .
For example , let ’s say someone else prefers Barnes & Nobles .
Over time , Google learns that person likes Barnes & Noble .
They begin to see even more Barnes & Nobles listings , rather than Amazon ones .
Of course , people will be clicking on a variety of sites , in search results .
So it ’s not a case of having one favorite that that simply shows up for everything .
Indeed , Google ’s other ranking factors are also still considered .
So that person who likes Amazon ?
If they ’re looking for a plumber , Amazon probably is n’t close to being relevant , so the personalization boost does n’t help .
But in cases where Amazon might have been on the edge ?
Personalization may help tip into the first page of results .
And personalization may tip a wide variety of sites into the top results , for a wide variety of queries .
Privacy Issues
To personalize results , Google has to record what you ’re doing — and that rings privacy alarm bells .
Can people see what you ’ve looked for ?
How long is the material kept ?
Can you just turn it off ?
You can turn it off .
A history is kept for 180 days .
You can delete that history at any time , but even if you do n’t , it ca n’t actually be viewed .
In particular , we now have two “ flavors ” of personalized search , or “ Web History ” as is the official Google name for it .
There ’s Signed - Out Web History and Signed - In Web History .
In Signed - Out Web History , Google knows that it has seen someone using a particular browser before .
Behind the scenes , it has tracked all the searches that have been done by that browser .
It also logs all the things people have clicked on from Google ’s search results , when using that browser .
There ’s no way to see this information , but it is used to customize the results that are shown .
It only remembers things for 180 days .
Information older than that is forgotten .
Google does n’t know your name .
If you use a different browser , Google does n’t know your past history .
In fact , you ca n’t even see your past history .
In Signed - In Web History , Google knows that a particular Google user is using Google .
Behind the scenes , it has kept a record of all the things that person has done when signed - in , regardless of what computer or browser they ’ve used .
If they ’re using the Google Toolbar with the page tracking feature enabled , then it has also kept a record of all the pages they ’ve viewed over time .
This information can be viewed by the user at any time , and the user can selectively delete info .
They can also delete everything , if they want .
If they do n’t , then Google forgets nothing .
Let ’s do a chart :
Feature Signed - Out Signed - In
What ’s recorded
What you click on in search results
What you click on in search results & pages you visit , if Google Toolbar tracking feature is specifically enabled
How long is data kept ?
180 days Forever , or until user deletes it Can you view search history ?
No Yes Can you opt - out permanently ?
Yes Yes
Ca n’t View History
An important aspect to the change is understanding that there ’s no way for you — or anyone — to see what you ’ve searched on or clicked on in the past , if you ’re using the signed - out version of web history .
Google Now Notifies Of “ Search Customization ” & Gives Searchers Control goes into much more depth about how last year , Google began notifying searchers if it changed their results based on their previous query .
Clicking on the notification would show the previous query , which might be embarrassing or worse if you left your computer and someone else saw it .
To limit exposure , only the last 30 minutes of previous query information was shown .
With the change , Google ’s storing much more than the last 30 minutes of previous history .
However , that ’s not being shown .
Let ’s do some pictures .
Here , I ’ve done a search for spain :
Notice the arrow pointing to Web History .
This is effectively a default notification that results are being logged for personalization .
Clicking on it leads to a notification page that in turn allows for opting - out .
Now here ’s another search I did right after that , for travel :
Notice I ’m pointing at the “ View customizations ” link that has now appeared .
This is another notification , an explicit one where Google ’s saying effectively “ Hey !
You searched for ‘ travel , ’ but I ’ve altered the results I ’ve shown you based on things I know about you personally . ”
So what ’s Google know ?
In this case , if you click on the link , you get shown :
I ’ve highlighted the key part .
Google ’s saying that it used your search history to alter this .
Almost certainly , this means it saw I had just search for “ spain , ” and so added that word to the query “ travel . ”
In the past , it would have told me this specifically .
But now that data is being kept longer , it ’s not showing any previous query or past search history material .
This Freaks Me Out !
Do n’t like the idea of your searches being recorded , even if you ’re not logged in ?
Keep in mind a few things for perspective :
All the major search engines have long recorded what you search on .
Google ’s simply using it to refine your results , in addition to what the others do , show ads
Your browser itself records what you search on — and often , people fail to clear their browser histories .
You do n’t have to use it .
Remember I mentioned that opt - out page ?
Let ’s see what it says :
See the link I ’ve pointed at ?
Click on that , and you ’ve turned off logging for personalization purposes .
Google will no longer keep track of what you ’ve searched on in the past , in association with your browser , in order to perform personalization .
In addition , Google remembers that you do n’t want to be logged in the future .
For the technically inclined , this is nice .
It means you can have a Google cookie that knows you do n’t want to be logged , rather than having to access Google without a cookie at all .
Note that even if you opt - out , Google will still be logging what you search on as it always has done .
It just wo n’t personalize using that information .
And after 180 days , even this logged - but - not - used information is deleted automatically ( see Anonymizing Google ’s Server Log Data — How ’s It Going ? for more about this ) .
Change your mind ?
Click on that Web History link I mentioned earlier .
It will oddly still show , even if you ’ve opted out and nothing is being logged ( plus , “ Web History ” is a bad name , since for signed - out users , it ’s not really tracking what you do on the web ) .
Click Web History , and you can enable custom search .
What About Diversity ?
Interestingly , I ’ve spoken on the subject of Google ’s preexisting search personalization feature three times over the past week , and each time , a key question has arisen .
If Google rewards the sites you like , does that mean eventually you ’ll only see stuff you like ?
Would a conservative see only conservative web sites ?
A liberal see only liberal web sites ?
No , Google says .
Annoyingly , the company will not give any metrics about what percentage of results a typically searcher gets back that are personalized in some way nor the percentage of the results themselves that are changed .
IE , are 85 % of queries personalized ?
And if you get a page of personalized results , are 20 % of the links on that page personalized ?

On Wednesday , December 9th , the New York Times published an op -ed by Congressman Bart Stupak in which he makes misleading claims about the Stupak - Pitts Amendment in the House Health Care Reform bill .
Here , Congresswoman Lois Capps ( D - CA ) , author of the Capps Amendment , provides a reality check to the claims in that op - ed .
Stupak
Claim :
Our amendment maintains current law , which says that
there should be no federal financing for abortion .
Reality : The Stupak - Pitts Amendment goes well
beyond current law by contracting access to abortion services and is in no way
the simple extension of the Hyde Amendment its proponents claim .
It dramatically
restricts consumers ’ ability to purchase comprehensive health plans that
include coverage for abortion services in the health exchange .
In
contrast the Capps Amendment , which was included in the original version of the
House bill , continued the prohibition of federal funding of abortion services ,
but did so without restricting insurance coverage of this legal medical
procedure when it is paid for with private funds .
Reputable
third parties , like a recent study from George Washington University , have
found that the Stupak–Pitts Amendment would
restrict coverage of abortion services even when paid for entirely with
private funds .
Stupak
Claim : Under our amendment , women who receive federal subsidies
will be prohibited from using them to pay for insurance policies that cover
abortion .
The amendment does not prevent private plans from offering abortion
services and it does not prohibit women from purchasing abortion coverage with
their own money .
The amendment specifically states that even those who receive
federal subsidies can purchase a supplemental policy with private money to
cover abortions .

Reality :
There is nothing in the
Stupak - Pitts Amendment to ensure that riders are available or affordable to
individuals purchasing coverage in the Exchange .
There is no
evidence that insurance companies actually offer such riders in the five states
that currently require women to purchase a separate rider for abortion
coverage .
It is not practical to expect women to plan ahead for an
unintended pregnancy , or a pregnancy that goes terribly wrong , by purchasing a
supplemental rider .
Furthermore , if only women of childbearing age
purchase such a rider then the premium for the rider will likely cost almost as
much as the service .
Stupak
Claim : Some opponents of the amendment have tried to argue that
it would effectively end health insurance coverage of abortion in both the
private and public sectors .
This argument is nothing more than a scare tactic .
Reality :
It is highly unlikely that
any insurance plan is going to go through the pain staking process of setting
up two separate plans — one with abortion services offered and one without – to
cater to less than 20 % of the Exchange participants who are allowed to buy
plans that include abortion services .
As noted
by Robert Laszewski , consultant to the insurance industry , in a recent
interview with NPR , it would n’t make any business sense to offer a plan
that would only be available to such a small number of potential customers .
A
recent report by George Washington University similarly concluded that the
effect of the Stupak amendment would “ militate against the creation of a
supplemental coverage market . ”
The argument
that this amendment wo n’t restrict access for women who are paying for
insurance entirely out of their own pockets is false .
Stupak
Claim :
The language in our amendment is completely consistent
with the Hyde Amendment , which in the 33 years since its passage has done
nothing to inhibit private health insurers from offering abortion coverage .
There is no reason to believe that a continuation of this policy would suddenly
create undue hardship for the insurance industry — or for those who wish to use
their private insurance to pay for an abortion .
Reality : The Stupak - Pitts Amendment
goes well beyond current law by contracting access to abortion services and is
in no way the simple extension of the Hyde Amendment its proponents claim .
The Hyde Amendment
prohibits federal funding for abortion in Medicaid programs except in
cases of rape , incest and to protect the life of the women , but it allows
states to use their own funds to pay for abortions in other cases .
Applying this same principle , the Capps Amendment , would have prohibited federal
funding to pay directly for abortions in insurance plans in the Exchange ,
but would allow plans to pay for these services using private funding from
patient premiums .
Just as churches and military contractors are able to
segregate federal funds from other sources of funding , insurance companies can
do the same .
Stupak
Claim : Given that insurance companies are able to offer
separate plans with and without abortion coverage now , it seems likely that
they would be able to continue to do so on the newly established health
insurance exchange .
Reality : The Stupak - Pitts Amendment severely limits private plans ’
ability to cover abortions .
The Stupak - Pitts Amendment would prohibit
any abortions beyond the Hyde exceptions within the public option and any plans
sold in the Exchange to individuals who receive affordability credits .
Although insurance companies are permitted to offer plans that cover abortion
to individuals who do not receive affordability credits , they would only be able
to do so if they offered two nearly identical plans with the only difference
being coverage and exclusion of abortion services .
Furthermore health
insurance companies would be unlikely to even offer a plan that does receive
any funding from affordability credits because the risk pool would be too
small .
In effect , this ensures there will not be any private plans
covering abortion available to individuals and small businesses that purchase
health insurance in the new Exchange .
Stupak Claim :
It is also disingenuous
to argue ( as some have ) that it would be a hardship for insurance companies to
provide plans with and without abortion coverage — when the health care bill as
introduced in the House and Senate mandated exactly that .
Under language
suggested by Representative Lois Capps , Democrat of California , the new
insurance exchange would be required to provide at least one plan that covers
abortion and one plan that does not .
If offering separate abortion - free plans
in this way was acceptable under the Capps language ( which has been endorsed by
abortion - rights groups ) , then it should also be acceptable under the
Stupak - Ellsworth - Pitts Amendment .
Reality : Under the Capps language
the Exchange would have to ensure that there is at least one plan that does not
include abortion services and one that does .
These plans could be
offered by the same company or different companies , so long as consumers were
offered at least one of each option .
In contrast the Stupak - Pitts
Amendment requires private plans that want to offer a comprehensive plan
including abortion services – and most private plans currently do offer
comprehensive plans – they would have to offer an identical plan that does not
include abortion services .
So if Blue Cross Blue Shield wanted to
offer a comprehensive plan they would also have to offer an identical plan
without those services .
According
to insurance industry consultants like Robert Laszewski it would n’t make
any business sense to offer a plan that would only be available to such a small
number of potential customers ( since less than 20 percent of the exchange
customers would even be allowed to purchase a comprehensive plan ) .
And
that is why anyone in the Exchange – even those paying for insurance completely
on their own – would n’t have access to abortion coverage .
The argument
that this amendment wo n’t restrict access for women who are paying for insurance
entirely out of their own pockets is false .
Stupak
Claim :
While many accusations have been thrown around in recent
months , the intent behind our amendment is simple and clear : to continue
current law , which says that there should be no federal financing of abortions .
Our intent was not to change , add or take anything away from federal law .
Reality : Again , the
Stupak - Pitts Amendment goes well beyond current law by contracting access to
abortion services and is in no way the simple extension of the Hyde Amendment
its proponents claim .
Regardless of intent , the amendment does dramatically restrict
consumers ’ ability to purchase comprehensive health plans that include coverage
for abortion services in the health exchange .
In contrast the Capps Amendment
continued the prohibition of federal funding of abortion services , but did so
without restricting insurance coverage of this legal medical procedure when it
is paid for with private funds .
Reputable third parties , like a recent
study from George Washington University , have found that the Stupak - Pitts
Amendment would restrict coverage of abortion services even when paid for
entirely with private funds .
Stupak
Claim :
This goal is consistent with the opinion of a majority
of Americans .
Recent CNN and Washington Post - ABC
News polls found that 61
percent of Americans do not want taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions .
And
while the Senate voted down a similar amendment on Tuesday , I ’m hopeful that
the spirit of our legislation will make it into the final bill .
Reality : The Capps language is consistent with both
current law and public opinion because it explicitly prohibits federal funding
for abortion services except those allowed by the Hyde Amendment : rape ,
incest , and to protect the life of the woman .
Furthermore , recent polling
conducted by the Mellman Group found that :
54 %
of voters would oppose a health care reform plan that prevented private
insurance plans from covering abortion .
56 % of voters believe
that those who receive partial subsidies should be able to buy plans that
cover abortion – surpassing those who oppose this choice by a 20 point
margin .
52 % of voters support
the “ Capps compromise , ” which would prohibit federal dollars , including
partial subsidies , from being used to pay for abortions , though abortions
could be paid using private funds generated by patients ’ premiums .
47 % agreed that
“ Political differences should not prevent us from moving forward on an
otherwise good healthcare reform plan . ”
As
pollster Mark Mellman noted a column in The Hill recently ,
“ Americans do not want reform to be an excuse for tightening restrictions on
abortion or for taking away health coverage millions already have .
Nor do they
want an abortion debate to stop reform .
Voters want an abortion - neutral
healthcare reform . ”

The odds of getting into UC Berkeley are shrinking even more .
The odds of getting into UC Berkeley were never high .
According to the College Board ’s latest figures , Cal Berkeley ’s acceptance rate is 22 % .
Expect that to get even worse .
UC Berkeley is going to become even more impregnable for California high school seniors .
Next year , UC Berkeley expects to accept 15 % fewer Californians .
The reason for the rising rejection rate all boils down to money .
The flagship school is starving for cash because its state support has dropped alarmingly for years .
To generate cash , Cal Berkeley is going to accept more out - of - state and international applicants .
California students are paying $ 8,325 in tuition and fees at Cal Berkeley and everybody else is paying $ 30,346 .
And folks that does n’t include the $ 15,308 tab for room and board .
All those tuition payments from outsiders will generate millions of extra dollars .
With UC Berkeley and other UC campuses in a historic financial crisis , it begs the question why rich outsiders would want to pay more than $ 46,000 a year to attend school here .

How to Make French Vinaigrette
Pin 2 K 3K Shares
One assumption that I ’m going to make about the French is that they ’re not afraid to make things au pif , or “ by the nose ” .
I do n’t know if a precise recipe for sauce vinaigrette actually exists .
But if there is , I bet few people follow it very closely .
And Romain is no different from his compatriots when it comes to recipes , and rules .
They are both for other people — and do n’t apply to him .
Vinaigrette is just one of those things .
It ’s a few simple ingredients which comes together so well , when done right .
Anyone can make it : you just pour , stir , marinate , then taste until it ’s just right .
But the salad dressings in France always taste better to me than elsewhere .
So I thought I ’d follow Romain when he made a true vinaigrette .
He was surprised at the idea of measuring anything , so I follow him through the steps , taking a few notes along with way ( see Recipe , at the end ) and along the way , I learned two French secrets for a great salad dressing .
One is that you must use good Dijon mustard .
Most French people use Maille or Amora , which are easily - available and decent brands .
And although the French are n’t known for embracing spicy foods , when it comes to mustard , all bets are off and no one minds using one that ’s especially zippy .
Personally , I ’m a fan of Edmond Fallot mustard , which is made from French - grown spices and exactly the right balance of spices for me .
My Francophile cousin always brings some back to the states to make a salmon glaze since she says the other mustards just do n’t taste the same .
Either way , just be sure to find a good Dijon mustard , preferably made in France , and use that .
The other secret to a great salad dressing is the use of les échalotes .
Some Americans are n’t that familiar with shallots , which are the chic cousins of onions .
Shallots , when marinated in vinegar , soften and add an attention - grabbing flavor to the dressing because of its slight bite .
I would n’t dream of making a salad dressing without them .
Do try mincing one and adding a bit to your next salad dressing ; you ’ll be amazed at the difference .
The first thing Romain does is to mince a small shallot pretty fine .
The shallots in America are huge , around the size of a small onion .
In France , I prefer the shallots longue , which are narrow and slender .
But Romain just uses the regular shallots , so do n’t listen to me .
Cut it pretty fine .
If your knife skills are n’t up to snuff , just run a chef ’s knife over the shallot slices a few times after you ’ve cut the shallot up and that should do it .
Next , mix the shallots in a bowl with the vinegar and a decent pincée ( pinch ) of salt .
Sherry or wine vinegar is best , and I ’m trying to wean everyone in the world off balsamic vinegar , which is too syrupy for a salad .
( You are welcome to post on one of those foodie bulletin boards about how I do n’t know what I ’m talking about when it comes to vinegar in salads .
But try sherry vinegar before you do .
If you do n’t like it , then you can post away . )
When I moved here , I bought a bottle of sherry vinegar , and when a friend came over she said , “ Oooh !
That ’s so French ! ” I did n’t know how French I was until that bottle took up residence on my kitchen shelf , but it does make a difference .
Romain uses white wine vinegar that his parents have in a crock in their kitchen .
Did you know that vinaigre is actually a liason between two words , vin ( wine ) and aigre ( sour ) .
So theoretically , that sweet balsamic does n’t cut it in the sour department .
And believe me , you do n’t want argue with the French about their language .
( Remember what happened last time I tried to make up a word ?
Yikes … )
Let the shallots sit and “ pickle ” for a few minutes .
This can be done a few hours in advance , and that extra time means they ’ll mellow even more .
Adding the salt now helps to make sure that it dissolves , so do that .
And this step is especially important if using coarse or flaky sea salt , as they often do in France .
Then you want to add some Dijon mustard .
As in , mustard from Dijon , France , since we ’re being literal .
The word “ Dijon ” is tossed around a little too - easily these days , and they may as well write “ Dijon - style ” on the label to be clear .
Easily available in France are aforementioned brands like Maille and Amora .
When I moved here I bought a jar of Amora at the supermarket and was on the bus home , a woman looked in my bag and said , “ Ooooh .
That mustard is very , very good , monsieur ! ”
Needless to say , I was as proud as a peacock that I impressed one of the locals after that .
Then she elbowed me aside and got off the bus .
Here , you were thinking , “ I thought we were making the salad dressing according to Romain ? ”
Well , we are .
But since I ’m trying to become French , I trying to do better at offering up my opinions , as well as ignoring some of the rules .
I ’ll stop harping about the mustard , but if you come to France , you can usually find it at Monoprix stores , as well as La Grande Épicerie and G. Detou , in Paris .
And it ’s not expensive .
Although the big jar of Amora mustard I bought was inexpensive and once empty , was intended to be a measuring cup .
And it had goofy , wildly - colored vegetables printed all over it .
So Romain adds in the mustard , and mixes it until smooth .
Alors , then it ’s time to add the olive oil .
Another ‘ secret ’ of salad dressings , in France and elsewhere , is that some sneaky people do n’t use olive oil .
Or they mix olive oil with a neutral - tasting oil .
The first time I saw someone sneak safflower or colza oil into their dressing here , I freaked and wanted to run over and tell her to stop .
I ’d never made a vinaigrette with anything but olive oil , but as a Parisienne cook told me recently , “ It was n’t until about ten years ago that I ever used olive oil .
It was always butter butter butter in our cooking . ”
But olive oil has flooded Paris and has even become trendy .
What is this world coming to ?
Although he ’s far from trendy , Romain uses olive oil , which his sister brings back from Spain for him .
Then in goes the olive oil , mixing it with a wooden spoon .
And next comes the most important step : la dégustation .
Because I ’ve trained Romain in the hyper - hygienic ways of les Americains , of course , he used a different spoon after each tasting .
Really he does .
One thing that we do disagree on is drying the lettuce .
I use an Oxo salad spinner , which I think does the best job .
But if course , Romain would n’t be French if he agreed with me — even when he knows I ’m right , so he prefers to give his greens a spin en plein air .
Still , for us apartment dwellers , I recommend a salad spinner , unless you like cleaning vegetable washing water off the ceiling .
The word “ foodie ” does n’t exist in French .
We ’ve tried thinking up a translation and all we could come up with was gastronome , which is n’t quite right .
And I ’ve been accused of being a foodie ( which I do n’t think I am ) , but I do admit to watching someone drain and toss lettuce for a salad and wanting to ask them if they ever considered drying the lettuce so the dressing would cling to it instead of sliding off ?
So I do n’t care how you dry your lettuce , whether you use one of those newfangled salad spinners , or go traditionelle and use some gras de coude .
Get that water off it .
Once dry , are you ready to go ?
Pas du tout !
At this point , you can add some chopped fines herbes .
Chives , chervil , and flat - leaf parsley are all good .
To take it in a different direction , you can use tarragon , but with restraint as it ’s quite strong .
When it ’s all done , mix the vinaigrette into the salad so the leaves are well - coated .
And then , à table everyone .
Eh , voilà , a true French vinaigrette , by a true Frenchman .
French Vinaigrette Print Recipe Makes about 1/4 cup ( 60 ml ) , enough for one large green salad Aside from not using balsamic vinegar in salad dressings , another astuce is to use freshly - ground black pepper , which is best added when tossing the salad with the dressing .
1/8 teaspoon flaky sea or kosher salt 1 tablespoon sherry or red wine vinegar 1/ 2 small shallot , peeled and minced ( about 1 tablespoon ) 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 3 to 4 tablespoons ( 45 ml to 60 ml ) olive oil fresh herbs , if desired 1 .
In a small bowl , mix together the salt , vinegar , and shallot .
Let stand for about ten minutes .
2 . Mix in the Dijon mustard , then add 3 tablespoons ( 45 ml ) of olive oil .
Stir well , then taste .
If too sharp , add the additional olive oil and more salt , if necessary .
Romain said one needs to add beaucoup de mustard , so feel free to add more as well .
If you wish to add fresh herbs , it ’s best to chop and mix them in shortly before serving so they retain their flavor .
Storage :
This dressing will keep for about eight hours at room temperature .
If you want to make it farther in advance , it ’s best to add the shallots closer to serving so they do n’t lose their verve .

* Foreign element remains but is small
* Fighters and explosives from Syria
BAGHDAD , Nov 18 ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda in Iraq is becoming more Iraqi and less dominated by foreigners as the insurgent group increasingly joins forces with Saddam Hussein 's outlawed Baath party , the commander of U.S. forces said on Wednesday .
Investigations into massive suicide bombings in Baghdad on Oct. 25 , in which more than 150 people died , indicated that explosives or fighters were coming across from Syria , U.S. General Ray Odierno also said .
The U.S. commander 's comments reinforced accusations by the government of Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki that al Qaeda and former Baathists were working together to undermine improved security and elections expected to be held in January .
Maliki 's government has also accused neighbouring Syria of giving a safe haven to Baathists plotting attacks in Iraq .
" Al Qaeda in Iraq has transformed significantly in the last two years .
What once was dominated by foreign individuals has now become more and more dominated by Iraqi citizens , " Odierno told reporters at the U.S. military 's main base in Baghdad .
" There 's still a small foreign element to al Qaeda , there are some who used to be Sunni rejectionists or ex-Baathists who are involved in this because of course they do n't want the government to succeed . "
Overall violence in Iraq has fallen sharply in the past 18 months and November so far has experienced one of the lowest civilian casualty levels since the 2003 U.S. invasion .
But attacks by suspected Sunni Islamist insurgents like al Qaeda remain common .
The twin suicide bombings in Baghdad on Oct. 25 devastated the Justice Ministry and the Baghdad governorate headquarters , while two similar suicide bombings on Aug. 19 killed almost 100 people at the foreign and finance ministries .
" We believe that there will be attempts to conduct more attacks between now and the elections because they want to destabilise those , " Odierno said .
The election is expected to occur between Jan. 18 - 23 but the date has been cast into doubt after Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi vetoed a law needed for the ballot to take place .
Odierno said multiple investigations had been launched into the Oct. 25 bombings , involving U.S. and Iraqi investigators .
" My experience is there probably was some movement of fighters or explosives coming from Syria , " he said when asked if the investigations had indicated any links to Syria .

( CNN ) -- President Obama 's four - day visit to China was aimed at building deeper ties -- and also spending time , albeit briefly , on family relationships .
In between his arrival in Beijing , China , on Monday and his informal dinner with Chinese President Hu Jintao a few hours later , President Obama met with his half - brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo .
" We just had a big hug .
...
It was very , very powerful and very , very intense , because he's my big brother , " Mark Obama said .
Mark Obama , who has spent the past seven years living in southern China , recently wrote a semi-autobiographical book titled " Nairobi To Shenzhen . "
In it , he claims that he was often physically abused by his father , Barack Obama Sr .
" What I wanted to do is write about my father , " he said .
" My father beat me .
He beat my mother . "
Mark Obama went on to say that oftentimes , he heard thuds coming from the living room and would " hear my mother 's screams and my father shouting . "
" I wanted to protect her ... but I could n't do anything . "
When asked whether the president shared experiences with their father , Mark Obama -- a pianist in China -- simply said that " we talked about family . "
In an interview with CNN , President Obama said that although he has not read his half - brother 's book , " it 's no secret that my father was a troubled person . "
Just like the president , Mark Obama was the child of a mixed marriage .
Although he never knew his half - brother while growing up , the two have met from time to time as adults .
" There is always that personal connection .
I honestly do n't see him as the president of the United States when I am next to him , " Mark Obama said .
As to how the two stay in touch , Mark Obama said that " I would rather not go into that for various reasons , but we know how to get in contact with each other if we have to . "

Christmas in Hollywood continues as we draw even closer to the big day .
Right now I ’m taking a look at a really cool figure , this is an exclusive Holiday version of Ash from Palisades Toys Army of Darkness line .
They made this figure a few years ago as an exclusive just for friends and retailers of Palisades Toys .
Packaging :
As an extremely limited exclusive , this item more or less came boxed in the package it was shipped in .
It ’s a quaint little package with some holiday theme to it .
It ’s supposed to be like an actual mailed package and it achieves that effect quite well .
The back has a little amusing holiday message about this figure and why you would have received it .
Inside is a simple shell with the figure and his hat .
He ’s got two twist ties on him that are super tight and have to be clipped .
I could n’t undo either one of them .
Articulation :
Although Palisades did n’t do a ton in the 3 3/ 4 market , they really redefined the articulation in the scale .
A ball jointed head , ball elbows , elbow swivel , double hinge elbows , wrist swivel , waist swivel , thigh swivel , swivel hinge thighs , double jointed knees just about makes this guy super articulated .
The articulation on these figures do seem to get loose over time , but there is plenty here to do with .
Perhaps too much honestly .
Especially because the articulation is n’t the best engineered , but you have to give them credit for adding a lot of play value .
Sculpt :
In retrospect a lot of people love the Army of Darkness line .
It was revolutionary for it ’s time , the sculpts were great and in hindsight the prices were n’t as bad as people made them out to be .
Of course back then you could get an 8 inch figure for the same price , so people were skeptical .
The one area where time has not been so nice is that the sculpt for Ash ’s head really is n’t very good .
Certainly it ’s not terrible , but it looks more like an animated caricature than actually a small scale Bruce Campbell .
Later on they would make two other Ash figures that looked a little better , but both were blind boxed in the second series with one being packed like 1 in 100 …
Which killed this line quicker than a boomstick .
The likeness here is the same as it was on the regular Ash figure , which is n’t very good .
Still if you can deal with the not so great head sculpt , he ’s otherwise pretty flawless .
He ’s decked out in green and red for the holidays , although the red pants are almost a brown color .
The paint work is n’t sloppy , it ’s actually pretty clean throughout and since this Ash has n’t been fighting deadites , he ’s got none of the dirty or blood wash that the others had .
He even has some extra paint on his shoes for metal studs .
However , the paint on the body is clumped and some of the joints are practically glued together with paint .
So when moving him the first few times be very careful in breaking the “ seals ” of paint .
Accessories :
The regular figures in this line came with a ton of accessories and really good ones too .
Sadly since this was a free gift , it comes with only his Santa hat and his shotgun holster .
No shotgun though ?
What ’s Christmas without a boomstick or two ?!
Although the hat is pretty cool and definitely small scale , it ’s still a little too big for him to wear without looking silly .
Value :
I believe these were originally free and that ’s my favorite price , but if you can track this guy down on Ebay you ’ll pay quite a bit more than free .

The Swedish entrepeneurs were turned down by N Korea 's biggest textile firm
North Korea is to make its debut in Western fashion by selling denim jeans in Sweden .
The first pairs of the jeans go on sale in a trendy department store in Stockholm on Friday - with a designer price tag .
The jeans , marketed under the Noko label , will cost 1,500 Swedish kronor ( $ 220 ; £ 132 ) a pair .
But the jeans will only be available in black - because the North Koreans associate blue denim with the US .
Noko Jeans ' founders - three advertising executives in their 20s - say the idea of their project is to increase contact with the isolated communist country .
One of the three , Jakob Ohlsson , explained : " It 's a country that sometimes treats its citizens terribly , but we think our project is a way ... to influence things . "
Blue jean taboo
The first of 1,100 individually numbered pairs of Noko jeans will initially be sold in Stockholm 's PUB store and on the internet .
The three entrepreneurs first contacted North Korean officials by email in 2007 , but the project ran into a number of difficulties .
North Korea 's biggest garment company turned the idea down , but eventually they struck a deal with the state 's largest mining group , Trade 4 , which runs a textile operation on its site .
Mr Ohlsson explained black denim was chosen because North Koreans " usually associate blue jeans with America .
That 's why it's a little taboo " .
But the high ticket price for the jeans is not simply aimed at finding an exclusive niche in the market .
Mr Ohlsson admitted : " The reason they are so expensive is that we did n't have any experience in fashion , trading , or anything like that . "
His doctor , the prominent brain surgeon William Beecher Scoville , suctioned out two slug - sized slivers of tissue , one from each side of the brain .
The operation controlled the seizures , but it soon became clear that the patient could not form new memories .
“ He loved to converse , for example , but within 15 minutes he would tell you the same story three times , with same words and intonation , without remembering that he ’d just told it , ” said Suzanne Corkin , a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied and followed Mr. Molaison in the last five decades of his life .
Each time he met a new acquaintance , each time he visited the corner store , each time he strolled around the block , it was as if for the first time .
Before H.M. , scientists thought that memory was widely distributed throughout the brain , not dependent on any one area .
But by testing Mr. Molaison , researchers in Montreal and Hartford soon established that the areas that were removed — in the medial temporal lobe , about an inch deep in the brain level with the ear — are critical to forming new memories .
One organ , the hippocampus , is especially crucial and is now the object of intense study .
In a series of studies , Mr. Molaison soon altered forever the understanding of learning by demonstrating that a part of his memory was fully intact .
A 1962 paper by Dr. Brenda Milner of the Montreal Neurological Institute described a landmark study in which she had Mr. Molaison try to trace a line between two five - point stars , one inside the other .
Each time he tried the experiment , it seemed to him an entirely new experience .
Yet he gradually became more proficient — showing that there are at least two systems in the brain for memory , one for events and facts and another for implicit or motor learning , for things like playing a guitar or riding a bicycle .
In the new brain - mapping project here , set to catalog many donated brains , scientists will have the ability to study areas of Mr. Molaison ’s brain at a level of detail that imaging cannot reveal , to solve lingering mysteries about the man and the brain .

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao talks at a session of the 4th Ministerial Conference of the Sino - African Forum in Egypt at in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El - Sheikh November 7 , 2009 .

SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt ( Reuters ) - China hopes that the United States will keep its deficit to an appropriate size to ensure basic stability in the U.S. dollar exchange rate , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on Sunday .
“ We have seen some signs of recovery in the U.S. economy ... I hope that as the largest economy in the world and an issuing country of a major reserve currency , the United States will effectively discharge its responsibilities , ” Wen told a news conference in Egypt .
“ Most importantly , we hope the United States will keep an appropriate size to its deficit so that there will be basic stability in the exchange rate , and that is conducive to stability and the recovery of the global economy , ” he added .
The premier had expressed concern in March that massive U.S. deficit spending and near - zero interest rates would erode the value of China ’s huge U.S. bond holdings .
China is the biggest holder of U.S. government debt and has invested an estimated 70 percent of its more than $ 2 trillion stockpile of foreign exchange reserves , the world ’s largest , in dollar assets .
“ I follow very closely Chinese holdings of U.S. assets because that constitutes a very important part of our national wealth .
Our consistent principle when it comes to foreign exchange reserves is to ensure the safety , liquidity and good value of the reserves , ” Wen said .
Humans are , by nature , tribal and never more so than in politics .
In the culture wars we all know the tribal stereotypes of what liberals think of con­servatives : Conservatives are a bunch of Hum­mer - driving , meat - eating , gun-toting , hard - drinking , Bible - thumping , black - and - white - thinking , fist - pounding , shoe - stomping , morally hypocritical blowhards .
And what conservatives think of liberals : Liberals are a bunch of hybrid - driving , tofu-eating , tree - hugging , whale - saving , sandal - wearing , bottled - water - drinking , ACLU - supporting , flip - flopping , wishy - washy , namby - pamby bed wetters .
Like many other stereotypes , each of these contains an element of truth that reflects an emphasis on different moral values .
Jonathan Haidt , who is a psychologist at the University of Virginia , explains such stereotypes in terms of his Moral Foundations Theory ( see www.moralfoundations.org), which he developed “ to understand why morality varies so much across cultures yet still shows so many similarities and recurrent themes . ”
Haidt proposes that the foundations of our sense of right and wrong rest within “ five innate and universally available psychological systems ” that might be summarized as follows :
Harm / care : Evolved mammalian attachment systems mean we can feel the pain of others , giving rise to the virtues of kindness , gentleness and nurturance .
Fairness / reciprocity : Evolved reciprocal altruism generates a sense of justice .
Ingroup / loyalty : Evolved in - group tribalism leads to patriotism .
Authority / respect : Evolved hierarchical social structures translate to respect for authority and tradition .
Purity / sanctity : Evolved emotion of disgust related to disease and contamination underlies our sense of bodily purity .
Over the years Haidt and his University of Virginia colleague Jesse Graham have surveyed the moral opinions of more than 110,000 people from dozens of countries and have found this consistent difference : self - reported liberals are high on 1 and 2 ( harm / care and fairness / reciprocity ) but are low on 3 , 4 and 5 ( ingroup / loyalty , authority / respect and purity / sanctity ) , whereas self - reported conservatives are roughly equal on all five dimensions , although they place slightly less emphasis on 1 and 2 than liberals do .
( Take the survey yourself at www.yourmorals.org.)
Instead of viewing the left and the right as either inherently correct or wrong , a more scientific approach is to recognize that liberals and conservatives emphasize different moral values .
My favorite example of these differences is dramatized in the 1992 film A Few Good Men .
In the court­room ending , Jack Nicholson ’s conservative marine Colonel Nathan R. Jessup is being cross-examined by Tom Cruise ’s liberal navy Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee , who is defending two marines accused of accidentally killing a fellow soldier .
Kaffee thinks that Jessup ordered a “ code red , ” an off - the - books command to rough up a disloyal marine trainee in need of discipline and that matters got tragically out of hand .
Kaffee wants individual justice for his clients .
Jessup wants freedom and security for the nation even at the cost of individual liberty , as he explains :
“ Son , we live in a world that has walls .
And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns ....
You do n’t want the truth because deep down , in places you do n’t talk about at parties , you want me on that wall .
You need me on that wall .
We use words like honor , code , loyalty .
We use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something .
You use ’em as a punch line .
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide , then questions the manner in which I provide it . ”
Personally , I tend more toward the liberal emphasis on individual fairness , justice and liberty , and I worry that overemphasis on group loyalty will trigger our inner xenophobias .
But evolutionary psychology reveals just how deep our tribal instincts are and why good fences make good neighbors .
And I know that ever since 9/11 , I am especially grateful to all the brave soldiers on those walls who have allowed us to sleep under a blanket of freedom .

With India disappointed with Obama , the president has vowed to " work even closer " with its prime minister .
Tunku Varadarajan on the cost of ignoring our allies .
On Tuesday evening , the world ’s most consequential turbaned man , Manmohan Singh , will glide through White House security and take his place at a dinner table beside Barack and Michelle Obama .
He is the prime minister of India , a country that could , if Mr. Obama shoots his diplomatic hoops right , come to be a preeminent American ally in the 21st century , taking its place alongside Britain , Israel , and , assuming the bolshie Yukio Hatoyama does n’t live forever , Japan .
It does n’t take a genius to recognize the political , strategic , and moral worth to America , the world ’s most powerful democracy , of a strong alliance with India , the world ’s largest .
Mr. Obama , by no stretch a man of tepid intelligence , has calibrated things artfully :
Not only is Mr. Singh the first state visitor to Washington since the president took office in January , his trip is the first time that India has headed an American president ’s list for a state visit — ever .
( Richard Nixon must be turning in his grave . )
For all his emphasis on diplomacy in dealing with hostile states , Mr. Obama has failed to grasp the diplomatic importance of tending to alliances .
And yet , until this moment , Mr. Obama has been indifferent to India .
No doubt his mind has been focused on other matters : the American economy , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Iranian and North Korean nuclear shenanigans — not to mention health - care reform ( although one must ask what prompted him to add that burden to an already heaving haversack of misfortune ) .
What has been left of Mr. Obama ’s attention has been consumed by China , itself inseparable in so many ways from any resolution of America ’s economic crisis .
( Treasury Secretary Geithner has done more hard yards on China than Secretary of State Clinton . )
Given all this swirl , Mr. Obama has had scant inclination to pay much attention to , let alone court , Delhi .
This has not gone down well in India , a country surrounded by a wall of thin skin .
India had grown used , under Mr. Obama ’s predecessor , to alpha - dog treatment .
George W. Bush was the best American president India ever had , and Mr. Obama ’s ability to take India for granted is , in some measure , a tribute to the extent to which Mr. Bush locked the two countries into a presumptively inseparable alliance .
But for all his emphasis on diplomacy in dealing with hostile states , like Iran , or inveterate competitor - states , like China , Mr. Obama has failed to grasp the diplomatic importance of tending to alliances , whether they be old and true ones , such as the one with Israel , or young and sensitive ones , such as the one with India .
India is not the India of Eisenhower ’s time , or Nixon ’s , or Carter ’s , or Reagan’s .
Sometime in the early 1990s , India finally acquired a “ foreign policy ” to replace the vexatious , preachy “ postcolonial policy ” that had previously guided its international relations .
Equally , the United States , under Bush , finally acquired an “ India policy , ” as opposed to a “ Pakistan policy ” of which India was a mere byproduct .
In fact , under Mr. Bush , improved relations between the two democracies came to acquire an almost moral imperative , one than can — and must — survive the short - term reliance on Pakistan in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan .
In any case , this is a war in which the U.S. has not , so far , been able to count on worthwhile Pakistani support .
True , that country has taken pains to maintain the appearance of an ally ; but every passing day brings new strains , and new cynicism .
Pakistan is “ in ” so that it can use the war to its advantage in its messianic conflict with India .
Besides , its overriding aim is to re-establish a Taliban regime in Kabul :
How much plainer does its dissonance with American aims in Afghanistan have to be before Mr. Obama works out that his country ’s long - term interests in the region lie with New Delhi , not Islamabad ?
Finally , a broader word about India and its relationship with America : Unlike China , which is inherently competitive for global leadership — and which will never accept American leadership or direction —
India is a country that would , like Britain or Japan or Germany , settle for a partnership with the United States that guaranteed mutual benefit and respect .
India ’s natural state , if nations can be said to have such a thing , is neither triumphalist nor antagonist ; it is cooperative and redemptive , much as America ’s tends to be .
One trusts that Mr. Obama will come to see these qualities as clearly as his predecessor did .
If not , this could be one area in which history will judge Mr. Obama to have been “ dumb , ” and Mr. Bush to have been the “ smart ” one .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
With trillions of dollars at stake in the battle over global warming , now would be the time for the press to closely scrutinize the claims of those who would reorganize the world ’s economy from farm to factory and laboratory to living room .
And the Climategate scandal - where leaked e-mails and dodgy computer programs from the University of East Anglia raise powerful new questions about the role of politics in climate science - would be the perfect opportunity to explore what is going on behind the scenes .
That ’s not happening .
To judge by recent coverage from Associated Press , the Fourth Estate watchdog has acted like a third - rate pocket pet .
Case in point is an 1,800 - word AP missive that appeared in hundreds of publications , many carrying it on the front page of their Sunday , Dec. 13 issue with the headline , “ Science not faked , but not pretty . ”
AP gave three scientists copies of the controversial e-mails and then asked them about their conclusions .
The wire service portrayed the trio of scientists as dismissing or minimizing allegations of scientific fraud when , in fact , the scientists believe no such thing .
The first scientist quoted in the article , Mark Frankel , is director of scientific freedom , responsibility and law at the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
AP quotes him as concluding that there is , “ no evidence of falsification or fabrication of data , although concerns could be raised about some instances of very ‘ generous interpretations . ’”
While the article mentions that former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and some Republican lawmakers are calling for independent investigations , AP does n’t note the views of the scientists they interviewed .
When The Washington Times talked to Mr. Frankel , the scientist gave a quite different impression .
The e-mails , he said , are not sufficient to reach any judgment at all on whether the data or science was faked or misleading .
“ You ca n’t do that on the e-mails alone , you ca n’t do it on the e-mails or the program , ” he concluded .
For that reason , Mr. Frankel supports investigation of East Anglia and related allegations of fraud at Pennsylvania State University .
There ’s a big difference between saying that there is n’t sufficient evidence to determine if falsification of data occurred - and that there should be an investigation - and saying , as AP did : “ Science not faked . ”
Mr. Frankel also believes outsiders to the two schools should be asked to take part .
“ You should be willing and open to going to outside people to be part of your inquiry , ” he advised .
“ If I were Penn State , I would certainly be advising them to be very open to the possibility of bringing in one or two people who have impeccable credentials , well - respected , to join in …. ”
Arizona State University professor Dan Sarewitz is quoted by AP as saying , “ This is normal science politics , but on the extreme end , though still within bounds . ”
However , Mr. Sarewitz was n’t speaking about the validity of the climate science ; he was discussing his belief that politics infects how most scientific research is conducted .
While AP used the quote to suggest that there was nothing terribly wrong that had been revealed in Climategate , Mr. Sarewitz was trying to issue a warning that politics infects too much science and that reporters , politicians and the public are naive about that reality .
As he told The Washington Times , “ When the human underside ( of science ) gets revealed , then suddenly people are disillusioned and they say , ‘ Oh , how shocking ! ’
But it ’s not particularly shocking . ”
Indeed , Mr. Sarewitz suggests that reporters ask scientists about their political views .
( For the record , he is a liberal Democrat . )
He also is skeptical of the university investigations , particularly if they do n’t include outsiders .
“ I think they should have external people [ involved in the investigations ] .
Certainly . …
The challenge here might be , can you find people who are independent but also understand the science well enough to really tell ( if there was wrongdoing ) ? ”
The third scientist interviewed by AP , professor Gerald North at Texas A&M University , joined Mr. Frankel and Mr. Sarewitz in hoping that climate data would be more readily shared in the future .
He told us he also thinks it is important that investigations proceed at the two universities .
The Washington Times tried to raise these issues with the reporters and editors involved , but Jack Stokes , AP ’s manager of media relations , said that none of the five reporters who worked on the article nor their editors had time to answer questions .
If AP refuses to explain how it could have given readers across the planet such a distorted view of Climategate , maybe an explanation can be found buried in the article itself .
One of the reporters , Seth Borenstein , the AP science reporter who writes on global warming and who is the lead author on the piece , is part of the Climategate story himself .
In the last sentence of the article , the authors note that the archive of disputed Climategate e-mails “ includes a request from an AP reporter , one of the writers of this story , for reaction to a study , a standard step for journalists seeking quotes for their stories . ”
But Mr. Borenstein ’s e-mail was hardly standard and far from neutral .
In it , the reporter disparages Marc Morano , a critic of man-made global - warming claims , as “ hyping wildly ” the study that Mr. Borenstein asked scientists to comment on .
The e-mail almost makes it appear as if Mr. Borenstein were asking those involved in Climategate to help him discredit critics of man-made global warming .
East Anglia and Penn State are not the only two institutions that need to answer questions about what is going on behind the scenes .

David Cameron has said " never again " to powers being transferred from the UK to Brussels without a referendum .
He said all future treaties would be put to a public vote as he outlined his new European policy after ruling out a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
He also promised a sovereignty bill if the Tories win the next election to " lock in " the supremacy of UK laws .
And the Tory leader vowed to repatriate powers on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , employment and criminal law .
Mr Cameron unveiled the new set of policies after abandoning a pledge to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty , which is now to come into force on 1 December .
Concoct pretext
He has been accused of backtracking on a " cast iron " pledge to hold a referendum if he becomes prime minister , but he said : " I did not promise a referendum come what may , because once the Lisbon Treaty becomes law there is nothing people can do about it . "
We will give the British people a referendum lock to which only they should hold the key
David Cameron , Conservative Party leader
Cameron denies Tory EU ' turmoil ' Q&A : The Lisbon Treaty
He added : " I recognise there are some who , now that we cannot have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty , want a referendum on something else ... anything else .
" But I just do n't think it 's right to concoct some new pretext for a referendum simply to have one for the sake of it . "
But a Conservative government would amend the European Communities Act 1972 to prohibit the transfer of power to the EU without a referendum .
That would cover any future attempt to take Britain into the European single currency , said Mr Cameron .
" We will give the British people a referendum lock to which only they should hold the key , a commitment very similar to that which exists in Ireland , " he added .
' Massive Euro bust - up '
Such a move , together with the repatriation of some powers , was " credible , doable and deliverable " and would prevent the " drift " towards a federal Europe , he argued .
Mr Cameron said the phrase " never again " would feature in the party 's general election campaign and manifesto .
British people now know what to expect when they hear a cast - iron guarantee from David Cameron on Europe : nothing
David Miliband , foreign secretary
Send us your comments
The sovereignty bill would act in place of a written constitution , which Britain does not have , to prevent the " drift " of EU powers into new areas and ensure the " final word on our laws is here in Britain " , explained Mr Cameron .
He said he would need the agreement of all 27 EU nations to get powers back on employment law , including the working time directive , the Charter of Fundamental Rights and criminal justice .
Status quo
But he reassured other EU nations that he was not seeking a " massive Euro bust - up " , stressing the situation was " complex " and would take the lifetime of a Parliament to solve .
Mr Cameron is seeking to head off a civil war in his party over Europe - and shadow foreign secretary William Hague said the proposals received " very strong support " when they were put to Tory MPs earlier .
But some Tory MPs are likely to continue demanding the public have a say on Europe .
Backbencher Douglas Carswell told the BBC News Channel : " I think we need a referendum on our relationship with Europe . "
It is madness to re-open long and drawn out discussions which would inevitably result in a bust - up with Europe
Ed Davey , Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman
And he criticised Mr Cameron 's proposals to ensure British law had primacy over EU law : " I fear that a sovereignty bill may merely institutionalise the status quo .
It 's the status quo that I 've got a problem with . "
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : " British people now know what to expect when they hear a cast - iron guarantee from David Cameron on Europe : nothing .
" This is not about taking back powers from Europe ; it is about transferring power to the Eurosceptics on his backbenches . "
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey , whose party campaigns for an " in or out " referendum from a pro-EU standpoint , said : " Cameron 's confused middle way will satisfy no one .
" It combines pointless gimmicks with dangerous proposals which would mire Britain in an endless round of negotiations . "
Nigel Farage , leader of the UK Independence Party , which campaigns for Britain 's exit from the EU , accused Mr Cameron of attempting to deceive the public on Europe .
" The true state of affairs is that we are signed up to a higher , European legal order .
Renegotiation is not credible or doable .
This is all too little too late , " he said .
The Guardian newspaper reports France 's Europe minister , Pierre Lellouche , as calling the Conservatives ' EU plans " pathetic " .
There is a danger that the UK could be " castrated " in Europe , he adds .

The Shiva God Helmet is the same technology used in the God Helmet Experiments , which produced visions of God in some subjects in a neuroscience lab .
Other subjects had a range of altered - state experiences , including religious bliss and out - of - body experiences .
The God Helmet ® , part of the Shiva Neural Stimulation System .
The God Helmet is a cutting - edge mind technology made famous by Dr. Michael A. Persinger , and seen on many television documentaries .
It has elicited a wide range of spiritual experiences , visions , out - of - body experiences , and even visions of God .
There are many online videos showing it in use .
The “ Shiva ” God Helmet ® is fully endorsed
The God Helmet uses magnetic signals to gently stimulate the brain , eliciting spiritual sensations , moods , and experiences .
The phrase God Helmet was invented by a journalist who wanted to make their article about the work of Dr. Michael A. Persinger more interesting by giving the Koren Helmet ( built by Stan Koren ) a more impressive name .
Although a small percentage of Persinger & Koren ’s subjects did have meetings with God ( more info ) , most of the sessions created other experiences .
These included out - of - body experiences , visions of an infinite ‘ Void ’ , patterns of light , paranormal episodes , and a range of other experiences and sensations .
Although the name God Helmet is n’t really accurate , it ’s the only name many people have heard for this kind of apparatus .
These pages will try to explain as much as possible about this technology , which is replicated in the Shiva Neural Stimulation System .
The Koren Helmet is the most important research tool in the science of understanding spirituality , especially the brain ’s role
in religious , mystic and spiritual experiences .
Religious and spiritual beliefs are another matter , of course .
This is the first time this type of device has been available to the public , as part of the Shiva Neural System .
The God Helmet setup for the Shiva Neural Stimulation System uses four USB sound devices ( included with the system ) to create eight independent stereo channels .
Magnetic fields cycle between four coils on one or both sides of your head .
These fields change strength every few milliseconds , so they ’re also magnetic signals .
You could also think of The God Helmet as conveying information to the brain using a magnetic carrier .
The name God Helmet comes from the fact that a small group ( less than two percent ) of Persinger ’s subjects had meetings with God during Koren Helmet sessions .
This is far too small a percentage to justify the name , but the phenomena is so striking that the name seemed right to some journalists and writers .
The name stuck .
The God Helmet experiments were first developed to test a theory of how the brain creates religious and mystic experiences .
Click HERE for a page with a short overview of that theory .
The Shiva God Helmet used at the God Helmet lab .
The God Helmet feeds information into the brain using fluctuating magnetic fields , and the fields move in two ways .
One of them is quick ( several times each second ) , and the other is very slow ( 20 to 30 minutes ) .
The fast motion is the rotation of the fields , cycling between four coils over the temporal lobes .
The exact place where the field is applied changes constantly .
Moving the location of the stimulation from one place to another makes it hard for the brain to “ get used to ” the signal or to “ tune it out ” .
The stimulation moves in a circle .
As one place responds , the surrounding ones become quieter , like peaks and valleys in a wave on water .
The slower movement in the two - phases of the standard God Helmet sessions .
Each lasts 20 to 30 minutes , making the whole sessions forty to sixty minutes .
These “ session designs ” are based on the most effective ones used in the original laboratory experiments .
The first phase uses one signal over one area , and the second phase applies a different signal over another area .
One signal gets positive responses from one side of the brain , and another signal gets positive effects from the other side of the brain .
The first phase slowly builds up activity in one area of the brain , and the second phase shunts it into another ( focusing on brain parts known to support spiritual experiences ) , so that the 2nd area suddenly bursts into activity .
The result is a spiritual response that would ordinarily be hard to achieve .
Each brain is different , and these differences mean the exact effects of each session are n’t the same for everyone .
Spirituality means different things to different people .
It ’s not “ one size fits all ” .
There are several sessions in the God Helmet software using various signals , and focusing on one side of the brain or the other , so you can find the one that works best for you .
Free tech support and advice is available , too .
This animation shows how God Helmet sessions use two different signals to create its effects .
In fact , all God Helmet sessions in the software use two signals , one after the other .
The signals circle around the brain ’s temporal lobes .
Each cycle takes a fraction of a second .
This animation shows only the most effective one , the one that created the most dramatic effects in Persinger ’s lab , and as seen on several TV documentaries .

This is the most powerful mind technology in the Shakti family of Neural Technologies , and there are possible side effects for each session design , but only for people who have psychiatric problems , or who choose to use it unsafely .
These are very uncommon , but are still described in the software on the pages for each , along with ways to stop them if they appear .
The God Helmet is a safe technology , but there are some safety guidelines , which you can see HERE .
The Earth ’s magnetic field can help make your sessions more effective .

Shiva God Helmet review comments and testimonials :
( Individual Results may vary * )
“ I have a Shiva Neural Stimulation system and I ’m very happy with it .
After the first try ( I used one of the God Helmet sessions ) I was a little uncomfortable , but I also felt much happier and I felt a kind of flow ( energy flow ? ) inside my body .
This continued for a few days before its intensity started to fade .
The next time I tried , I did n’t have the uncomfortable feeling , but one of happiness and I would say a different look at things and the world .
Over the next months I used several other sessions and found that their effects differed from one another .
Some of them were more effective for me than others .
The best feeling it gave me so far is the flow of happiness I mentioned before .
It makes me more energetic , and I even started enjoying some tasks at work I had once hated .
I also found that it improved communication with other people and made it also more enjoyable and productive .
I ’ve only gone through 20 - 30 % of the sessions so far and I ’m very excited about the many more positive surprises I ’ll get from the system . ” *
( Using a session called Modulated 40 hertz ‘ chirp ’ signal over both sides followed by amygdala over the left . )
_____________
I have the Shiva God Helmet and have used it about 6 times now .
I was interested in it for the right hippocampus stimulation and left amygdala stimulation .
I have been ‘ vibrating ’ while awake .
Having more visions and ‘ seeing ’ peoples auras .
My … ( friend ) … has used it and has now seen someone ’s aura .
People are starting to tell him very private things after only meeting him for a few minutes .
… ( I ’m ) still ‘ playing ’ with it .
I ’m keeping a journal of my experiences .
So far I ’m happy I got it . ” *

“ I was using ( … ) a ” god helmet ” to see if it would boost my OBE experience , it did .
I experienced total knowledge and connection to everything .
I experienced a level of joy that cannot be explained with words .
I was a globe of white light among an infinite number of other white lights .
I floated as close as possible to get near the great light , it was massive , pervading everything except the space we were in . ” * ( source )

The Shiva God Helmet was used in filming an episode of the television program Paranormal Lockdown .
“ … one of the highlights of the new season was the use of the God Helmet , originally called the Koren Helmet , which was created to study things like creativity and religious experience .
Nick ( who used the God Helmet ) said their sessions with the helmet produced “ incredible results ” , adding : “ It was truly an uplifting experience .
It really helped me rise above the negativity of this extremely haunted location . ” * ( source )

“ … this morning I did a God Helmet session .
This was a pretty intense experience .
Think binaural beats or perhaps CES at a delta or theta state , but much stronger .
Very pleasant overall experience with lots of very strong and colorful hypnagogic flashes .
There was a peacefulness about it .
The experience felt very warm and very safe .
It ’s hard to describe .
Now I am no stranger to altered states , so my perception of pleasant might be another ’s “ weird ” or “ just too intense ” .
I can see why people report a presence or in some cases a sense of God .
I would describe that element of the experience more like the feeling one has on psychedelics , that feeling of oneness or interconnection .
I would describe it that way . ” * ( source )

“ I seem to get good visuals with the chirp signal on the right hemisphere .
Using the first half of the original Koren helmet session , the chirp signal does not elicit ‘ negative ’ emotions in me , but rather strong imagery ( for my standards ) and intuitions .
The amygdala signal on the left side elicits a strong feeling of well - being , affection and ‘ connectedness ’ . ” *

Myself and a handful of others have been using this device , called a “ God Helmet ” , for several months now and the subjective reporting tends to cluster and lines up with what you would expect .
…
Stimulate the hippocampus and you ’ll get into a more “ wordless ” space that feels much like a deep meditation for me .
Stimulate the amygdala and you ’ll get an improved feeling of well - being .
I ’m not a brain scientist or a researcher , just exploring on my own , but based on what I ’ve read , the effects fall in line with expectations .
The device was developed by Dr. Persinger and has been used in a number of published experiments in peer reviewed journals . …
So far my experience has been very positive and surprising in some respects .

NOTE : The “ Sensed Presence ” experience , common with this technology in Dr. M.A. Persinger ’s lab , is infrequent with the Shiva System in its God Helmet configuration .
It may have to do with the rigorous laboratory conditions for the God Helmet Experiments , compared to the way people use it at home .

Have yourself a microscopic Christmas :
The world 's smallest snowman at just 0.01 mm wide
For most children the challenge is trying to build the biggest snowman .
Scientists , however , enjoy taking on altogether trickier tasks .
They have built the world 's smallest snowman , measuring just 0.01 mm across - one fifth of the width of the average human hair .
The world 's smallest snowman is just one fifth of the width of a strand of hair and is made of two tiny tin beads
A focused ion beam was used to carve the snowman 's eyes and smile , and to deposit platinum for the nose
While the creation , once magnified in a blue light , looks like the product of a child 's imagination , it was put together using hi-tech gadgetry .
Made of two tiny tin beads usually used to calibrate electron microscope lenses , the snowman was built by the National Physical Laboratory .
It was assembled using tools designed to manipulate nano - particles , and welded together with tiny deposits of platinum .
A focused ion beam was used to carve the eyes and smile , and to place the platinum nose .
The snowman was created by Dr David Cox , a member of the Quantum Detection group at the laboratory .

The Brit donned various costumes for a commercial to promote his latest cookery series , Jamie 's American Road Trip , with his guises including a cowboy , a policeman , a sailor and a construction worker .
Oliver is seen striding through an airport dressed as the characters to the sound of the Village People 's 1979 single Go West .
Now lawyers for the band are threatening legal action against Channel 4 , accusing the broadcaster of infringing trademark rights .
The name and costumes are trademarked in the U.S. and the Village People 's attorney , John Giacobbi , claims officials at Channel 4 never approached the band to use the characters in the commercial .
A spokesperson for Channel 4 insists the accusations are unfounded , telling the Daily Telegraph newspaper , " We are confident that the promotional campaign for Jamie 's American Road Trip does not infringe any copyright / trademark rights which the Village People may have .
No parties have received a formal legal claim from the Village People and , if one is received , it will be vigorously defended . "

A former London student has been charged with attempting to blow up a transatlantic airliner carrying 278 passengers on Christmas Day .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a 23 - year - old Nigerian , was charged in hospital late last night with attempting to destroy the aircraft during its final approach to Detroit airport , the US justice department said .
American prosecutors claim that Abdulmutallab , who finished an engineering course at University College London last year , had a device attached to his body when he boarded the plane in Amsterdam on Christmas Eve .
He passed through the airport in transit after flying from Lagos .
Extra security measures have been brought in for passengers flying from British airports to the US .
Travellers can carry only one piece of hand luggage , including duty - free items , face a pat - down body search before boarding planes and will have to remain in their seats for the final hour before arrival in the US .
Air Canada said its passengers would not be allowed access to carry - on baggage or to have any items on their laps during the last hour of the flight .
British Airways advised passengers flying to the US to arrive at check - in with plenty of time to spare .
Travellers to other destinations would not be affected .
Abdulmutallab , the son of a wealthy Nigerian banker , is alleged to have set off the device as the flight approached Detroit airport .
The device caused a fire that burned Abdulmutallab 's legs .
A preliminary FBI investigation found that the device contained an explosive known as PETN , or pentaerythritol .
Agents recovered what appeared to be the remnants of a syringe found near Abdulmutallab 's seat , which is thought to have been part of the device .
" Had this alleged plot to destroy an airplane been successful , scores of innocent people would have been killed or injured , " said the US attorney general , Eric Holder .
" We will continue to investigate this matter vigorously , and we will use all measures available to our government to ensure that anyone responsible for this attempted attack is brought to justice . "
Abdulmutallab had been living in a mansion block in Mansfield Road , close to Oxford Street , London , while studying mechanical engineering between 2005 and last year .
The block was cordoned off by police today .
Abdulmutallab was barred from returning to Britain when he tried to obtain another student visa , this time using a bogus college , Whitehall sources said .
But he was not on the US no - fly list .
According to an affidavit , interviews with the passengers and crew of Northwest Airlines flight 253 revealed that before the incident Abdulmutallab went to the aircraft 's bathroom for approximately 20 minutes .
When he returned to his seat , he said he had an upset stomach and pulled a blanket over himself .
Passengers then heard what were described as popping noises similar to the sound of firecrackers .
Some reported seeing Abdulmutallab 's trouser leg and the inner wall of the aircraft on fire .
He was overpowered by passengers and crew who used blankets and fire extinguishers to put out the flames .
The charges were read to Abdulmutallab in hospital , where he appeared in a medical gown and wheelchair .
There will be a hearing on Monday at a federal court in Detroit , and bail will not be considered until a separate hearing on 8 January .
Citing US officials , the Wall Street Journal said the Nigerian told investigators that al - Qaida operatives in Yemen had given him the device and told him how to detonate it .
Nigeria's
This Day newspaper cited family members as saying that the suspect 's father , Umaru Mutallab , the retired chairman of First Bank in Nigeria , has been uncomfortable with his son's " extreme religious views " and had reported him to the US embassy and Nigerian security agencies six months ago .
The US government created a record on Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab last month in the intelligence community 's central repository of information for known and suspected international terrorists , but there was not enough negative data to place him on a no - fly list , a US official said .
Jennifer Allen , 41 , said passengers boarding the same flight in Amsterdam on Saturday were frisked and that she was asked to remove a ball of tissue from a pocket .
" It was a thorough pat - down .
It was n't a quick rub , " she said .
The Dutch counterterrorism agency , NCTb , said Abdulmutallab had boarded a KLM flight from Lagos to Amsterdam , and passed through a security checkpoint while in transit at Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport .
Gordon Brown said the British government would take " whatever action was necessary " to protect airline passengers .
Security sources said the police and MI5 were diverting extra staff and resources to the investigation as a matter of priority to establish the significance of the " London link " .
Disclaimer - the intention of this post is to create conversation , I am not trying to fabricate rumors , I am just putting a thought on paper ( or on screen ? ) .
Here 's what I 'm thinking - trade for Ray Whitney .
It 's not because we need more scoring - this incarnation of the Jackets can certainly do that .
The reason I want to bring The Wizard back to Columbus is two - fold :
1 ) He 's a veteran , and he 's won a cup .
He can be the kind of voice in the room this team could use right about now .
A guy who 's been in battles before , who can work with the young guys and bring them back to buying - in to the coaching staff .
2 ) He 's familiar with the organization , mind you there are a new coach and GM running the show now , but the fact remains he is a familiar site for Columbus fans .
He 's also played with Rusty and Nasher before as a Jacket , and won a cup with Mike Commodore .
Nash , Rusty and Commie are part of the leadership group that Hitch uses to communicate , so adding a player who already knows those three and who is a veteran himself would just add to the leadership in the room .
The Hurricanes are more than likely in sell - mode .
Nothing will happen over the Christmas break due to the roster freeze , but I think in the new year this is a move that would benefit the Jackets immensely .
Again , the issue with the Jackets is n't scoring , but it does n't hurt to have a player like Whitney in the lineup .
Last year he led the Hurricanes in scoring , he finished with 24 goals , 52 assists for 77 points .
He also played in all 82 games .
He 's an unrestricted free - agent at the end of this season , so the Jackets wo n't be on the hook for anything past this year if it does n't work out .
He 's making a reasonable 3.55 million this season , and with half of it off the books by January , the Jackets would only need to take on about 1.75 million , something I 'm willing to bet the ownership would agree to .
My guess , and I could be way off - base , is that he could be had for a second round pick and maybe a later pick .
I 'm not talking about trading Nikita Filatov or any other major piece , or the first round pick for that matter .
A second and fifth should get it done .
It would help the ' Canes by adding some picks , which are much - needed to stock their weak prospect pool .
This is n't an earth - shattering move , but it could pay off in a huge way for the Jackets .
Sometimes all it takes to turn a team 's season around is a move like this - to bring in a new voice ( or in this case , an old voice ) who can help deliver the coach 's message .
With Rusty out for a long period of time , Whitney could fill the leadership void and also contribute to the offense .
He can run a powerplay as well , taking some heat off of Brass , allowing him to simplify his game .
I 'd love to hear what folks have to think about my proposal , good move , bad move ?

The Pope was knocked down by a woman at the start of the service in St Peter 's Basilica .
The woman , who is reported to be mentally unstable , jumped the security barriers as Benedict XVI entered the basilica , causing the pontiff to fall .
The Pope appeared to be unhurt and recovered to lead the Mass .
These pictures taken by a witness show the moment the incident happened .
A month ago , 29 - year - old Maxim.com editor Justin Halpern landed a book deal for his popular Twitter feed shitmydadsays , on which he dumps the irascible , profane mutterings of his 73 - year - old father .
Now CBS has signed a deal with Halpern to develop a sitcom based on the feed , with the help of Will & Grace creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick .
The project is still in the script - development phase , which means casting , shooting a pilot , ordering a series and changing the name are still a long way off .
Still … a show based on a Twitter feed .
That 's where we are .

Why Did Human History Unfold Differently On Different Continents For The Last 13,000 Years ?
A Talk By Jared Diamond
I 've set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history , on all the continents , for the last 13,000 years .
Why did history take such different evolutionary courses for peoples of different continents ?
This problem has fascinated me for a long time , but it 's now ripe for a new synthesis because of recent advances in many fields seemingly remote from history , including molecular biology , plant and animal genetics and biogeography , archaeology , and linguistics .
As we all know , Eurasians , especially peoples of Europe and eastern Asia , have spread around the globe , to dominate the modern world in wealth and power .
Other peoples , including most Africans , survived , and have thrown off European domination but remain behind in wealth and power .
Still other peoples , including the original inhabitants of Australia , the Americas , and southern Africa , are no longer even masters of their own lands but have been decimated , subjugated , or exterminated by European colonialists .
Why did history turn out that way , instead of the opposite way ?
Why were n't Native Americans , Africans , and Aboriginal Australians the ones who conquered or exterminated Europeans and Asians ?
This big question can easily be pushed back one step further .
By the year A.D. 1500 , the approximate year when Europe 's overseas expansion was just beginning , peoples of the different continents already differed greatly in technology and political organization .
Much of Eurasia and North Africa was occupied then by Iron Age states and empires , some of them on the verge of industrialization .
Two Native American peoples , the Incas and Aztecs , ruled over empires with stone tools and were just starting to experiment with bronze .
Parts of sub-Saharan Africa were divided among small indigenous Iron Age states or chiefdoms .
But all peoples of Australia , New Guinea , and the Pacific islands , and many peoples of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa , were still living as farmers or even still as hunter / gatherers with stone tools .
Obviously , those differences as of A.D. 1500 were the immediate cause of the modern world 's inequalities .
Empires with iron tools conquered or exterminated tribes with stone tools .
But how did the world evolve to be the way that it was in the year A.D. 1500 ?
This question , too can be easily pushed back a further step , with the help of written histories and archaeological discoveries .
Until the end of the last Ice Age around 11,000 B.C. , all humans on all continents were still living as Stone Age hunter / gatherers .
Different rates of development on different continents , from 11,000 B.C. to A.D. 1500 , were what produced the inequalities of A.D. 1500 .
While Aboriginal Australians and many Native American peoples remained Stone Age hunter / gatherers , most Eurasian peoples , and many peoples of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa , gradually developed agriculture , herding , metallurgy , and complex political organization .
Parts of Eurasia , and one small area of the Americas , developed indigenous writing as well .
But each of these new developments appeared earlier in Eurasia than elsewhere .
So , we can finally rephrase our question about the evolution of the modern world 's inequalities as follows .
Why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents for the last 13,000 years ?
Those differing rates constitute the broadest pattern of history , the biggest unsolved problem of history , and my subject today .
Historians tend to avoid this subject like the plague , because of its apparently racist overtones .
Many people , or even most people , assume that the answer involves biological differences in average IQ among the world 's populations , despite the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of such IQ differences .
Even to ask the question why different peoples had different histories strikes some of us as evil , because it appears to be justifying what happened in history .
In fact , we study the injustices of history for the same reason that we study genocide , and for the same reason that psychologists study the minds of murderers and rapists : not in order to justify history , genocide , murder , and rape , but instead to understand how those evil things came about , and then to use that understanding so as to prevent their happening again .
In case the stink of racism still makes you feel uncomfortable about exploring this subject , just reflect on the underlying reason why so many people accept racist explanations of history 's broad pattern : we do n't have a convincing alternative explanation .
Until we do , people will continue to gravitate by default to racist theories .
That leaves us with a huge moral gap , which constitutes the strongest reason for tackling this uncomfortable subject .
Dr. Shu and Dr. Gneezy demonstrated another effect of this fallacy by giving people gift certificates good for movie tickets and French pastries .
Some got certificates that expired within two to three weeks ; others got certificates good for six to eight weeks .
The people who received the long - term certificates were more confident than the others that they would redeem the gifts  a logical enough assumption , given all the extra time they had .
But they just kept putting it off , and ultimately they were more likely to let the gift go unredeemed than the people who had received the short - term certificates .
Once you start procrastinating pleasure , it can become a self - perpetuating process if you fixate on some imagined nirvana .
The longer you wait to open that prize bottle of wine , the more special the occasion has to be .
If you ’re determined to get the absolute maximum out of those frequent flier miles , you can end up wasting them , as Dr. Shu found in an experiment offering people a chance to use discount coupons in the course of buying a series of plane tickets .
Once the subjects were told that they might have a chance at a free flight worth $ 1,000 , they scorned lesser awards and hung on to their coupons so long that in the end they had to use them for much cheaper flights .
“ People can become overly focused on an ideal , ” Dr. Shu said .
“ Even if they know it ’s unlikely , they get so focused on the perfect scenario that they block everything else .
Or they anticipate that they ’ll kick themselves later if they take second - best option and then see the best one is still available .
But they do n’t realize that regret can go the other way .
They ’ll end up with something worse and regret not taking the second - best one . ”
But even if you know about all this research , how can you apply these lessons ?
How can you avoid the temptation to postpone pleasure ?
( You can offer suggestions at nytimes.com/tierneylab . )
One immediate strategy , Dr. Shu said , is to cash in quickly any gift certificate you received this holiday season .
“ The biggest danger is that it will be forgotten and expire , ” she said .
“ One of the best presents you can give back to the giver is to use it quickly and then tell them how much you enjoyed it .
The regret from not using it will be bigger than the regret from using it on a nonperfect occasion , for you and especially for the person who gave it . ”
Another tactic is to give yourself deadlines .
Cash in the miles by summer , even if you ca n’t get a round - the - world trip out of them .
Instead of waiting for a special occasion to indulge yourself , create one .
Dr. Shu approvingly cites the pioneering therapeutic work of Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher , who for the past decade used their Wall Street Journal column on wine to proclaim the last Saturday of February to be “ Open That Bottle Night . ”
But you do n’t even have to wait until Feb. 27 .
Remember the advice offered in the movie “ Sideways ” to Miles , who has been holding on to a ’ 61 Cheval Blanc so long that it is in danger of going bad .
When Miles says he is waiting for a special occasion , his friend Maya puts matters in perspective :
“ The day you open a ’ 61 Cheval Blanc , that ’s the special occasion . ”
The Yankees are one win away from winning their 27th championship , or the same number collectively won by the Angels , Blue Jays , Braves , Cubs , Diamondbacks , Indians , Marlins , Mets , Orioles , Phillies , Royals , Twins and White Sox .
Wow , no wonder so many people hate them .
We can get to the intricacies of pitching Andy Pettitte on short rest and all that good stuff later today , but with nearly 70 percent of SportsNation planning to watch to Game 6 -- and almost the same percentage rooting for the Phillies -- we 're wondering how much of the interest in the Fall Classic comes from people rooting against the Bronx Bombers ?
A Cubs fan , SportsNation blogger drmockdreamy went the other way , happily catching a ride on the Yankees ' bandwagon once his team was ( yet again ) rendered useless .

The Copenhagen Wheel .
Photo - Courtesy of the SENSEable City Lab
Yesterday , Dec. 15 , at the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change , MIT researchers debuted the Copenhagen Wheel -- a revolutionary new bicycle wheel that not only boosts power , but can keep track of friends , fitness , smog and traffic .
Though it looks like an ordinary bicycle wheel with an oversized center , the Wheel 's bright red hub is a veritable Swiss army knife 's worth of electronic gadgets and novel functions .
" Over the past few years we have seen a kind of biking renaissance , which started in Copenhagen and has spread from Paris to Barcelona to Montreal , " says Carlo Ratti , director of the MIT SENSEable City Laboratory and the Copenhagen Wheel project .
" It 's sort of like ' Biking 2.0 ' — whereby cheap electronics allow us to augment bikes and convert them into a more flexible , on - demand system . "
The first goal of the Copenhagen
Wheel project is to promote cycling by extending the range of distance people can cover and by making the whole riding experience smoother so that even steep inclines are no longer a barrier to comfortable cycling .
Toward this end , the Wheel can store energy every time the rider puts on the brakes , and then give that power back to provide a boost when riding uphill or to add a burst of speed in traffic .
" The Wheel uses a technology similar to the KERS ( Kinetic Energy Recovery System ) , which has radically changed Formula
One racing over the past couple of years , ” says Ratti .
" When you brake , your kinetic energy is recuperated by an electric motor and then stored by batteries within the wheel , so that you can have it back to you when you need it .
The bike wheel contains all you need so that no sensors or additional electronics need to be added to the frame and an existing bike can be retrofitted with the blink of an eye . "
" Our city 's ambition is that 50 percent of the citizens will take their bike to work or school every day , " says Ritt Bjerregaard , Lord Mayor of Copenhagen .
" So for us , this project is part of the answer to how can we make using a bike even more attractive . "
But there are also a variety of extra functions hidden within the hub of the Copenhagen Wheel .
By using a series of sensors and a Bluetooth connection to the user 's iPhone , which can be mounted on the handlebars , the wheel can monitor the bicycle 's speed , direction and distance traveled , as well as collect data on air pollution and even the proximity of the rider 's friends .
" One of the applications that we have discussed with the City of Copenhagen is that of an incentive scheme whereby citizens collect Green Miles — something similar to frequent flyer miles , but good for the environment , " says Christine Outram , who led the team of MIT researchers .
The project also aims to create a platform for individual behavioral change .
" The Copenhagen Wheel is part of a more general trend : that of inserting intelligence in our everyday objects and of creating a smart support infrastructure around ourselves for everyday life , " says Assaf Biderman , associate director of the project .
“ For example , the Wheel has a smart lock : if somebody tries to steal it , it goes into a mode where the brake regenerates the maximum amount of power , and sends you a text message .
So in the worst case scenario the thief will have charged your batteries before you get back your bike . "
The initial prototypes of the Copenhagen Wheel were developed along with company Ducati Energia and the Italian Ministry of the Environment .
It is expected that the wheel will go into production next year , with a tag price competitive with that of a standard electric bike .
According to Claus Juhl , CEO of Copenhagen , the city might place the first order and use bicycles retrofitted with the Copenhagen
Wheel as a substitution for city employee cars as part of the city 's goal to become the world 's first carbon - neutral capital by 2025 .
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia —
It has been an eventful six weeks for Sivarak Chutipong .
When he left for work on Nov. 10 , the 31 - year - old Thai native was an anonymous expatriate who had lived and worked peacefully as an airport engineer in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh for seven years .
In the weeks since , he has met prime ministers , been pardoned by a king , and seen his picture splashed across the front pages of newspapers , caught up in the latest round of feuding between his native country and his adopted home .
Sivarak was convicted of spying in a Cambodian court earlier this month after relaying the flight information of fugitive ex-Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra to the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh .
Thaksin arrived in Cambodia on Nov. 10 for an intensely controversial visit , the fallout from which has attracted international attention and dominated news coverage in Thailand and Cambodia ever since .
Never exactly role models for peaceful co-existence , relations between Thailand and Cambodia have been especially strained since last year , when disagreements over territory surrounding an 11th - century temple near the Thai - Cambodian border erupted in a series of military clashes that left at least seven dead .
Neither country ’s leaders have been shy about exploiting this antagonism for domestic political points , and Sivarak ’s arrest and Thaksin ’s visit allowed Cambodia to take up the nationalist offensive against the government of Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva , as officials in Phnom Penh accused Bangkok of orchestrating an espionage plot and disrespecting Cambodian sovereignty .
A bitter rival of the Abhisit administration , Thaksin is the only elected Thai prime minister to have served a full term in office , scoring overwhelming victories in 2001 and 2005 .
In 2006 , however , he was ousted in a military coup and later indicted on corruption charges .
He went into self - imposed exile last year to avoid a two - year jail term and has been globe - trotting ever since .
Abhisit was incensed by Thaksin ’s arrival in Cambodia , the closest the former leader has come to his homeland since going into exile .
While Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has referred to Thaksin in recent weeks as his “ eternal friend , ” their relationship is evidently forward - looking ; in 2003 , when Thaksin was still in power , Hun Sen caused a diplomatic crisis by egging on anti-Thai rioters who subsequently burned down the neighboring country ’s embassy and attacked the Phnom Penh offices of Shin Corporation , owned by Thaksin ’s family .
Time , however , heals all wounds ( or perhaps the more appropriate adage is “ the enemy of my enemy is my friend ” ) ; in any case , Thaksin and Hun Sen used the November visit to showcase their amicability while lodging a steady stream of criticism at Abhisit right on his doorstep .
Thaksin , despite his conviction , still harbors ambitions of returning to politics , accusing the current Thai leadership of “ false patriotism ” during his inaugural speech as an official Cambodian economic adviser .
Sivarak had the misfortune of being drafted into a leading role in this diplomatic drama , as Thaksin and Hun Sen charged that on orders from the Thai Foreign Ministry , the young engineer had stolen secret information that put Thaksin ’s life in danger .
“ If we did not act in advance then for sure at this time , at this hour , Thaksin would be dead or jailed in a Thai prison , ” Hun Sen said of the case , cleverly omitting the fact that Thaksin ’s arrival was broadcast live on local television that morning .
Despite protests that he was not involved in politics and that Thaksin ’s arrival was public knowledge , Sivarak was found guilty in a one - day trial on Dec. 8 and sentenced to seven years in jail .
As images of Sivarak ’s tearful mother were beamed out from the Phnom Penh courthouse , critics in Bangkok accused Cambodia of manipulating the case for political ends .
These charges were amplified when , just three days after his conviction , Sivarak received a royal pardon that Cambodian officials said had been brokered by Thaksin .
Sivarak ’s mother , to the delight of the Thaksin allies in Thailand ’s opposition Puea Thai party , explained that her family could not trust Abhisit to handle the matter in the face of his acrimonious relations with Cambodia .
Following his release last week , Sivarak was invited to Hun Sen ’s Phnom Penh residence for a stage - managed event in which , as photographers and Puea Thai leaders looked on , the Cambodian premier greeted him warmly and presented him with a copy of the pardon .
Thaksin , believed to be spending most of his time in Dubai , flew back to Cambodia on the eve of Sivarak ’s release and visited him in prison .
In an impressive feat of doublethink , he told Hun Sen he considered Sivarak “ a political victim of the Thai government , ” according to local television reports .
Sivarak himself had little to say on the day he was freed , wearing a guarded expression as he played out his role in the political theater .
“ I feel very happy that I have freedom again , ” he said .
COPENHAGEN  President Obama announced here on Friday night that five major nations , including the United States , had together forged a climate deal .
He called it “ an unprecedented breakthrough ” but acknowledged that it still fell short of what was required to combat global warming .
The agreement addresses many of the issues that leaders came here to settle .
But it has left many of the participants in the climate talks unhappy , from the Europeans , who now have the only binding carbon control regime in the world , to the delegates from the poorest nations , who objected to being left out of the critical negotiations .
By the early hours of Saturday , representatives of the 193 countries who have negotiated here for nearly two weeks had not yet approved the deal and there were signs they might not .
But Mr. Obama , who left before the conference considered the accord because of a major storm descending on Washington , noted that the agreement was merely a political statement and not a legally binding treaty and might not need ratification by the entire conference .
The three - page accord that Mr. Obama negotiated with the leaders of China , India , Brazil and South Africa and then presented to the conference did not meet even the modest expectations that leaders set for this meeting , notably by failing to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord .

Frank -
Loved the imaginary letter from Jesus .
My son is gay and a follower of Jesus Christ and I am a follower of Jesus Christ and do n't find any scriptural evidence to condemn loving , monogamous same sex relationships .
I sometimes think " I could be wrong - who knows for sure " - but even if I am wrong who is God going to condemn ?( if he does that sort of thing is questionable imo ) ... my son who is in a good , loving , monogamous relationship and not oppressing or hating on people - or religious people who are spending their time and effort trying to keep gay people from being able to marry and trying to convince them that they are shameful and rejected by God ???
It 's a no brainer for me .

Frank you 're getting yourself tangled in the messages of the new testament if you think you can use selective passages and say the rest not relevant as evidenced by your " pick the good , leave out the bad " .
You should have just stuck with where Jesus says " you should love God with all your heart " and you should love your neighbor as yourself " and that story .
That 's all you really needed .

Thanks Frank -
I always think how infrequently Good Samaritan story is though about in Christian circles , and really how profound it is .
The story is literally Christ 's answer to " who is my neigbor " , I take it to mean : who ever crosses you path , regardless of cultural differences , is your neighbor , and you should love and care for them as much as you do yourself , that is the essence of being a Christian People forget / ignore that when Jesus railed against the pharisees and sadduces and told the good samaritan parable , and the sheep and the goats story , he was railing against the holy - than - thou , intolerant , uncompassionate , literal readers of religious law of his day , those who did not live by the spirit of the law , which Jesus defined as compassion and understanding .
I was thinking you sounded a tad angry for being Jesus , but then I remembered Jesus did get pretty righteously angry about people who were leading people astray spiritual , I suspect some one seeing Jesus throwing tables over at the temple would even say he was in a rage , not selfish anger over his needs , but in rage over the mistreatment and misleading of his flock .
Thanks , great post .
@ Konstantin -
If you read new testament portion about Jesus ' life and his words , there is no way to avoid how much and how often he is making the same points as Frank does above , for the characters of his time .
Yes Frank is picking certain verses , but he is picking the ones others do not pic , ignore , so the are forgotten , not emphasize , but not in the Gospels ... Jesus is constantly railing on literalist puffed up righteous ones of his day , talking about how his Father will throw people in hell for doing religious duties but not caring for orphans , widows , hungry , those in jail , etc ... Frank 's specific examples in modern times are needed to make these points more obvious Pharisee , Sadducees=religious right of our day , poor people , gay people , muslims= widows , adulterous woman , samaritans , of his day .
People completely miss the main emphasis of Christ teachings , one must pull out specific verses that are overlooked and give modern examples .
Why to Christ talk in parables and analogies ?
it helped people understand .

Frank , you who assume to speak as the oracle of God ... be careful .
Who commissioned you or who gave you the authority ?
This position is given of God , to those who have obtained to a level of spiritual maturity such that they can be trusted with that position .
You are not there and you are in danger of judgement .
Again , be very careful and consider yourself duly warned .
If you persist , your blood is on your own hands .
Jesus did n't violate the law ( old testament ordinances ) ,
He fulfilled it .
( Romans 13:10 ) Although , homosexuality is wrong ( Romans 1:26 & 27,1 Corinthians 6:9 ) , we are to love the homosexual as we do all men and women .
( again Romans 13:10 )

Big Dan , just take a moment to look around .
There are many American Churches that speak the true word of Christ .
It is why this article is mistitled .
While I agree there are those groups like the Fred Phelps gang that totally miss the point there are many Christians out their doing Christ work here on earth .
In my city alone there are more Christian organizations than I can count that are out there feeding the homeless , providing for the everyday needs of the downtroddin .
Simply because it is the right thing to do .
You do not " have to " accept Christ to receive help , just simply show up .

I agree with Ken above .
Frank is not God or a prophet and should not continue to speak for God .
There are multiple fallacies in his letter .
Nowhere does he back up what he says with scripture ( hint hint ) .
I pray you people have sense enough to read God 's word for yourself and not take a man 's word for what He says .
Poor Frank is a liberal who misquotes the bible to make his opinions appeal to people who want to live their own life like " they " want ... not how God commands .
We " all " fall short of the glory of God .
So beg for forgiveness from Jesus Christ as He is the only way to salvation .
We all need saving .
Do n't get caught up in liberal or conservative politicians beliefs to save you .... as Frank bashes Bush and praises Obama ... both of which are just men and both sin .
Read what the bible says on wars ( ( 1 Samuel 15:3 ; Joshua 4:13 ) . , homosexuality ( levitcus 20:13 ) , abortion ( jeremiah 1:5 ) etc .
If you have any questions what to do in life do n't believe the commone man .... read God 's word .
We 're all responsible for ourselves to know what is right and wrong according to the bible .
Frank I leave you with this passage as your letter fits this to a " T " .
Proverbs 6:16 - 19
You 're walking on thin ice it appears .

big dan i think you 're old enough to get a job with insurance .
if not your mother should have you covered .
half the people out there in need of insurance either do n't want it because their job pays more to decline it or they just do n't want to get a job .
i agree some people are n't offerend insurance and these people should think about purchasing their own .
i know if i did n't have insurance i'd purchase it ... if not for me then for my family .
insurance is n't a right it 's a benefit .
next you 'll be saying we should pay for everyone 's car insurance flood insurance etc .
i buy mine and the uninsured should buy theirs .
basically these knuckleheads want this bill passed so we can pay for everyone 's abortion .... otherwise they 'd omit that from the bill .

To some degree i agree David .
But if we ignored everyone who thought like this guy we'd be going to Heaven without alot of people who still have time to change their hearts .
There 's no doubt in my mind that these people know right from wrong .
They just find it 's alot easier to go down the path of Satan then follow the Lord .
And I agree it is .
One day in the near future they wo n't have to worry about that choice and it 'll be too late .
There is n't a day that goes by that we do n't stumble .
But the good news is we 've already been forgiven .
All we have to do is ask for forgiveness and turn away from that sin .
Too many people looking out for number one and it 's terrible .
A guy with what he believes in and he wants to tell everyone what Jesus would do .
Poor Schaeffer .
I 'll be praying for you and people like you who think it 's ok to live " my " life with no regards for living biblically .
The great day of the Lord is closer than the experts believe I beg that everyone who does n't know the Lord get on their knees tonight and ask for forgiveness .
Then start reading new testament .
Reading John got me started .
Once you believe in the Lord it'll break your heart knowing we 're all guilty of His murder .
Good thing about the Jesus is he 's there for you anytime you need him .
If you fully repent and mean it I promise you 'll be blessed beyond imagination .
He 's the man .

When children grow up in an environment with a twisted concept of " male and male " parents , should the Christians shut up ?

Now , I realize that you are refering to prophecy , but you offer us a website wherein the first words are as follows : " The Bible is not a science book , yet it is scientifically accurate .

I humbly submit to you the following questions : 1 ) what is the value of pi ?
2 ) what is the Biblical valueof pi ?
( Hint 1 Kings 7:23 and 2 Chronicles 4:2 ) 3 ) how do you reconcile the difference between the answers to 1 ( 3.14 ... ) and 2 ( 3.00 ) above and still maintain that " It 's impossible for the bible to be anything but truth " ?

So many words and so little logic .
" Frank " cannot " speak for Jesus . "
But the Pastors in your megachurches who teach intolerance can ?
" Frank will go to hell for blasphemy ? "
What about the writers of the Bible ?
Where they also blasphemous ?
How did they get the permission to " speak for Jesus ? "
" Frank is " misrepresenting " the Bible because he is a liberal ? "
Was n't Jesus a Liberal ?
" Frank does not know God or does not know the Bible or does not give his soul over to God . "
Interesting that ... how can anyone know what is in another 's heart ?
Not to mention that my understanding of Frank Schaeffer was that he has been studying scripture and Christ his entire life ... but , apparently if his truth does not equal your truth it is not the real truth .
" You should read God 's word for yourself and not take a man 's word for God's . "
Which God 's words should I read ?
The ones that the Council of Nicaea decided that they would include in the Bible or the ones that they decided not to include ?
Men wrote the words in the Bible , men from the Council of Nicaea decided which of those words that they would include and you are all instructing me not to trust the word of man but to instead only trust the word of God .

To " here 's a clue " comment 26 http://www.direct.ca/trinity/pi.html see if this link helps you out with your math .
I 'm sure with all your great wisdom you 'd know the answer to pi before God would ?
You 're talking a difference of .00026 % difference in that verse of scripture and pi .
It 's easy for people to step back and pick out a verse here and verse there and attempt to tear it apart to try and ridicule God 's word .
I 'd like to know from this person if he knows of a prophecy written in the bible that 's ever been proven wrong .
Just pick one .
I mean there are hundreds to chose from and I 'm asking for one verse you can prove wrong .
And to Nathanial on comment 37 .
Leviticus 20:13 is all you need to know about homosexuality .
And their is a huge difference between witnessing to people in public and praying in public .
I 'm sure you 'd know this or are you just tossing a few jabs in at the Christians who actually care whether or not people go to hell ?
This letter written is based on half fact taken out of context and the writer knows this .
That 's what makes it really detestable .
Apparently the writer knows a little something about God 's word but refuses to take the whole verse into meaning because it condemns his beliefs .
The bible in plain words condemns homosexuality ... no ifs , ands or buts .
We should all be striving to live a better life and hold ourselves to a higher standard for what was given to us .
It 's not my job to condemn anyone .
I 'm a sinner as everyone posting on this site is .
The difference is that I know I fall short of the glory of God and have asked for forgiveness for all of my sins .
It 's an everyday process ... just as it is for a junkie or an alocoholic , it is for a sinner who 's trying to live according to God 's will not ours .

To Anjha comment 36 .
First of all do n't get caught up believing every preacher you hear .
He 's only a man .
If you put faith in a man to save you then you 're alot worse off then you know .
Men will fail you every time whereas God will not .
What I 'm saying to you is that you should know enough of the bible to figure out if a preacher is speaking clearly from the word of God .
Also , writers of the bible were given visions from God as to what should be included in the bible .
Understand something .
What is in the bible today is there because God wanted it that way ... no matter who typed it up , wrote it down etc .... it's ultimately God 's decision .
He uses man every day to get His work done .
He does n't need us to do His work to get it done , but we do it willingly because the sacrifice
He 's made for everyone of us whether we accept
His gift or not He 's still your God .
Also noone knows what 's in Schaeffer 's heart ... only God knows .
But understand what precedeth from the mouth comes from the heart first ( matthew 15:17 - 20 ) .
Basically , he 's laying his cards out on the table when he writes what he 's writing .
He could be on his knees as I type this asking the Lord into his heart and he 's forgiven and will enter into heaven on that Great Day !
It 's as simple or as hard as you want it to be .
Understand this , the first time Jesus came it was as a Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins .
The next time
He returns it will be as Conquerer and Judge .
It 's too late then .
The curtain has n't closed on this one yet .
I hope this helps .
God Bless you .

Michael --
No , that 's NOT all I need to know about homosexuality .
I needed to know a lot * more * , so I dropped the bronze - age mythology and came to terms with who I really AM --- an out , proud gay man --- and I am a lot happier and content than when I was letting sanctimonious busy - bodies bully me around .
And , as you may know , the bible also condemns usury , so why are n't all the busybodies lining up to spread calumny about all the major banks ?
And you * know * about that " bearing false witness " injunction , which a lot of the gawd - botherers --- from Tony Perkins to Maggie Gallagher to Fred Phelps to Joey the Rat in his obscene gilded palace --- transgress on a virtual daily basis , what with all the shocking lies that they tell about us harmless and innocent gay men and women .

Would you agree that maybe that same margin of error be granted to us imperfect humans in our dealings with each other ?
You 'll tolerate the bible being clearly wrong about the simple number of pi .
But you 'll hold an imperfect human to the letter of the law ... a law mind you that Jesus fulfilled and replaced with mercy and grace .
Michael I do n't think you 've used the words love , forgiveness , grace or mercy in any of your comments here ...
but you claim to speak for god .
" Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ? " he replied , " ' You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind ' - this is the great and foremost commandment , and there is a second like it , ' You shall love your neighbour as yourself ' .
The whole Law and Prophets hang on these two commands . "
( Mtt 22:37 - 40 , Mrk 12:28 - 34 ) .

... michael said on 12/10/2009 @ 10:58 am PT ... big dan i think you 're old enough to get a job with insurance .
if not your mother should have you covered .
half the people out there in need of insurance either do n't want it because their job pays more to decline it or they just do n't want to get a job .
i agree some people are n't offerend insurance and these people should think about purchasing their own .
i know if i did n't have insurance i'd purchase it ... if not for me then for my family .
insurance is n't a right it 's a benefit .
next you 'll be saying we should pay for everyone 's car insurance flood insurance etc .
i buy mine and the uninsured should buy theirs .
basically these knuckleheads want this bill passed so we can pay for everyone 's abortion .... otherwise they 'd omit that from the bill .
Drive by ignorance .
Typical ignorant conservative who only thinks of himself and thinks he knows everything .
Your ignorance is really showing with the statement that you think half the people out there are n't insured because they do n't want it .
Who would n't want insurance ?
That 's asinine to say people do n't want insurance , that does n't make any sense .
People like you see the light when they lose their insurance .
You are the " I got mine , screw you " mentality .
The " I do n't want everyone covered because then mine will go up " mentality .
The selfish mentality of conservatives .
You will see the light soon , because insurance is tied to your job , and jobs are getting scarce .
Wait until you lose your insurance , or someone in your family does .
Will you laugh at them ?
Or one of your friends .
Wait until one of your relatives or friends dies due to lack of health insurance .
It 's a right , not a privilege .
Maybe not to you and your " I got mine " conservatism .

Conservatives like Michael have put a value on an American 's life : it 's $ 100 .
If Michael was told his insurance would go up from $ 400 to $ 500 in order to cover all uninsured Americans and save thousands of lives , Michael would say " no " .

Thank you Frank .
I think Jesus would approve of this piece .
As for the trolls here , may you and the other commenters have a very Merry Christmas and a much better New Year .
Pray for Peace and for bringing the troops home .
Those poor souls need all the prayers they can get .
Let 's all work to end these unjust wars , afterall that 's what Jesus would want .

A little pedantic , but right on .
There are any number of amazing things about this blog .
For starters , it flies right over the heads of most convervative Christians that they are the embodiment of biblical Pharisees ; just we liberal mainline Christians such as myself do n't seem to grasp that we are the Sadduccees of this day .
What is most astounding is to think of who Frank Schaeffer 's father was -- and to see how Frank has not abandoned Christianity altogether .
Would it were possible for us to fast forward 100 years and see what religion scholars make of the dicotomy between Francis and Frank Schaeffer , which of them will be the enduring spiritual voice and what our response to either of them will say about us .

Dearest Jesus , I appreciate your comments regarding Christians and their hypocritical stance re : gays .
However I was hoping you would also address the " Christian " inclination towards war , and their indifference to suffering , torture and false imprisonment of others .
Why are n't these Christians against war ?
Why not " Peace on Earth " ?

There is NO reasoning with ' Christians ' these days .
Not sure if there ever was .
But one thing IS clear about those who call themselves Christians in America ...
Until they do right by humanity , God has most certainly forsaken them .
One only needs to look at them and their intentions to know this .
Christianity in America and many other parts of the world has become a symbol of hatred , bigotry and oppression .
And apparently Christ 's followers would n't have it any other way .

Dearest Michael ,
You said : Men will fail you every time whereas God will not .
You also said : Understand something .
What is in the bible today is there because God wanted it that way ... no matter who typed it up , wrote it down etc .... it's ultimately God 's decision .
He uses man every day to get His work done .
This strikes me as a wee bit fickle .
Is the fact that the Council of Nicaea were somehow more led by God ( and therefore conveniently relevant to your point ) because it happened so long ago ?
Are we more fallible now in our interpretation than 2000 years ago ?
( Apart from the fact that the council cherry picked so all we have to go on now is what they have told us we can have . )
This sentiment also strikes me as naive , contadicted , but also quite dangrous to live by .
So you 're saying God wills everything ?
Or just that " True Christians " such as yourself are solely led by the big G ?
Was 9/11 an act of God ?
Or was that the American Government cashing in on fear , whilst fuelling the hatred of " that which is other " in the horrified American people ?
( Actually that 's unfair , it horrified , not to mention sucessfully terrified the whole world . )
I 'm sure God would n't want you to feel guilty all the time for sinning .
Depends what you count as sins I suppose .
... Eating a Big Mac ?
Does that count ?
Or stuff like thinking " She looks fat in that , and then lying to make her feel better ? "
Or the classic " I totally just killed 20 people with this machine gun ... "
" Man will fail every time " , huh ?
Tad harsh there .
Are you yourself not a man ?
I know nobody is perfect , but is n't the point of being human to make mistakes and then rectify them ?
You do that for yourself .
Then if you 're desperate you can ask God to handle stuff for you if you can't deal with it .
But you do that with your parents when you are little .
God as father .
Powerful .
Dangerous .
God usually does n't smack your wrist in this life , and well , I have n't actually met anyone who has been to a hell they have n't made for themselves here ... so .
Let your conscience be your guide darling .
I wish upon you what you wish upon yourself .

Michael said " To some degree i agree David .
But if we ignored everyone who thought like this guy we'd be going to Heaven without alot of people who still have time to change their hearts . "
I agree that while there is life there is still time , and I pray they 'll learn the truth before it 's too late .
But there comes a time when one must stop casting their pearls before swine and move on to those whose hearts and minds are not filled with hatred towards God and His Word .
The modern - day liberal hates God and His laws and harbours hatred towards those who are his true followers , as is evident from several of the posts on this thread .
May the Lord reward them according to their works .

Brad Friedman ~ you forgot to mention David Lipscomb completely lumping every liberal into the same category that he has imagined for himself .
And ignoring the fact that whilst blinded by his own sense of righteousness he has forgotten how to love anyone other than his particular brand of God Squad and the image of their snowy bearded white father figure mascot .
But I forgive Mr. Lipscomb because his name makes me think of someone with a truly epic moustache .
For that reason alone , David has made me smile .
And hey , David , look on the bright side ...

The most recent map and business data :
Uses the most up - to - date maps and business listings from Google Maps , which is constantly improving thanks to users who report issues and businesses who activate their listings with Google Local Business Center .
Search in plain English : Easily locate destinations even without an address by simply entering a business name , landmark , or just about anything else .
Search by voice :
By holding down the search button , you can activate voice search , which will allow you to speak a destination and the app will interpret and plot routes for you .
Traffic view : Displays and warns of upcoming traffic issues indicated with colors , just like Google Maps .
Search along route : Find businesses along your current path by searching by name or type .
Satellite view :
Uses the same satellite imagery as Google Maps .
Gives detailed 3D view of your upcoming route for easy navigation .
Street view :
You will be able to zoom into Street View to see the street from a first - person perspective .
Google has announced that they will be officially entering the turn - by - turn navigation app market with their new free Android 2.0 app called Google Maps Navigation .
This news is n't at all surprising considering it was only yesterday that rumors of such an app were making their rounds across the Internet .
The most exciting portion of the news , however , comes from Google 's vice president of engineering , Vic Gundotra , who has stated that the company is working closely with Apple to bring the app to the iPhone .
In a post on Google 's blog , they highlight seven of the app's most exciting features :
As stated earlier , Google Maps Navigation ( Beta ) will only initially be available for Android 2.0 .
The first device to carry it will be the Motorola Droid , which launches on November 6th on Verizon .
Google is working with Apple to bring the app to the iPhone , although no other details are available , including a timeframe .
This news will no doubt have all of the other navigation companies shaking in their boots since Google will be offering Google Maps Navigation free of charge .
Ads will eventually make their way into the app , but they wo n't be present at launch .
Embedded below is a video of the app in action on an Android 2.0 device .
Who said you ca n’t teach an old dog new tricks ?
Not the dude in the video below who , after staring blankly at the screen scrolling code for a minute or two , gets Android to boot up on his Palm Treo 650 :
Sure …
But can it run Crysis ChromeOS ?
Maybe Palm should start a little TreoDoes campaign .
TreoDoes prefer Android to WebOS .
Anyone ?
Takers ?
Instead of emphasizing the what , I want to emphasize the how part : how we feel while programming .
That 's Ruby 's main difference from other language designs .
I emphasize the feeling , in particular , how I feel using Ruby .
I did n't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone , because you feel differently from me .
No language can be perfect for everyone .
I tried to make Ruby perfect for me , but maybe it 's not perfect for you .
The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python .
- Matz .
Has anybody , then , made systems which might some day convert any language into any other language in a clean fashion , so that I can write in Alice ML and you can modify it in Java ?
Personally , I think it is obvious that even if such transmogrification were avaialble , it would n't always help a heck of a lot because the density of any given region of code can change like 100x .
Not to mention that I guess any Turing - esque equivalency does n't take into consideration the differences in runtime .
Another take on this :
Why are n't there programming language generators / wizards which ask me a series of 20 questions ( " do you prefer static or dynamic typing ? " - i'd like to be able to answer ' both ' , of course ) and then spit out a framework language ( including debugger ! ) for me ?
( And under the covers everything gets converted to / from XML so we can individually put the curly braces - if any - wherever we prefer . )
An investigation has been launched into allegations that British soldiers tortured Iraqi civilians , Britain 's Ministry of Defence said .
The announcement of the probe came after the Independent newspaper said 33 cases of alleged abuse had been reported , including claims of rape , the use of torture techniques and physical assault .
The newspaper said the civilians claimed British soldiers in Iraq copied sexual and physical abuse from photographs taken at the notorious US - run Abu Ghraib jail in Baghdad , which emerged in 2004 .
A legal letter was served on the ministry last week by a lawyer representing the Iraqis , the report said .
Britain 's armed forces minister Bill Rammell said " formal investigations " must be carried out " without judgments being made prematurely " .
He added : " Over 120,000 British troops have served in Iraq and the vast , vast majority have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour , displaying integrity and selfless commitment .
" While there have been instances when individuals have behaved badly , only a tiny number of individuals have been shown to have fallen short of our high standards .
" Allegations of this nature are taken very seriously , however allegations must not be taken as fact and formal investigations must be allowed to take their course without judgments being made prematurely . "
In the letter to the ministry , reported in the newspaper , lawyer Phil Shiner said : " Given the history of the UK 's involvement in the development of these techniques alongside the US , it is deeply concerning that there appears to be strong similarities between instances of the use of sexual humiliation . "
One claimant alleges he was raped by two British soldiers , while others say they were striped naked , abused and photographed between 2003 and 2007 , the Independent reported .
Female British soldiers are alleged to have taken part in the alleged incidents .
Camp Bucca near Basra in southern Iraq , where British and US troops worked alongside each other , was named by the newspaper as one possible scene of the alleged abuse .
In September 2003 , Iraqi hotel receptionist Baha Mousa died after suffering 93 injuries , including fractured ribs and a broken nose , while in British military custody in Basra , southern Iraq .
A public inquiry into the case is taking place in London .
Photographs taken at Abu Ghraib showed naked and hooded prisoners being beaten until they bled by their US guards and made to commit humiliating acts such as simulated homosexual intercourse .
In 2006 , then US president George W Bush admitted the scandal was the biggest blunder Washington had made in its entire Iraq campaign , and the facility was closed and handed over to Iraqi control .

The blubbery sea lions at Pier 39 , one of San Francisco 's smelliest and most famous tourist attractions , are gone .
During the last week of November , they left the wooden docks on which they 've spent the last 20 years and no one knows if they 'll be coming back .
" We have no idea where they moved on to or why , " said Shelbi Stoudt , who manages a team that helps stranded animals in the San Francisco Bay from the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito , California .
The sea lions ' disappearance is as strange as their initial colonization of the pier about 20 years ago , in late 1989 .
They just started showing up one day and as their numbers increased , their traditional hang out , Seal Rocks , became less populated .
There are all sorts of theories about why the pier became a favorite haul - out spot for the sea lions , but no one knows for sure why the animals ' behavior changed .
Stoudt said the officials at the Marine Mammal Center were n't worried about the animals ' disappearance from their favored location .
The sea lions are migratory animals , after all , and it 's natural for them to move around .
So , even though no one has found them , " there really is n't a reason to be looking for them , " Stoudt said .
The disappearance is unusual , though .
The animals ' numbers usually peak in late fall and many stick around during the winter months before heading south for the summer .
According to the Marine Mammal Center 's FAQ on the animals , " from late summer to late spring , 150 to 300 sea lions haul out here , " though their numbers can run much higher .
This year saw a massive influx of sea lions .
In fact , a Marine Mammal Center survey conducted in the fall found 1,585 mammals hauled out on the spot , an all - time high .
Some of them invaded a neighboring area , the Hyde Street Pier , where they may have been scared away by an itinerant fisherman 's dog .
Their disappearance drew the attention of San Franciscans like local blogger Gary Soup , who posted the photo above on Twitter of the deserted docks .
The animals had become a major tourist and education locus on the otherwise highly commercial strip known as Fisherman 's Wharf .
The Marine Mammal Center sends docents to the area to answer questions about the creatures .
On the other hand , fishermen and others who work the waters of the Port of San Francisco have far less friendly relations with the animals .
One recently told a local radio station , " They 're cute when they 're in here lying on the docks by Pier 39 , but they 're not too cute out in the ocean when they 're stealing your livelihood . "
It does n't appear that local weather conditions could have influenced the animals .
The weather in San Francisco has been normal , according to National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Canaepa .
" It 's pretty typical winter conditions , " Canaepa said .
This is an El Niño year , but the local impacts of that warming of the Pacific have been moderate .
" I do n't know if that would be enough to make them change their minds and leave the area , " he said .
The Mammal Center 's Stoudt said they had n't detected signs of something unusual going on with the fauna of the Bay , either .
While it 's appealing to think that the animals may have just returned to their previous home at Seal Rocks , locals contacted by Wired.com did n't think there had been much of a change in the sea lion population there .
" Nothing unusual has happened , " said Jennifer Valencia , who takes reservations at the Cliff House , which overlooks the Rocks .
So , for now , no one knows where they 've gone or whether they 'll ever head back to their perch amid the clam chowder shops and street performers .

Tom Coburn picks on political science
The American Political Science Association has informed me that Senator Tom Coburn has introduced a floor amendment to strip away all National Science Foundation funding for political science .
Now , as a political scientist , I have some skin in this game .
I ’ve never received a dollar of NSF funding , but much of my own work has built off of studies that were funded by the National Science Foundation .
So my natural instinct is to oppose this .
You want to chalk up my opposition to simple material interests , be my guest .
Looking at Coburn ’s explanation for his amendment , however , I ’m even more perturbed .
This is the first part of his explanation :
When Americans think of the National Science Foundation , they think of cross-cutting science , technology , engineering , and mathematics .
Most would be surprised to hear that the agency spent $ 91.3 million over the last 10 years on political " science " and $ 325 million last year alone on social studies and economics ….
NSF spent $ 91.3 million over the last 10 years on political " science . "
This amount could have been directed towards the study of biology , chemistry , geology , and physics .
These are real fields of science in which new discoveries can yield real improvements in the lives of everyone .
Actually , what surprised me is how little the NSF is spending on political science .
Tom Coburn is ticked off because the federal government is shelling out a whopping $ 9.13 million per year on political science ?
We ’re running a $ 1 trillion deficit and Coburn thinks that poli sci’s $ 9.13 million is what ’s crippling the hard sciences ?
That dog wo n’t hunt .
Moving on….
The National Science Foundation has misspent tens of millions of dollars examining political science issues which in reality have little , if anything , to do with science [ such as ] … .
The Human Rights Data Project : which concluded that the United States has been " increasingly willing to torture enemy combatants and imprison suspected terrorists , " leading to a worldwide increase in " human rights violations " as others followed - suit ;
Hmmm …. seems to me that finding a correlation of that significance is :
Most definitely science ; Pretty friggin’ important .
Going through the rest of Coburn ’s list of " abominations , " I can see one or two grants that might raise my hackles — but that ’s going to be true of any grant - giving exercise .
See Henry Farrell and Andrew Gelman on this point as well .
As Gelman observes , " really , the list of ‘ wasteful projects ’ seems pretty lame to me .
Golden Fleece material , it ai n’t . "
Here ’s the key paragraph in Coburn ’s explanation :
If taxpayers are going to get their money ’s worth from the significant funding increases being entrusted to the National Science Foundation , the agency should be held accountable for how those funds are being spent .
The political science program which does not withstand scrutiny should be eliminated immediately .
Theories on political behavior are best left to CNN , pollsters , pundits , historians , candidates , political parties , and the voters , rather than being funded out of taxpayers ’ wallets , especially when our nation has much more urgent needs and priorities ( emphasis added ) .
OK , dear readers , I want you to close your eyes and imagine a world in which your entire knowledge of political behavior emanated only from CNN , pollsters , pundits , historians , candidates , and political parties .
Take your time .
I ’ll wait .
If that world did n’t scare you , well , then , you have nothing to worry about .
The rest of you can marvel at Coburn ’s failure of logic .
Basic research in the hard sciences or the social sciences is a public good — these things tend to get underprovided in a perfectly free market .
It ’s not clear to me at all why Coburn thinks that the $ 9 million spent on poli sci is a waste but the gazillions from the public trough spent on the hard sciences are not a waste when private corporations , industrial associations , scientific publications , universities , and private citizens could n’t fund this stuff .
Now , I must grudgingly concede one point in Coburn ’s favor : APSA ’s response to this is that it , " encourages political scientists to contact their Senator ’s office TODAY to ask them to vote against Coburn ’s amendment . "
This suggests to me despite our massive federal subsidy , APSA has yet to understand how to influence political behavior .
Having a couple of hundred political scientists call their Senators ai n’t going to matter .
Using our vast control of the liberal mainstream media the interwebs to generate media interest in Coburn acting like an ignorant jackass seems much more useful .
BWA HA HA HA HA HA !!
[ Um … is this news ?
If Coburn regularly acts like an ignorant jackass , then would this be deemed newsworthy ?
–ed .
Uh -oh . ]
Another post related to Avatar today .
The journey to Pandora was shown as taking six or seven years , which assumes a ship travelling at somewhere close to light speed ( maybe 0.8 c ) because do n't forget there is also the acceleration when first starting and deceleration before arrival that needs to happen as well .
But to truly know just how far away even the closest star to us is we 'll have to use the only scale we can imagine : the planets in our Solar System and the farthest we have ever sent a probe .
Let 's use that to visualize the distance to our nearest stellar companion .
Well , companions ( there are three stars in the system ) .
But Avatar is based on the largest star , Alpha Centauri A .
First we have an image showing 250 AU .
The first dot there ( none of these dots are to scale of course ) is the Sun , then Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Ceres , Jupiter ( in red there , the first one away from the crowd ) , Saturn , Oranos ( my preferred English name for Uranus ) , Neptune , then Pluto in yellow , and after that there is Haumea , Makemake , and Eris way out on its own .
The grey line is the location of Voyager 2 , which is thus far the farthest we 've ever been able to send a craft out into space .
And now the journey to Alpha Centauri A begins .
Do n't use the scroll bar on the right !
To fully appreciate the distance you have to keep scrolling down with the mouse .
And we are there !
Just joking , we 're 8th of the way there .
If we 're lucky then the recently launched WISE will discover a brown dwarf at about twice or three times this distance .
If not , then we 'll have to go eight times this distance to reach our first interstellar object .
Well , the red dwarf Proxima Centauri is about 0.17 light years closer , which is 10 750 AU or 43 times the first image .
But in cosmic terms it 's pretty much the same distance .
The good news is that Voyager was n't sent out to be particularly fast , so it is n't a representative of what we are truly capable of .
That is , we 're not really trying because there 's precious little to see beyond the Solar System .
A craft using VASIMR ( VASIMR is n't quite flight ready but in a few years it should be ) would be able to achieve a velocity of over 100 km /s , which is about 17 days per AU .
At that rate it would surpass Voyager 2 in about 4.5 years , not bad since it 's taken Voyager 2 a total of 32 years so far to reach its current distance .
But at that velocity it would still take 12,900 years or so to reach Alpha Centauri .
Voyager 2 would take 72,000 years .
We get that actors , and special effects are pretty expensive , but we 're always baffled when we hear the amount of money it takes to make a Hollywood blockbuster .
After all , many of our favorite films were made with a borrowed hand held camcorder , a few nameless actresses and whatever it costs to rent two plus sized chicken costumes ( and have them thoroughly dry cleaned ) .
We asked you to show us what some of the most expensive movies would have looked like if they 'd been made with what those of us who know the value of a dollar still consider a lot of money .
The winner is below , but first the runners up .

Hey , this frankly amazing Onion video almost kinda came true !
Glenn Beck suffered an appendicitis attack on - air today .
It was during his radio program , so sadly there is no video of Glenn clutching his abdomen , vomiting , and finally collapsing in pain .
Beck is expected to make a full recovery , after his appendix was removed at " an undisclosed hospital . "
Let 's hope things go better than they did the last time he went to the hospital , when he had to wait for 40 minutes in the emergency room !
This was back when he was with CNN , so he blamed the health care industry instead of secret Maoist - ACORN Lizard People .
Fursuits can cost thousands of pounds from shops
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
A court case where the two defendants met on a " furry " website has put the spotlight in this little - known world .
So what is a furry ?
Lenya looks adorable , with lots of glossy white fur , black paws , a shiny pink nose and cute little pointed ears .
But Lenya is also a 48 - year - old computer network administrator called Marshall Woods , who likes motor racing , visiting museums and reading crime novels in his spare time .
DEFINITIONS Anthropomorphism : Attribution of human traits to an animal Zoomorphism : Attribution of animal traits to a human Source : K.Gerbasi Mr Woods is what is known as a furry and Lenya is a " fursona " he has created , which he described as a " sort of space weasel " .
As part of getting into character he wears a handmade , full - size fursuit .
Furry Fandom , furrydom , furdom - it 's called many things - has momentarily found itself in the spotlight in the UK , due to a court case where the two defendants met on a furry website .
It is a largely unknown scene and participants have been happy to keep it that way , feeling they are often misunderstood .
So what is a furry ?
No standard definition exists but generally furries are people who have a fascination with anthropomorphic animals .
These are animals that are given human traits , like walking and talking .
They can be anything from cartoons characters like Bugs Bunny to computer game personalities like Pokemon .
The scene has its own art , animation , comic books and literature , but activities are largely conducted online - where furries adopt " fursonas " for role playing .
But for some it is about meeting other furries in person .
Groups around the world meet regularly and there are conventions in the US , UK , Germany , Mexico , France , Russia and Brazil .
Petting and scratching Furries say the scene is about creativity , freedom and community ; being who you want to be among like - minded people .
" You get to choose what and who you are .
Imagination is OK , no matter what your age , " says Mark Merlino , a founding member of the furry culture in the US and known as Sylys Sable on the scene .
COMMON FURRY IDENTITIES
Wolf Fox Lion Tiger Folf ( Fox / Wolf ) Cabbit ( Cat / Rabbit ) Source : K Gerbasi But , inevitably perhaps , there 's a sexual element too .
In a recent court case in the UK , two men who met on a furry website , and shared sexual role - playing fantasies , were convicted of plotting to kill one of the pair 's adoptive parents .
Christopher Monks , from Lancashire , and Shaun Skarnes , from Cheshire , were found guilty of meticulously preparing the killings via the internet .
They are currently awaiting sentence .
Furries will not thank the pair for casting their hobby in a negative light , and tend to argue the sexual side is hugely overplayed .
" I think the problem is that sex sells , " says Ian Wolf ( his furry pseudonym ) , who is editor of the British furry news website , FurteanTimes.com .
" It is not surprising that less scrupulous journalists like to print stories about people having sex dressed as foxes . "
Some furries assume animal traits - known as zoomorphism - and indentify strongly with certain species .
This can range from adopting an online persona to wearing a tail or full - sized fur suits like Mr Woods .
Exhilarating " Fursuiters " , as they are called , bemoan society 's inhibitions and look admiring at the animal kingdom where creatures have more freedom to be expressive .
Touching , petting , hugging and " skritching " ( lightly scratching and grooming ) is common at social gatherings .
And most do not remove their costumes in public areas , to prevent breaking the illusion .
" There 's a magic moment when you put a costume on and see yourself in the mirror , " says Mr Woods .
" It 's simultaneously disorienting and exhilarating .
You actually do feel that you 've changed for just a moment . "
Some identify with certain animals Anthrozoologist , Kathy Gerbasi , who studies human - animal interactions and furries , has witnessed furry interaction first - hand .
" People say that being in a fur suit allows you to do things you might not otherwise do , like dance in public , clown around , give people a hug , " she says .
She argues furries are just taking something that most of us do a few steps further .
" I think most humans grow up interested in animals .
We grow up with teddy bears , pets , Mickey Mouse , etc .
Animals surround us in advertisements , nature , stories and fables .
" Humans tend to anthropomorphise as a way of understanding and interpreting the world around us .
Furries just take this interest a bit further than most people . "
But a small minority take it further still - believing they are animals trapped in human bodies , or consider themselves to be part animal .
A study by Ms Gerbasi at one furry convention found about a quarter of the participants did not consider themselves 100 % human .
She is currently researching this in relation to gender identity disorder , when people feel they are the wrong sex and trapped in the wrong body .
She says currently unpublished data supports the hypothesis that there are similarities .
She is calling it species identity disorder .
' Mystified '
Feeling you are part- animal is unusual , she admits , although " for most , the furry fandom is a hobby and like Star Trek fans or such " .
Of course , there 's nothing new about people donning animal costumes for a spot of fun .
But Furryism , as a pursuit in its own right , grew out of science fiction and comic book conventions in the 1980s , says furry historian Fred Patten .
FURRY GLOSSARY Fursona - furry persona Plushie - person who loves cuddly toys Fleshie - a non furry Fursuiters - People who dress in animal costumes Yiff - furry porn Skritching - scratching and grooming Small room parties were held at such events in the UK and US for fans of animated cartoons with animal characters .
But it really came of age with the internet in the 1990s and today is an internet community first and foremost , says Mr Merlino .
Conventions are held around the world and some have attracted have up to 3,000 furries .
In the UK the scene is very active , says Mr Wolf .
There are locals groups and two annual conventions , in London and Manchester , with another planned for Inverness .
For a long time it was a male - dominated scene , but many more women are now involved .
" There are still way more male furries than female ones , but the number of girls is growing slowly , " says furry artist TaniDaReal ( her furry pseudonym ) , a 29 - year - old media designer from Germany .
' Mystified '
" On art galleries , I 'd say the gender ratio is pretty balanced .
A lot of the furry artists are female . "
Very little research has been done on the furry world .
This is probably because many behavioural scientists are not really aware of their existence , says Ms Gerbasi .
The Lenya costume was handmade " When I presented an interactive session at an identity conference in 2007 people were mystified , " she says .
" If you tell people about furries they often think you are kidding or making it up .
Also , due to bad publicity , furries have not been cooperative about being studied . "
Furries argue it is the persistent misconceptions about them that keeps the scene private .
" The big misconception is that most furries are mainly obsessed with sex , " says Mr Wolf .
" While there is pornography in the fandom - ' yiff ' as it is known - it is only a small part . "
So what do they say when someone thinks being a furry is weird ?
" I would say that we are just free thinkers who let our minds expand to create these weird and wonderful characters , " says Mr Wolf .
Below is a selection of your comments .
As a fursuiter myself , I find the condescending tone of this piece a little distasteful .
At the end of the day , what is wrong with like - minded individuals dressing up and having fun ?
Lennard Owen , Leeds , West Yorkshire
If they are n't hurting anyone - why make a fuss .
it sounds a very nice and innocent lifestyle which I suppose many people will consider weird thus somehow perverted .
Live and let live .
Dave , Kidderminster From what I 've seen here and elsewhere about furries , they are n't dressing up like animals , they 're dressing up like cartoon characters and plush toys .
Most costumes , while charming and clever , owe more to Arthur Rackham - inspired Disney or to Japanese anime .
As anyone who has dressed up for Halloween knows , wearing a costume gives us license to behave in ways we might not otherwise .
But this whole business of animals being friendlier is silly .
A license to touch and hug ?
Hmmm .
Ca n't imagine a wolf giving a hug to a fox .
A cat is more likely to bite the head off a rabbit than groom it .
Ellen , New Haven , CT
Has anybody noticed that turning into an animal , or having the powers of an animal , or having a totem animal is almost universal in all known tribalisitc , pre-written and shamanistic cultures .
And that Brer Rabbit ( Brother Rabbit ) and other humanistic , talking , animals are common throughout the world 's folktales and oral cultural mythology .
So dressing up as an animal , and pretending to have fur , is merely a modern take on an extremely common and ancient human pastime .
Alisdair Budd , Southend
There are a lot more people creating furry art than wearing fursuits in the fandom .
The art ranges from really beautiful , detailed portraits of furry characters to humorous cartoons done in all sorts of offbeat personal styles .
But 99 % of these articles focus almost exclusively on the fursuiters , leading most people to think EVERY furry wears a suit .
Joe Strike , New York NY US
It is important to note that not all furries are fursuiters .
In fact , quite a few of us think they 're a bit ... odd .
Most of us just think Werewolf , Catgirl , etc art and the like is neat looking .
I think it 's a bit much to try and link it to fetishism or other such stuff .
That would be like saying all Japanese Animation fans are Kigurumi ( " masked cosplay " ) fetishists .
KiTA , Twin Falls , ID , US I consider myself " fursona " to be a mixture of a Lion and a Bunny , these are traits of my personality and emotional states that I identify with .
I consider the fandom no more different than any other fandom .
I was introduced to the wider fandom though Second Life , and have progressively developed my " fursona " , I have found true warm accepting friendship within the furrie community unbound by normal constraints .
Steam Bunjie , Westhoughton Personally I love being a fur as it allows me to express my personality in a way that is not possible in mainstream society .
As such it is incredibly liberating and has taught me a lot about myself and others , as well as rekindling my interest in art .
I would also like to add that I have also learnt from my character and incorporated some of his positive aspects into my own personality and thus make me a richer person overall .
Although he may not be real he lives in me and I believe I 'm a better person for it .
Sierus the Stalion , Brighton I always liked the idea of wearing a cat suit and got my chance at a fancy dress ball .
Unfortunately it was a once in a life time experience , it was so baking hot in that blasted suit that I nearly passed out .
Now I restrict fur wearing to gloves , it gives me a superb tactile feeling when I put them on .
Does that make me a furry ?
Dahlia , London
If people want to dress up as animals etc then let them , it 's not harming anybody else .
Kayleigh Clarke , Beccles I start by saying that I am not nor do I have any interest in being a Furry .
However I am incensed that the media has once again branded a section of society by the actions of two individuals .
Had the two murder plotters been reporters , model makers , stamp collectors , BBC website readers or children 's entertainers would the link have been made to their career or hobby ?
I very much doubt it .
So people dress as animals with human traits , so what ?
The fact that two of those people are somewhat mentally unhinged is a coincidence .
Maybe their common interest brought them together but would it have been reported if the common interest was more common ?
I doubt it !
Amateur reporting twaddle .
Rob , Newbury , Berkshire Rob , a more complete misreading of an article is hard to conceive .
It notes that the furry community would not be pleased by the association with the court case , but people nevertheless are interested in it .
The article attempts in a limited way to describe the community and links to websites that give more information .
The furry community is a curiosity to most and the article is pitched at them , not at those who already know something .
This is reasonable , draws no negative conclusions about the community and tries to broaden knowledge and understanding .
Gavin , Cornwall
I for one really likes this article , as a member of the furry fandom it was nice to see an article that was balanced and informative .
The scene is varied and fun to be part of , we are just normal people with an interest in something different .
Far too often is the sexual misconception overplayed in articles and it was nice to see a balanced article .
James Shilingis , Colchester , Essex I hate to burst the bubble of this hard - researched article , but I 'm going to have to point out that everything that you see before you - the entire furry fluffy scene - is n't really a pop culture movement at all , it 's just a sub genre of a much large movement called Cosplay ( Short for Costume Play ) that originates in Japan .
While furries may be an acquired taste in the UK and US , Cosplay is considered a mainstream hobby in Japan .
It 's sort of like being a Trekkie .
Furries are just Cosplay enthusiasts who dress up as furry animals , whereas pure Cosplay enthusiasts dress up and / or role play in all manner of costumes , from established cartoon and video game characters to their own creation .
Both of the furry kind , and of the not so furry kind .
Reader
The real - life meets are always fun , and you get to connect with many like - minded people .
It 's given me some of my best friends , and some of my worst enemies , but I would do it all over again .
TwoTailedFox , Southend - on - Sea
There 's nothing weird about people dressing up as animals , why 's it different to any other hobby ?
When I get my costume on I feel far more comfortable and will often wear my tail at work to help me relax .
My colleagues do n't seem to mind .
Trisha Storey , aka Bitsy the Space Kitten , United Fluffdom I 'm not a fursuiter but I do like drawing furry art .
I agree with Lennard Owen , a little condescending , but it's an interesting article .
DJF , Preston Nothing wrong with this sort of behaviour - as long as they stay off the furniture and do n't scratch the wallpaper .
Vital Spark
All a bit of harmless fun and then Ms Gerbasi coins " Species Identity Disorder " .
That is a virulent term which will serve to lend legitimacy to a deranged minority of this subculture .
These people are not the " wrong species " and should not be given any reason to think that the positive feelings that they get when wearing a fursuit makes this so .
If somebody was genuinely an " animal inside a human body " , then they would be stark naked , defecating in public and fighting each other over the right to procreate , presumably with members of their true species .
The real reason why people feel liberated in those fursuits is quite obviously because they provide the wearer with anonymity , allowing them to have ( non-sexual ) physical contact with other HUMANS .
They should just arrange to hug each other without the suits .

Tell us a little about yourself and what you do for a living for our readers .
Any good geeky hobbies ?
Let ’s see – I graduated from Cornell in the spring with a self - made major in Interactive Media Design ( read : Games ) and three related minors .
I started Proper Walrus , the company that produced Tipoli , immediately after in addition to my full time job at ActionXL where I do production and design on motion - based games .
Less - relevant but possibly more interesting / embarrassing tidbits : I ’m obsessed with electric bagpipe music , the color orange ( so underloved ) and A &W chili cheese fries .
I have a 6 month old Keeshond puppy named Koru that I really enjoy dressing up as a banana .
Geeky hobbies : I collect chessex dice – the 7 piece sets .
My first set was “ Festive Green w/ Silver ” and I ’ve got a dozen more since .
My goal is the brushed steel set – someday .
I , of course , use the dice to play copious amounts of D&D and other RPGs , both classic table top and digital ( my newest one is on Google Wave ) .
I love language , too , and had a habit of creating them as a child that led to three semesters of Sanskrit in college .
Bho bhoh , dhurta !
( It means : Ho there , rogue ! — admittedly , Sanskrit is not the most practical of languages ) .
Tell us about Tipoli !
Well that ’s not an open question !
Okay , Tipoli is a love story .
I mean , game .
No , I actually mean love story .
As much as every marketing type person is telling me to call it a game , because people wo n’t “ get ” the love story thing , Tipoli is , at heart ( lulz ) , a love story .
Tipoli is about two faces , Mint and Periwinkle .
Mint is sad , lackluster , disappointed ; Periwinkle is cheerful , bouncy , and optimistic .
They ’re both trying to find love , and that ’s the point of the game .
They ’re stuck together , one but not the same .
Mint keeps
Periwinkle grounded , prevents the purply sphere from spinning away into oblivion .
At the same time , Periwinkle is the only reason Mint can move at all .
They only work because they ’re together .
It ’s not perfect , they ’re not madly in love , but they do revolve around each other , and , with a little bit of player help , they do move through life .
What starts as a single unrequited heart coursing from Periwinkle to Mint eventually becomes a constant stream flowing back and forth between them , carrying them to the end of their day and into dreams .
I wanted to tell a powerful , realistic story about relationships , but I wanted to do it without words , through the nuance of character behavior and graphic effect .
As much as Tipoli is an exercise in minimal input , it ’s an endeavor to discover how to convey feeling and evoke emotions using the one asset that sets games apart from every other classic medium : the interaction .
Buuut since that might not be legit , here ’s the classic answer :
Tipoli is a game you play with one button .
Just one .
Tap the screen and the sticky and bouncy ball swap places .
That ’s it .
Simple ?
Yes .
Easy ?
Only for a little while .
Based on timing and the objects around the pair , they can walk , jump , bounce , hop up walls or crawl under ceilings .
Spinning orbs can fling them closer to their goals or they can hop on Cloud9 and soar skyward .
It ’s amazing what you can do with just a tap , and we ’re extremely proud of how unique the movement and physics are .
Tipoli also has a hand - painted art style and symphonic soundtrack that add to the dream - like vibe – like you ’re stuck in a fairy tale but it ’s not all sugar and mush .
We were trying to get away from the last - minute - addition sound of typical games and create a style that people could identify as uniquely Tipoli .
Can you tell us about the origins of Tipoli ?
What inspired it and how did it come into existence ?
Tipoli came about as a result of a 48 hour game jam in Albany , at RPI , where Team Fling !
Monkey ( Richard Hough , Chelsea Howe , Matthew Olivo , Franklin Pride , Michael Goddard ) made a game cheekily called The Illusory Persistence of LOVE .
With the aforementioned theme , I decided I wanted something involving orbiting objects , things partnered and spinning .
Richard suggested having one sticky and the other bouncy and from there Tipoli cascaded into life .
The core mechanics did n’t change at all over the next 11 months , but we added five new background tracks , 50 + new levels , and several new physics objects to make the game more involved and interesting and see just how much we could do with 1 button .
Have you worked on any other projects similar to this ?
Since I had the privilege of designing my own major , I integrated an independent game design project every semester for six semesters .
One of the joys of a university or part time development gig is that you can take HUGE risks , so I always tried to do something experimental .
In Tipoli , it was using the very minimal controls , embracing a pastel , soft art style that ’s quite atypical of classic gamer taste , and incorporating a love story without any overt textual narrative or dialogue .
I worked on another game called Music Monsters that took player - generated MIDI data and used it to create a character or boost a character that the player could then play through a mario - esque platformer .
The higher notes you play , the bigger your character ’s wings , the more sixteenth notes , the faster the character moves , and so on .
I think the other big experimental move I made was in Symbiosis , which was a networked game where the players could n’t text , chat , or video .
I wanted to find a way to minimize the out of character and aggressive / immature behavior that normally happens in MMOs , so we created a super tiny language of character gestures ( four , to be exact ) that was the only way for the characters to communicate .
They could n’t get through the game without working together , so it was really an exercise in cooperation instead of competition and contextual communication .
From concept to launch , how long did it take to make Tipoli ?
Eleven months .
Tipoli was born on January 30th to the thematic cry of “ As long as we ’re together we ’ll never run out of problems ” – the official theme of the First Annual Global Game Jam , where me and four other students made TIPOL – The Illusory Persistence of LOVE .
Richard Hough , Tipoli ‘s programmer , and I decided to take TIPOL a step further .
We worked on it as an independent study and received a publishing contract the day after graduation .
From there , we brought on another artist , Michael Molinari , and 6 months down the road , Tipoli was in stores !
When you ’re running low in inspiration for design , where do you go / what do you do to refresh the design batteries ?
I love going for walks or hikes , and taking naps has also been surprisingly fruitful .
Sometimes , at work , I ’ll hide on the floor under my desk and close my eyes for a few minutes just to let myself dream .
The other thing I like to do is build constraints – hone in on a specific design aspect ( orbiting physics , hidden information or flocking algorithms , for instance ) and approach it from as many angles as I can .
I also get a kick out of reading science fiction and fantasy short stories .
Good writing is pretty lacking in the industry , so reading an engaging book or even checking out an art museum is really refreshing .
No pixels !
Will you be making any more iphone games after this ?
If so , what type ?
Definitely !
I ca n’t not make games , and the iPhone is a very accessible platform , especially with Unity3D .
My next game ’s going to revolve around music and how synchrony can affect emotions in games .
It was actually a topic on my thesis that I researched , and I want to put all that experiment data to good use .
That ’s all I can say for now !
What was the hardest part about the design and implementation process ?
What was the easiest ?
The hardest part was definitely staying in communication with everyone .
Our programmer moved to California , I was in upstate New York , and our artist was in New Jersey .
On top of that , this was part time for all of us , and some of us had extremely taxing full time jobs to worry about .
Keeping everyone active and up to date was a constant challenge .
The easiest part of the design process ?
Hmm …
I really enjoyed the level design and testing out how the physics worked .
It was great fun watching all the bizarre things that can happen if you just mash the button , for instance .
Sometimes a crazy mistake will actually land you exactly where you wanted to be , albeit somewhat circuitously ; I ’ve done some fantastic tricks !
What did you want in the game that did n’t make the final cut ?
I wanted more narrative told through the mechanics .
One of the ideas I loved originally was to really harp on Mint and Periwinkle ’s relationship .
I wanted , for instance , to have a broken heart object that would “ snap ” their connection .
I even thought about having other spheres with different properties !
( Peach , Cornflower , Cream ? )
What would happen if Periwinkle found someone else ?
And how would you put Mint and Periwinkle back together again ?
What games are you playing right now ?
If you could take one game and put it on the iphone , what would it be ?
If you could take an iphone game and put it on a console / PC , what would it be ?
This is going to sound so bad , but I actually do n’t have any games on my iPhone .
My friend JUST gave me a code for Cathy ’s Book , which is an interactive multimedia mystery app – pretty cool – but that ’s it .
Other than that , I finished Assassin ’s Creed II ( 100 % complete six days after release ! ) and am crushing on Ezio , tested out NSMBWii , and just brought out Mirror ’s Edge to celebrate its birthday by beating hard mode .
Mirror ’s Edge – there ’s something that would be interesting on iPho– oh wait , it ’s already out and I just did n’t know about it .
Clearly I ’m a sucker for free - running games !

What , you thought you were safe ?
You ’d get through the big “ Cancel Culture ” war without me popping off ?
No such luck .
Public morality should be pretty simple .
When an oppressed group gets enough power to make its oppressors behave , they will do so — and they should .
The real problem , the kind of thing that would make De Niro in Casino groan , “ Amateur night ! ” , starts when people imagine that they can stop immoral behavior by policing immoral characters , phrases , or scenes in literature .
They ’re looking for the wrong thing .
They ’re sniffing for depictions of immorality , when they should be scanning the silences , the evasions .
There ’s a very naïve theory of language at work here , roughly : “ if people speak nicely , they ’ll act nicely ” — with the fatuous corollary , “ If people mention bad things , they must like bad things . ”
The simplest refutation of that is two words : Victorian Britain .
Victorian Britain carried out several of the biggest genocides in human history .
It was also a high point of virtuous literature .
Because they were smart about language .
They did n’t rant about the evil of their victims or gloat about massacring them , at least not in their public writings .
They wrote virtuous novels , virtuous poems .
And left a body count which may well end up the biggest in world history .
Open genocidal ranting is small - time stuff compared to the rhetorical nuke perfected by Victoria ’s genocidaires : silence .
The Victorian Empire was the high point of this technology , which is why it still gets a pass most of the time .
Even when someone takes it on and scores a direct hit , as Mike Davis did in his book Late Victorian Holocausts , the cone of Anglosphere silence contains and muffles the explosion .
Which is why Late Victorian Holocausts is Davis ’s only book that did n’t become a best - seller .
Davis was among the first historians with the guts and originality to look hard at some of the Victorian creeps who killed tens of millions — yes , tens of millions — of people from the conquered tropics :
“ The total human toll of these three waves of drought , famine , and disease could not have been less than 30 million victims .
Fifty million dead might not be unrealistic . ”
An English radical of the Victorian Era , William Digby , saw the scope of the horror : “ When the part played by the British Empire in the nineteenth century is regarded by the historian fifty years hence , the unnecessary deaths of millions of Indians would be its principal and most notorious monument . ”
But that did n’t happen .
There was no wave of conscience among historians of the British Empire in the 1920s ( or 30s or 40s or , to end the suspense , ever . )
Davis puts it bluntly : “ [ T ] he famine children of 1876 and 1899 have disappeared . ”
How did this happen ?
Why is it still happening ?
What are the lessons for those studying literature , propaganda , and ideology ?
They ’re very grim lessons , as it happens .
While grad students comb texts for improper remarks , they miss the real point : the vast silence , and the paint - job of virtue that helps distract us .
Ideology does n’t seem to do any good at clearing away the bigotry of Imperial history .
Charles Kingsley , prominent novelist of mid-nineteenth - century Britain , was honored as promoter of socialist causes — while he wrote in letters to his wife about his loathing for the “ white chimpanzees ” whose corpses were littering the roadside when he visited Sligo during the Famine in the 1840s .
We go to his Wiki for a quick bio of Kingsley , and the first thing we find is “ working men ’s socialism . ”
Sounds good , right ?
Not if you ’ve steeped yourself in the vile culture of mid-19th c. Britain .
It sounds like boasting maybe , but it ’s the simple truth : as soon as I saw that subhead , I KNEW , for certain , that Kingsley must have hated the Irish .
And sure enough , there ’s a whole subhead on his “ Virulent Dislike of the Irish ” :
Virulent dislike of the Irish
Kingsley was accused of racism towards the Roman Catholic Irish poor and described Irish people in rabid and virulent terms .
Visiting County Sligo , Ireland , he wrote a letter to his wife from Markree Castle in 1860 : “ I am haunted by the human chimpanzees I saw along that hundred miles of horrible country [ Ireland ] … to see white chimpanzees is dreadful ; if they were black one would not see it so much , but their skins , except where tanned by exposure , are as white as ours . ”
Kingsley statue in Devon .
Never to be kissed by sledgehammer , because the only historical conscience the UK has is imported from the US , where no one ’s even heard of Kingsley .
Someday ( not in my lifetime ) , the UK Left will have to deal with this stuff .
Your movement comes straight out of Cromwell , the Gordon Street rioters , and the Baptists , all steeped in ethnic / sectarian hate .
I ’m not telling you what to do , but noticing that fact would be a start .
Kingsley wrote several best - sellers after the Great Famine .
It should n’t come as a surprise that none of them have anything to do with the Famine .
These people were cunning , if mediocre ; they saved the bile for private letters about “ white chimpanzees . ”
But it ’s easy to dismiss Kingsley as a middlebrow entertainer .
Let ’s take a far more serious case : Eric Hobsbawm , still revered as canonical Marxist historian of the UK .
As Davis notes , Hobsbawm does “ mention ” the Irish Famine , but — and if any phrase ever deserves to be written in all - caps , this phrase from Late Victorian Holocausts does : “ Hobsbawm … makes no allusion in his famous trilogy on nineteenth - century history to the worst famines in perhaps 500 years in India and China . ”
There are no excuses for this .
There are reasons , but as the song says , “ It does n’t make it all right . ”
Still , once the rage passes and you stop clenching your jaw ’ til it aches , there are reasons .
Most of all , there ’s a deep Imperial skill in the trope of silence .
The stupid Nazis ranted and raved and lasted 13 years , then got completely destroyed .
The Empire kept its rants for private letters , passed on to a guild of coopted historians , pundits , and publishers — and has never been called to account .
Maybe it never will be .
That poor optimist radical Davis mentions thought the exposé would be big news by 1925 .
Well , it ’s 2020 , and the Empire is still remembered fondly .
Victoria herself is a beloved figure all over again .
Silence is the only really effective PR for a genocide , and the nature of artificial famines , as opposed to mass executions , makes silence particularly effective .
Famines , most people still believe , are acts of God , or matters of chance , or perhaps ( under their breath ) the result of the sheer fecklessness of the victims , for being Papists as in Ireland , or Hindus as in India , or Muslims as in contemporary Somalia .
After all , the Empire was n’t standing people up against a wall and shooting them ( except sometimes , as in Kenya , and the Empire handled that by putting the records on ships and dropping them into the Indian Ocean . )
Silence , not Nazi - style boasting .
That ’s the key .
We should be looking for omissions , not gaffes .
Gaffes are for hicks like Hitler .
Silence is the grown - up way to hide vast genocides .
The key to effective silence is to coopt , not alienate , your intelligentsia .
The hick Nazis drove out or killed their intellectuals ; the Empire suborned and coddled its writers and poets , often promoting those of little talent ( whose works are still vaguely canonical ) , adding intellectual insecurity as another motive for collusion .
Tennyson makes a good start here .
Anybody associate Tennyson with genocide ?
Did n’t think so .
He never mentioned it — in his canonical writings .
He and Victoria were neighbors , chums , and he won every honor the Empire could bestow , despite being by general consent the stupidest “ major ” poet in the canon .
You ’d never link Tennyson to genocide , until you look at his private letters and his friends ’ memoirs .
Then you see the perfect melding of silence and violent hatred , as in Kingsley , as in case after case after case that you never hear about — and if you do dare to mention one of the cases , will get you a grumpy , “ Oh yes , we know about all that , they held some pretty objectionable opinions , as was common at the time … ” ( I wish I could do the inflection on “ pretty objectionable . ”
It ’s one you hear often among Commonweath academics , especially after the second drink . )
I once read Tennyson ’s letters and found to my shock that he had visited Famine Ireland .
Even in his letters there is not one mention of the dead .
What you do get is a set of rules he laid down , as a celebrity , to his hosts as he made his way from one vampire castle to the next ( never mind Mark Fisher , these guys were the real thing ) : he was not to be spoken to about “ Irish distress , ” and the window shades of the carriages in which he rode from one Ascendancy manse to another were to be kept completely shut , lest he see the bodies .
You can see why Bram Stoker , a minor Ascendancy Igor , did his best to move Nosferatu as far to the east and south as he could .
As poor Byron , the one real hero of British literature , pointed out , the “ moral North ” always preferred to place evil as far to the east and south of Britain as it could .
So I read these letters in New Zealand and wrote to the leading Tennyson biographer , asking , “ Can you explain to me why you ’ve never written on Tennyson ’s visit to Ireland ? ”
He replied , “ I suppose (! ) because Tennyson never mentioned it . ”
That , folks , is how you cover up a genocide .
It ’s leaked a little in the 170 years since it was successfully carried out .
But it lasted longer than any other cursed tomb in history .
Nowhere — not in Dublin , not in London — was there any commemoration of the Famine on its 50th anniversary in 1897 , or its hundredth in 1947 .
In 1998 Blair gave a very carefully - worded quasi-apology , and I still remember Jeremy Clarkson ’s response : “ I see Blair has apologized to the Irish for poisoning their potatoes . ”
In short , this method works .
We are its products ; we live in the delusion it created , and like it or not , Hobsbawm and a host of other Igors have that blood on their hands along with the outright vampires .
Sometimes you end up angrier at the Igors than the Nosferatus .
So the key to radio silence over a genocide is cooption — very , very literal , straightforward cooption .
The best candidates are novelists and poets , especially mediocre ones .
Many imperial officials moonlighted in both the active ( killing ) part of the genocides , and the passive PR side .
Many were very popular writers , and all their doorstop books were virtuous , virtuous , oh so virtuous .
The vilest of the lot , perhaps , was Robert Bulwer - Lytton , First Earl of Lytton , the Famine Queen ’s fave poet , whom she pushed for the post of Viceroy to India .
After getting the post in 1876 , Lytton presided over artificial famines that killed tens of millions of Asians .
No one outside India seems to mind , or even remember , that side of his life .
He is remembered only as the son of Edward Bulwer - Lytton , the cuddly old silly who wrote “ It was a dark and stormy night , ” the inspiration of those “ Worst Opening Sentence ” competitions .
Lytton ’s novelist father was a monster too , but he could only terrorize his family and servants .
As Viceroy to India , his poet son was able to inflict , and then cover up , misery on a much more vast scale .
As Mike Davis says :
“ The Central Government [ of British India ] under the leadership of Queen Victoria ’s leading poet , Lord Lytton , vehemently opposed efforts …to stockpile grain or otherwise interfere with market forces .
All through the Autumn of 1876 , while the kharif crop was withering in the fields …
Lytton had been absorbed in organizing the immense Imperial Assemblage in Delhi to proclaim Victoria Empress of India ( Kaiser - e - Hind ) .
As The Times [ of London ] ’s special correspondent described it , ‘ The Viceroy seemed to have made the tales of Arabian fiction come true … nothing was too rich , nothing too costly . ’
[ This feast ] ‘ achieved the two criteria [ set for Lytton ] , of being ‘ gaudy enough to impress the orientals ’ and …a pageant which hid the nakedness of the sword on which we really rely . ’
An English journalist later estimated that 100,000 of the Queen - Empress ’s subjects starved to death … in the course of Lytton ’s spectacular durbar . ”
But do n’t expect to find anything in Lytton ’s poems about these artificial famines .
He was n’t that dumb .
The poems are astoundingly dull , and the most surprising thing about the repeated charges of plagiarism that were made against them is that Lytton could steal so much decent poetry and make such complete crap out of it .
Well , he was an Earl , Victoria swooned for him , and above all , he had no more conscience than a weasel .
In short , he was the man for his time and place .
He fit right in there — because the Victorian elite were unquestionably the worst human beings who ever lived .
“ Including the Nazis ? ” Yes .
No contest , once the Indian and Chinese intelligentsia give us what we ’ve never had : an accurate body count for Victoria ’s Empire .
Or , if you prefer , consider the timelines : Nazis , 13 years in power ; Britain ’s tropical genocides , a century at least .
What do you find , then , when you look for literary “ clues to the horror ” in Lytton ’s poetry ?
Nothing .
English - Department products will never admit that , if only because it precludes all sorts of Blackadder - level cunning that find all sorts of secret guilt in unlikely places like Wuthering fucking Heights .
( Sorry Terry Eagleton , you probably meant well . )
These people had no conscience .
Do n’t waste time looking for one .
Here ’s a sample of the endless “ novel in verse ” Lytton wrote ( under the pseudonym “ Owen Meredith ” — not to be confused with George Meredith , a talented poet and radical who does n’t deserve the shame of being taken for Lytton ) .
You really do n’t need more than a sample of Lytton ’s vaporous drone .
Read it and sleep :
But scarce had the nomad unfurl’d
His wandering tent at Mysore , in the smile
Of a Rajah ( whose court he controll ’d for a while ,
And whose council he prompted and govern’d by stealth ) ;
Scarce , indeed , had he wedded an Indian of wealth ,
Who died giving birth to this daughter , before
He was borne to the tomb of his wife at Mysore .
His fortune , which fell to his orphan , perchance
Had secured her a home with his sister in France ,
A lone woman , the last of the race left .
Lucile
Neither felt , nor affected , the wish to conceal
The half - Eastern blood , which appear ’d to bequeath
( Reveal ’d now and then , though but rarely , beneath
That outward repose that concealed it in her )
A something half wild to her strange character .
The nurse with the orphan , awhile broken - hearted ,
At the door of a convent in Paris had parted .
But later , once more , with her mistress she tarried ,
When the girl , by that grim maiden aunt , had been married
To a dreary old Count , who had sullenly died ,
With no claim on her tears — she had wept as a bride .
Said Lord Alfred , “ Your mistress expects me . ”
The crone
Oped the drawing - room door , and there left him alone .
There was a time when I could have spun a cunning hermeneutic web here , revealing the scandalous insight that in this passage , the “ Indian of wealth ” has only one purpose : to die , leaving her wealth to that white guy .
But that ’s grad - school crap , deserving no more than a Butthead “ Well DUH , dumbass ! ”
Orientalism has made a lot of careers and missed the big point .
That ’s not the real work of poems like this .
Their real point is to exist .
It ’s to be long , to be maudlin , and to be inoffensive to the original audience .
You wo n’t find gloating , you wo n’t see death ’s heads on every officer ’s cap .
That stuff was for the Nazis , who were hicks themselves .
The pro’s , like Lord Lytton , wrote virtuous , vapory blather like this .
Reams of it .
Best smoke - screen a genocidaire could want .
Lytton let 6 or 7 million peasants starve , in what had been the rice bowl of the world , for reasons which will sound familiar to readers familiar with the work of Amartya Sen — ideological , “ free - market ” decisions that somehow always managed to wipe out populations which had been annoying the Empire .
BTW , you can see classic port - sipping Donnish rage in sites reacting to Sen ’s work , like this one .
Lytton ’s callousness has been ascribed , when it gets mentioned at all , to the fact that he was a lunatic , an opium addict , a lifelong jerk , etc .
He was all those things , but you ’re playing into the hands of the Imperial rear guard ( HQ Oxbridge and London ) if you start pondering individual psychology .
As Davis says ,
“ [ I ] n adopting a strict laissez - faire approach to famine , Lytton , demented or not … [ was ] only repeating orthodox catechism …
He issued strict , ‘ semi-theological ’ orders that ‘ there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of the Government with the object of reducing the price of food , ’ and in his letters home to the India Office and to politicians of both parties , he denounced ‘ humanitarian hysterics .
’… By official dictate , India like Ireland before it had become a Utilitarian laboratory … Grain merchants , in fact , preferred to export a record 6.4 cwt of wheat to Europe in 1877 - 78 rather than relieve starvation in India . ”
“ As in Ireland ” indeed .
The parallels between India after the 1857 “ Mutiny ” and Ireland after repeated rebellions are obvious , and have been pointed out many times .
In both cases it was not simply free enterprise dogma that doomed the victims : both populations were seen , bluntly put , as vermin , and many officials were not shy about saying God Himself was taking a hand to rid the Empire of them .
Indian intellectuals , from Sen onward , have been much braver than most victims in dealing with Imperial hatred of their ancestors .
After the 1857 rebellion in India was crushed , the whole culture of the Raj changed .
Many early 19th c. British occupiers had dabbled in local cultures , but after 1857 , this was derided as “ going native . ”
Instead of pre-Victorian eccentrics , often brilliant and downright weird , the Raj snapped into line hard and demanded laconic , effectual mediocrity — men of few words and fewer thoughts , “ men of action ” whose echoes you can still hear in Wodehouse characters ( always bad guys ) who are archly described as “ Empire - builders ” or “ the kind of man who made Britain what it is . ”
After the 1857 “ Mutiny ” , the Raj repented of its brief flirtation with the cultures of the Indian center and began recruiting “ frontier tribes , ” especially Pashtun , who had no loyalty to pre-Conquest India .
Once the Suez Canal was finished , Raj officials were able to live in a virtual Britain , dealing with Indians as little as possible :
“ British contacts with Indian society diminished in every respect ( fewer British men , for example , openly consorted with Indian women ) , and British sympathy for and understanding of Indian life and culture were , for the most part , replaced by suspicion , indifference , and fear . ”
I ’m going to deal with literary responses to the Irish Famine of the 1840s rather than the Indian famine of the 1870s , for two reasons — one lame , and one a little more plausible .
The lame one first : I know the literature of the 1840s and 50s better than that of the 1870s .
Now the reasonable one : the UK literary / intellectual world could claim ignorance of what was happening far away in India , but no one who could read a newspaper in London could claim not to know that a million people , fellow citizens of the UK , were dying in huge numbers just a few miles away .
So let ’s look at the best - sellers of that era — not like poor Eagleton , desperate to find some saving grace , but coldly , seeing , as Stevens would say , “ Nothing that is not there / And the nothing that is . ”
A little context , for those lucky enough not to have wasted years on this very Schopenhauerian story : there were bad crops in much of Europe in 1845 - 50 , but in most of the Continent , local organizations were able to provide some bare minimum of relief .
As Amartya Sen said , lethal famines happen when shortages strike populations with no power , either financial or political .
These are populations already hated by their rulers , and to put it bluntly , their rulers welcome the famines .
The tater , which had been imported from Peru by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century , were the perfect slave - food .
European peasants relied on the potato all across the northern tier , not just in Ireland .
Ever see that Van Gogh painting , “ The Potato - Eaters ” ?
The painting is from 1885 , almost 40 years after the Potato “ famine . ”
Europe ’s poorest returned to eating potatoes , the cuisine of no -choice .
What did their potato - eating ancestors in Flanders do when the 1840s blight came ?
They survived thanks to local organizations that were able to limit the harm caused by crop failures :
“ Flanders is a typical case where local communities carried the heaviest burden in organising and financing relief , control and repression activities .
In the crisis years about two - fifths of the people in the most affected areas received some form of communal aid .
In the Netherlands in 1847 18 % of the people were supported by local relief boards , against 13 % in 1840 - 1844 .
In some regions the numbers supported doubled .
In France expenditures of the local relief boards doubled between 1843 and 1847 , often financed by an extra ‘ poor tax ’ .
The same pattern is seen in South Germany . ”
In Flanders , in France , in Germany , those at risk were hated only in the relatively mild way that the rich always hated the poor — a hatred tempered by the fact that the elites saw these wretches as belonging to their own group .
Not so in Ireland , in the Highlands of Scotland ( which shared a history of stubborn Papism , a different language , and chronic rebellion ) — or India in the 1870s .
The British elite began to nourish a particular hatred of India , especially Hindu regions of India , after the 1857 Rebellion .
The uprising by supposedly loyal local auxiliaries drove the occupiers insane , in a way that would have been very familiar to any survivors of the Irish Famine of the 1840s .
In both cases , clever Imperial officials said nothing incriminating , but in the 1847 crisis , some high officials had not learned their lesson properly and said bluntly that any famine that wiped out a troublesome population was a good famine — sent by God , in fact .
Trevelyan , the official in charge of dealing with the crisis , said , “ The judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated . ”
They talked a lot about the “ moral evil of the people ” as the real cause of mass starvation , and said outright that ,
“ We must not complain of what we really want to obtain .
If small farmers go , and their landlords are reduced to sell portions of their estates to persons who will invest capital we shall at last arrive at something like a satisfactory settlement of the country . ”
What you see here is free - market ideology , yes — but you ca n’t make the mistake of dismissing ethnic hatred as unreal , therefore not a factor .
If free - market ideology had been as cold and rational as it claimed ( and still claims ) to be , poor people all over Britain would have been left to rot by the roads .
Ethnic hatred is real , and it exercises a real power over ruling elites ’ decisions .
There ’s a strain of Leftist intellectual inclined to deny this at all costs , in the way that abuse victims who get religion blame their rape memories and whip scars on “ Satan ” rather than their stepfather .
The “ socialist ” polemics of Charles Kingsley are an almost ridiculously clear example of the way ideology did NOT help any Imperial writers to see what was in front of their eyes .
What did Charles Kingsley offer to the British public in 1848 , when the Famine was wiping out the Irish - speaking peasantry ?
Ladies and Gentlemen , I offer you …drum roll … YEAST !
“ Motivated by his strong convictions as a Christian Socialist Kingsley wrote Yeast as an attack on Roman Catholicism and the Oxford Movement , on celibacy , the game laws , bad landlords and bad sanitation , and on the whole social system insofar as it kept England ’s agricultural labourer class in poverty .
The title was intended to suggest the ‘ ferment of new ideas ’ . ”
You have to admire , or flinch , at the sheer proto - Trumpian reversal here :
It ’s not that our Empire is wiping out a long - hated Papist peasantry via artificial famine ; it ’s the Papists who are ruining our agriculture back home in England !
Kingsley ’s novels contain no mention of “ white chimpanzees . ”
He had the Imperial method : save that stuff for letters to your wife .
His real work , and I wish to God people would see this , was to write sentimental , virtuous porridge .
Right through the Famine years , Kingsley wrote about every kind of maudlin nonsense he could find , the more meaningless the better .
He did NOT attempt to justify the genocide .
He dangled baubles in front of the popular audience instead .
How did Dickens deal with the Famine ?
Take a guess .
Yup :
“ What is truly remarkable is that in the sixteen novels of Dickens , there is not a single Irish character . ”
That quote is from a book written long ago , unknown now .
I ’m telling you — probably annoying you with my shrill insistence — that this method works .
No matter what that mush - headed crypto-Christian Terry Eagleton says , there is no trace of conscience in this list of popular novels from the Famine years or its aftermath .
The nun who wrote a summary of this literature back in 1939 was more honest and correct when she said : “ In the fiction of the nineteenth century by English novelists the Irishman is not a significant figure . ”
There .
That ’s the truth .
As opposed to , oh I do n’t know , yelping “ She said ‘ IrishMAN , ’ not ‘ person ! ” or sweating your guts out to find conscience in one of the Brontes ’ novels , rather than saying simply , as this dead nun did long ago , “ The works of the Bronte sisters are of imagination rather than life … ” and looking for historical conscience in those sequestered imaginations — often quite viciously xenophobic , as in the caricature of the Frenchwomen in Jane Eyre — is fatuous and frankly servile .
Let ’s go through a list — not my list , one I found online — of popular or ‘ important ’ novels from the Famine years and their aftermath :
1847
Charlotte Brontë Jane Eyre ______ Emily Brontë Wuthering Heights ______ Captain Frederick Marryat Children of the New Forest ______
1848
1849
1850
1851
1852
Wilkie Collins Basil : A Story of Modern Life ______ Charles Kingsley Phaeton ; or Loose Thoughts for Loose Thinkers ______
1853
1854
1855
… For 1847 , we have good ol ’ Wuthering Heights , an S&M classic but please , nothing whatsoever to do with the Famine ; Jane Eyre , another bondage classic with zip to say about all those dead peasants you could smell when the wind blew east from [ that place we do n’t mention ] .
1848 : Yeast , ’nuff said .
For 1849 , when every literature person knew about mass starvation in Ireland , we get two by Dickens , who as we know was so reform - minded that he never even mentioned the Irish ; and The Caxtons : A Family Picture by …Edward Bulwer - Lytton , the father of Robert , Lord Lytton .
Small world , Vampiria ( and not by accident ) .
Like dad , like son ; Edward was a monster like his son — but in prose .
The book is apparently light , comic , and utterly virtuous : “ Never before had Bulwer written with so light a touch and so gentle a humor , and this novel has been called the most brilliant and attractive of productions .
His gentle satire of certain phrases of political life was founded , doubtless , on actual experience . ”
1850 , when one might expect the genocide to be bruising tender hearts , gives us Kingsley in reformist mode with his expose of the clothing business , Cheap Clothes and Nasty .
I ’ve read this one ; it mentions the Irish briefly , listing their presence in England , takin ’ our jobs , as a result of sharp practices by merchants — not , of course , because of the suffering of the “ white chimpanzees ” he saw littering the roadside in Sligo .
1851 .
The Yeast keeps rising , which was clearly the Papists ’ fault , along with other things that need not be mentioned .
1852 : Kingsley again , and Wilkie Collins with Basil : A Story of Modern Life .
Basil is a good book to finish on .
You ’re welcome to consider the other novels for 1853 - 55 , but like the man said about the turtles , it ’s Kingsleys and Dickenses all the way down .
Basil is interesting because it , alone in this decade of virtuous silence , was not a virtuous novel .
Indeed , it had crimes in it , “ domestic horrors ” which so seared the minds of virtuous critics that they scolded Collins in his obituary , decades later , for writing it :
“ The Athenaeum … called Basil ‘ a tale of criminality , almost revolting from its domestic horrors ’ and the Westminster Review described it as ‘ absolutely disgusting ’ .
Mrs Oliphant later called the novel ‘ a revolting Story ’ and the critics harked back to it even in their obituaries of Collins . ”
Remember Basil , then .
Remember poor Basil , lone dinghy of evil in a sea of literary virtue .
Lone hint that there might be something not entirely virtuous in Britain .
And hated for its lack of virtue , while the masses of virtuous pose being emptied by the carriage - load over a mass grave were , and are still , found innocent .
My hope is in the South Asian intellectuals , who alone seem to grasp how this successful model of genocide works .
The Irish intelligentsia got gaslit , unfortunately , in the mid-Twentieth century and has not yet recovered .
Glory to Amartya Sen and those who follow him , and my sincere apologies for dwelling on the Irish version of hushed - up artificial famine .
The truth is , that ’s the literary - PR story I happen to know best .
You , in India , will write the true Black Book of the British Empire .
To the rest of us : stop looking for bad words .
Stop taking the Nazi hicks as your example of evil .
Remember Yemen .
It ’s virtuous silence and distraction we should fear .

People in the north - central part of the Canadian province of Ontario are digging out after one of the worst snow storms on record .
Some areas north of Toronto received as much as 100 centimetres of snow over the past three days .
The main highway through the region re-opened for the first time in days , but nearly all side roads remain closed , blocked by a thick blanket of snow , in some areas chest high .
More than 100,000 people have been affected by the storm , either cut off in smaller communities , or in their cottages , or stranded by the road closures .
In one town the mayor declared a snow emergency , shutting schools and businesses .
Officials say emergency road crews clearing roads are completely exhausted .
Officers at one police detachment said they could not see their parked patrol cars buried under the snow .
Police are also urging travellers to stay away from the region at least for the next couple of days .
Meanwhile , western Canada is in the grip of a cold snap with temperatures plummeting anywhere from - 40 to - 50 degrees Celsius .
The document reveals people from certain countries are always searched
The details of security procedures at US airports have been mistakenly posted online by the US Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
The document reveals which passengers are exempt from screening and that security can be reduced in peak hours .
Information which had been blacked out for security reasons was easily retrievable using ordinary software .
The TSA said there was no threat to security as the document was outdated , but that it took the issue seriously .
The document was posted on the TSA 's Federal Business Opportunity site in March , said the Associated Press news agency .
Its existence was reported in a blog , the Wandering Aramean , on Sunday , which pointed out that the blacked - out sections could easily be read .
Those sections cover information about which passengers should always be selected for extra screening unless specifically exempted , including people with passports from Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Syria , Somalia and other countries .
The document says that prosthetic devices , medical dressings , wheelchairs , scooters and surgical footwear may be exempt from screening for explosives at certain times .
It also says that at busy travel periods , screening procedures may at times be reduced to 25 % of normal levels and that properly accredited flight crew are not subject to restrictions on carrying liquids and gels on to aircraft .
Clark Kent Ervin , former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security , told ABC news the document was " an appalling and astounding breach of security that terrorists could easily exploit " .
But the TSA said that while it was taking the matter seriously the document itself was outdated and the public was not in danger .
In a statement , it said it had " many layers of security " to protect the public and had " appropriate measures in place to effectively screen passengers at airport security checkpoints nationwide " .

Why I Don’t Write About Sarah Palin ’s Facebook Posts
Created : December 23 , 2009 12:39 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Last week , PolitiFact.com announced its “ Lie of the Year ” : Sarah Palin ’s claim that the health care bill might create “ death panels ” that would kill elderly or disabled Americans .
It was a lie , the editors pointed out , because Palin ’s claim was based on a mangling ( by Michele Bachmann ) of false claims by Betsey McCaughey — that the bill would mandate end - of - life counseling , and that rationing would deny care based on “ level of productivity in society . ”
That phrase was Palin ’s invention .
Palin responded to the PolitiFact article with a post on her Facebook page , claiming that , actually , the CBO ’s assessment that it would be tough to cut the rate of increase in Medicare is the sort of thing she had been talking about all along .
That ’s obviously not true .
But political reporters are taking note , filing stories about what Palin wrote that do n’t add much more context .
I really think this is a humiliating exercise .
The problem is that Palin has put the political press in a submissive position , one in which the only information it prints about her comes from prepared statements or from Q&As with friendly interviewers .
This is n’t something most politicians get away with , or would be allowed to get away with .
But Palin has leveraged her celebrity — her ability to get ratings , the ardor of her fans and the bitterness of her critics — to win a truly unique relationship with the press .
She is allowed to shape the public debate without actually engaging in it .
Let ’s take the example of her “ feud ” with Al Gore .
Palin ’s name appeared on a Dec. 9 op - ed in The Washington Post , calling on President Obama to boycott the Copenhagen climate talks because of the “ fraudulent scientific practices ” of climate scientists .
The next day , Andrea Mitchell interviewed Al Gore , author of a new book on scientific responses to climate change , and her very first question was about … Palin ’s op - ed .
When Gore answered with a blanket response to “ global warming deniers , ” Mitchell responded by quoting Palin again : “ One of the things that she has written recently on Facebook is that this is doomsday scare tactics pushed by an environmental priesthood that makes the public feel like owning an SUV is a sin against the planet . ”
Gore parried again , and moved on .
Palin responded to this with , yes , another Facebook post , one that was dutifully read aloud and reprinted .
“ He ’s wrong in calling me a ‘ denier , ” she wrote , even though Gore had rather adroitly shifted the question from Palin — whom reporters care about — to the rather large population of “ global warming deniers , ” whom he cares about .
In this Politico write - up of the “ feud , ” Andy Barr posted most of Palin ’s response without any kind of fact - check about her claims .
That ’s not Barr ’s fault .
The problem is with how Palin chose to engage the media .
While Gore submitted to an interview , on camera , Palin lent her name to a Facebook post .
I say “ lent her name ” because there is really no way of telling if Palin wrote the post — that ’s probably the biggest problem with the way Palin is using the media here , and the reason I choose not to engage with this stuff .
When the Gore “ feud ” really heated up , Laura Ingraham asked Palin whether she ’d debate the former vice president on climate change .
Among climate change skeptics ,
Gore ’s unwillingness to face someone like Lord Monckton in a public debate is a burning issue , presented as evidence that Gore ca n’t handle criticism .
When Ingraham posed the question , however , Palin rambled for a bit about how the format might bias Gore ’s “ friends ” against “ reasonable voices . ”
This was more than good enough for Ingraham .
INGRAHAM : But what if it ’s an Oxford - style , proper debate format .
I mean , he ’s going to chicken out .
I mean , if you challenge him to a debate , do you actually think he would accept it ?
PALIN : I do n’t know , I do n’t know .
Oh , he would n’t want to lower himself , I think , to , you know , my level to debate little old Sarah Palin from Wasilla .
So : Palin , having declined to engage Gore in any real - time discussion of climate change — having instead hid behind , basically , press releases — argued that Gore would n’t debate her anyway because he ’s either a chicken or because he ’s an elitist who looks down on her .
I think what Palin ’s doing here is incredibly savvy .
She knows that anything that goes out under her name will be accepted as fact by conservatives — “ Going Rogue ” was a 400 - page exercise in score - settling that identified , for Palin fans , everyone who ever did her wrong .
And she knows that liberals despise her and will pick apart everything that goes out under her name .
It was liberals , after all , who obsessed over the “ death panel ” claim , because for whatever reason they thought it was vitally important to prove that Palin was misleading people about what was in the health care bill .
At the same time , I think that the media ’s indulgence of Palin ’s strategy — which often results in pure stenography of press releases that may or may not have been written by her — is ridiculous , bordering on pathetic .
Fort Lauderdale , Florida ( CNN ) -- Sean Cononie bounded out of the back of an ambulance ahead of most of the other volunteers .
A bullhorn in his hand , he was , in a sense , the pied piper .
" If there 's anybody out here , that wants the swine flu vaccine , please come over here , " he said .
And come they did .
Outside Fort Lauderdale 's main library , a crowd started to build , and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the H1N1 vaccination .
" You stop spreading the germs , " Cononie said .
" Because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu , they get sick , they go into a gas station and use the bathroom , transfer those germs to a public bathroom , [ then ] mom and dad come in with little ones , use that bathroom -- boom .
Bingo .
Contagious .
Swine flu . "
The volunteers are with the Homeless Voice -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in Hollywood , Florida .
They 've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in Broward County .
They requested the vaccine through the Florida Department of Health to help part of a population that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls an at risk group .
Many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions , and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus .
So far , the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people
" Some have high blood pressure , some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu , the seasonal flu , and the swine flu , " said Dr. Chad Frank , a family practice physician who is a volunteer .
" We 're protecting them , and we 're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients , swine flu patients . "
Wearing a yellow reflective T - shirt , Frank spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort .
" I think it 's needed , " he said .
" And believe it or not , it 's fun .
That 's why I 'm a doctor . "
Russell Ahamed was one of the first people in line .
He lives in the park next to the library in downtown Fort Lauderdale .
The volunteers took his temperature to make sure he was n't running a fever and took his name down so he could be entered into a Department of Health database .
" I appreciate this .
There 's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this , " Ahamed said .
" I know people can die from [ the flu ] . "
But on this night , not everyone was able to get the shot .
William -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able .
Alcohol had gotten the best of him , and he could no longer stand .
Fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine , the volunteers would not give it to him .
Calmly , Cononie leaned down to talk to William , who was sitting on the grass , and explained why they could n't vaccinate him then .
" William , I 'm gonna put something in your bag .
It 's a piece of paper , " Cononie said .
" When you wake up in the morning , promise me you 're going to look for this piece of paper , OK ?
It says our phone number .
Call us in the morning .
We 'll come back and give you a shot when you 're a little more sober . "
William insisted , " I need the shot now . "
Cononie replied , " Well , we do n't think tonight 's a good night because you have a lot of alcohol in you . "
The volunteers , who travel with a police escort in case they encounter any situation they 're not equipped to handle , described the homeless as a forgotten population .
Lee Engels is newly homeless .
He lost his trailer and his construction job in Martin County , Florida , and headed south to Fort Lauderdale , he said .
He 's been homeless for three weeks , and he 's trying to stay sober .
" It 's tough out here , but it 's how you make it , " Engels said , rolling up his sleeve to get the vaccine injection .
The volunteers said there 's no way to know how much of an effect they are having in stopping the spread of H1N1 , but they believe they are doing a public service .
" A true blessing , " Engels agreed .
" You do n't have to go to a hospital and pay the bill . "
Kate Moss causes outrage with her Size Zero motto : Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels
Kate Moss has been accused of encouraging young girls to become anorexic after glorifying a ' size zero ' slogan .
The supermodel caused outrage by revealing that one of her mottos is the phrase ' nothing tastes as good as skinny feels ' .
The saying is a watchword for millions of anorexics and bulimia sufferers .
Blasted : Kate Moss claimed ' nothing tastes as good as skinny feels '
Moss made the comments in an interview with fashion website WWD .
Asked if she had any mottos , Miss Moss said : ' There are loads .
There 's " Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels " .
That 's one of them . '
She later tried to qualify the remark , adding : ' You try and remember , but it never works . '
The saying is believed to have originated from some early WeightWatchers members but is now commonly used on numerous slimming websites and blogs around the world .
One such site , caloriecount.about.com , carries the post : ' Cuz a donut does n't taste as good as skinny feels . '
Blasted : Kate , seen with boyfriend Jamie
Hince this week , has been criticised for her remarks , which are also used as the motto of pro-anorexia websites
Last night , model Katie Green - who four months ago launched the Say No To Size Zero campaign - said : ' There are 1.1 million eating disorders in the UK alone .
Kate Moss 's comments are likely to cause many more .
' If you read any of the proanorexia websites they go crazy for quotes like these . '
Miss Moss 's comments were also attacked by Denise Van Outen .
' Kate Moss is talking out of her size zero backside , ' she said .
The 35 - year - old TV presenter , who is pregnant , told The Sun : ' Having been in the industry for so long , she knows the impact her comment will have on vulnerable young women . '
She warned women against starving themselves , vowing : ' After I have my baby I 'll lose weight through healthy eating and exercise .
The sensible way .'
Miss Moss 's comment comes after a survey last month revealed that teenage girls are routinely missing two meals a day because they believe they need to lose weight .
It showed that 26 per cent of 14 - and 15 - year - olds often do n't eat breakfast , 22 per cent skip lunch and 10 per cent regularly go without either .
The study by the Exeter - based Schools Health Education Unit found that a majority of teenage girls - and 40 per cent of ten and 11 - year - olds - believed they needed to slim but few were actually overweight .

A Quick Glance at Using Linquify
Linquify is a complete business class solution for LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework data context management .
When using LINQ to SQL out of the box , one would need to make a series of complex calls to obtain a data context , save the object , and manage the data layer code .
LINQ to SQL classes can also be difficult to pass within an ASP .NET web application ’s Session .
Linquify simplifies the database object management with easy - to - use business objects , allowing you to perform functionality as follows :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 Person person = new Person ( ) ; person .
Load( 10 ) ; person .
FirstName = " John " ; person .
Save ( ) ; person .
LastName = " Doe " ; person .
Save ( ) ; person = new Person ( null , " John " , " Doe " ) ; person .
Save ( ) ; person = new Person ( 10 , " John " , " Doe " ) ; person .
Insert ( ) ; person .
WhereClause .ID = 10 ; List < Person > personList = person .
Find( ) ; foreach ( Person a Person in personList ) { a Person .
Delete( ) ; } person .
WhereClause .
MyWhere = " WHERE LastName LIKE '% Doe % ' " ; person .
WhereClause .
MyTop = " TOP 2 " ; List < Person > personList = person .
Find( ) ; foreach ( Person a Person in personList ) { ... } public partial class Person { public static Person GetTestPerson ( int id ) { using ( HelloWorld.DB.PersonContext context = new HelloWorld.DB.PersonContext ( ) ) { var result = from p in context .
Person where p.ID == id select p ; return new Person ( new BaseTypes.Person( result.ToList ( ) [ 0 ] ) ) ; } } } Person person = Person.GetTestPerson ( 10 ) ; person .
LastName " Doe Jr. " ; person .
Save ( ) ; myGridView.DataSource = person.ToList ( ) ; myGridView.DataBind ( ) ;
As you can see from the above code , the business classes make working with LINQ to SQL and the Entity Framework data contexts a breeze .
You have the option to utilize the built - in
Where clause on each business class or use LINQ syntax for safer and expressive querying .
Linquify also supports all primary key types , including Int , Guid , auto - incrementing , etc , when inserting new objects to the database .
Simply pass a null primary key to default to the auto - generated or auto - incremented value , as setup in the database table .
Linquify generates user partial classes , allowing you to easily extend the business objects with custom methods and custom LINQ queries , without affecting re-generation of business classes when the database table changes .
Embedding Business Objects
The Linquify business classes include overridable methods OnSave ( ) , OnSaveComplete ( ) , OnDelete ( ) , OnDeleteComplete( ) , OnInitializeComplete ( ) , allowing you to embed other business objects and load data as needed .
Extending and customizing the business objects can be done in the automatically generated partial classes .
For example :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 public partial class Person { public Address Address { get ; set ; } protected override void OnInitializeComplete ( ) { if ( Address Id != null && Address Id != Guid .
Empty ) { Address = new Address ( ) ; Address.Load( AddressId.GetValueOrDefault( ) ) ; } base . OnInitializeComplete( ) ; } protected override void OnSave ( ) { if ( Address != null ) { Address .
Save ( ) ; Address Id = Address .
AddressId ; } base . OnSave ( ) ; } }
Transactions
Linquify transactions can be created by wrapping calls within the same LINQ2SQL or Entity Framework database context , as shown in the example below .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 using ( HelloWorld.DB.PersonContext context = new HelloWorld.DB.PersonContext ( ) ) { Person person = new Person ( ) person .
SetTransactionContext( _ context ) foreach ( Person p in person .
ToList ( ) ) { p. Age++ p.Save ( ) } Address address = new Address ( null , " 123 Main St. " , " Newark " , " NJ " , 12345 ) address.SetTransactionContext( _context ) ; address .
Save ( ) ; person .
Load ( 123 ) person .
Address
Id = address .
Address Id ; person .
Save ( ) person .
Commit ( ) }
With the overview out of the way , let ’s jump into a quick - start tutorial for using Linquify in your own project .
Linquify with LINQ to SQL - Quick Start Tutorial

Types.GeneratedTypes ;
16 .
Add a new item to your main project , Application Configuration File ( or web.config if using a web application ) .
17 .
In the App.config file , add your connection string with the name you specified in Linquify :
1 2 3 < connectionStrings > < add name = " MyConnectionStringName " connectionString = " server=123.456.789.0 ; database=yourdatabase;uid=user;pwd=password ; " /> </ connectionStrings >
18 . We ’re done !
You can now use the generated types with their native business class methods or with LINQ .
Linquify with the Entity Framework - Quick Start Tutorial
1. Repeat steps 1 - 6 above with a new Visual Studio solution .
2 . In the “ Add New Item ” window , select “ ADO. NET Entity Data Model ” and name it : HelloWorldContext.edmx
This will be your Entity Framework data context .

Types.GeneratedTypes ;
11 . Add a new item to your main project , Application Configuration File ( or web.config if using a web application ) .
12 . In the App.config file , copy the connection string from the HelloWorld .
DB App. Config ( generated by the Entity Framework ) :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 < connectionStrings > < add name = " HelloWorldEntities " connectionString = " metadata=res://*/HelloWorld.csdl|
res://*/HelloWorld.ssdl|res://*/HelloWorld.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient ; provider connection string = " Data Source =123.456.789.0 ; Initial Catalog= yourdatabase ; Persist Security Info=True ; User ID=user;Password=password ; MultipleActiveResultSets=True " " providerName = " System.Data.EntityClient " /> </ connectionStrings >
13 . We ’re done !
You can now use the generated types with their native business class methods or with LINQ .
Using Linquify and LINQ to SQL with MySQL or Oracle
If you are using the Entity Framework , Linquify supports all database platforms via the default Entity Framework database provider , and no additional changes are needed .
Simply select your EDMX file and run Linquify , following the steps in the tutorial above .
If you are using LINQ2SQL , Linquify can support LINQ to SQL with a MySQL or Oracle database by generating the LINQ to SQL classes using DbLinq , an opensource LINQ2SQL generator .
You ’ll need to download a copy of DbLinq ( direct download DbLinq binaries ) and , for MySql , you ’ll need to download the ADO .
NET MySql Connector .
To use DbLinq to generate the LINQ to SQL class for MySQL , follow these steps :
1. Run the DbLinq command - line generator against your database as follows :
dbmetal / server : 123.456.789.0 /user:username / password : password / provider : MySql /database: yourdatabase /language:C#
2. Rename the generated file to contain .designer.cs in it .
In a new Visual Studio solution , follow the steps from the previous tutorial to create an empty HelloWorld .
DB class library project and add the generated class .
designer.cs file to your HelloWorld .
DB project ( this will take the place of your LINQ to SQL generated context.dbml file ) .
3 . We need to tweak / hack some items in the DbLinq generated file to work with Linquify and LINQ to SQL , but it ’s quite straight - forward .
Inside class.designer.cs ( your generated DbLinq file ) , rename the generated class to contain the word DataContext at the end and change the base class to the DbLinq MySql implementation , as follows :
1 2 3 4 public partial class MyDatabaseDataContext : DbLinq.MySql.MySqlDataContext { ... }
4 . Add the following two using statements to the top of the DbLinq generated class , directly after the existing using statements :
1 2 using System .
Configuration ; using MySql. Data .
MySqlClient ;
5 . Remove the two existing constructors in the DbLinq generated class and replace it with the following ( change class name and connection string name to suit your project ) :
1 2 3 4 5 public HelloWorldDataContext ( ) : base ( new MySqlConnection ( ConfigurationManager. ConnectionStrings [ " MyConnectionStringName " ]. ConnectionString ) ) { }
6 . Enclose the entire DbLinq generated class in a namespace , as follows :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 namespace HelloWorld .
DB { using System ; using System . Data ; using System .
Data .
Linq .
Mapping ; using System .
Diagnostics ; using System .
Reflection ; using DbLinq .Data .
Linq ; using DbLinq .
Vendor ; ... public partial class MyDatabaseDataContext : DbLinq.MySql.MySqlDataContext { ...
7 . In the HelloWorld .
DB project , add a Reference to System .
Data .
Linq , DbLinq , DbLinq .
MySql , and MySql.Data ( from the ADO . NET MySQL Connector link above ) .
8. Select the HelloWorld .
DB project and click Tools - > Linquify , enter the name HelloWorld .
Types .
GeneratedTypes as the namespace .
9 . In the generated project , HelloWorld .
Types , modify the file GeneratedTypes / BaseTypes/BusinessBaseType.cs to replace “ DataContext ” with “ DbLinq.MySql.MySqlDataContext ” , as follows :
1 2 3 public abstract class BusinessBaseType< TEntity , TContext > where TEntity : class , new ( ) where TContext : DbLinq.MySql.MySqlDataContext , new ()
Also comment out the following line in the constructor :
1 //Context . DeferredLoadingEnabled = false ;
Also change the using statement at the top of the file from using System .
Data .
Linq to using DbLinq .
Data .
Linq , as follows :
1 using DbLinq . Data .
Linq ;
10 .
In the generated project , HelloWorld .
Types , add a reference to DbLinq and DbLinq .
MySql .
11 . Add a new item to your main project , Application Configuration File ( or web.config if using a web application ) .
12 . In the App.config file , add a connection string for your MySQL database using the same you entered for the connection string in the Linquify dialog .
13 .
You ’re done !
Back in your main project , add a reference to HelloWorld .
Types , DbLinq , and DbLinq .
MySql and you can now begin accessing the business objects in the same way as the SQL Server tutorial above , including LINQ queries .

Linquify Project Architecture and File Descriptions
The above solution architecture offers 3 - tiers :
The user interface HelloWorld , the Types library HelloWorld .
Types , and the database layer HelloWorld .
DB .
All database calls from the user interface go through your business layer and / or the Types library .
This separation of layers allows easy inclusion in a variety of architectural patterns , such as the Repository pattern or Manager classes as needed .
A detailed description of the Linquify project files are shown below :
Project HelloWorld
This is your main program and user interface layer .
This can be a console application or ASP .NET web application .
This project will reference your business layer library or the generated Types library to access the database .
Program logic and control stems from this project .
Project HelloWorld .DB
This is your database layer project .
This project contains your LINQ to SQL DBML file , your Entity Framework EDMX file , or your DbLinq generated LINQ to SQL file .
This project provides a clear layer of separation from your user interface , business layer , and Types library .
Note , while an app.config file may be generated from the ORM tools and placed in this project , you will need to copy the values in the app.config over to your main HelloWorld project so it can access the file and connection strings , as the main project runs in the context of the main project ’s folder .
Project HelloWorld .
Types
This is your Types library , containing business objects to represent the database layer .
This project is automatically generated by Linquify and contains the files needed to access the database or extend your business objects .
The files generated are as follows :
HelloWorld .
Types
GeneratedTypes
BaseTypes
UserTypes
Person.cs
Folder BaseTypes
This folder contains the lowest level business objects , next to the database , for accessing database calls and LINQ or Entity Framework connectivity .
These classes contain private members for tracking dirty flags on each class property ( to know which fields to update on SQL queries etc ) .
You should never modify files in this folder .
Any time you re-generate with Linquify , these files will be overwritten .
Folder UserTypes
This folder contains light - weight business objects ( or Data Transfer Objects DTO ) , available to the user for manipulating the database .
These light - weight business objects can be passed throughout your application , in the web application Context , Session , business class methods , etc. , and provide the main database access for your solution .
You should never modify files in this folder .
Any time you re-generate with Linquify , these files will be overwritten .
Class Person.cs
This is a partial class for your light - weight business object ( DTO ) .
These files are automatically generated by Linquify , the first time ran , and allow you to customize the business object functionality to add custom data access methods and extend your business class .
The following overriddable methods exist :
OnSave ( ) : occurs before the Save method of the business object completes
OnSaveComplete( ) : occurs after the Save method of the business object has completed
OnDelete( ) : occurs before the Delete method of the business object completes
OnDeleteComplete( ) : occurs after the Delete method of the business object has completed
OnInitializeComplete( ) : occurs after the Load method of the business object has completed
Using these overridable methods , you can extend the functionality of the business classes to embed related business objects ( see the Person and Address example above ) or to add your own custom methods , LINQ code , and business rules .
Full Support for Entity Framework Foreign Keys
Linquify 1.6 and above includes full support for foreign keys with both LINQ to SQL and the Entity Framework .
Note , the the Entity Framework in .NET 3.5 has limitations with foreign keys , as they are not included in the default Entity Framework generated schemas .
Linquify resolves this by including foreign keys in the generated type classes and mapping them directly to the Entity Framework foreign key relation objects .
This gives you support for getting and setting foreign keys with the Entity Framework with no hassle , allowing you to write code with the Entity Framework , as follows :
1 2 3 4 Person person = new Person ( ) ; person .
Person
Id = 100 ; person .
Address
Id = 30 ; person .
Save ( ) ;
Manually Installing the Add-in for Visual Studio 2008 / 2010 / 2012

License and Usage
Writing and re-writing data access methods is boring and prone to error .
This was the driving force behind the development of Linquify .
We find that the business classes greatly reduce the time required to get an ASP .NET web application project off the ground , moving past the details of setting up data access methods , and immediately beginning work on logic and UI .
We hope the Linquify tool can help other .NET developers as well .
Linquify v1.6 is free to use .
The included template classes are licensed under the LGPL v2.1 , giving sufficiently flexible permissions to allow the use of Linquify in both open source and commercial projects .
About the Author
Linquify and associated article(s ) were written by Kory Becker , .NET software architect and founder of Primary Objects , a software and web application development company .
Updated : The Senate ethics committee on Friday issued a sternly worded rebuke to Senator Roland Burris of Illinois , saying he had made misleading and inaccurate statements about the circumstances surrounding his appointment by disgraced Governor Rod Blagojevich .
But it made no recommendation for punishment .
Concluding an investigation into whether Mr. Burris lied about his contacts with associates of the governor , who was later forced from office , the panel issued Mr. Burris a letter of admonishment and said he had been less than candid in his statements and had an inappropriate telephone call with the governor ’s brother , Robert .
“ While the committee did not find that the evidence before it supported any actionable violations of law , senators must meet a much higher standard of conduct , ” said the letter from the panel , which also found that Mr. Burris ’s actions and statements “ reflected unfavorably on the Senate . ”
In his own statement , Mr. Burris , who has announced he will not seek election to the seat next year , said he was gratified the investigation was over and that he looked forward to finishing his term .
“ I am pleased that after numerous investigations , this matter has finally come to a close , ” the senator said .
“ I thank the members of the Senate ethics committee for their fair and thorough review of this matter , and now look forward to continuing the important work ahead on behalf of the people of Illinois . ”
The statement from the senator ’s office carried a headline noting that Mr. Burris was “ cleared of legal wrongdoing ” by the panel .
But the tone of the ethics panel admonishment made clear that his colleagues were disturbed by conduct related to his disputed appointment in January to the seat vacated by President Obama before assuming the presidency .
“ The committee found that you should have known that you were providing incorrect , inconsistent , misleading or incomplete information to the public , the Senate , and those conducting legitimate inquiries into your appointment to the Senate , ” the letter said .
The ethics committee ’s letter is available in pdf and below :

This was the country 's first official reaction after three days of talks .
' Mutual understandings '
State media quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying : " [ North Korea ] and the United States agreed to continue cooperation in order to narrow remaining differences .
NUCLEAR CRISIS
Oct 2006 - North Korea conducts an underground nuclear test Feb 2007 - North Korea agrees to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for fuel aid June 2007 - North Korea shuts its main Yongbyon reactor June 2008 - North Korea makes its long - awaited declaration of nuclear assets Oct 2008 - The US removes North Korea from its list of countries which sponsor terrorism Dec 2008 - Pyongyang slows work to dismantle its nuclear programme , after a US decision to suspend energy aid April 2009 - Pyongyang launches a rocket carrying what it says is a communications satellite 25 May 2009 - North Korea conducts a second nuclear test 5 August 2009 - Former US President Bill Clinton visits to help secure the release of two detained US journalists 6 October 2009 - North Korea tells China it may be willing to return to six - party talks " The two sides were able to deepen mutual understanding , narrow differences in views and find considerable common ground .
" A series of mutual understandings were also reached on the need to resume [ six party talks ] " .
Mr Bosworth had earlier described the talks as " useful " but said he did not know when talks would be resumed .
These were the first official discussions between the US and North Korea since Mr Obama took office .
North Korea walked away from six - party nuclear talks earlier this year , but then said it could return .
These discussions - involving the US , China , Russia , Japan and the two Koreas - are aimed at getting rid of the North 's nuclear capabilities in return for aid and security guarantees .
North Korea had said it would never again get involved in the talks .
But China managed to persuade officials in Pyongyang to consider returning .
The BBC's Michael Bristow says that Mr Bosworth 's trip was aimed at showing North Korea the " different future " that awaited it if it rejoined talks and eventually gave up its nuclear ambitions .
Mr Bosworth met several top officials , although not the leader , Kim Jong -il .
Mr Bosworth is now due to fly to Tokyo , Beijing and Moscow to brief officials from the other nations involved in the six - party talks before heading home .

Tim “ Barrel Man ” McKernan , an avid Broncos fan who was known for wearing a barrel , cowboy hat , cowboy boots and not much else , died in his sleep this morning of lung failure .
He was 69 .
McKernan , a former United Airlines mechanic , began wearing a barrel in 1977 after making a $ 10 bet with his brother , Scott , that by wearing one he could get on television .
McKernan won the bet and the barrel he had painted to look like an Orange Crush soda can became his signature costume and resulted in him becoming one of the Broncos ’ most recognized fans and a popular mascot .
“ He liked the attention , he loved inspiring the fans and had a take - charge attitude , ” said Tim ’s son , Todd McKernan , who said he was 17 when his dad first donned the costume .
“ My kids grew up knowing grandpa in the barrel , ” he added .
The elder McKernan had attended Broncos games since 1967 and had only missed four .
In 2003 , an aneurysm left him in the intensive care unit at St. Mary ’s Hospital in Grand Junction .
He was confined to a wheelchair and placed on oxygen , but later recovered .
About six years ago , he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , or scarring of the lung .
this past September , his breathing became more difficult .
He was hospitalized , but came home three weeks ago to receive hospice care , his family said .
In 2007 , McKernan retired his barrel and was honored by the Broncos during a halftime show where he was presented with a team football and other gifts and lots of fan appreciation that moved him to tears .
A memorial service for McKernan is pending

Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty has been busy working to shore up the support of his conservative base as he mulls a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 .
This could explain his views in the following Newsweek interview , in which he enumerates his belief in creationism and announces that while he once may have supported gay equality , he does n’t any more .
He even recants a past vote in support of anti-discrimination legislation .
Pawlenty ’s main reason for recanting the anti-discrimination support ?
He wants to protect kids from cross -dressing elementary - school teachers .
From the Newsweek interview :
Let me ask you about social issues your party has been dealing with .
In her book , Palin claims that McCain ’s handlers wanted her to be silent about her belief in creationism .
How would you describe your view ?
I can tell you how we handle it in Minnesota .
We leave it to the local school districts .
We do n’t mandate a curriculum or an approach .
We allow for something called “ intelligent design ” to be discussed as a comparative theory .
It does n’t have to be in science class .
Where are you personally ?
Well , you know I ’m an evangelical Christian .
I believe that God created everything and that he is who he says he was .
The Bible says that he created man and woman ; it does n’t say that he created an amoeba and then they evolved into man and woman .
But there are a lot of theologians who say that the ideas of evolution and creationism are n’t necessarily inconsistent ; that he could have “ created ” human beings over time .
I know you are opposed to gay marriage , but what about medical benefits for same - sex couples ?
I have not supported that .
Why not ?
My general view on all of this is that marriage is to be defined as being a union of a man and a woman .
Marriage should be elevated in our society at a special level .
I do n’t think all domestic relationships are the equivalent of traditional marriage .
Early on we decided as a country and as a state that there was value in a man and a woman being married in terms of impact on children and the like , and we want to encourage that .
To borrow a phrase , have your views evolved over time ?
In 1993 I voted for a bill prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodation , housing , and employment .
That was 16 years ago .
Yes , gay - rights activists regarded you as a pretty cool guy at the time .
We overbaked that statute , for a couple of reasons .
If I had to do it over again I would have changed some things .
Overbaked ?
That statute is not worded the way it should be .
I said I regretted the vote later because it included things like cross-dressing , and a variety of other people involved in behaviors that were n’t based on sexual orientation , just a preference for the way they dressed and behaved .
So it was overly broad .
So if you are a third - grade teacher and you are a man and you show up on Monday as Mr. Johnson and you show up on Tuesday as Mrs. Johnson , that is a little confusing to the kids .
So I do n’t like that .
Has the law been changed ?
No .
It should be , though .
So you want to protect kids against cross - dressing elementary - school teachers .
Do you have any in Minnesota ?
Probably .
We ’ve had a few instances , not exactly like that , but similar .
Early carnivorous dinosaurs crossed continents

Did the first dinosaurs wander across continents or stay put where they first evolved ?
The first dinosaurs evolved 230 million years ago when the continents were assembled into one landmass called Pangea .
The question of early dinosaur movements remained unclear until the discovery of some exciting new fossils .
In the Dec. 11 , 2009 , issue of Science , a team of paleontologists presents the 213 - million - year - old fossils of previously unknown carnivorous dinosaur Tawa hallae , including several of the best preserved dinosaur skeletons from the Triassic Period .
Fossil bones of Tawa , named after the Hopi word for the Puebloan sun god , were recovered from a dig site in northern New Mexico known as Hayden Quarry .
The quarry is located on Ghost Ranch , where late painter Georgia O'Keefe once lived .
Fossil bones of several individuals were recovered , but the type specimen is a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile that stood about 28 inches ( 70 centimeters ) tall at the hips and was approximately 6 feet ( about 2 meters ) long , from snout to tail .
Its body was about the size of a large dog , but with a much longer tail .
Based on an analysis of the relationships among Tawa and other early dinosaurs , the researchers hypothesize that dinosaurs originated in a part of Pangea that is now South America , diverging into theropods ( like Tyrannosaurus rex ) , sauropodomorphs ( like Apatosaurus ) and ornithischians ( like Triceratops ) ; and then dispersed more than 220 million years ago across parts of Pangea that later became separate continents .
" This new dinosaur Tawa hallae changes our understanding of the relationships of early dinosaurs , and provides fantastic insight into the evolution of the skeleton of the first carnivorous dinosaurs " said Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and University of Utah , a co-author of the study .
In addition to Irmis , authors of the study included lead author Sterling Nesbit of the University of Texas at Austin ; Nathan Smith of the University of Chicago and the Field Museum of Natural History ; Alan Turner of Stony Brook University ; Alex Downs of the Ruth Hall Museum of Paleontology in Abiquiu , N.M. ; and Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History .
" If you have continents splitting apart , you get isolation , " said Nesbitt .
" So when barriers develop , you would expect that multiple carnivorous dinosaurs in a region should represent a closely related endemic radiation .
But that is what we do n't see in early dinosaur evolution . "
Instead , the research team found three distinct carnivorous dinosaurs – including the newly discovered Tawa – in the fossil - rich , Late Triassic beds they investigated at Ghost Ranch .
" When we analyzed the evolutionary relationships of these dinosaurs , we discovered that they were only distantly related , and that each species had close relatives in South America , " said Irmis .
" This implies that each carnivorous dinosaur species descended from a separate lineage before arriving in [ the part of Pangea that is now ]
North America , instead of all evolving from a local ancestor . "
At Ghost Ranch , the researchers found fossils from a carnivorous dinosaur related to Coelophysis , common to that region , and fossils from a carnivore closely related to Herrerasaurus , which lived in South America .
The 6.6 - to 13 - foot - long ( 2- to 4 - meter - long ) skeletons of Tawa display characteristics that exist in both species and features found in neither , implying a separate lineage .
" The discovery of multiple dinosaur species in one place that emigrated from elsewhere got us wondering whether other Late Triassic reptiles show similar patterns " said Irmis .
" It turns out a variety of other reptile groups made multiple trips from the northern and southern continents [ then parts of Pangea ] and back again during the Late Triassic , including other dinosaurs . "
Because so many different groups with different life modes were able to move freely across Pangea , the research team concluded that during the Late Triassic , there were no major physical barriers , such as large mountain ranges , to the movement of reptiles between parts of Pangea that later separated into distinct continents .
But this presented a paradox to the team : " We wondered : if reptiles , including dinosaurs , were able to freely move around Pangea during the Late Triassic , then why are n't there any sauropodomorph and ornithischian dinosaurs in North America during the Triassic ? " said Irmis .
" Our conclusion is that climate , possibly related to latitude , controlled the distributions of some reptile species . "
" We think that all the major dinosaur groups had the ability to get to North America [ part of Pangea ] during the Late Triassic , and may have even passed through , but for some reason , only the carnivorous dinosaurs found the North American climate to be hospitable during this time , " concluded Irmis .
The first Tawa fossils were discovered in 2004 by volunteers taking a paleontology seminar at the Ruth Hall Museum of Paleontology in New Mexico .
Museum scientists invited the team of paleontologists to come and take a look .
" The specimens are unusual because they are so well preserved , " said Irmis .
" Because dinosaur bones are hollow , they are usually broken and crushed , but those of Tawa are nearly pristine . "
Irmis and the rest of the team began a full - scale excavation in 2006 and have continued to unearth new material every summer since then .
The fossil bone bed extends for tens of yards along a hillside , promising many years of potential significant finds .
I swear , if I see one more commentator buying - in to Senator Conroy 's spin about child pornography on the Internet I 'm going to pop an artery .
There are plenty of other places where you can read all about how the Enex Testlab report released by the Minister on Tuesday decimates the case for the Government 's policy , so I 'm not going to rehash that here .
But I 'm going to go into an important issue which sits right at the core of the debate , which is , " What , exactly , is the Government planning to block ? "
In one sense that 's a fairly easy question to answer , because the Minister told us exactly what he 's going to block .
In his speech , measure number 1 was , " The introduction of mandatory ISP - level filtering of Refused Classification ( RC ) - rated content . "
After saying that , the Minister did his usual trick of clouding the issue by talking about child abuse material , as if that was somehow related to the RC concept and a legitimate inclusion in the debate .
Egged on by his friends at the Australian Christian Lobby , he 's done this so often that the terms " Refused Classification " and " illegal " are virtually synonymous in many peoples ' minds , even though they 're totally different concepts , and even though the Classification Board has no power to make any finding of illegality pertaining to any content in any media .
So lets clear the air a bit :
What , exactly , is " Refused Classification " content ?
It 's fairly simple .
Picture Aunt Gladys from Cootamundra , who has rarely actually used the Internet but has some terribly strong opinions about what 's on it .
Aunt Gladys receives some spam one afternoon , clicks on a link , and finds herself looking at a pornography site .
" This is terrible ! "
Gladys harrumphs , " Something must be done ! " and she calls the police to lodge a complaint about the awful , disgusting imagery that she 's only just now discovered is on the Internet .
Following up her complaint , the police examine it , and determine that there 's nothing illegal there .
But Gladys is insistent : Something must be done !
Brushing her off , the police tell her that she can submit Internet content complaints through the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) so that she can run away and hassle them instead of wasting police time .
So she bustles herself back to her telephone and calls the NetAlert Hotline , disturbing ACMA from their Kyle Sandilands deliberations for long enough to take down the particulars of her complaint .
Three months later they finally get around to looking at it , and send her a sympathetic email message confirming that the web page she 's found is Refused Classification and Prohibited Content .
There there , my dear Gladys , have a pat on the head and an elephant stamp on your wrist .
Consider yourself validated .
ACMA is the agony aunt of the Internet .
Their job is to listen to all the Gladys ' of Australia , the people who want to complain about things that are n't actually illegal , a veritable online version of the Letters to the Editor page in the Northern Territory News .
None of that tut - tutting would happen if Gladys had found actual illegal material .
If she 'd reported illegal content to the police , they'd have never referred her to ACMA , they 'd simply start the process of gathering evidence , issuing interception warrants to find out who had published the material and who was downloading it , and generally doing whatever they need to do to get distributors of illegal content behind bars .
They'd do the whole thing in secret , like they do with every other criminal investigation they conduct , and both ACMA and the Classification Board would rarely get a look - in .
If Gladys had reported illegal content to ACMA , they 'd send it straight to the police too .
That 's what they have to do -- The Broadcasting Services Act compels them .
If content is actually illegal , there 's no ridiculous time - wasting messing around with blacklists , the material is supposed to be taken down and the perpetrators arrested , no questions asked , no second - guessing .
To summarise :
The only content that 's ever blacklisted , RC or otherwise , is that which is legal , but offensive to people like Gladys .
That 's the purpose the " RC " category serves under Australian law .
That 's why the three ACMA blacklists published by Wikileaks in March 2009 did n't contain any child pornography , despite ACMA 's continued discredited insistence that approximately half of their silly , smutty little list is rated " RC - Child Depiction . "
Google gets this .
On Wednesday they slammed the Government 's policy : " Our primary concern is that the scope of content to be filtered is too wide . "
They went on : " Refused classification is a broad category of content that includes not just child sexual abuse material but also socially and politically controversial material - for example , educational content on safer drug use - as well as the grey realms of material instructing in any crime , including politically controversial crimes such as euthanasia . "
Google reminds us that being homosexual was a crime in Tasmania until 1997 , and information about it could have been ( and was ) Refused Classification , ripe for banning by Conroy 's rabbit - proof firewall .
Google is n't alone in making these observations .
Earlier this week , University of New South Wales law professors released a paper entitled , " Untangling the Net : The Scope of Content Caught By Mandatory Internet Filtering , " which identified a wide gamut of legal content that would be swept up in Senator Conroy 's RC net , and criticised the application of mandatory ISP censorship to the Australian Internet .
The Government can't avoid this .
In February , ACMA themselves were in the Parliament insisting that photographs published on an anti-abortion site were Refused Classification .
And for several years Australia has been the only nation in the world to ban Dr. Phillip Nitschke 's book , " The Peaceful Pill , " as a Refused Classification publication .
Under Senator Conroy 's plan , you 'll still be able to legally buy the book on amazon.com , but unlike everyone else in the world you wo n't be able to read it on your Kindle or watch the accompanying DVD on Youtube .
For some time , the Government has been claiming that " the new filter rules are not intended to curtail freedom of speech . "
But they can't avoid the fact that the RC category is , by its very existence , a curtailment on free speech .
It stands alone as a category of legal material which the Government has decided you are n't allowed to see .
If anything comes out of this discussion , I 'd like to see Australian media commentators ( who are more affected by censorship than virtually any other segment of the Australian population ) understand that " RC " is not the same as " illegal " or " child pornography . "
Joining the two concepts together is a manipulative rhetorical tactic the Minister is using to garner support for his obnoxious policy , and I 'm sure that the protectors of the Fourth Estate are clever enough to avoid being drawn in to it .
It 's well past the time when the Government should be given the benefit of the doubt on this issue .
Senator Conroy has spent two years blazing a trail of such spectacular wrongness , where his every utterance on the subject of censorship has been picked apart for the entertainment of enraptured onlookers .
It 's high time for some skepticism :
The Minister must be held to account , and forced to explain what he hopes to achieve , and how , exactly , his censorship policy will help him to achieve it .

Students across Iran are planning to lead a huge day of protest this week against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime , in a defiant commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the US embassy takeover by radical students in Tehran .
Thousands of green flyers and posters , drawn by anonymous artists , are circulating on the internet , inviting ordinary Iranians to join the student protests , planned for Wednesday .
Organisers have condemned the repressive measures taken by Ahmadinejad 's government since the disputed election results of the summer , which gave the Iranian president a second term and led to unprecedented demonstrations on the streets of Tehran and elsewhere .
Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi appeared to back the protests yesterday , posting a statement on a reformist website .
Mousavi said he would press ahead with his efforts for political change .
Referring to the Iranian date of the seizing of the US embassy in 1979 , Mousavi said : " The 13th of Aban is a ... rendezvous so we would remember anew that among us it is the people who are the leaders . "
Iran 's police chief , Ismail Ahmadi-Moghadam , has warned demonstrators to stay off the streets , but activists predict one of the biggest days of protest since the height of the green marches .
A student of civil engineering at Amir Kabir University in Tehran , who wished to remain anonymous , said : " The officials are very afraid of the student movement , that 's why they are preparing to crack down on 4 November .
The protests in Iran have not cooled off , they 're just beginning . "
Iran 's students were on vacation during the failed " Green Revolution " of June , when hundreds of thousands of protesters attempted to overturn the official election result , which gave Ahmadinejad a crushing victory over Mousavi .
But in recent months , despite the high - profile presence on campuses of security police , universities have become centres of underground protest and organisation .
Dissent has also been expressed in schools .
One teacher in a Tehran school told the Observer that such gestures of rebellion were widespread .
" It is amazing , " he said , asking not to be named .
" In the school where I 'm teaching , students show their opposition in any way that they can find , whether it's by wearing a green wristband , green shirt , doing homework in green pen or writing slogans in toilets , on their desk or on the blackboard . "
In an interview published on the Amir Kabir University student news website , Morteza Simiari , a leader of Iran 's Student Organisation , Tahkim Vahdat , said : " The students who are protesting in universities today are the people who were out there in the streets in June and July and were mistreated .
Universities are part of society and what is happening now shows that people do not believe the results in the election . "
Authorities have closed 235 schools in Kashan , in the province of Isfahan , until Saturday , ostensibly as the result of a swine flu scare , although no cases of the virus have been reported .
Since the beginning of the academic year in Iran , students in Tehran , Isfahan , Shiraz , Karaj , Qazvin and other provincial cities have all held protests against the election results .
Hundreds of students have as a result been summoned before disciplinary boards , some have been imprisoned and at least 20 expelled .
Government officials visiting universities have received stormy receptions .
On 4 October , Mohammad Javad Larijani , a close ally of Ahmadinejad , visited Sharif University , where he was confronted by students shouting " Death to the dictator " and chanting in favour of Mousavi .
In Tehran , the private Azad University has been a hotbed of unrest , according to students .
" Azad university protests were huge , so they [ the authorities ] used tear gas and wielded batons to calm down the situation , " said one of the Azad protesters .
" They bussed in militia from other universities .
Recently 14 of us have been banned from class . "
OAKLAND , Calif. , Nov 17 ( Reuters ) - California faces a budget gap of nearly $ 21 billion over its current and next fiscal years , according to the state government ’s budget watchdog agency , the Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday .
The newspaper said California ’s Legislative Analyst ’s Office would issue an official report on Wednesday with its shortfall estimate .
The projection comes less than four months after Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers agreed to a budget plan that closed a deficit of more than $ 24 billion largely with deep spending cuts to respond to plunging revenues amid the worst economic crisis to hit the most populous U.S. state since the Great Depression .
Schwarzenegger said last week he expects a budget gap for the rest of the current fiscal year of between $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion .
His finance advisors had previously said the state government would see a $ 7.4 billion gap in the next fiscal year beginning in July .
But next year ’s budget shortfall will be much larger than initially forecast , the Los Angeles Times said .
Citing sources briefed the upcoming report , it said the deficit will be $ 14.4 billion .

Ruby Manor
Ruby Manor is one of those alternative conferences .
It 's not run for a profit , and costs just £ 8 for a ticket ( you pay just enough to cover the cost of the room and equipment ) .
You even get a free beer afterwards in the local boozer ( and it 's at least £ 3 a pint in London these days ) .
Due to the unique way that Ruby Manor is funded ( actually , that 's nothing to do with it ) you can even check the bar bill .
There were some great talks again this year , and it's far and away my favourite date on the conference calendar .
Congratulations to Murray , James and Kalv on organising such a runaway success .
I spent most of the day typing frantically , but I did n't manage to capture everything .
The photos that are littered through the following articles are all thanks to @glenngillen from Rubypond , who was sat next to me snapping away for most of the day .
So , in alphabetical order , here are my notes from every talk at Ruby Manor 2 ( also known as " Ruby Manor Harder " ) .
Each talk gets a page of it's own this year , mainly to help you see the wood for the trees .
You can also find a couple of articles covering Ruby Manor 2008 at the bottom of the list .
P.S. If you 're one of the speakers and spot a mistake , or want me to change anything , just get in touch on Twitter and I 'll sort it out pronto .
I love feedback and questions — please get in touch on Twitter or leave a comment .

That changed when he was about 15 and saw a buddy shot to death on the street after he had assaulted a Colombo captain .
“ There was a thick snake of blood , ” Mr. Carlo recalled , with writerly vividness .
“ It looked like his lifeblood was crawling out of him . ”
Suddenly the underworld did not seem so romantic .
Mr. Carlo was in a gang , the 24th Avenue Boys , and one day in a rumble he was shot in the head , somehow escaping with little more than a scar over his left eye .
Dyslexic , with a checkered high school record ( he would later spend a year in community college ) , he found solace in reading , sliding his fingers slowly over the words .
He grew his hair long and moved to Manhattan , supporting himself , he acknowledged ruefully , by selling marijuana .
He graduated to real estate and , in 1976 , bought his brownstone in the West 80s , between Riverside Drive and West End Avenue , for $ 80,000 .
Then he began to write .
Rather than rely on the shock value of his story lines , Mr. Carlo sought to infuse his prose with soul .
As he put it : “ A lot of what occurs in writing is between the lines .
It is not the lines . ”
He got the idea for his first book when he was hospitalized at Bellevue with an infection and a woman was murdered there .
He spun it into a thriller about a killer loose in the wards .
He collected 125 rejection letters and shelved it forever .
Disillusioned , he decamped for Europe , where , in Amsterdam , he said he was shocked to see children performing sex shows in shop windows as police officers stood by .
He studied the sex trafficking of children and , in a sidewalk cafe in Ibiza , scrawled out another novel , this time about the kidnapping of a American girl in Pompeii by a child pornography ring .
After 10 rejections , Dutton published it as “ Stolen Flower ” in 1986 .
Universal optioned the book for Mr. De Niro , and the two men spent weeks scouting movie locations .
Five scripts later , the project languished .
But Mr. Carlo became a frequent television guest and lecturer on the sex trade .
After Mr. Ramirez , the Night Stalker , was convicted in 1989 of 43 crimes , including 13 murders , Mr. Carlo wrote him on death row , seeking material for a novel about a serial killer .
A correspondence blossomed , and the novel turned into nonfiction .
Mr. Carlo ’s 1996 chronicle of Mr. Ramirez ’s troubled early life and brutal crimes drew strong reviews  Publishers Weekly called it “ exceptionally well - told ”  and has gone through 23 printings .

Glenn Beck 's commie - hunt continues !
Last month he was waving the bloody pelt of Van Jones .
" We need to at least in this country start having the necessary discussion of , Do we want communists in the United States government ? " he ranted .
" This guy is still a radical , just like Cass Sunstein and John Holdren and Carol Browner and Mark Lloyd and the list goes on and on and on .
Now some in the White House may be uncomfortable calling these individuals radicals or revolutionaries or communists , but I 'm not — America , when did we stop caring about communism ? "
A few days ago , Beck posted a picture on his Web site of the Empire State Building in the colors of the Chinese flag .
Apparently this was a courtesy gesture from New York City in recognition of our largest bondholder and second - largest trading partner 's birthday .
Beck 's headline : Communist State Building ?
This got me thinking , even though I prefer not to think about Glenn Beck :
His administration suspects are actually a pretty tame bunch .
( Cass Sunstein is a vaguely libertarian professor at Harvard and author of at least thirteen books .
John Holdren is a distinguished professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School , the director of the Woods Hole Research Center , and former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Carol Browner is a former Senate staffer and senior state government official .
Mark Lloyd is a professor at Georgetown University 's public policy school and a former lecturer at MIT . )
Not exactly bomb - throwing revolutionaries .
However , there is still one powerful American who has extensive connections with communists — not just some communists , but some of the most powerful communists in the world .
According to an extensive report in the New York Times , this man has " flattered Communist Party leaders and done business with their children , " met repeatedly with senior members of the communist Politburo , " cooperates closely " with communist censors and propaganda networks , and " cultivates political ties " with communists in the hope that they will " insulate his business ventures . "
Not only that , but he " often supports the policies " of communist leaders and " attacks their critics . "
It gets worse .
This powerful American has control of a large number of media holdings , and he attempted to curry favor with said communists by ordering one of his book publishing units to release glorifying Deng Xiaoping , the heir to Chairman Mao .
Another time , he killed a book deal with the last British governor of Hong Kong because of rumors that it would be critical of his communist business partners .
When the story broke , the businessman denied it .
Then Business Week uncovered internal memos that spoke of " corporate worries " that the book would threaten his business interests in China .
And it gets worse still .
This powerful American businessman also owns a Chinese television network called Star TV .
Once it carried news programming from the BBC .
But after the famous incident when communists attacked unarmed civilians in Tiananmen Square , Star TV's BBC affiliate repeatedly showed the spectacular video clip of a man facing down a tank alone .
The communists complained .
And the powerful American businessman — who makes a great deal of noise on these shores about being a champion of freedom and free speech and the free market — asked the BBC to stop showing it so often .
But the BBC kept airing the clip and the communists kept complaining and finally the businessman ordered his Chinese network to drop the BBC news channel altogether .
He insisted this was a business decision and that politics had absolutely nothing to do with it , of course — and , also , the BBC reporters really wanted to spend more time with their families .
But subsequently , the supreme leader of the communists praised him for his " objective " approach to Chinese political news .
As I said , this American businessman is a vocal champion of freedom in this country .
He owns the Weekly Standard , which supports Bill Kristol and many other influential neoconservatives who are passionately committed to spreading democracy to all oil - producing countries .
He put all of his media power behind the Iraq War .
He cheered George W. Bush as " a man of great character and deep humility . "
And he 's famously touchy about any criticism of his politics — when The Simpsons ran a parody of Fox News that included headlines like " Do Democrats Cause Cancer ? " he threatened to sue the creators of the most successful show in the history of his network .
But his friendly relations with overseas communists have proved lucrative .
After killing Star TV's BBC affiliate in order to ingratiate himself with China 's communist propaganda ministers , he established a contract to help design a Web site for CCTV , the giant official Chinese TV network that Time magazine called " the key propaganda arm of the Communist Party . "
He also helped launch the Web site of the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party , The People 's Daily .
He helped the communists develop a television encryption system , which will doubtless prove useful in suppressing dissent in the future .
His Chinese version of MySpace obeys all communist censorship laws , even including a built - in link for reporting " inappropriate information " to the authorities .
And to smooth the skids on his new ventures , he signed employment contracts with the son of the national propaganda chief and the leadership committee of the Communist Youth League .
Oh , and he also does business with the communist nation of Cuba , which harbors one of the many tax havens where he has hidden cash to avoid American tax laws .
This powerful American friend of communists is , of course , Rupert Murdoch — the man who signs Glenn Beck 's paychecks .
Do n't hold your breath waiting for a Beck exposé .
But let us not simply curse the darkness .
Since this column has criticized Republican leaders for standing by silently while Beck and Co. have poisoned the nation with lies and hate , let us give credit where credit is due :
To Republican Senator Lindsey Graham , who spoke out on Beck last week , saying that the bloviator was " not aligned with any party as far as I can tell .
He 's aligned with cynicism . "
Also , to the sixty major companies that have stopped buying ads on Beck 's show after a campaign by a group called Color of Change prompted more than 275,000 people to write protest letters .
But there remain a few prominent corporate Beck - lovers who still need help finding the decency to spurn this irresponsible nutcase demagogue who fakes his phony tears with Vicks VapoRub .
They are : Target , Orbitz , Warner Bros. , JoS. A. Bank , and Roche .
I should warn you , however , that boycotting Warner Bros. means refusing to see The Informant ! and Where the Wild Things Are — two interesting movies that both happen to have been made by good Hollywood liberals .
Funny how that is .
You 'll also have to boycott The Box , the new Cameron Diaz movie about a married couple that receives a magic box offering a special deal : open it , and you become incredibly rich — but you also let Chinese communists kill some random person you do n't know .
Remember , folks : it 's only a movie .

He was not willing to sell his soul to stay in power .
[ obit ]
Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , the spiritual leader of Iran 's democratic movement and one of the two top ayatollahs in Shia Islam ( Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in Iraq is the other ) , passed away in his sleep on Saturday .
Grand Ayatollah Montazeri was born in 1922 in Najafabad , a town in the province of Isfahan in central Iran .
His father , Ali , was a farmer who also taught reading and interpretation of the Qur'an to the townspeople .
The young Montazeri entered the seminary at Isfahan at the age of 12 .
After finishing his preliminary studies in 1941 , he moved to the holy city of Qom and began his theological studies .
He was a student of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the future leader of the 1979 Revolution .
Years after the Revolution toppled the regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi , Khomeini referred to Montazeri as " the fruit of my life . "
In the 1950s , Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Hassan Tabatabaei Boroujerdi was the most important grand ayatollah and marja ( source of emulation ) in Shia Islam .
He believed that clerics should not intervene in politics and should act only as spiritual advisers .
After Ayatollah Tabatabaei passed away in 1961 , other important ayatollahs of that era became the focus of attention : Seyyed Mohammad Reza Golpayegani ( 1895-1993 ) , Seyyed Mohammad Sadegh Rouhani ( 1926-2002 ) , Shahabeddin Marashi Najafi ( 1897-1990 ) , Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari ( 1905 - 86 ) , and Khomeini .
The question was who would be " the top among the equals . "
Montazeri and other students of Khomeini promoted him , presumably because the others were not willing to take on the Shah .
When on June 5 , 1963 , there was an uprising by the followers of Khomeini , who in a fiery speech had denounced the Shah and was going to be arrested , Montazeri and others actively supported their teacher and spiritual leader .
After Khomeini was exiled to Turkey and then Iraq in 1964 , it was Montazeri and other disciples of Khomeini who kept in contact with him and helped propagate his political messages against the Shah .
Montazeri was arrested by the Shah 's security forces many times and spent years in jail .
When in March 1966 his son Monammad Montazeri distributed anti-Shah fliers at the shrine of Masoumeh in Qom , the SAVAK -- the Shah 's security agency -- arrested the elder Montazeri .
He had been released from jail only a few months earlier .
His arrest provoked strong protests by the other ayatollahs in Qom and , as a result , he was released from jail in October 1966 .
After his release , he secretly traveled to Najaf , Iraq , where Khomeini was living , but on his return to Iran , he was arrested again and spent another five months in jail .
In 1967 , the Shah crowned himself " King of Kings " and his wife Farah , Empress .
To prevent any disturbance , the SAVAK banished Montazeri to Masjed Soleiman in Khuzestan province .
He was there for three months then returned to Qom against SAVAK orders .
He was greeted by a large number of people and arrested again by the SAVAK and sent off to exile in his hometown of Najafabad .
There , he began public Friday Prayers .
In his sermons , he harshly criticized the Shah .
He was arrested and convicted in a show trial in the Shah 's military court .
( In that era , civilian courts and judges refused to put political dissidents on trial ; as in the Islamic Republic , these trials were a farce and every verdict a foregone conclusion . )
He was eventually sentenced to 18 months in Qasr Prison in Tehran , where political detainees were held .
Montazeri was freed in April 1970 and returned to Qom .
Because of his influence and popularity , he was exiled by the SAVAK to Najafabad again .
He again used his Friday Prayer sermons to criticize the Shah .
The Friday Prayers he led became so popular that people from many cities in Isfahan province would attend just to listen to him .
The SAVAK reported to the Shah that " Montazeri 's Friday Prayers are a base of struggle against the government . "
Montazeri spent three years in exile in Najafabad , followed by a period in Tabas , a town in the southern part of Khorasan province .
When he arrived in Tabas , over 50,000 people reportedly traveled there to meet with him , and Tabas became a center of anti-Shah activities .
Montazeri wrote an open letter about the dangers of what he called imperialism [ represented by the United States ] and Zionism [ Israel ] and the necessity of a united front to oppose them .
The open letter was widely distributed [ as a university student , the author read a copy of it ] .
The letter angered the SAVAK , so in 1974 he was again transferred from Tabas to Khalkhal in the province of East Azerbaijan ; because he did not speak Azeri Turkish , it was hoped the move there would curb the spread of his influence .
But that did not stop him from criticizing the Shah , which made him popular even in Khalkhal .
Therefore , he was banished to Saqez during the harsh winter in hopes that the foul weather would curtail his activities .
But even there , the SAVAK worried about him .
Finally , he was brought to Tehran in July 1975 , where he was interrogated and tortured at Evin prison .
He spent the first six months there in solitary confinement .
A SAVAK interrogator told him , " We do not want you to be in Qom , because we do not want another Khomeini there . "
A military court sentenced him to 10 years in prison .
But even in Evin , Montazeri was politically active .
He began Friday Prayers at the jailhouse , which quickly amassed a following and prompted SAVAK to put a stop to it .
Together with Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Taleghani ( 1911 - 79 ) , he advocated unity between Islamic and secular leftist political prisoners .
By 1978 , the Revolution was under way and gathering steam .
On October 29 , 1978 , Montazeri was released from Evin and greeted by a large crowd of people .
He then traveled to Paris to meet with Khomeini , and was vested with full powers to represent him in Iran .
Upon his release from prison , Khomeini told Montazeri , " It is not surprising that the criminal [ political ] establishment subjects you to medieval torture .
Those who commit treason against the country and the people are afraid even of your shadow . "
The irony in this statement is that the same would later apply to Montazeri 's status in the next regime -- the Islamic Republic he helped found .
After the Revolution , Montazeri was chairman of the Assembly of Experts of the Constitution .
Two groups were key in inserting the principle of Velayat-e Faqih ( guardianship of the jurist , i.e. , the position of Supreme Leader ) into the Iranian constitution .
One group , consisting of clerics , was led by Montazeri .
The second was made up of non-clerical right - wing politicians associated with the Islamic Coalition Society , led by Dr. Hassan Ayat ( who was assassinated in July 1981 ) and closely associated with Mozaffar Baghaei , a politician who had supported the CIA / MI6 coup in 1953 .
But Montazeri always insisted that he never intended for the Supreme Leader to have executive power , but only to act as a spiritual adviser .
In 1985 , the Assembly of Experts -- a constitutional body that appoints the Supreme Leader and , in theory , monitors his performance -- appointed Grand Ayatollah Montazeri as deputy and successor to Ayatollah Khomeini .
But differences between the two had already begun to grow .
The grand ayatollah was opposed to show trials , torture , and the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the 1980s .
He initially expressed his opposition privately , but gradually went public with it .
In 1988 , through a quasi - coup led by Khomeini 's son Ahmad ( who hoped to succeed his father ) and other clerics , Montazeri was sacked from his position as Khomeini 's deputy .
When asked why he did not keep silent until he succeeded Khomeini , at which time he could address " the crimes and problems , " he responded that , " I could not sleep at nights , knowing that innocent people were being killed . "
Montazeri demonstrated that nothing and no one , even a charismatic and powerful man such as Khomeini , could influence him when it came to defending the truth .
He showed that power meant nothing to him if it came at the expense of defending the rights of the oppressed and repressed .
After Mohammad Khatami was elected president in 1997 , Montazeri in a famous speech criticized Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader , and declared him unqualified for the position .
He advised Khatami to tell Khamenei , " You and your office are respected , but I was elected with 20 million votes and , therefore , I should be allowed to run the country . "
That prompted the hardliners to put him under house arrest , confiscate many of his properties , freeze his bank account , and subject him to ongoing pressure .
The house arrest was lifted in 2002 .
Since then , the hardliners refer to him as " the simple - minded cleric . "
But Montazeri was far from naïve .
After the rigged June 12 presidential election , Montazeri came down strongly on the side of the reformist - democratic groups .
After Mir Hossein Mousavi , the main reformist candidate , wrote a letter to important clerics , asking them to pronounce their opinions on the results of the rigged presidential election , Montazeri issued a statement rejecting the results of the election , and warned the nation that they should not provide any excuse to those who intend to create an atmosphere of fear and repression in the country .
The statement said ,
Over the last several days I have been witnessing the glowing presence and the lively and sacrificial efforts of my dear and dignified sisters and brothers , old and young , in the campaign for the 10th presidential election .
Our youth also demonstrated their presence on the political scene with hope and good spirit , in order to achieve their rightful demands .
They waited patiently night and day .
This was an excellent occasion for government officials to take advantage of and establish religious , emotional and nationalistic bonds with our youth and the rest of our people .
Unfortunately , however , this opportunity was wasted in the worst possible way .
Such election results were declared that no wise person in their right mind could believe , results that based on credible evidence and witnesses had been altered extensively , and after strong protests by the people against such acts -- the same people who have carried the heavy weight and burden of the Revolution during eight years of war and resisted the tanks of the imperial government [ of the Shah ] and those of the enemy [ Iraq ] -- they attacked the children of the same people and nation right in front of national and foreign reporters , and used astonishing violence against defenseless men and women and the dear [ university ] students , injuring and arresting them .
And now they are trying to purge activists , intellectuals , and political opponents by arresting a large number of them , some of whom have even held high positions in the government of the Islamic Republic .
After many protesters were killed by security forces , Montazeri declared three days of national mourning .
He bravely apologized to the nation for having a hand in establishing the position of Supreme Leader .
He set aside his own earlier opinions that he found to be incorrect .
Then , in a historic declaration , Montazeri declared the Supreme Leader illegitimate and working with the government against religion .
This fatwa was issued in response to a letter that Dr. Mohsen Kadivar , a progressive cleric and strong critic of the hardliners , and a former student of Montazeri had sent him , asking pointed questions .
Kadivar had asked ,
Taking up positions of power for serving the public -- which according to the law , must be occupied by those who are fair , honest , competent , and require the vote of the majority of the people -- by those who are either not qualified , or no longer satisfy the conditions and qualifications stipulated by the law by exhibiting the characteristics that , with almost complete certainty , are against the required qualifications , requires what course of action [ by the people ] ?
Montazeri responded ,
If any of the qualifications mentioned in the question , which religiously and reasonably govern the conditions for occupying the official position for serving the public , is no longer met by the person who occupies the position [ to serve the public ] , that person , automatically and without any need for dismissal , is sacked , which also means all the orders issued by him are no longer valid .
But , if the conditions are such that they are not religiously and reasonably necessary for taking up the position , but have been mutually agreed upon by the people and the person [ taking the position ] who serves them and takes care of their affairs , and have been violated by that person , the people can dismiss him .
After the fall [ destruction ] of justice , honesty , and loss of the vote [ trust ] of the majority that must be reiterated constantly , which are the conditions for serving [ the public ] and ruling , the criterion is no longer that the person is innocent unless proven otherwise when it comes to the public affairs that he was in charge of , rather the person must prove his innocence , lack of violation of the laws and the religion , and the efforts for protecting people 's right by giving the people a valid reason , in order to satisfy them .
If there is still a difference [ between the public and the person ] , the person must prove his claim [ of innocence ] to a free , fair , and neutral adjudicator who is independent of the government ; otherwise , the adjudication will not be acceptable .
Kadivar then asked ,
What is the religious duty of the people with regard to the public servants who , despite the warning by the wise and good - intentioned people , insist on continuing to act against religion ?
Montazeri responded ,
As I said , those who have lost , religiously and reasonably , the credibility for serving the public , are automatically dismissed , and the continuation of their work has no legitimacy .
If they want to use force , or fool or cheat people in order to keep their power , people must express their opinion about the illegitimacy and lack of their approval of their performance , and seek their dismissal through the best and least harmful way .
It is clear that this [ dismissal of the officials ] is a societal duty of everyone , and all the people , regardless of their social positions and according to their knowledge and capability , must participate in this endeavor , and cannot shirk their responsibility .
The enlightened that have more knowledge about the religion and the laws , and are also more influential , have more responsibility [ toward dismissal of the unqualified officials ] .
They must unify people and through formation of political parties and organizations , as well as public and private gatherings , inform the people and show them the way [ to dismiss the officials ] .
In his will Imam Ali said [ Nahjolbalaagheh , letter 47 ] , " the governance and domination of the evil people [ in a society ] is the natural consequence of not preaching good deed and avoiding sin , because they [ the evil people ] abuse the opportunities .
Montazeri continued to issue strong statements in support of the opposition Green Movement .
He warned the people to avoid radicalism and violence and said that , " The victory of the [ democratic ] movement is certain .
Therefore , there is no need for chanting radical slogans [ that provoke violence ] . "
When pro-government hardliners tore and burned a poster of Khomeini , taped the event , and then broadcast it on national television in order to step up their attacks and pave the way to arrest the reformists , Montazeri , in one of his last statements before his death , said , " The late Ayatollah Imam Khomeini was a very important man .
But , he was not masoom [ sinless ] and had erred many times .
He himself never claimed to be masoom .
Therefore , there is no need to make an issue of this [ tearing and burning his poster ] . "
Montazeri defended the rights of religious minorities .
He saved the lives of several people who had converted to Christianity , when he issued a fatwa saying that , " If someone leaves Islam as a result of his own investigation and research , there should not be any problem for him . "
He defended the rights of Iranian Baha 'is , a religion not recognized by Islam .
He said that although Islam does not recognize Baha'ism , " our Baha 'i compatriots are entitled to full citizen rights , like any other Iranian . "
The hardliners are afraid of him even in his death .
IRNA , Iran 's official news agency , refused to call him Ayatollah .
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has asked the press to talk only about Montazeri 's scholarly Islamic work , and not his political activities .
Security forces are on alert .
According to various reports , a huge number of people are flocking to Qom to attend his funeral tomorrow ( Monday , December 21 ) .
Some of the most important ayatollahs who have supported the democratic movement , such as Ayatollah Abdolkarim Mousavi Ardabili , Grand Ayatollahs Yousef Sanei and Asadollah Bayat Zanjani , as well as Mir Hossein Mousavi and others have already visited Montazeri 's home to pay their respects .
In a joint statement , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the two symbolic leaders of the Green Movement , declared tomorrow a national day of mourning for Montazeri .
In Shia tradition , the dead are mourned on the eve of the seventh day after passing .
Fittingly , for Montazeri , the seventh day will fall on the Day of Ashura , which annually commemorates the martyrdom of revered Shia icon Imam Hossein .
The Green Movement had vowed to use the occasion to demonstrate against the hardliners , and Montazeri 's passing only adds to the significance of the day .
Personally , my own life has been influenced greatly by Montazeri for several reasons .
First and foremost , he and others like him taught me that one can be a Muslim , but also a progressive and a democrat and to be proud of it .
Second , in the fall of 1978 , when the Revolution was gathering steam , I was becoming restless .
I had moved to the United States in March of 1978 , but had second thoughts because I wanted to go back to Iran to support the Revolution .
Through a college friend who was a relative of Montazeri , I asked him what he thought people like me should do .
His message : " Tell your friend that one can be a soldier of the Revolution and Iran in several different ways .
For him the best is to remain in the United States , learn as much as he can and then serve Iran in any way he can by transferring his knowledge to the younger generations . "
I have tried to do just that .
Finally , I am indebted to Montazeri for his defense of the rights of the political prisoners .
As someone who lost his younger brother at the age of 23 when he and my cousins were executed by the Islamic Republic , I know how it feels to lose loved ones to political violence .
Thus , I greatly appreciate anyone 's efforts on behalf of the political prisoners .
Montazeri's work in this regard was unique .
Shirin Ebadi , the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate , declared in a statement , " I call you father because I learned from you how to defend the oppressed without using violence against the oppressor .
I learned from you that being silent is helping the oppressor .
Father , I learned much from you , although I never [ got the chance to ] show my appreciation for being your child and student .
Father , forgive us . "

The U.S. military 's toughest trucks are getting a new layer of protection – against rocket - propelled grenades .
The Army recently awarded an $ 8 million contract to equip MRAP ( mine resistant ambush protected ) armored trucks with Iron Curtain .
It 's a protection system which blasts incoming rockets before they can hit the vehicle .
If the system works , it could go all long way towards neutralizing one of the deadliest threats American troops face overseas .
The contract calls for the Iron Curtain with Darpa 's sniper - detection system , CROSSHAIRS .
It detects and locates enemy shooters using radar and acoustic sensors , and is intended to work against Rocket Propelled Grenades ( RPGs ) , missiles , bullets and mortar rounds .
Iron Curtain itself is currently designed to deal with RPGs ; the makers Artis LLC planning future developments to deal with more challenging threats .
Iron Curtain system detects and tracks the incoming rocket with a radar , which then cues an optical sensor – a smart camera , essentially .
The optical sensor identifies and classifies the threat – pinpointing the location of the rocket with an accuracy of about half an inch – and selects an aim point .
A row of explosive countermeasures is mounted on a rail running around the top of the vehicle .
The system selects the best one of countermeasures , and fires it vertically downwards at the exact moment the rocket is passing .
This does not destroy the warhead but ' duds ' it so that the warhead deflagrates , rather than exploding properly .
By the end of the collision of RPG and countermeasure , Artis claims , the warhead bounces off of the vehicle 's side .
In field tests mounted on uparmored Humvees , Iron Curtain has proven its effectiveness against RPGs , so the makers ' confidence is understandable .
Here 's some video , from a corny - but - cool National Geographic documentary :
Iron Curtain is one of many , many competing systems for RPG protection , ranging from metal slats and bars to Kevlar airbags and missile - firing Active protection Systems .
Iron Curtain is at the more sophisticated end of the spectrum , and one of its most distinctive features is how the countermeasures work .
Collateral damage is a major issue for " active " protective systems like Iron Curtain .
Whatever you fire at the incoming round is going to end up somewhere , and it may do real damage .
Systems that spray out shrapnel are likely to be a major hazard for anyone in the immediate vicinity .
This can included dismounted troops who have just stepped out of the vehicle , or local civilians if an attack takes place in a crowded area .
One way around this is to use Dense Inert Metal Explosive ( DIME ) , basically micro-shrapnel made of powdered dense metal which only travels a few feet .
Another approach is to have shrapnel made of Reactive Material which burns up in the air and only gets a short distance before it complete vaporises .
The Iron Curtain approach – of simply firing downwards – could be safer than either of these and should ensure that the countermeasures only hit what they ’re aimed at .
It 's not clear how the system could defend against attacks from above , but the makers ' web site says that Iron Curtain " can be configured to protect almost any surface , from just the sides of a vehicle to all - around protection , including top . "
The integration with CROSSHAIRS makes this more than just a system to protect one vehicle .
The aim of CROSSHAIRS is to " engage enemy shooters " with both automatic and man - in - the - loop modes .
And it might even go one step further than that , according to Darpa : " Additionally , the program is investigating the feasibility of a variety of technologies to detect enemy shooters before the firing of a weapon . "
This suggests that in principle , a CROSSHAIRS - equipped vehicle with a convoy could open fire on any potential ambushers before they fire a shot .
Or it might just engage them with something like a non-lethal laser dazzler , which could avert an ambush without risking shooting the wrong people .
It could be a useful capability , and one that can't be delivered fast enough : the MRAP vehicles equipped with Iron Curtain and CROSSHAIRS should be ready for testing in Juy 2010 .
Meanwhile , there are also studies to integrate Iron Curtrain with Hummers and with the LAV 's operated by the Marine Corps .

Epidemic experts say they are investigating the apparent spread of Tamiflu - resistant swine flu virus among four patients at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , N.C. , and five in a hospital in Wales .
These clusters appear to be the first in which a virus resistant to the antiviral Tamiflu , a mainstay of flu treat , has spread from person to person , researchers said Friday .
If Tamiflu - resistant virus spreads widely , swine flu will become tougher to treat and may cost more lives , says Duke 's Daniel Sexton , who is leading the hospital 's investigation .
Doctors say investigations of the two hospital outbreaks are underway , but the preliminary genetic evidence suggests that the virus spread among patients at the hospitals .
" The four patients involved in this situation had the same resistance pattern , " says Sexton , adding that researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now testing virus samples from Duke to see whether they 're identical .
" The resistance pattern suggests that might be the case , " he says .
All of the Duke patients were located in a ward for people with cancer or severe blood disorders .
All were severely ill and were highly susceptible to infections , Sexton says .
The patients became ill with flu in October .
When they did n't respond to Tamiflu two weeks ago , the hospital sent specimens of their virus to see whether it might be resistant to antiviral treatment .
The results came back this week , prompting Duke to launch an investigation .
CDC spokesman Dave Daigle confirmed that three CDC epidemiologists have arrived at Duke to assist in the investigation , alongside infectious disease experts from the hospital and the state health department .
The research team is also trying to determine whether Tamiflu - resistant flu is circulating elsewhere in North Carolina .
Three of the four Duke patients have died , Sexton says .
The fourth is extremely ill but is being treated with another antiviral called Relenza and appears to be recovering .
In Wales , doctors have confirmed five Tamiflu - resistant swine flu cases in one ward of an unidentified hospital .
Three more patients on the ward are being tested for drug - resistant virus ; a ninth patient is infected with virus that is still susceptible to Tamiflu .
" At present we believe the risk to the general healthy population is low , " Britian 's Health Protection Agency said in a statement , noting that there is no evidence that the resistant virus is any more virulent than any other form of flu .
A community - wide investigation is ongoing , the agency said .
So far , like the swine flu virus isolated from the Duke patients , the Wales virus remains sensitive to the antiviral drug Relenza .
As of Friday , the World Health Organization has reported 57 cases of Tamiflu - resistant virus worldwide .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fl. ) is urging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) to propose revisions to the Senate 's cloture rules so that only 55 votes , instead of 60 , would be required to end floor debate .
His effort -- spearheaded with the help of an online campaign at StopSenateStalling.com -- takes special aim at the healthcare debate , which Grayson said has fallen victim to countless overused and unfair filibuster threats over the past few months .

" Why should launching wars and cutting taxes for the rich require only 50 votes while saving lives requires 60 ? " asked Grayson , who listed a series of important bills that passed with fewer than 60 votes .
" Join me in calling for an end to this unfair system , " he added .
" Tell Majority Leader Reid to modify the rules of the Senate to require only 55 votes to invoke cloture instead of 60 .
Fill out the form below to sign the petition today !
" So far , Grayson 's campaign has netted about 7,000 signatures , though a cursory glance at the names on the list yields a few duplicates .
The letter included as part of Grayson 's petition reveals the congressman 's reasoning : A change to the chamber 's historic cloture rules would best serve voters , who elected Democrats in 2008 " with a mandate ... for major change , " he wrote .
House Democrats for the most part have rallied together to overcome GOP opposition with the help of rules that favor a simple majority , but many of the lower chamber 's efforts remain stalled in the Senate because " no- mongering Republicans " have " abused the filibuster rule like never before " and continue to obstruct progress , he added .
Consequently , Grayson stressed his Senate colleagues would be wise to pursue a change to the chamber 's rules that would decrease the number required to invoke cloture from 60 to 55 .
As Grayson pointed out in his letter , the Senate has previously implemented such a change : Lawmakers reduced the minimum for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths in 1975 .
" The filibuster does not appear anywhere in the Constitution .
If the Founding Fathers had wanted it , they would have included it , " the congressman said .
" Instead , this undemocratic rule allows small - state senators representing as little as 11 percent of the country to thwart the will of the other 89 percent .

Police abuse encouraged by higher - up thugs Share This :
The first item : A headline from the Huffington Post
This week , Arpaio and County Attorney Andrew Thomas indicted Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley for the third time .
They also indicted Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox .
Both Stapley ( R ) and Wilcox ( D ) have been vocal opponents of Arpaio 's hardline immigration enforcement policies .
Stapley has been charged with fraud , theft , perjury , forgery , and false swearing .
Wilcox has been charged with conflict of interest , perjury , forgery , and false swearing .
The merit of the charges , though , are lost on a public who is becoming increasingly cynical of the persecution of political foes in Maricopa County ... Last week , Thomas and Arpaio alleged in a RICO ( racketeering ) suit that Stapley , Wilcox , Judge Gary Donahoe , Judge Barbara Mundell , another judge , attorney Tom Irvine , and attorney Ed Novak have engaged in " a pattern of using their offices to benefit themselves " and have conspired to hinder the investigation and block the prosecution of conflicts of interest related to a new $ 347 million court tower .
Then on Wednesday , after Judge Donahoe refused to recuse himself and just hours before Donahoe was set to hear a case that could have resulted in Thomas being barred from prosecuting county officials ( i.e. , Stapley and Wilcox ) , Thomas and Arpaio filed criminal charges against Donahoe for bribery , obstructing a criminal investigation , and hindering prosecution .
Though Thomas indicted Judge Donahoe for bribery ( among other things ) , Thomas concedes that no money has changed hands .
In short , it is an all - out war for power among the corrupt elite and the mask of " serving the public " has slipped away to reveal the grotesque self - serving monster beneath .
I vividly remember Thomas ' office ruining the life of a teenager who was convicted of being a sex offender because he showed a Playboy to a fellow - student who was also ' under - age . '
Nothing but national media made him pause .
At that point , he handed the 3 - year prosecution over to a bootlicking flunky ( rumored to lick other things ) who publicly eviscerated the teenager when it was no longer possible or prudent to prosecute .
The second item : A headline in the ( 12/16 ) Portland Mercury reads
Angela DeCorte signed an agreement ... to â€œhold harmlessâ€  the Gresham officerâ€ ” essentially , agreeing not to pursue legal action .
In exchange , the District Attorneyâ€™s office agreed to drop charges of resisting arrest , theft of services , and interfering with a peace officer against DeCorte .
Officers from Portland and Milwaukie were also involved in the incident on the platform .
BTW , the charges are standard double - speak for when a person has committed no real crime but the police want to arrest him / her anyway .
If you so much as ask for directions of a cop or accidentally step in front of him , he can ( in principle ) arrest you for interfering with a police officer in the line of duty .
If you then say " but I did n't do anything , " he can add on " resisting arrest . "
The amount of time he has ' wasted ' in arresting you is the amount of the " theft of service " you 've committed .
These become bargaining chips with which DAs and others threaten innocent people into relinquishing their right to sue or other protest police abuse .
By design , this leaves the police with zero accountability .
With such institutionalized incentives toward abuse , no wonder the cops have become jackbooted thugs who are far worse than common criminals .
Moreover , if they respond this way to a trivial infraction committed by a mother with child , how do you think they will treat someone with a serious objection ?
That 's how unarmed and innocent people get beaten to death by cops .
Details on DeCorte 's situation are difficult to come by undoubtedly because silence is in the interests of both sides .
The dearth of info has led to some people claimed that commentators who sympathize with DeCorte side are being biased and proceeding on inadequate information .
For me ... the actions of the DAs office is proof enough .
The plea deal offered reflects one of two things : there was no case against her ; or , there was a case / a lawsuit solidly against the cop .
As one commentator declared , " Open your eyes :
If simply threatening to sue when you got arrested was a way to get the charges dropped , then every crook in town would do it ! "
Equally , to anyone who believes that police brutality comes from a few bad apples about whom the higher - ups are ignorant , I declare , Open your eyes !
Police abuse has been institutionalized and protected by the higher - ups who probably care less about your rights and safety than does the cop - on - the - beatâ€ ¦you know , the one who will brutalize you for asking a question .

Two news items involving police misconduct came onto my radar this morning .
Or , rather , I stumbled over a dozen or so but paused on the following two because they touch on another common objection I hear to my continuing and harsh criticism of cops .
Yesterday I rebutted the objection , " What of the good cops that you do n't discuss ! ? "
Today I address the notion that higher - ups do n't know about the transgressions of cops - in - the - field who would be reined in if they did .
I believe the contrary is true .
I think the average cop has become dramatically more brutal , corrupt and otherwise abusive because the higher - ups are on the same trajectory and refuse to hold anyone in the legal system accountable for ' bad acts . '
After all , that 's the same system in which they are committing their own ' bad acts .
' The first item : A headline from the Huffington Post " Sheriff Arpaio Indicts Political Opponents While Feds Investigate Arpaio " for an article in which commentator Dawn Teo explains what 's happening behind - the - scenes in Maricopa County , Arizona vis-a - vis the sheriff 's department , the DAs Office , and City Council .
It is difficult for me decide whether the sadistic and totalitarian Arpaio is more despicable than DA Thomas ... nor could I choose which one is responsible for the suffering of more innocent people at the hands of law enforcement .
( Maricopa includes Phoenix and is the 5th largest county in America . )
The Arpaio referred to is Sheriff Arpaio ( the darling of FOX News for his ' get tough ' attitude ) who is under federal investigation for corruption .
Arpaio and the equally despicable DA Thomas are responsible for the terrible suffering of many innocent people at the hands of law enforcement .
Excerpt from Teo ...

In essence , a woman agreed not to sue for being arrested by brutalized in front of her young daughter for the crime of asking a cop in a subway station why he was tasering a man in custody who was screaming in pain .
The police also threatened to remove custody of the woman 's child because ( apparently ) questioning the police made her an unfit mother .
BTW , the charges are standard double - speak for when a person has committed no real crime but the police want to arrest him / her anyway .

Today members of GenderBloc , a radical queer organization on the University of Cincinnati ’s campus , observed Transgender Day of Remembrance by placing white flags on McMicken Commons , one for each person who dies yearly because of hate crime perpetrated against a transgender person .
The students also chalked messages explaining the flags and denouncing hate .
Two computer programmers who worked for Bernard L. Madoff ’s brokerage firm were arrested on Friday and accused of helping him sustain his long - running Ponzi scheme .
The two men  Jerome O’Hara of Malverne , N.Y. , and George Perez of East Brunswick , N.J.  were also named in a civil case filed on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Securities regulators said that the two men created the computer software that generated the elaborate paper trail that Mr. Madoff used to conceal his fraud from investors and regulators for more than 15 years .
According to the complaints , both men grew uneasy about their role in the fraud three years ago and closed their own Madoff accounts in April 2006 , withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - French scientists have found a way to create human skin rapidly from stem cells , a discovery that could save the lives of many burns victims who are vulnerable to infection and now wait weeks for a skin graft .
The scientists made the breakthrough by creating a patch of human skin on a mouse ’s back using stem cells -- cells which have the ability to develop into any human cell .
Skin grafts have traditionally been created from cell cultures taken from the patient -- a process that takes three weeks , too long for some patients suffering extensive burns .
The new method using stem cells allows hospitals to order human skin as soon as they take in a burns victim .
“ What our findings can provide is a way to cover the burns during those three weeks with skin epidermis ... produced in that factory and sent to the physician at the moment they receive a severely burned patient , ” Marc Peschanski , research director at the institute I - Stem , told Reuters Television .
“ They call the factory and then , immediately , they will get a square meter of epidermis which will be a temporary way to cover the burns , ” he added .
“ We grafted cells on the back of a mouse on which we had created a wound , and we observed twelve weeks later that the epidermis had mended itself , ” said Xavier Nissan , who took part in the study by I - stem , which develops regeneration therapies using stem cells .
In France , 200 to 300 people a year risk dying from severe burns , said Peschanski , who hopes the new method will become a common therapeutic tool .
“ So it is really a new hope for those people and really , any one of us could become a severe burns patient , ” he said .

With some Web services URL canonicalization has a downside .
What works great for major search engines like Google can fire back when a Web service like Yahoo thinks circumcising URLs is cool .
Proper URL canonicalization might , for example , screw your blog ’s reputation at Technorati .
In fact the problem is not your URL canonicalization , e.g. 301 redirects from http://example.com to http://example.com/
respectively http://example.com/directory to http://example.com/directory/, but crappy software that removes trailing forward slashes from your URLs .
Dear Web developers , if you really think that home page locations respectively directory URLs look way cooler without the trailing slash , then by all means manipulate the anchor text , but do not manipulate HREF values , and do not store truncated URLs in your databases ( not that “ http://example.com” as anchor text makes any sense when the URL in HREF points to “ http://example.com/”).
Spreading invalid URLs is not funny .
People as well as Web robots take invalid URLs from your pages for various purposes .
Many usages of invalid URLs are capable to damage the search engine rankings of the link destinations .
You ca n’t control that , hence do n’t screw our URLs .
Never . Period .
Folks who do n’t agree with the above said read on .
TOC : What is a trailing slash ?
About URLs , directory URIs , default documents , directory indexes , …
How to rescue stolen trailing slashes About Apache ’s handling of directory requests , and rewriting respectively redirecting invalid directory URIs in .htaccess as well as in PHP scripts .
Why stealing trailing slashes is not cool Truncating slashes is not only plain robbery ( bandwidth theft ) , it often causes malfunctions at the destination server and 3rd party services as well .
How URL canonicalization irritates Technorati 301 redirects that “ add ” a trailing slash to directory URLs , respectively virtual URIs that mimic directories , seem to irritate Technorati so much that it can’t compute reputation , recent post lists , and so on .
What is a trailing slash ?
The Web ’s standards say ( links and full quotes ) :
The trailing path segment delimiter “ / ” represents an empty last path segment .
Normalization should not remove delimiters when their associated component is empty .
( Read the polite “ should ” as “ must ” . )
To understand that , lets look at the most common URL components :
scheme :// server - name .
tld / path ? query - string # fragment
The ( red ) path part begins with a forward slash “ / ” and must consist of at least one byte ( the trailing slash itself in case of the home page URL http://example.com/).
If an URL ends with a slash , it points to a directory ’s default document , or , if there ’s no default document , to a list of objects stored in a directory .
The home page link lacks a directory name , because “ / ” after the TLD ( .com|net|org| … ) stands for the root directory .
Automated directory indexes ( a list of links to all files ) should be forbidden , use Options - Indexes in .htaccess to send such requests to your 403 - Forbidden page .
In order to set default file names and their search sequence for your directories use Directory Index index.html index.htm index.php /error_handler/missing_directory_index_doc.php .
In this example : on request of http://example.com/directory/
Apache will first look for / directory / index.html , then if that does n’t exist for / directory / index.htm , then / directory / index.php , and if all that fails , it will serve an error page ( that should log such requests so that the Webmaster can upload the missing default document to / directory / ) .
The URL http://example.com
( without the trailing slash ) is invalid , and there ’s no specification telling a reason why a Web server should respond to it with meaningful contents .
Actually , the location http://example.com points to Null ( nil , zilch , nada , zip , nothing ) , hence the correct response is “ 404 - we have n’t got ‘ nothing to serve ’ yet ” .
The same goes for sub - directories .
If there ’s no file named “ / dir ” , the URL http://example.com/dir points to Null too .
If you ’ve a directory named “ / dir ” , the canonical URL http://example.com/dir/ either points to a directory index page ( an autogenerated list of all files ) or the directory ’s default document “ index . ( html|htm|shtml|php | … ) ” .
A request of http://example.com/dir – without the trailing slash that tells the Web server that the request is for a directory ’s index– resolves to “ not found ” .
You must not reference a default document by its name !
If you ’ve links like http://example.com/index.html
you ca n’t change the underlying technology without serious hassles .
Say you ’ve a static site with a file structure like / index.html , /contact/index.html , /about/index.html and so on .
Tomorrow you ’ll realize that static stuff sucks , hence you ’ll develop a dynamic site with PHP .
You ’ll end up with new files : /index.php , /contact/index.php , /about/index.php and so on .
If you ’ve coded your internal links as http://example.com/contact/ etc. they ’ll still work , without redirects from .html to .php .
Just change the Directory Index directive from “ … index.html … index.php … ” to “ … index.php … index.html … ” .
( Of course you can configure Apache to parse .html files for PHP code , but that ’s another story . )
It seems that truncating default document names can make sense for services that deal with URLs , but watch out for sites that serve different contents under various extensions of “ index ” files ( intentionally or not ) .
I ’d say that folks submitting their ugly index.html files to directories , search engines , top lists and whatnot deserve all the hassles that come with later changes .
How to rescue stolen trailing slashes
Since
Web servers know that users are faulty by design , they jump through a couple of resource burning hoops in order to either add the trailing slash so that relative references inside HTML documents ( CSS / JS / feed links , image locations , HREF values … ) work correctly , or apply voodoo to accomplish that without ( visibly ) changing the address bar .
With Apache , DirectorySlash
On enables this behavior ( check whether your Apache version does 301 or 302 redirects , in case of 302s find another solution ) .
You can also rewrite invalid requests in .htaccess when you need special rules :
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase / content /
RewriteRule ^dir1 $ http://example.com/content/dir1/
[ R=301,L ]
RewriteRule ^dir2 $ http://example.com/content/dir2/ [ R=301,L ]
With content management systems ( CMS ) that generate virtual URLs on the fly , often there ’s no other chance than hacking the software to canonicalize invalid requests .
To prevent search engines from indexing invalid URLs that are in fact duplicates of canonical URLs , you ’ll perform permanent redirects ( 301 ) .
Here is a WordPress ( header. php ) example :
$ requestUri = $ _SERVER [ " REQUEST_URI " ] ;
$ queryString = $ _SERVER [ " QUERY_STRING " ] ;
$ doRedirect = FALSE ;
$ fileExtensions = array ( " .html " , " .htm " , " .php " ) ;
$ serverName = $ _SERVER [ " SERVER_NAME " ] ;
$ canonicalServerName = $ serverName ;
// if you prefer http://example.com/*
URLs remove the " www . " :
$ srvArr = explode ( " . " , $ serverName ) ;
$ canonicalServerName = $ srvArr[count ( $srvArr ) - 2 ] . " . " .$ srvArr[count ( $srvArr ) - 1 ] ;
$url = parse_url ( " http:// " .$canonicalServerName .$requestUri ) ;
$ requestUriPath = $ url [ " path " ] ;
if ( substr( $requestUriPath , - 1 , 1 ) != " / " ) {
$ isFile = FALSE ;
foreach ( $ fileExtensions as $ fileExtension ) {
if ( strtolower ( substr ( $requestUriPath , strlen ( $fileExtension ) * - 1 , strlen ( $fileExtension ) ) ) == strtolower ( $fileExtension ) ) {
$ isFile = TRUE ;
}
}
if ( ! $isFile ) {
$ requestUriPath .= " / " ;
$ doRedirect = TRUE ;
}
}
$ canonical Url = " http:// " .$canonicalServerName .$requestUriPath ;
if ( $ queryString ) {
$ canonical Url .= " ? " .
$ queryString ;
}
if ( $url [ " fragment " ] ) {
$ canonical Url .= " # " . $ url [ " fragment " ] ;
}
if ( $ doRedirect ) {
@header ( " HTTP /1.1 301 Moved Permanently " , TRUE , 301 ) ;
@header ( " Location : $ canonicalUrl " ) ;
exit ;
}
Check your permalink settings and edit the values of $ fileExtensions and $ canonicalServerName accordingly .
For other CMSs adapt the code , perhaps you need to change the handling of query strings and fragments .
The code above will not run under IIS , because it has no REQUEST_URI variable .
Why stealing trailing slashes is not cool
This section expressed in one sentence : Cool URLs do n’t change , hence changing other people ’s URLs is not cool .
Folks should understand the “ U ” in URL as unique .
Each URL addresses one and only one particular resource .
Technically spoken , if you change one single character of an URL , the altered URL points to a different resource , or nowhere .
Think of URLs as phone numbers .
When you call 555-0100 you reach the switchboard , 555-0101 is the fax , and 555-0109 is the phone extension of somebody .
When you steal the last digit , dialing 555 - 010 , you get nowhere .
Only a fool would assert that a phone number shortened by one digit is way cooler than the complete phone number that actually connects somewhere .
Well , the last digit of a phone number and the trailing slash of a directory link are n’t much different .
If somebody hands out an URL ( with trailing slash ) , then use it as is , or do n’t use it at all .
Do n’t “ prettify ” it , because any change destroys its serviceability .
If one requests a directory without the trailing slash , most Web servers will just reply to the user agent ( brower , screen reader , bot ) with a redirect header telling that one must use a trailing slash , then the user agent has to re-issue the request in the formally correct way .
From a Webmaster ’s perspective , burning resources that thoughtlessly is plain theft .
From a user ’s perspective , things will often work without the slash , but they ’ll be quicker with it .
“ Often ” does n’t equal “ always ” :
Some Web servers will serve the 404 page .
Some Web servers will serve the wrong content , because / dir is a valid script , virtual URI , or page that has nothing to do with the index of / dir / .
Many Web servers will respond with a 302 HTTP response code ( Found ) instead of a correct 301 - redirect , so that most search engines discovering the sneakily circumcised URL will index the contents of the canonical URL under the invalid URL .
Now all search engine users will request the incomplete URL too , running into unnecessary redirects .
Some Web servers will serve identical contents for / dir and / dir / , that leads to duplicate content issues with search engines that index both URLs from links .
Most Web services that rank URLs will assign different scorings to all known URL variants , instead of accumulated rankings to both URLs ( which would be the right thing to do , but is technically , well , challenging ) .
Some user agents can’t handle ( 301 ) redirects properly .
Exotic user agents might serve the user an empty page or the redirect ’s “ error message ” , and Web robots like the crawlers sent out by Technorati or MSN - LiveSearch hang up respectively process garbage .
Does it really make sense to maliciously manipulate URLs just because some clueless developers say “ dude , without the slash it looks way cooler ” ?
Nope .
Stealing trailing slashes in general as well as storing amputated URLs is a brain dead approach .
KISS ( keep it simple , stupid ) is a great principle .
“ Cosmetic corrections ” like trimming URLs add unnecessary complexity that leads to erroneous behavior and requires even more code tweaks .
GIGO ( garbage in , garbage out ) is another great principle that applies here .
Smart algos do n’t change their inputs .
As long as the input is processible , they accept it , otherwise they skip it .
Exceptions
URLs in print , radio , and offline in general , should be truncated in a way that browsers can figure out the location - “ domain.co.uk ” in print and “ domain dot co dot uk ” on radio is enough .
The necessary redirect is cheaper than a visitor who does n’t type in the canonical URL including scheme , www - prefix , and trailing slash .
How URL canonicalization seems to irritate Technorati
Due to the not exactly responsively ( respectively swamped ) Technorati user support parts of this section should be interpreted as educated speculation .
Also , I did n’t research enough cases to come to a working theory .
So here is just the story “ how Technorati fails to deal with my blog ” .
When I moved my blog from blogspot to this domain , I ’ve enhanced the faulty WordPress URL canonicalization .
If any user agent requests http://sebastians-pamphlets.com it gets redirected to http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/.
Invalid post / page URLs like http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/about redirect to http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/about/.
All redirects are permanent , returning the HTTP response code “ 301 ″ .
I ’ve claimed my blog as http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/, but Technorati shows its URL without the trailing slash .
… < div class= " url " >< a href = " http://sebastians-pamphlets.com "
>
http://sebastians-pamphlets.com</a> </div > < a class= " image - link " href= " /blogs/sebastians-pamphlets.com " >< img …
By the way , they forgot dozens of fans ( folks who “ fave ’d ” either my old blogspot outlet or this site ) too .
I ’ve added a description and tons of tags , that both do n’t show up on public pages .
It seems my tags were deleted , at least they are n’t visible in edit mode any more .
Shortly after the submission , Technorati stopped to adjust the reputation score from newly discovered inbound links .
Furthermore , the list of my recent posts became stale , although I ’ve pinged Technorati with every update , and technorati received my update notifications via ping services too .
And yes , I ’ve tried manual pings to no avail .
I ’ve gained lots of fresh inbound links , but the authority score did n’t change .
So I ’ve asked Technorati ’s support for help .
A few weeks later , in December / 2007 , I ’ve got an answer :
I ’ve taken a look at the issue regarding picking up your pings for “ sebastians-pamphlets.com ” .
After making a small adjustment , I ’ve sent our spiders to revisit your page and your blog should be indexed successfully from now on .
Please let us know if you experience any problems in the future .
Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions .
Indeed , Technorati updated the reputation score from “ 56 ″ to “ 191 ″ , and refreshed the list of posts including the most recent one .
Of course the “ small adjustment ” did n’t persist ( I assume that a batch process stole the trailing slash that the friendly support person has added ) .
I ’ve sent a follow - up email asking whether that ’s a slash issue or not , but did n’t receive a reply yet .
I ’m quite sure that Technorati does n’t follow 301 - redirects , so that ’s a plausible cause for this bug at least .
Since December 2007 Technorati did n’t update my authority score ( just the rank goes up and down depending on the number of inbound links Technorati shows on the reactions page - by the way these numbers are often unreal and change in the range of hundreds from day to day ) .
It seems Technorati did n’t index my posts since then ( December / 18/2007 ) , so probably my outgoing links do n’t count for their destinations .
( All screenshots were taken on February / 05/2008 .
When you click the Technorati links today , it could hopefully will look differently . )
I ’m not amused .
I ’m curious what would happen when I add
if (! preg_match ( " / Technorati/i " , " $userAgent " ) ) {/* redirect code */}
to my canonicalization routine , but I can resist to handle particular Web robots .
My URL canonicalization should be identical both for visitors and crawlers .
Technorati should be able to fix this bug without code changes at my end or weeky support requests .
Wishful thinking ?
Maybe .
Update 2008 -03-06 : Technorati crawls my blog again .
The 301 redirects were n’t the issue .
I ’ll explain that in a follow - up post soon .
China was this morning condemned for its human rights record after a British man who , his supporters say , had mental health problems , was executed for smuggling drugs .
Akmal Shaikh , 53 , was put to death at 10.30 am local time ( 2.30 am British time ) after frantic last - minute pleas for clemency by the Foreign Office failed .
Britain had demonstrated its anger with Beijing over the treatment of Shaikh , who had smuggled 4kg ( 8.8lb ) of heroin into China , when it summoned the Chinese ambassador for a diplomatic dressing down at the Foreign Office .
In what was described as a " full and frank exchange of views " , the Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis asked Fu Ying for clemency and outlined Britain 's concern that China had not taken Shaikh 's mental health into consideration .
Hours before the deadline – and after voicing Britain 's opposition to the death penalty in a telephone call to his Chinese counterpart – Lewis told the ambassador that it was " not right " that Shaikh 's mental health had been overlooked by the court that sentenced him .
Speaking after meeting the ambassador , in Britain 's 27th representation to China on the case , Lewis said : " China fully understands the strength of feeling in this country and around the world . "
But the ambassador made clear that the Chinese judiciary was independent of the government and that the supreme court had made its decision .
On Shaikh 's mental health , she said all his paperwork had been fed into the judicial process , which had now taken its course .
As MPs lined up to criticise China 's action , a spokesman for the embassy said Shaikh had been found with more than 4kg of heroin , and being caught with 50g of heroin was enough for the death penalty under Chinese law .
Downing Street said Britain had done " everything within its power " to secure a fair trial and clemency for Shaikh , who was found guilty of drug smuggling in 2007 .
" The prime minister has intervened personally on a number of occasions : he has raised the case with Premier Wen [ Jiabao ] , most recently at the Copenhagen summit , and has written several times to President Hu [ Jintao ] , " a spokesman said .
MPs were scathing about China .
Ken Purchase , a former Foreign Office ministerial aide and a member of the Commons foreign affairs select committee , called China 's actions " absolutely regrettable " , adding that the country was trying to position itself in the mainstream of international affairs while persisting with " barbaric actions " .
Gisela Stuart , a former Labour minister who also sits on the foreign affairs select committee , said : " When it comes to questions of human rights in China there is still the most enormous gap . "
Shaikh was informed of his death sentence yesterday when British consular officials accompanied two of his cousins Soohail Shaikh and Nasir Shaikh , to the secure hospital in Urumqi where he was being held .
His death sentence marks the first time an EU national has been executed in China in 50 years .
In a statement after the meeting , they said : " He was obviously very upset on hearing from us of the sentence .
We strongly feel that he 's not rational and he needs medication .
We feel a pardon would allow Akmal to get the medical assistance he needs . "
The family filed a last - minute petition for a stay of execution and an application for a special pardon to China 's supreme court , to the president , and to the standing committee of the people 's national congressNational People 's Congress orthe parliament .
Shaikh , a father of three , was arrested in Urumqi in September 2007 and charged with drug smuggling .
He lost a final appeal last week , but campaigners claim his mental illness was not taken into account .
The anti-death - penalty organisation Reprieve said it had medical evidence that Shaikh believed he was going to China in 2007 to record a hit single that would usher in world peace .
It said he was duped into carrying a suitcase packed with heroin on a flight from Tajikistan to Urumqi .
As the hours counted down to his execution , witnesses gave more evidence of Shaikh 's strange behaviour in the past .
Paul Newberry , a British national who lives in Poland , described how Shaikh while there had lived in a fantasy world : " He had no money but was never desperate for it .
He was clearly not desperate enough to smuggle heroin to China . "
Rachel follows up on her reporting on the ' kill the gays ' bill being considered in Uganda .
Her show attempted to get some responses from the American legislators who have decided to inject themselves so deeply into African politics - with predictable results .
Most of them either tried to wash their hands of their part in this absolutely horrid piece of proposed legislation or did n’t bother to respond at all .
The scandal ridden John Ensign ’s office said he was too busy screwing up the health care bill to give a response .
James Inhofe and Sam Brownback did n’t bother to respond , either .
Do n’t hold your breath waiting on those two knuckle - draggers , Rachel .
I ’m sure it will be a cold day in hell before either of them bother to tell the evil “ librul ” lesbian woman why they could care less if you were killed if you were unfortunate enough to live in Uganda , assuming this law gets passed .
Props to Rachel for keeping after this story .
It has to be one of the most disgusting news items I ’ve watched in a very long time and these C - Street wingers need to be held to account for their actions .
It ’s a shame the rest of the media is not giving this story the attention it deserves .
They ’re too busy chasing around the White House party crashers or Tiger Woods ’ mistresses .

GEORGE W. BUSH , THEN - U.S. PRESIDENT : Today on the continent of Africa , nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus -- including 3 million children under the age of 15 .
Ladies and gentlemen , seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many .
Tonight , I propose the emergency plan for AIDS relief -- a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : A legitimately moving moment in President Bush`s State of the Union address back in the year 2003 .
When all was said and done after two terms of the Bush administration , American help fighting HIV and AIDS in Africa was one marquee issue of compassionate conservatism that Mr. Bush could brag about in trying to shape his legacy for historians and he did come back and talk about the issue at the end of his presidency to remind people about that .
The issue of AIDS in Africa indeed became one of the hallmark causes for a lot of different conservatives who wanted to keep the compassionate conservatism idea alive , conservatives like Kansas Senator Sam Brownback .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
SAM BROWNBACK ( R ) , KANSAS : It `s amazing how grateful people are for -- if you save -- help save their lives .
The approval ratings of the United States in Africa , the highest continent in the world .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : But it`s not just that these conservative religious politicians have a generic continent - wide engagement on the issue of AIDS in Africa .
The involvement that these politicians have had has largely been focused on one specific country , Uganda .
When President Bush came into office , Uganda was one of the success stories in Africa when it came to fighting AIDS .
Their success was built around a strategy called ABC .
ABC stood for " abstinence , " " be faithful " and " condoms . "
In other words , first abstain from sex , otherwise be monogamous , otherwise use condoms .
And condom billboards , condom promotion was evident all over the nation of Uganda .
This effort to combat HIV and AIDS through that comprehensive strategy worked pretty well .
Infection rates in Uganda dropped from about 15 percent to 5 percent from 1991 to 2001 .
But then President Bush`s big high - profile push to help fight AIDS in Africa ended up coming with a big catch .
American conservatives wanted the focus to be on abstinence , not on condoms .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BROWNBACK : It`s abstinence - focused .
If you want to stop the spread , the key best way to do it is abstinence .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : When Congress finally passed the big AIDS legislation that President Bush wanted , Republican Congressman Joe Pitts slipped in an amendment that said 33 percent of the funding -- 33 percent -- could only be used for abstinence programs .
Fully , a third of that money earmarked only for abstinence , even as American research consistently demonstrated that abstinence programs just don`t work .
As religious conservatives were pushing abstinence on places like Uganda from Washington , internationally - minded , politically - connected America conservative evangelical began focusing on Uganda as well .
Evangelicals like American Pastor Rick Warren and his Saddleback Church ; evangelicals like the Family which we`ve talked about on this program with Jeff Sharlet .
The Family , of course , is the secretive religious organization that runs the C Street dormitory for lawmakers in Washington .
It `s led by a man named Doug Coe .
Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma credits Doug Coe for launching his own activism in Africa .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
JAMES INHOFE ( R ) , OKLAHOMA : Doug has always been kind of the unseen and very quiet .
He talked me into going to Africa .
I had no interest in going to Africa .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Religious conservatives saw Uganda specifically as a place that they could have some real influence .
Uganda`s first lady became an emphatically born again Christian .
Her husband , the president , is believed to have serious ties to the Family .
Same goes for the ethics minister of Uganda , as well as a number of legislators there .
One of Uganda`s most prominent pastors began speaking at Rick Warren`s mega-church in California .
He became so close with Rick Warren that Rick Warren`s wife reportedly called him her brother .
And while Americans were courting that Ugandan pastor here touting their own compassionate conservatism on the issue of AIDS in Africa , back in Uganda , that pastor was taking up the anti-condom cause , holding public bonfires of condoms , conducting some of the most extreme anti-gay preaching and activism anywhere in the world .
Evangelicals and conservative politicians in this country saw Uganda as a place that they could leave their mark .
Senator Sam Brownback traveled there to look into the AIDS issue in 2005 .
Senator James
Inhofe made at least 20 trips to Africa just since 1999 , mostly to Uganda as well as Ethiopia .
In March of this year , a group of three American evangelicals traveled to Uganda for a conference on the evils of homosexuality .
Their message was that homosexuality is a choice , that it can be cured by a relationship with Jesus , that , in short , you can pray the gay away .
There`s been a dual effort under way here : anti-gay proselytizing by American evangelicals and assurances from conservative American politicians that we can solve that nation`s AIDS problem .
The culmination of these efforts -- this massive focus on Uganda -- is a piece of legislation that`s been introduced in that country now that attempts , it says , to tackle the AIDS problem in that country and the problem of homosexuality all at once .
It`s a bill that calls for the execution of any gay Ugandan who is HIV positive , who is caught having gay sex -- death by hanging specifically .
And it`s not just gay Ugandans who are HIV positive who are being targeted , the sentence just for being gay is life imprisonment .
The sentence for knowing somebody who is gay and not reporting them to authorities , presumably so they can be prosecuted , is three years in prison .
This bill was written by a Ugandan legislator purportedly taken in by Republican Senator James Inhofe and the Family here in America .
Having lit this fuse and created this environment in Uganda where a bill like this can exist , some American evangelicals and conservative politicians are now sort of washing their hands of the whole situation .
Pastor Rick Warren is saying , quote , " It`s not my personal calling as a pastor in America to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations . "
The evangelical leaders who went there in March are now saying their intent was not at all to inspire this type of legislation .
But what about all of the conservative politicians in this country who have shown themselves to have such influence in Uganda and who have decided to concern themselves so publicly with this one specific country in Africa ?
Now that there`s a bill in that country that calls for the execution of people who are gay in that country for the simple fact of being gay , those politicians maybe should say what they think about it .
Family - linked Senator Tom Coburn`s office is telling us today that the senator does not support the legislation .
When we asked his office whether he would communicate that to officials in Uganda where it might matter , the senator had no comment .
Family - linked Congressman Bart Stupak`s office telling us , quote , " Any claim that I support the legislation before the Ugandan parliament is as clueless as it is false . "
Mr. Stupak`s office adding that he believes the State Department is looking into it .
Indeed , the State Department telling us exclusively today that they are looking into the matter saying , quote , " If adopted , a bill further criminalizing homosexuality would constitute a significant step backwards for the protection of human rights in Uganda . "
The State Department tells us that they are in the process of raising this issue with Ugandan authorities .
Now , the office of Congressman Joe Pitts , who slipped in that pro- abstinence language telling us today -- who slipped in that pro-abstinence language in the Bush AIDS bill , he told us today , quote , " What the Ugandan legislation proposes to do is unambiguously wrong and I hope they will not proceed with it . "
These statements , of course , encouraging .
Some other senators remain silent on the issue as yet .
Senator John Ensign`s office , for example , told us today they could not get an answer from him on this issue because he`s been so focused on health care .
We made repeated calls to the offices of Senator James Inhofe and Senator Sam Brownback .
We have yet to hear back from either of them on this issue -- despite the fact they`ve been so proudly outspoken on issues affecting Uganda and , specifically , sexuality in Uganda in the past .
Conservative politicians and evangelicals in this country have made a really big push into Africa in recent years and they`ve even been very delighted to get some political acclaim as compassionate conservatives for having done so .
When a human rights disaster like this is born in that country that they`ve taken so much pride in showing off their influence in , in a country they have been intimately involved in , it could be argued that it is incumbent upon those politicians to at least say what they think about that legislation , if not take action in that country in which they have such influence .
We`ll keep you posted on what we hear from them , their future actions or lack thereof .

Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) -- Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri died overnight , several state - run Iranian news agencies reported Sunday .
His son , Ahmad , told the official IRNA news agency that his 87 - year - old father passed away due to cardiac arrest at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning , Press TV reported .
The semi-official ILNA agency said he died at his home in the Iranian holy city of Qom .
Montazeri -- a key figure in Iran 's Islamic Revolution 30 years ago -- was perhaps the most prominent cleric who publicly criticized the presidential elections last June that returned hard - liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency .
On his Web site , Montazeri described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the " very legitimacy of the Islamic Republic . "
His death is " a terrible blow for the ( reformist ) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months , " said Mehrdad Khonsari , a senior research consultant at the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies in London .
In the last six months , Montazeri had become the voice of the green movement on key foreign policy issues , Khonsari said .
The cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates .
" He was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials , and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment , " Khonsari said .
" He was a major thorn in the back of ( Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali ) Khamenei .
He was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system , " even within the ruling establishment , he said .
Montazeri , for example , took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October , issuing a fatwa , or religious edict , declaring them to be " un- Islamic " and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them , said Nazenin Ansari , diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London .
Iran 's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern , with the United Nations considering expanding sanctions against the Islamic state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb .
Montazeri's upcoming funeral must be a cause for concern for the authorities in Tehran , Ansari said , but because of his standing , they can not ban it .
" Already there are people starting to march towards his home , " she said she had heard from sources inside Iran .
" He has a very large public following especially since the June elections and all his statements in favor of human rights . "
It is not clear whether his death sparked demonstrations , as some reports said .
CNN producer Shirzad Bozorgmehr saw no unusual activity in the vicinity of Tehran University , at Haft - e - Tir Square or Revolution Square in Tehran on Sunday .
Montazeri's
Web site called for a funeral procession from his home to the Massoumeh Shrine in Qom , the holy city where he lived , starting at 9 a.m. on Monday ( 12:30 a.m. ET ) .
Any demonstrations resulting from the burial could spill over into the capital , Ansari said .
" Qom is very close to Tehran and this is a major event , " she said , adding that it is difficult to predict what would happen .
" It would be questionable how a lot of the foot soldiers of the revolution would react . "
The timing of his death could also be significant , she said , since it comes in the month that first saw the demonstrations that spiraled into the revolution that toppled the monarchy and brought the Islamic regime to power .
Montazeri was once a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , who led Iran for a decade after the revolution .
He studied under Khomeini and then acted as his representative in Iran after Khomeini was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy , Ansari said .
Montazeri , too , was jailed and exiled .
After the revolution , he was the heir apparent to Khomeini , and played a key role in writing Iran 's constitution as the first chair of the powerful Guardians Council .
He was also the leader of Friday prayers in Tehran , one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country .
But he was supplanted by the current supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997 .
" His problems with Khomeini started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing ... thousands of leftist prisoners , " Ansari said .
" He never was in agreement with that , and then he started to fade " from power .
" Once Khamenei became leader , Montazeri objected , " she said .
Montazeri said Khamenei " was elevated above his ( religious ) qualifications , " pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah .
" It was then he was arrested . "
Recently he has objected to the current regime 's characterization of his one - time mentor Khomeini as a saint , she added .
And following the disputed elections in June , " he issued a ground - breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the ( reformist ) green movement to the world .
" Given the dynamics of the political situation in Iran , the regime will have difficulty controlling his funeral and where it might lead , " she said .
Montazeri had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004 , arguing in favor of reformist candidates .
Sitting behind his desk with a government minder in the room , he said then that Iran 's Islamic revolution had lost its way .
" Even I , who used to be a leading figure in the revolution , have not the right to speak out , " he said .
" Authoritarianism will never last long .
The gentlemen in power must submit to the wishes of the people , or they will be swept away . "
Der Griff der Parteien nach ARD & ZDF :
Wir wollen das Fernsehen zurück !
Die Parteien sollen sich aus den öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunk - Anstalten heraushalten .
Denn Politiker entlassen Journalisten , von denen sie einst interviewt wurden .
Am Nachmittag des Donnerstags winkt der ZDF - Verwaltungsrat eine neue Chefredaktion für das Zweite Deutsche Fernsehen durch .
Das Gremium ist von der Union dominiert .
Nach dem planmäßigen Abschuss des langjährigen Chefredakteurs Nikolaus Brender sind nun stabile Mehrheiten garantiert .
Das ZDF ist schon genug beschädigt , jetzt soll Ruhe im Mainzer Karton einkehren .
Der Rundfunkfreiheit erweist dieses Hau -Ruck - Verfahren einen erneuten Bärendienst .
Das liegt nicht am wahrscheinlichen Nachfolger Brenders als Chefredakteur : Der bisherige ZDF - Hauptstadtstudio- Chef Peter Frey und dessen Nachfolgerin Bettina Schausten sind bewährte Journalisten .
Und mit Schausten übernimmt endlich eine Frau einen der Top - Jobs im ZDF .
Das lässt sich aber nur arg begrenzt als gute Nachricht verkaufen , denn die neue ZDF - Chefredaktion wird sich mit dem Makel herumschlagen müssen , eine von Roland Kochs Gnaden zu sein .
Auch der ZDF - Fernsehrat ist ausgebremst .
Dort sitzen die Vertreter der Gesellschaft , der Gebührenzahler , der ZuschauerInnen , von uns allen .
Der Rat wollte mehrheitlich den Vertrag von Nikolaus Brender als ZDF - Chefredakteur verlängern .
Nun darf er noch ein bisschen hinterherstänkern , nach ausgewogenem Parteienproporz , versteht sich .
Denn der öffentlich - rechtliche Rundfunk soll wieder zur Tagesordnung zurückkehren , so wünschen es die Mächtigen .
Doch das darf nicht passieren .
Denn nicht nur beim ZDF haben Exekutive und PolitikerInnen die Macht an sich gerissen und treffen Personalentscheidungen über JournalistInnen , denen sie danach im Interview begegnen .
Auch bei vielen ARD - Anstalten sitzen amtierende Minister oder Staatssekretäre in den Gremien .
Nirgendwo ist die Konzentration der Herrschenden so dicht wie beim ZDF .
Doch was hat der bayerische Innenminister Joachim Herrmann ( CSU ) im Rundfunkrat des Bayerischen Rundfunks oder sein hessischer Amtskollege Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) beim Hessischen Rundfunk ( HR ) verloren ?
Beim Südwestrundfunk sitzen die stellvertretenden Ministerpräsidenten von Rheinland - Pfalz und Baden - Württemberg gleich beide im SWR - Verwaltungsrat .
Und damit gar nichts schiefgeht , passt noch ein Staatssekretär im Rundfunkrat auf .
Das ist das Gegenteil von der im Grundgesetz festgeschriebenen Staatsferne des Rundfunks - und dass andere große ARD - Anstalten wie NDR und WDR seit wenigen Jahren ohne Regierungsvertreter in ihren Gremien auskommen , nur ein schwacher Trost .
Gerade der Hessische Rundfunk ist zudem ein Musterbeispiel an vorauseilendem Gehorsam .
Der ehemalige ZDF - Chefredakteur Klaus Bresser nannte die Entlassung seines Nachfolgers zu Recht " organisierte Verfassungskriminalität " durch den hessischen Ministerpräsidenten - doch der Rauswurf kam im Roland - Koch - Sender HR fast gar nicht vor .
Die " Hessenschau " habe auf eine " tägliche Wasserstandsmeldung " zum Thema Brender verzichtet , bestätigt ein Sendersprecher .
Und der Aufruf von 35 prominenten Staatsrechtlern , die sich hinter Brender stellten , sei Teil einer Kampagne gewesen , die der HR nicht habe bedienen wollen .
Zu keiner Zeit habe es sich um Restriktionen gehandelt , heißt es treu beim HR , der Intendant habe lediglich eine Anweisung zu " ausgewogener Berichterstattung " gegeben .
Doch nicht nur die Vertreter der Exekutive in den Aufsichts - und Kontrollgremien des öffentlich - rechtlichem Rundfunks - übrigens auch im Hörfunkrat des immer gern vergessenen Deutschlandradios - sind das Problem .
Denn die Minister und Staatssekretäre treffen hier noch auf jede Menge ParteikollegInnen , die von den Parlamenten in die Gremien entsandt werden .
Natürlich sind auch politische Parteien Vertreter der Öffentlichkeit - doch müssen es gleich noch einmal zwölf Plätze sein wie beim ZDF - Fernsehrat ?
Was muss nun passieren ?
Erstens : Die Vertreter der Exekutive müssen vollständig aus den Gremien des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks verschwinden .
Die Chancen , dies über ein Verfahren beim Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe zu erreichen , stehen gut .
Zweitens muss die Zahl der offiziellen Parteien - Vertreter in den Gremien sinken .
Drittens müssen die Vertreter der gesellschaftlichen Gruppen auf den Prüfstand : Sie bilden die heutige Gesellschaft schlicht nicht mehr ab - und sortieren sich ebenfalls nach parteipolitischer Couleur .
Dieses Problem , sagt der Medien - und Verfassungsjurist Dieter Dörr , einer der Mitunterzeichner des Staatsrechtler - Aufrufs pro Brender , lasse sich " nur bekämpfen mit einem Appell an diese Verbände , ihre Rolle ernst zu nehmen . "
Denn " sie sitzen dort als Vertreter der Gesellschaft , nicht der Parteien " .
Also müssen sie ersetzt werden durch neue gesellschaftliche Vertreter , die dann wirklich diejenigen repräsentieren , denen der öffentlich - rechtliche Rundfunk gehört : Die GebührenzahlerInnen , die ZuschauerInnen - uns .
Supporters of Attorney General Martha Coakley are hailing her victory in the Democratic primary as a historic step for women .
Andrea Kramer of Cambridge was one of hundreds celebrating Tuesday after Coakley 's decisive victory over her Democratic rivals .
" I am so elated .
I did n't let myself believe all week that this was gonna happen .
And I can't believe it 's true , " Kramer said .
" Martha is an outstanding candidate .
She 's gonna make an outstanding senator — and we 've made history to boot . "
Susanna Chase said she was especially moved to see Coakley join hands on stage with state Senate President Therese Murray and the state 's first female U.S. representative , Niki Tsongas .
" It 's time .
And to see her up there with Therese Murray and Nicki — it was just great to see all the women finally making it in Massachusetts , " Chase said .
" She 's gonna be an important voice in Washington for health care , for the people . "
Coakley now faces Republican state Sen. Scott Brown in the general election next month .
Around two weeks ago , I found this email in my inbox , with the subject “ Complaint about Robozzle ” :
Hi Igor Robozzle is really cute , I like it , but why on earth is it polluted with hundreds of invisible links to porn sites ?
From a guy like you I do n’t expect to do such dirty things .
pls remove them .
David
Hoping for a simple explanation , I looked at the source of the RoboZZle front page .
And my heart sunk as I saw hundreds of spam links on the bottom :
< a href= ” < a hijacked site >.com/files/cms/7/pornhud.com-20076.html”>porn hud.com </a>
< a href= ” < a hijacked site >.com/files/cms/7/www.tube.com8-5852.html”>www.tube.com
8</a>
…
The links were inside a < p > tag with visibility set to “ hidden ” , so the links were only visible to search engines , not to human visitors .
I wondered if this affected how my site shows up in search engines .
So , I searched for RoboZZle on Google ( results in Bing or Yahoo ! were not affected ) , and here is what I got :
Oh crap .
This sucks .
How did it happen ?
Site infestation
So what did the hackers do to my poor game ?
I looked around to find what has changed :
Planted links
Multiple pages on my site have been modified to import a planted config.ini file .
The config.ini file contained hundreds of fake links , and was updated every couple hours with a new set of links .
The links all pointed to spammy content planted on another hijacked site .
Planted content
My site also contained thousands of small planted HTML files , similar to the spammy stuff that the planted links pointed to .
An odd folder ( something like http://robozzle.com/old/old2/) contained the HTML files , all with links to suspicious content , and all infested with spammy keywords .
Backdoor PHP scripts
And finally , my site also contained a couple of PHP backdoor scripts .
If you visited a particular URL on the robozzle.com domain , you ’d get a file manager that lets you upload , delete , and manage files on my site , no passwords needed .
As I found out later , the hackers actually knew my FTP password so they did n’t need the backdoors , but they left the backdoors so that they can get in once I change my password .
I carefully checked my site and removed all of this stuff .
Even after I removed the PHP backdoors , the config.ini file continued to get updated until I changed my FTP password .
From that point , I was pretty sure that the attackers somehow got my FTP password .
Looking for other hijacked sites
After cleaning up my site , one of the first things I did was notify the other compromised site , which hosted the planted content linked from my site .
I also wondered if more sites have been hacked in a similar way .
I tried various online tools to find other sites that contain the same links that have been planted on my site .
I found a handful of hacked sites right away .
The fact that the links change every few hours made the task more difficult , though .
The newest links generally point to content that has not yet been crawled by search engines .
But , there is a simple solution .
By looking at older versions of several compromised sites in a service like Google Cache , I eventually found older links that lead me to many more hijacked sites .
After repeating the process for a couple hours , I ended up with a list of over a 150 infected sites , including some fairly major sites .
The larger sites generally removed the infestation quickly , though .
Here are a few sites that have n’t cleaned up , despite the fact that I alerted them at least two weeks ago :
bayonnenj.org – City of Bayonne , NJ
steinercollege.edu – Rudolf Steiner College
dillard.senategop.org – GOP Senator Kirk Dillard
egnc-ibm.gov.eg – Egypt-IBM Nanotechnology Research Center
Do n’t go to these sites unless you know what you are doing .
At the time of writing this post , these sites appear to be compromised , so they may well contain viruses or malware .
UPDATE : Most of the sites are suddenly not showing the links .
My guess is that the hacker group distributed an empty config.ini file after this story became popular on reddit .
I do n’t believe that so many obscure sites on my list would be fixed over night when they have been infected for months before .
Some sites still contain the planted links , but those seem to be the ones that have n’t been updating the links regularly .
These are probably the sites that the hackers only have partial control over at this point ( e.g. , FTP password changed , but there is still a backdoor on the site somewhere ) .
You should be able to view the planted links on all infected sites by looking at Google Cache .
I did my best to contact owners of as many hijacked sites as I could .
Looking for contact information on that many sites – most of them not in English – is a time - consuming endeavor , though .
Tools I used
I found these tools useful when tracking down other sites that have been hijacked :
Yahoo !
Site Explorer
This is the best tool I found to search for sites that link to a particular URL .
At least for my purposes , it worked much better than “ link : ” queries in Google .
Proxify
When visiting sites controlled by hackers , it is worthwhile to be cautious , since the site may be infested by malware .
Proxify sends the request on your behalf , and in the Source mode , sends you the HTTP response as text .
So , the infested site wo n’t see your IP address , and any HTML it sends back will not be rendered , just shown in text format .
Web caches
As you probably know , all major search engines ( Google , Bing , Yahoo ! ) let you view the version of the page cached by the service .
This gives you a version of the page as it was a few days or weeks ago .
And how did I get hacked in the first place ?
Of course , I have been wondering about how the hackers got my FTP password in the first place .
It was n’t really guessable or discoverable by brute force , and I did n’t use the same password on other sites .
And then I got an email from my webhost , notifying me that FTP passwords may have been stolen due to a vulnerability .
They tracked down the issue to a particular software package they use .
So , I assume that my password got stolen this way .
If not , it is also possible that I logged into my site on a computer with a particular virus .
Apparently , that ’s how many FTP passwords get stolen .

Mysterious supernova in a class of its own
Astronomers have discovered what they think is a new type of supernova , which could have implications for how the universe is measured .
Dr Dovi Poznanski of the University of California , Berkeley and colleagues , identified the supernova event in the galaxy NGC 1821 , some 160 million light years away .
Their results appear today in the journal Science .
Astronomers classify supernovae as one of two basic types .
Type 1 supernovae involve white dwarfs that explode after accreting , or gathering , material from companion stars in binary systems .
Eventually when they build up enough mass , they explode as a supernova .
Because type 1 supernovae usually explode at a set size , they 're called standard candles and are used to gauge cosmic distance .
Type 2 supernovae occur when massive stars 10 to 20 times larger than the Sun explode after running out of fuel .
Astronomers determine whether a supernova is type 1 or 2 by examining the radiation they emit .
But when Poznanski and colleagues examined supernova SN 2002bj , they found it did n't fit either category .
The spectrum showed the presence of helium and intermediate - mass elements in SN 2002 bj .
But there was no clear sign of hydrogen or iron , which is typically found in a type 1 supernova .
Poznanski says , this suggests it evolved extremely fast , producing an unusual combination of elements .
" It only barely resembles a type 1a supernova . "
Unique
Dr Stuart Ryder , an astronomer with the Anglo Australian Observatory , says , " a lack of iron usually means the progenitor , a white dwarf , did n't explode completely , but simply ignited the material it had sucked up from its companion star , which is what a ' nova ' does . "
Poznanski believes the answer may be a previously hypothesised event involving a helium detonation in a white dwarf , ejecting only a small envelope of material in the process .
In the case of SN 2002 bj the visible ejecta was just a tenth the amount expected .
Ryder says the event could be something between a nova and supernova .
He says it raises questions as to whether type 1 supernovae are still useful as standard candles to measure cosmic distance , as well as estimating the amount of dark energy in the universe , thought to make up 70 % of the mass of the universe .
The Pentagon continues to pour funding into Arizona - based laser plasma lightning blaster - gun firm Applied Energetics , formerly known as Ionatron .
The US Army says that the firm 's lightning guns are " approaching the level of maturity needed to begin weaponization " .
The military assessment came as the US Army Research , Development and Engineering Command ( ARDEC ) inked a new $ 3.1 m deal with Applied last week .
" Now that the technology is approaching the level of maturity needed to begin weaponization we will be more closely coordinated with Applied Energetics through this contract to fulfil Army mission needs , " said Ben Lagasca , chief of " Advanced Energy Armaments " at ARDEC .
The technology in question is a fairly old idea : that of using a laser beam to create a plasma " tunnel " or " channel " through the atmosphere which would be more conductive than ordinary air .
This would allow a powerful electric spark discharge - an artificial lightning bolt - to be directed onto a target with some precision .
Arizona firm Ionatron began work on this plan in 2002 .
Originally the company thought that it would soon develop lightning blasters so portable and powerful that they would supersede conventional small arms .
Any desired electric intensity from lethal force down to circuitry - disabling - but - harmless - to - people could be selected on one 's battery - powered electric blaster pistol .
There would also be a wireless - Taser stun option in between .
Initially , however , the firm attempted to deploy its zappers as a bomb - disposal tool on robotic vehicles for use in Iraq .
This ended in ignominious failure during 2006 , and Ionatron stock fell off a cliff .
The firm renamed itself , but nonetheless faced huge shareholder anger and earlier this month was forced to cough up $ 6.5 m to settle a class - action lawsuit .
Still , normally the firm 's continued military research contracts would offer some confidence that at least some kind of electric bomb - zapper is in fact on the horizon - if not a proper sci - fi raygun .
But colossal amounts of cash have been targeted by the US forces at finding a technical fix for the insurgent bombs which have been such a deadly scourge overseas .
That money has to be spent - perhaps regardless of how promising any given project may genuinely appear to be . ®
In an internal memo to staff , News Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said he did not think an agreement would be reached with Time Warner Cable regarding carrying Fox 's local TV stations and several cable networks before the deadline of the current deal expired at midnight Thursday .
That means the signals for local Fox TV stations in cities where Time Warner Cable is the distributor will go dark .
Other channels that Fox owns that are part of this spat include FX and some regional sports channels including Prime Ticket and Fox Sports West in Los Angeles .
The two sides have been fighting for several months over the fee Fox wants from Time Warner Cable to keep carrying its local TV stations , including KTTV Los Angeles and WNYW New York .
Fox has sought $ 1 per subscriber , per month , and Time Warner Cable so far has countered with about 30 cents per subscriber .
Carey wrote :
" At this time , it looks like we will not reach an agreement and our channels may very well go off the air in Time Warner Cable systems at midnight tomorrow , December 31 .
We deeply regret that millions of Fox customers will be deprived of our programming , but we need to receive fair compensation from Time Warner Cable to go forward with them .
Some may ask why Fox is n’t providing an extension while negotiations continue – the fact is that we ’ve been trying since the summer to negotiate a fair deal and that further extensions simply extend the period of time that Time Warner profits from our marquee programming without fairly compensating Fox for it . "
Carey went on to say that Fox 's " requested compensation is about equal to what Time Warner Cable pays TNT , a network with a fraction of the ratings and original programming of Fox , or about a quarter of what they pay ESPN , a network we again dwarf in ratings .
Time Warner Cable will claim they cannot afford the rates we are requesting and try to blame us for rate increases to their customers . "
Of course , Carey is a tough negotiator , and this is just the latest in a series of back - and - forth jabs between the two companies .
Late Tuesday , Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Glenn Britt told Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , who previously asked both sides to settle their differences so viewers would n't lose their favorite shows , that he was willing to extend the current deal and enter binding arbitration .
Neither of those options appeal to Fox .

OTTAWA  Canada ’s top military officer said Sunday that on more than one occasion , Canada did not turn over Afghan prisoners to the Afghan government , fearing for their safety .
The acknowledgment by the officer , Gen . Walter Natynczyk , the chief of the defense staff , appeared inconsistent with Canada ’s assertions that such prisoners had not been tortured .
The brief remarks by General Natynczyk at a news conference in Halifax , Nova Scotia , came amid a vigorous campaign by the Conservative government to discredit the testimony of a senior Canadian diplomat , Richard Colvin , who told a parliamentary committee last week that “ the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured ” during his time as second in command at the embassy in Kabul in 2006 and 2007 .
Mr. Colvin detailed his efforts to warn the Canadian government and military about instances in which , he said , prisoners had been sexually abused , beaten , stabbed , shocked , and burned .
He said that those warnings were ignored and that he had been ordered not to document the allegations .
Canada ’s practices regarding Afghan prisoners , Mr. Colvin said , were “ un-Canadian , counterproductive and probably illegal . ”
The government , which earlier used national security laws to block Mr. Colvin from cooperating with a military police commission ’s inquiry into the prisoners ’ fate , responded by attacking Mr. Colvin ’s credibility .
The defense minister , Peter MacKay , dismissed the testimony from Mr. Colvin , now assigned to the Canadian Embassy in Washington , as “ hearsay , second - or third - hand information , or that which came directly from the Taliban . ”

A laser - powered robotic climber has won $ 900,000 in a competition designed to spur technology for a future elevator to space .

Building a space elevator would require anchoring a cable on the ground near Earth ’s equator and deploying the other end thousands of kilometres into space .
The centrifugal force due to Earth ’s spin would keep the cable taut so that a robot could climb it and release payloads into orbit .
Though building a space elevator might require an initial investment of billions of dollars , proponents say once constructed , it would make for cheaper trips into space than is possible using rockets .
But huge technological hurdles must first be overcome , including how to supply power to the robotic climber .
To that end , NASA offered $ 2 million in prize money in a competition called the Power Beaming Challenge , in which robotic climbers , powered wirelessly from the ground , attempt to ascend a cable as fast as possible .
Now , a robotic climber has made a prize - winning ascent worth $ 900,000 , making it the first to win money in the competition , which has occurred annually since 2005 .
Ted Semon , a volunteer with the Spaceward Foundation , a non-profit that organised the competition , and author of the Space Elevator Blog , says the feat shows space elevators are one step closer to getting off the ground .
“ We ’ve done a lot here to demonstrate that this technology is possible , ” he told New Scientist .
“ This is just enormously exciting . ”
The winning climber was built by a team called LaserMotive , based in Seattle , Washington .
Like the other two vehicles in the competition , it used solar cells to absorb energy from a ground - based infrared laser .
Unclaimed pot
On Wednesday , LaserMotive fired up its laser , powering the climber to ascend 900 metres up a cable suspended from a helicopter at Edwards Air Force Base in Mojave , California .
The climber reached the top in just over 4 minutes , for an average speed of 3.7 metres per second .
The team ’s climber repeated the feat at a slightly higher speed of 3.9 metres per second on Thursday .
On Friday , two other teams failed in their final attempted climbs .
That means LaserMotive will receive the entire $ 900,000 NASA set aside for climbers that could make the climb faster than 2 metres per second .
The remaining $ 1.1 million in NASA prize money was reserved for climbs faster than 5 metres per second , which none of the competitors was able to achieve .
Lunar rovers
A climber entered by a team from the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon , Canada , stalled just a few metres up the cable in its final attempt on Friday and was unable to continue its climb .
A climber from a third team , called the Kansas City Space Pirates , also achieved only partial climbs .
NASA was expected to officially recognise LaserMotive as the winner of the $ 900,000 prize in an award ceremony later on Friday .
Though a space elevator remains a distant prospect , NASA is interested in wireless power transmission for other applications , like beaming power to lunar rovers travelling in shadowed craters , where solar energy is unavailable .
MIT neuroscientists asked patients who had recently had their sight restored to identify and trace the shapes they saw .
While a normally sighted person would likely trace two overlapping squares , these patients interpreted the drawing as three separate shapes .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Cases of restored vision after a lifetime of blindness , though exceedingly rare , provide a unique opportunity to address several fundamental questions regarding brain function .
After being deprived of visual input , the brain needs to learn to make sense of the new flood of visual information .
Very little is known about how this learning takes place , but a new study by MIT neuroscientists suggests that dynamic information -- that is , input from moving objects -- is critical .
In the United States , as in most developed nations , infants with curable blindness are treated within a few weeks of birth .
However , in developing nations such as India , there are relatively more instances of children born with curable forms of blindness that are left untreated for want of medical or financial resources .
Such children face greatly elevated odds of early mortality , illiteracy and unemployment .
Doctors have been hesitant to treat older patients because the conventional dogma holds that the brain is incapable of learning to see after age 5 or 6 .
MIT brain and cognitive sciences professor Pawan Sinha , through his humanitarian foundation , Project Prakash ( Sanskrit for " light " ) , has treated and studied several such patients over the past five years .
The Prakash effort serves the dual purpose of providing sight to blind children and , in the process , tackling several foundational issues in neuroscience .
The new findings from Sinha 's team , reported in the November issue of the Journal of Psychological Science , provide clues about how the brain learns to put together the visual world .
They not only support the idea of treating blindness in older children and adults , but also offer insight into modeling the human visual system , diagnosing visual disorders , creating rehabilitation procedures and developing computers that can see .
This work builds on a 2007 study in which Sinha and graduate student Yuri Ostrovsky showed that a woman who had had her sight restored at age 12 had nearly normal visual processing abilities .
These findings were significant since they challenged the widely held notion of a " critical age " for acquiring vision .
However , because they came across the woman 20 years after her sight was restored , the researchers had no chance to study how her brain first learned to process visual input .
The new work focuses on three adolescent and young adult patients in India , and follows them from the time of treatment to several months afterward .
It suggests that " not only is recovery possible , but also provides insights into the mechanism by which such recovery comes about , " says Sinha .
Testing the patients within weeks of sight restoration , Sinha and his colleagues found that subjects had very limited ability to distinguish an object from its background , identify overlapping objects , or even piece together the different parts of an object .
Eventually , however , they improved in this " visual integration " task , discovering whole objects and segregating them from their backgrounds .
" Somehow our brain is able to solve the problem , and we want to know how it does it or how it learns to do it , " says Ostrovsky , lead author of the new paper .
' Many different pieces '
One of their subjects , known as S.K. , suffered from a rare condition called secondary congenital aphakia ( a lack of lenses in the eye ) and was treated with corrective optics in 2004 , at the age of 29 .
After treatment , S.K. participated in a series of tests asking him to identify simple shapes and objects .
S.K. could identify some shapes ( triangles , squares , etc. ) when they were side - by - side , but not when they overlapped .
His brain was unable to distinguish the outlines of a whole shape ; instead , he believed that each fragment of a shape was its own whole .
For S.K. and other patients like him , " it seems like the world has been broken into many different pieces , " says Sinha .
However , if a square or triangle was put into motion , S.K. ( and the other two patients ) could much more easily identify it .
( With motion , their success rates improved from close to zero to around 75 percent . )
Furthermore , motility of objects greatly influenced the patients ' ability to recognize them in images .
During follow - up tests that continued for 18 months after treatment , the patients ' performance with stationary objects gradually improved to almost normal .
These results suggest that movement patterns in the world provide some of the most salient clues about its constituent objects .
The brain is programmed to use similarity of dynamics to infer which regions constitute objects , says Sinha .
The significance of motion may go even further , the team believes .
It may serve to " bootstrap " the learning of rules and heuristics by which the brain comes to be able to parse static images .
The idea is simple but far - reaching .
Starting from an initial capability of grouping via motion , the brain begins to notice that similar dynamics are correlated with similarity in other region attributes such as orientation and color .
These attributes can then be used even in the absence of motion .
In addition to understanding how the human visual system works , the findings could help researchers build robots with visual systems capable of autonomously discovering objects in their environment .
" If we could understand how the brain learns to see , we can better understand how to train a computer to do it , " says Ostrovsky .
Other authors of the paper are Ethan Myers , an MIT graduate student in brain and cognitive sciences , and Suma Ganesh and Umang Mathur of Dr. Shroff 's Charity Eye Hospital in New Delhi , India .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
The Silverlake Conservatory of Music is a quaint storefront nestled in a hipster block of Los Angeles called Sunset Junction .
Just before 3:30 p.m. on weekdays , kids stream through the front door toting drumsticks , violins and guitar cases , the latter taller than they are .
They 're here to learn the traditional fundamentals of playing an instrument .
In the corner , a wiry man with tattooed knuckles is playing the piano .
It 's Flea , the bass guitarist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
He founded the nonprofit music school in 2001 with his childhood friend , Tree , aka Keith Barry , who teaches and serves as the Conservatory 's dean .
The two were band geeks together in junior high and high school .
" In high school and after high school , I was heading for disaster , " recalled Flea , who was then known by his given name , Michael Peter Balzary .
" I was on drugs ; I was robbing people 's houses ; I was wild on the street .
" But lucky enough , through the public school system , I had been able to have some music education , and that gave me something to focus on , and discipline -- like a family to feel part of .
There was a healthy family . "
Around the time of the Chili Peppers ' " Californication " tour , Flea took in a basketball game and happened to sit next to a woman who introduced herself as the music teacher at his alma mater in L.A. , Fairfax High .
She invited him for a visit .
" I went there , and it was just barren .
No funding , no instruments , nothin ' .
It made me feel empty inside .
That 's when I thought , ' I need to start a music school -- a nonprofit music school .
Anyone who wants to go can go . '
I was lucky enough to have the dough , and this place is flourishing . "
After an initial investment of a few hundred thousand dollars from Flea 's own pocket , the doors of the Silverlake Conservatory of Music opened to the public .
Of the school 's 900 students , 25 percent are on scholarship .
( Those who can afford it pay $ 25 per half - hour lesson . )
Flea and Tree hope to expand that number to 50 percent as the budget for music education shrinks in public schools .
" For us to just be OK and do what we 're doing -- in terms of the amount of kids that come for free -- we have to raise a million a year to break even , " Flea confided .
" I do n't believe that we 've gotten one penny from the government . "
There 's a big tree painted on a wall in the lobby .
Hanging from it -- like a second - grade art project -- are red apples bearing names like Metallica , Warner Bros . and Andy Summers , the guitarist from the Police .
They 're some of the Conservatory 's benefactors .
Summers wrote a hefty check and donated a vintage Mercedes that was auctioned off for a total donation of $ 40,000 .
Metallica headlined one of the school 's annual " Hullabaloo " benefit concerts .
Eddie Vedder , Patti Smith , Ben Harper and , of course , the Red Hot Chili Peppers have also lent their talents .
But make no mistake ; this is no School of Rock .
" It 's not about being famous .
It 's not about being a rock star or anything like that .
We 're just teaching fundamentals and technique of playing music , " Flea said .
One of those students is 10 - year - old Leo Decter , who sits in the lobby , demonstrating his guitar skills .
" My mom recently played me some Red Hot Chili Peppers around the house .
I liked some of it , but some of it I did n't like so much , " he admitted with a sheepish smile .
Terror In The Nursery
Police counter - terrorist units in the U.K. are now monitoring nursery - age kids for signs of Islamic extremist sympathies , The Times reports .
Not sure how that works :
Do they demand all foreign occupations end before they 'll eat their veggies , or what ?
" I do hope that you will tell me about persons , of whatever age , you think may have been radicalised or be vulnerable to radicalisation ... I will report back any information or intelligence which may suggest someone is a terrorist , or is planning to be one . " - police email to community groups .

Mum Joleen Baughman 's life is made hell by a car crash injury that left her constantly craving sex .
The smash two years ago damaged a nerve in her pelvis which controls desire , leaving it permanently switched on .
It means Joleen , 39 , becomes aroused by even the slightest movement - while vacuuming , sitting on a bus , bending over or walking across a room .
She said : " It 's unbearable .
Just my clothes rubbing gets me so aroused that I can hardly think straight .
" It 's very embarrassing and it's impossible to concentrate . "
The mum of two is officially suffering from a rare condition known as Restless Genital Syndrome or Persistent Sexual Arousal .
Joleen , of New Mexico , says even regular sex with husband of 20 years Brian does not alleviate her symptoms .
She added : " We 'd have sex once and I 'd feel no release at all .
" So we'd go again and then it would start really hurting but I would still want sex , even more than before .
" If my husband managed to go for a third time it would be agony but I would still feel no release .
" Being aroused pretty much 24 - hours a day is exhausting .
" It 's so embarrassing .
I have to try to keep my feelings under control and to ignore them so I can get on with normal life .
" But I often worry people can guess what I 'm feeling even though they can't . "
Joleen , who has to take sleeping pills at night , added : " If my urges get really strong I lie down very still so there is no vibration at all and that helps a little bit .
" It 's mind over matter .
But I 'm hoping a medical cure can be found in the future . "
Market Research Findings is reporting Black Friday Traffic To Online Shopping Sites Grows 10 Percent .
Despite Challenging Economy , Black Friday Traffic To Online Shopping Sites Grows 10 Percent Year Over Year
Nielsen Online , a service of the Nielsen Company , reported today that Web traffic from home and work to the Holiday eShopping Index increased 10 percent year over year on Black Friday , growing from 28.8 million unique visitors in 2007 to 31.7 million unique visitors in 2008 across more than 120 representative online retailers .
Holiday eShopping Index Category Growth
Consumer Electronics was the fastest growing product category on Friday , increasing 219 percent from the previous Friday , November 21st .
Shopping Comparison / Portals and Toys / Videogames took the No. 2 and No. 3 spots , with 83 and 73 percent Web traffic growth , respectively .
“ Even with the weakening economy , an unstable stock market and a rising unemployment rate , Black Friday traffic to online retail sites grew at a double digit rate this year , ” said Ken Cassar , vice president , industry insights , Nielsen Online .
“ Consumers are continuing to shift their holiday shopping to the Web for the convenience of not having to fight the crowds and to further stretch shrinking budgets .
The fact that the Shopping Comparison / Portals category was the second fastest growing segment indicates that consumers continue to see the Web as the source for determining the best deals and prices of the season , which we expect to be top of mind for holiday shoppers this year . ”
Cassar continued , “ With the season underway and consumers back at work , it will be interesting to compare activity for Cyber Monday and to see if the initial growth rate we saw on Black Friday holds up throughout the holiday shopping season . ”
Black Friday Top 10 Online Retail Destinations
eBay was the top online retail destination on Black Friday with 9.8 million unique visitors , while Amazon and Wal - Mart followed with 8.4 million and 6.0 million unique visitors , respectively .
Among the top ten online retail destinations , Circuit City was the fastest growing on Friday , increasing 352 percent over the previous Friday .
Best Buy ranked No. 2 with a 196 percent increase in Web traffic and Target rounded out the top three with a 136 percent week over week growth .
Shoppers Seek ‘ Elusive Game ’
Shoppers took advantage of Black Friday discounts to snap up televisions , laptop computers and robot hamsters at Best Buy Co. , Target Corp. and Toys “ R ” Us Inc. stores from New Jersey to Texas .
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. , the world ’s largest retailer , drew crowds with $ 298 Hewlett - Packard laptop computers and other doorbuster specials that went on sale at 5 a.m. Best Buy Inc. , the biggest electronics chain , had bigger early - morning crowds than last year , Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn said .
The lines in front of the stores were longer , and the company ’s Web site attracted more visitors , Dunn said .
“ Those are both directionally important indicators for us , ” Dunn said in a Bloomberg Television interview .
“ I do this because of my family , ” Eihab Elzubier , a truck driver , said as he stood at the head of the line outside a Best Buy in Greensboro , North Carolina , before the store opened this morning .
He arrived at 9 a.m. yesterday and kept his place in line with help of his wife , mother and sister .
$ 1,000 Savings
Elzubier , 41 , figured the 20 - hour wait will save him as much as $ 1,000 .
He planned to buy a 42 - inch Samsung flat - panel TV for $ 547.99 , a Sony laptop computer for $ 399.99 , a Compaq laptop for $ 179.99 , software and accessories .
The 12,000 - car parking lot at Taubman Centers Inc. ’s Woodfield Mall in Chicago was 35 percent full by 6 a.m. , compared with 28 percent last year , Bill Taubman , chief operating officer of Taubman Centers , a U.S. real estate investment trust with 24 malls , said in a telephone interview .
“ There ’s a little more traffic than last year across the board , maybe 10 percent , ” he said .

1/4/2010 : The WSJ again says it 's shipping in March after being announced later this month ( though the " ship date has n't been finalized and could still change " ) , while All Things D says more specifically it 's being announced Jan. 27 .
The WSJ also says it " will come with a 10 to 11 - inch touch screen , " that " Apple was working on two different material finishes for the device " and cites analysts who claim it will be $ 1000 , which might include unlimited Wi -Fi hotspot access of some kind .
Uh , What 's It Called ?
The iPhone was called the iPhone years before Steve Jobs ever took the stage to announce it .
We do n't have the luxury of such clarity here .
I would think the name has no more than two syllables , personally .

Overwhelmingly what " evidence " there is points to some form of Slate .
Not only did Apple register the domain iSlate.com through an intermediary to keep it a secret ( discovered by Mark Gurman ) , they 've trademarked it through a shell company called Slate Computing ( signed for by Apple 's Senior Trademark Specialist ) and registered domains and trademarks in Europe through their usual IP law firm , utilizing their standard secret trademark practices , last used with the iPhone .
They 've also registered " Magic Slate " through the same company .
And , while we initially blew off NYT editor Bill Keller referencing an " Apple Slate " in a speech as meaningless , it 's a whole lot curiouser now .

Update 12/29/2009 : Another shell company , iGuide Media—using Apple Senior Trademark Specialist Regina Porter as the signatory — applied for a trademark on iGuide , which seems , from the trademark description , to a be service less so than a piece of hardware :
Downloadable electronic publications in the nature of books , magazines , newsletters , journals , and blogs in the fields of entertainment , sports , science , history , culture , celebrities , news , current events , politics , technology , and education

Borders referenced an " Apple iPAD " in a survey , but it sounds like the sad invention of a survey copywriter who hit caps lock instead of shift , not to mention a digital feminine hygiene product .
Apple also registered a trademark for TabletMac , but most likely to protect the Mac brand name from modders ( it sounds unwieldy and gross ) .

Apple 's put a lot of effort into iSlate it seems .
Is that the name of the Apple Tablet ?
When 's It Coming ?
Update 1/4/2010 :
The WSJ again says it 's shipping in March after being announced later this month ( though the " ship date has n't been finalized and could still change " ) , while All Things D says more specifically it 's being announced Jan. 27 .

Well , obviously everybody who picked a day before today is wrong .
Which leaves everyday after today !
The overall consensus is that 's being announced in late January — note , though , that a lot of the people who 're part of the new January cabal were the same people convinced it was coming in the fall .

iLounge predicted awfully specifically back in September that " Apple is currently planning to announce it on or before January 19 , 2010 . "
The Financial Times
said two days ago that Apple is expected " make a major product announcement on Tuesday , January 26th " at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco , where Apple 's rented a stage for " several days . "
Silicon Alley Insider says that Apple is going to demo a tablet in January .
But when can you actually hold one ?
From most to least specific :
The Wall Street Journal says the tablet is actually going to ship in March , and an analyst said it 's coming in March or April .
iLounge says it'll hit stores in May or June , like the iPhone .
Digitimes reported Foxconn is supposed to have almost half a million of 'em shipped by April .
Little emperor of Apple analysts Gene Munster says the first half of 2010 .
A bunch of connected Mac people just say 2010 .
Advertisement
Everybody from the WSJ to Apple fan sites are convinced the tablet is being announced sometime late next month , shipping 2 - 6 months afterward , so hype and development can bloom , like the iPhone .
( Though most of 'em were wrong three months ago . )

How Much Is It Gonna Cost ?
The iPhone was $ 600 .
Then sales stopped being a -mazing and it dropped to $ 400 .
When the iPhone 3G came out , it went to $ 200 and everybody bought one .
So , uh , how much is the tablet gonna be ?
Advertisement
Update 1/4/2010 : The WSJ cites analysts who claim it will be $ 1000 , which might include unlimited Wi -Fi hotspot access of some kind .
Everybody says roughly the same thing : AppleInsider has said it 's " expected to retail for somewhere between the cost of a high - end iPhone and Apple 's most affordable Mac notebook . "
Our insider told us it would " cost $ 700 to $ 900 , " or " more than twice as much as a netbook . "
Taiwan Economic
Times says it 's between $ 800 and $ 1000 .
China Times , while they got the date pegged to the price horribly wrong , said 800 bucks .
And then there 's DigiTimes , who says the whole reason the tablet was " delayed " was because it was getting an OLED upgrade , so it'd be a whopping $ 1500 to $ 1700 .
The final word comes from Steve Jobs who said " we do n't know how to build a sub - $ 500 computer that is not a piece of junk . "

Survey — and logic — says it'll be pricier than an iPhone and more expensive than a MacBook .
Which does n't say a lot .
If you had to pick a number , $ 800ish seems like the safest bet .

How Big Is It ?
The most important spec — and maybe the biggest mystery — is , well , how big the tablet is .
Three sizes dominate rumors , tied to the size of panels produced by display manufacturers : 7 inches , 9.6 ( or 9.7 ) inches , and 10.6 inches .

Let 's go from least to most specific .
Apple reportedly told publishers it's " small enough to carry in a handbag but too big to fit in a pocket . "
A company discovered in its traffic logs an " unannounced Apple product with a display somewhere between an iPhone and a MacBook , " reported the NYT .
The WSJ reported it 's " smaller than [ Apple 's ] current laptop computers but bigger than the iPhone or iPod Touch . "

Apple analyst king of the dweebs Gene Munster , after speaking to " component contacts " in Asia , says it 's between 7 and 10 inches .
TechCrunch says it 's 7 or 9 inches .
Digitimes says there 's two tablets , one that 's 9.6 inches ( with OLED ) and another that 's 10.6 inches .
Taiwan Economic
News says 9.6 inches too .
Actually respectable news organization Dow Jones says Apple ordered displays from Wintek that are " between 9.7 and 10 inches . "
Oh , and there might be ginormous tablets somewhere out there .

Update 1/4/2010 : The WSJ says it " will come with a 10 to 11 - inch touch screen . "
The Financial Times and Reuters both say it 's 10 inches .
So does our insider .

iLounge presents a unified theory of the tablet universe that would explain the multiplicity of sizes :
There have been three prototypes , and the initial one had a 7 - inch screen , which was too small , so the latest version is 10.7 inches .
Whatever the exact size , they say , it has " 7 x the touchable surface area " as the iPhone
Let 's just stick with bigger than an iPhone , but smaller than a MacBook .
What 's Inside
There 's been surprisingly little discussion of the actual specs beyond the size of the screen — storage , memory , processor , etc .
Most of what little talk there has been has revolved around the networking capabilities .
Advertisement
There could be versions with 3G and without .
Specifically , HSDPA ( meaning it would only work on AT&T or T - Mobile in the US ) .
Oh look , a SIM card tray !
But maybe it'll be on Verizon said BusinessWeek .
Hey , maybe even Verizon LTE 4G wireless !
strong > Update 1/6/2010 : Chalk up another vote on Verizon wireless inside .
This analyst is sure : " Definitely Verizon .
I 've been told that 's a certainty . "
Mmmmhmmmm .

As for the processor , Intel Germany CEO passed gas about a bigger " version of the iPhone " powered by Atom .
Dean Takahashi says that the tablet will be the first device using chips that Apple 's designed in - house through PA Semi , the chip company Apple bought a while ago , and that the chips are possibly ARM - based .
( Update 1/6/2010 : Some analyst heard " based on conversations with Apple 's design manufacturing partners " it 's going to use a PA Semi designed chip . )

Update 1/4/2010 : Not really " inside , " but the WSJ says " Apple was working on two different material finishes for the device . "
Fuzzy and rubbery ?
Update 1/8/2010 : Reuters reports that AVY Precision Technology will start producing " aluminum casings " for the tablet next month , in time for a " second quarter " launch .
Aluminum .
Mmmm .

Update 1/10/2010 : France Telecom / Orange exec Stéphane Richard may or may not have said " yes " to questions about a webcam in the tablet .
Update 1/12/2010 : The Grubes hears there is " no camera , webcam or otherwise , on The Tablet . "

Aaaaaannnd it coooooooould have an OLED screen , if it cost 1500 bucks .
A 3G option seems very possible , as does a secret - sauce processor , but who knows ?

Um , Steve Jobs , duh .
A whole bunch of new multitouch engineers .
Oh , and the Newton guy is back .

Quanta might be making it .
Or Foxconn ( who makes the iPhone and got a guy killed over a leaked prototype ) .
With a display made by LG ( who makes the gorgeous , if flaky , panel inside the 27 - inch iMac . )
Or maybe the display 's from Wintek , according to Reuters and Dow Jones .
The battery might be made by Dynapack .

Besides Apple , again , who knows ?

Patent Soup
The thing about patents is that , besides the fact they 're patenting something , they do n't say a whole lot , at least not about actual products .
But here 's a few interesting ones pertaining to a tablet .
Advertisement
Update 1/5/2009 : A real interesting one is for a " touch screen device , method and graphical user interface for manipulating three - dimensional virtual objects . "
Update 1/7/2010 :
This is a really neat patent for using the screen 's pixels themselves as touch sensors ( instead of placing the touch layer on top of the display ) , leading to super thin devices .
Advertisement
This patent for a " display housing for a computing device " sure sounds like a tablet , which might fit into the tablet docking station in this patent , and you might use two hands , as shown in this patent , to interact with a multitouchable OS X , generously illustrated in this patent , unless you use a pen ( ha ha ha ) .
And it might be bumpy , in a cool way .
Advertisement
Patents do n't mean a whole lot , so do n't expect any of them to actually make it into a tablet .
They could , though .
The Backstory
It 's fairly well known the iPhone was born from efforts to develop a touchscreen tablet computer .
It was simply miniaturized , and uses tech from FingerWorks , a touch interface company Apple bought .
The NYT reported Apple 's been working on it since 2003 , when they built several prototypes using a battery - slaying PowerPC processor .
Our insider said that Apple 's been working on it for 4 - 6 years , and that the first prototype of the current version was developed in 2008 .
Steve Jobs killed the PowerPC tablet , according to the NYT , because Jobs asked what tablets were good for besides surfing the web while sitting on the toilet .
The WSJ reported he 's killed it twice already .

Update 1/6/2010 : Apparently , Apple expects to sell 10 million of them this year , according to a former Google exec , though his information did n't come from Apple , so I 'm not sure who 's expecting what then .
Advertisement
Update 1/11/2010 : Apple just turned off the lights at Fingerworks.com , whose IP could show up in the tablet .
Update 1/14/2010 : Apple hit Gawker with a cease - and - desist letter talking about how Gawker 's bounty for Tablet info is a no - no , which seems like a sorta soft confirmation there is something , since that 's when Apple tends to sue people :
Apple has maintained the types of information and things you are soliciting - " how it 'll work , its size , the name , the software , " as well as any possible details about the product 's appearance , features , and physical samples - in strict confidence . "

What 's It Going to Do ?
Perhaps the most important question of all :
What 's it actually like ?
Advertisement
Most of the excitement lately is that it 's going to redefine newspapers and magazines — we broke the news , using multiple sources , that Apple was talking with several media companies rooted in print about content for the tablet .
Also , we heard there might be some kind of textbook content too .
Plus , we 're not the only ones who 've heard it 's got an ebook bent .
Advertisement
Also , well , it depends on the OS .
i Phone OS 3.1 had clear traces of new Apple iProducts , and some people say it 's a bigass iPod touch , or at least running iPhone OS , which sorta fits with iPhone app developers supposedly being asked to make higher res versions of their apps for demonstration .
It apparently fits in with the iTunes remodeling Apple 's got going on .

Update 1/13/2010 :
It might be like an " iPhone on steroids . "
Update 1/8/2010 : Apple 's been working on a multitouch version of iWorks for a couple of years , according to a former Apple designer .
Could it be for the tablet ?

The NYT reported " You will be very surprised how you interact with the new tablet , " whatever that will come to mean .
As much as Steve Jobs saying they 've got some " interesting ideas " about small computers , presumably .
Martha Stewart is hyped about it , maybe ' cause it has something to do with diners .

Everybody pre-conceived the iPhone based on the iPod and , to a lesser extent , the Newton .
Everybody was wrong .
Today , most everybody is pre-conceiving the tablet based on the iPhone .
Maybe we 're all wrong again , or maybe the leaks are better this time .
Your Turn
You know our mantra about rumors : Never trust them .
But putting all of them together , we 've definitely got some ideas now .

If there 's any rumor we missed — or you have a tip ( we 're good at keeping secret identities ) — let us know .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A growing storm of debris flying around in space is dramatically increasing the risk of orbital crashes , and steps to avoid them will add greatly to the costs of future space flight , British space experts say .
A ball of twisted metal , purported to be fallen space junk , is pictured on a farm in southwestern Queensland in this undated handout photograph received March 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / James Stirton / Handout
Their study into the future of space travel predicts that “ close encounters ” in orbit will rise by 50 percent in the next 10 years and by 250 percent by 2059 to more than 50,000 a week .
“ The time to act is now , before the situation gets too difficult to control , ” said Hugh Lewis of the University of Southampton ’s school of engineering science , who led the study .
“ The number of objects in orbit is going to go up , and there will be impacts from that . ”
The U.S. military said on Tuesday it is tracking 800 satellites on a daily basis for possible collisions and expects to be able to track 500 more by the year ’s end .
Lewis ’s team looked back to the beginning of the space age , when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 in 1957 , to analyze how cluttered space has become since then and how much more so it is likely to be in future .
While the number of close encounters -- defined as objects passing within 5 km of each other -- is set to rise sharply , Lewis said the main effect would not necessarily be an increase in crashes , but in the number and cost of steps to avoid them .
His study estimated that satellite operators will have to make five times as many collision avoidance moves in 2059 as they will in 2019 -- each of them a strategic operation that takes time , skill and money .
Lewis was unable to put a price on avoidance steps , but said they would need to be high priorities in future space budgets .
COLLISION THREATS
Space junk -- or “ orbital debris ” -- can take many forms , ranging from used - up parts and defunct satellites , to fragments of space vehicles , particles from explosions and even flakes of paint and dust .
The amount of space debris remained relatively manageable for the first part of the space age , but two major events in recent years dramatically changed the scene , he said .
In 2007 , China destroyed one of its own defunct satellites with a missile -- spewing a shower of debris .
And in February , two large satellites -- a telecoms satellite owned by Iridium and a defunct Russian military satellite -- collided above the Russian Arctic and were destroyed .
“ Those two events generated an enormous number of fragments , contributing about 40 percent to the total number of objects in orbit now , ” Lewis said in a telephone interview .
“ When you look forward and see collisions are predicted , you need to anticipate that each of these ... will contribute to the problem in a significant way , which is obviously very worrying . ”
A tiny piece of space junk about 1 cm long forced astronauts briefly to evacuate the International Space Station in March when it came too close .
“ It ’s all about speed , ” said Lewis .
“ For things to be on orbit , typically they are moving at speeds of around 7.5 km per second -- that ’s relative speed of 15 km per second for things heading toward each other .
So you only need something the size of a marble to completely destroy a spacecraft . ”
A SIGGRAPH paper by Qiming Hou , Kun Zhou , Baining Guo , abstract :
We present BSGP , a new programming language for general purpose computation on the GPU .
A BSGP program looks much the same as a sequential C program .
Programmers only need to supply a bare minimum of extra information to describe parallel processing on GPUs .
As a result , BSGP programs are easy to read , write , and maintain .
Moreover , the ease of programming does not come at the cost of performance .
A well - designed BSGP compiler converts BSGP programs to kernels and combines them using optimally allocated temporary streams .
In our benchmark , BSGP programs achieve similar or better performance than well - optimized CUDA programs , while the source code complexity and programming time are significantly reduced .
To test BSGP 's code efficiency and ease of programming , we implemented a variety of GPU applications , including a highly sophisticated X3D parser that would be extremely difficult to develop with existing GPU programming languages .
The language acts to simplify CUDA , which reminds me of assembly code even if it uses C syntax , with , among other things , a higher - level memory model and implicit data - flow ( so you do n't have to explicitly partition your code between different kernels ) .
Here is one trick that really impressed me :
findFaces ( int * pf , int * hd , int * ib , int n ) { spaw n ( n * 3 ) { rk = thread .
rank ; f = rk/3 ; v = ib[rk ] ; thread.sortby( v ) ; require owner = dtempnew [ n ] int ; rk = thread.rank ; pf[rk ] = f ; owner[rk ] = v ; barrier ; if ( rk == 0 ||owner[rk - 1 ] != v ) hd[ v ] = rk ; } }
After the call to sortby , all threads are sorted by rank according to the values of v , rather than explicitly sorting a list or some other auxiliary data structure that would have to be allocated into memory .
In other words , the call forces a reality where all the threads are coincidentally arranged in the way we want them to be ... an interesting PL concept .
Global carbon - dioxide emissions are rising fast , global temperatures continue to climb at a pace in line with projections , and polar regions are losing ice faster than climate models have projected .
These are some of the recent research findings highlighted by a group of 26 climate scientists in a report released Tuesday dubbed The Copenhagen Diagnosis .
The purpose of the effort , say researchers from eight countries , including the US , is to update policymakers and the public about the pulse of the planet ahead of the climate - treaty negotiations scheduled to begin in the Danish capital Dec. 7 .
The assessment comes amid a controversy over hacked e-mails of climate scientists – including a few who contributed to this effort – that global warming skeptics are using to question climate science .
The new report 's bottom line :
If the goal is to try to hold global average temperatures to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) above preindustrial levels , global greenhouse - gas emissions need top out sometime between 2015 and 2020 .
To stabilize the climate around that 2 - degree goal , the global economy needs to reduce average carbon - dioxide emissions to less than 1 metric ton per person per year by 2050 , the group adds .
This is equivalent to cutting per capita emissions by 80 to 95 percent below 2000 levels in developed countries by 2050 .
The report highlights results from some 200 recent studies in hopes of influencing upcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen , the researchers say .
The benchmarks it sets out for reaching the 2 - degree neighborhood are n't significantly different from those the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) set out two years ago .
Still , " we felt that we needed to call attention of the delegates to the scientific case for urgent action , " says Richard Somerville , professor emeritus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California , San Diego , a lead author of the IPCC 's 2007 volume on climate science , and a contributor to this report .
" If you want to stabilize the climate at a reasonable amount of global warming , then you cannot delay indefinitely . "
The group 's effort is independent of the UN - sponsored IPCC , which publishes reports on global warming roughly every five years , the last one in 2007 .
The Copenhagen Diagnosis aims to fill the gap on research since mid-2006 – the deadline for the 2007 IPCC report .
" There 's new science and there 's also three more years of data .
In many instance , the observations show that climate change has accelerated , " Dr. Somerville said in a briefing Tuesday on the report .
Controversy over hacked e-mails
The report is being released against the backdrop of the more than 1,000 e-mails pilfered from the Climatic Research Unit of the UK's University of East Anglia .
Many of the e-mails are mundane .
Some , however , give the appearance of scientists – including some involved in the Copenhagen Diagnosis – introducing fudge factors in presenting results .
Others scoff at their colleagues ' work and at critics outside the climate community who question approaches used by the e-mails ' authors to process or interpret data .
And they sometimes reveal a strong undercurrent of angst over what skeptics may make of their results .
The e-mails have generated a outcry among conservative commentators over the credibility of climate science .
Many climate researchers say the e-mails do nothing to undercut the science behind global warming , which has been building for more than 100 years .
What the controversy really shows is a desire on all sides to maintain a myth about how science is conducted , says Daniel Sarewitz , co-director of Arizona State University 's Consortium for Science , Policy , and Outcomes .
" Both sides want to maintain this idea that science is this pure thing , this source of clarity , exactness , and truth .
Of course , it is n't , " he says .
" It 's a human endeavor , a social endeavor .
The people who do it are people full of imperfections . "
None of that undercuts the weight of evidence on global warming , he adds .
Ice caps melting faster
Among the climate - related observations the Copenhagen Diagnosis makes :
• Carbon - dioxide emissions :
In 2008 , emissions were almost 40 percent above 1990 levels .
Even if emissions peaked today , by 2020 temperatures would stand a 25 percent chance of exceeding 2 degrees C – even if emissions fell to zero in 2030 .
• Ice caps at both poles are melting faster than models have projected .
Moreover , a study published this week and not part of the Copenhagen Diagnosis suggests that the loss of ice is now extending to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet , not just the west Antarctic Ice Sheet , which has long been a focus of concern .
In the Arctic , the average melt - back of summer sea ice was 40 percent larger for the 2007 to 2009 period than predicted in 2007's IPCC reports .
• Rates of sea - level rise from thermal expansion and melting land - based ice – about 3.4 millimeters a year during the last 15 years – are about 80 percent above those projected in IPCC .

US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle with the Queen and Prince Philip
Prince Philip mocked an Army cadet , blinded during a Real IRA bomb attack , by poking fun at his dress sense .
As the Queen asked Stephen Menary how much he could see Philip said : " Not a lot , judging by that tie . "
Stephen was wearing the uniform of the Middlesex Cadet Force , which includes a red , blue and yellow tie .
Mr Menary was 14 - years - old when he picked up a torch bomb that was thrown at Territorial Army barracks in west London , by the Real IRA in 2001 .
He was blinded and lost part of his left arm .
The comment , made by the Duke of Edinburgh during a tree - planting ceremony in Hyde Park , London seven years ago , was revealed by Stephen 's mum Carol .
She said : " Prince Philip is completely out of touch with reality , he is from another world .
After he said it there was just stunned silence .
" The Queen looked like she wanted to plant Philip next to the tree .
She just looked at him open mouthed .
I do n't think she could believe what he had said .
" I think there was no malice behind it , it was a tactless thing to say .
" Mocking the sight of a blind boy is something , even by his standards .
He is a strange man with a very strange sense of humour . "
Mr Menary said " I do n't think there 's any malice in what he says . "
A history of verbal gaffes
In his time the Duke of Edinburgh has described the Chinese as " slitty - eyed " , and the Hungarians as " pot- bellied " .
In 1969 the duke was said to have annoyed Tom Jones after the Royal Variety Performance by asking : " What do you gargle with , pebbles ? "
He added the following day : " It is very difficult at all to see how it is possible to become immensely valuable by singing what I think are the most hideous songs . "
At a WWF meeting in 1986 ( he was international president ) , he said : " If it has got four legs and it 's not a chair ... the Cantonese will eat it . "
In 1995 , he asked a Scottish driving instructor : " How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test ? "
After the Dunblane massacre in 1996 he declared a member of a shooting club was no more potentially dangerous than a cricketer , and also wondered why the unemployed cannot make up their mind whether they want more leisure time or not .
He also upset residents of Lockerbie when on a visit to the town in 1993 , he said to a man who lived in a road where 11 people had been killed by wreckage from the Pan Am jumbo jet : " People usually say that after a fire it is water damage that is the worst .
We are still trying to dry out Windsor Castle . "
On a visit to China in 1986 he told British students : " If you stay here much longer you 'll all be slitty - eyed . "
In 1999 , he angered deaf people with a comment about a Caribbean music band .
During a visit to the Welsh Assembly , the Duke met a group from the British Deaf Association , pointed to the musicians , and said : " Deaf ?
If you are near there , no wonder you are deaf . "
In 2002 he asked an Australian Aborigine if he was " Still throwing spears ? "

( Newser ) – Tiger Woods has entered rehab — possibly for sex addiction — at a cushy Arizona facility , pushed by an entourage desperate for him to start repairing his badly damaged image .
“ He has been there for a few days since his handlers forced him to enter the program , ” a source tells X17online .
“ They feel that if he blames his cheating on addiction , the public will forgive him . ”
“ Tiger wants to get back on top , ” adds the source .
“ He agreed to put golfing on hold so he could show the world how badly he feels about what he ’s done and to prove that he wants to correct the problems that led to his infidelity . ”

( Newser ) – British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is launching a massive $ 25.3 billion sell - off of Britain 's assets , ranging from student loans to the Chunnel linking England and France , in order to reduce record deficits and maintain public expenditures .
As the British election draws nearer , the Labor Party is attempting to burnish its credentials for fiscal responsibility by privatizing infrastructure , energy companies , and even a sports betting company .
Several political figures last night called the plans the biggest privatizations in over 20 years .
With the real estate market depressed — and to avoid accusations of a " fire sale " — Brown will spread sales over two years , and is refusing to sell any land until markets improve .
Yet Labor has struggled in the past to get peskier assets off the public books .
It has been stuck with its share in the state gambling company Tote for years despite promising to sell it off in 2001 .
In 2008 the government nearly sold it , but pulled back at the last minutes after deciding the market was too weak .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -- Move over Switzerland .
The tiny state of Delaware beats the Alpine country in a contest for the most secretive financial jurisdiction , a tax justice rights group said on Saturday .
The United States , led by the eastern seaboard state , took in $ 2.6 trillion in deposits from non-resident corporations and individuals in 2007 , according to a survey of financial jurisdictions analyzed by the Tax Justice Network .
The survey of laws , practices and size of inflows in 60 jurisdictions found Delaware coming in first , followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland .
The Cayman Islands and the United Kingdom round out the top five .
“ While the U.S. has been jumping up and down and saying ‘ Aha , bad , wicked Swiss banks , ’ the U.S. is doing exactly the same things as far as non-resident bank account holders , ” said Sarah Lewis , executive director of the group , based in the U.K .
Switzerland has been the poster child for financial secrecy over the past year .
The United State sued Swiss global banking giant UBS AG , which paid a $ 780 million fine to settle a lawsuit against it by the government .
As part of the deal , UBS admitted it actively helped Americans evade U.S. taxes .
The ranking is based on a composite of total offshore activity and measures such as whether a jurisdiction obtains beneficial ownership information about companies and the degree of cooperation in turning over requested financial information .
Delaware is attractive because it does not tax profits realized outside the state and does not require companies to be physically present , according to the Tax Justice Network .
UBS and Credit Suisse have about 200 entities in the state , according to the group .
There are nearly 700,000 active entities registered in Delaware -- and about half of those publicly traded in the United States , according to the group .
Total U.S. deposits of non-residents rose from about $ 1 trillion in 2001 to $ 2.6 trillion in 2007 , according to the study .
In Luxembourg , non-resident deposits rose to $ 500 billion from $ 101 billion over the same period .
In Switzerland , such deposits rose to $ 1.45 trillion from $ 103 billion during the period .
Larry Hamermesh , a business law professor at Widener University in Delaware , said the state gets an unfair rap .
For example , he said tax justice groups criticize the state for not obtaining companies ’ beneficial ownership information when they incorporate in the state .
But no other U.S. state actually requires such information , Hamermesh said .
“ Delaware is no more secret than any other U.S. state , ” he said , noting that Delaware ’s attraction to business is its flexible laws and expert courts .
When you think of a robotic vacuum cleaner , there ’s a good chance that the Roomba comes to mind .
That , or Rosie from the Jetsons .
Well turn off those old cartoons because Asus ( specifically their subsidiary AGAiT ) is throwing their hat into the vacuum cleaning ring with the ECleaner .
The ECleaner looks very similar to the Roomba , but has a few tricks up its sleeve that the competition does n’t .
In addition to its vacuuming duties , it also has a 6000 - hour UV light to disinfect the area that it is sweeping .
If your room could use a little freshening up , it can also spread a fragrance of your choice wherever it goes .
There still are n’t a lot of details currently , but we do know that they are shooting for a $ 150 price when the device makes its debut .

We are past , for the moment , the White House “ war ” on Fox , such as it was .
( Obama did an interview with Fox News ’ Major Garrett a few weeks back , and General Petraeus is on Fox News Sunday today , with close Obama ally Dick Durbin . )
Summer is gone too , and with it the “ wee weed up ” “ silly season ” of political coverage that Obama and his aides regularly decried .
But President Obama ’s disdain for certain features of the national media remains alive and well .
In a little noticed aside at the end of Thursday ’s jobs summit , Obama effectively painted the press as an obstacle to not just the much - needed economic recovery , but to America recovering its 20th Century position as an economic powerhouse .
Obama was responding to a comment from Farooq Kathwari , the CEO of furniture maker Ethan Allen .
Kathwari had observed that the layoffs at his company that followed the economic collapse have actually provided an opportunity for the company to reinvent itself as something better .
Obama agreed with Kathwari ’s point :
If we can recapture that sense that we ’re in this thing together and that we are willing to work hard , that America is not great because it ’s owed to us , but we ’ve been great because previous generations have put in the hard work to get us there , then I ’m confident that we ’re going to get through this tough time and the 21st century is going to be as good for us as the 20th was .
But then Obama made a turn , and went after the press , specifically the group of network correspondents who had interviewed Obama on his trip to Beijing .
The full passage follows after the jump .
But it ’s not going to come easily and it is going to require a level of cooperation and a willingness to work strategically together that we have not seen over the last several years .
And frankly , this town and the way the political dialogue is structured right now is not conducive to what we need to do to be globally competitive .
And all of you are leaders in your communities — in the business sector and the labor sector , in academia , we even have a few pundits here — it is important to understand what ’s at stake and that we ca n’t keep on playing games .
I mentioned that I was in Asia on this trip thinking about the economy , when I sat down for a round of interviews .
Not one of them asked me about Asia .
Not one of them asked me about the economy .
I was asked several times about had I read Sarah Palin ’s book .
( Laughter . )
True .
But it ’s an indication of how our political debate does n’t match up with what we need to do and where we need to go .
Pretty pointed stuff , and I have little doubt that the president was actually irked by this at the time .
[ He also remembers the content of the interviews inaccurately .
See update below . ]
Through both the campaign and his presidency , Obama has made little secret of his disdain for some of the horse - race , tabloid elements of the press corps–though his political and communications staff are not above sometimes exploiting those same tendencies for their own benefit .
Obama meets regularly off - the - record and on - the - record meals with columnists who his advisers see as more intellectually substantive ( or politically influential ) .
But he has not done the same with beat reporters , whom , as he suggested Thursday , sometimes do a disservice to the country with the journalistic equivalent of ambulance chasing .
( In fairness , one man ’s ambulances –Town Hall shoutfests !
Sarah Palin Facebook posts !
etc.–are another man ’s news , and columnists also chase them . )
On the aforementioned Asia trip , Obama only took two questions from the U.S. print press corps over the course of seven days , one in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and one with South Korean President Lee Myung - Bak .
Obama did sit down interviews in Beijing with CBS , NBC , CNN and Fox News .
ABC
News got an interview with Obama shortly before he departed for Asia .
UPDATE : Over Twitter , reader MayBeeTweet points out that Obama did not accurately characterize his interviews in Asia .
Fox News ’ Garrett asked both about the jobs bill Obama has proposed and the South Korean trade agreement .
NBC ’s Chuck Todd asked about the jobs summit and Chinese relations on human rights .
A message to progressives :
By all means , hang Senator Joe Lieberman in effigy .
Declare that you ’re disappointed in and / or disgusted with President Obama .
Demand a change in Senate rules that , combined with the Republican strategy of total obstructionism , are in the process of making America ungovernable .
But meanwhile , pass the health care bill .
Yes , the filibuster - imposed need to get votes from “ centrist ” senators has led to a bill that falls a long way short of ideal .
Worse , some of those senators seem motivated largely by a desire to protect the interests of insurance companies  with the possible exception of Mr. Lieberman , who seems motivated by sheer spite .
But let ’s all take a deep breath , and consider just how much good this bill would do , if passed  and how much better it would be than anything that seemed possible just a few years ago .
With all its flaws , the Senate health bill would be the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare , greatly improving the lives of millions .
Getting this bill would be much , much better than watching health care reform fail .
At its core , the bill would do two things .
First , it would prohibit discrimination by insurance companies on the basis of medical condition or history : Americans could no longer be denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition , or have their insurance canceled when they get sick .
Second , the bill would provide substantial financial aid to those who do n’t get insurance through their employers , as well as tax breaks for small employers that do provide insurance .
( CNN ) -- A Massachusetts grand jury has indicted a 98 - year - old woman , accused of strangling her 100 - year - old nursing - home roommate , on a second - degree murder charge .
Prosecutors say Laura Lundquist killed centenarian Elizabeth Barrow , a resident of Brandon Woods Nursing Home in Dartmouth , after the two women had an argument over a table Lundquist had placed at the foot of Barrow 's bed .
Barrow was found dead September 24 with a plastic shopping bag tied loosely around her head , according the Bristol County district attorney 's office .
An autopsy indicated Barrow had been strangled .
Barrow complained that the table obstructed her path to the bathroom , authorities said .
When a nurse 's aide moved it , Lundquist punched the aide and grumbled that her roommate " might as well have the whole room , " prosecutors said .
District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said Barrow repeatedly complained that Lundquist was making her life " a living hell " in the weeks leading up to the woman 's death , and that Lundquist remarked that she would outlive her roommate .
A nursing home spokesman said the facility twice presented Barrow with the chance to change either rooms or roommates , but she declined each time .
He compared the pair to " sisters , " saying they took " daily walks together ... ate lunch together every day , and were heard at night saying , ' Good night , I love you , ' to each other . "
Lundquist 's attorney , Carl Levin , contends his client was not involved in Barrow 's death , saying , " We maintain her innocence . "
A superior court judge granted a motion to send Lundquist to a state hospital for a competency evaluation .
An arraignment will be held only if Lundquist is found competent to stand trial .
Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
Investigators have found " elements of an explosive device " at the site of the derailment of an express train in Russia and believe an act of terror caused the deadly incident .
The derailment killed at least 26 people and injured about 100 , but there was no immediate word on who or what group might have been behind the action .
" One can say with certainty that that was indeed an act of terror , " Vladimir Markin , spokesman for the investigative committee of the Russian prosecutor 's office , told CNN .
He would not elaborate on exactly what kind of " elements of an explosive device " the investigators discovered earlier , but said the crater found beneath the railroad bed was " 1.5 meter by 1 meter in size . "
Later Saturday morning , a second device went off on nearby tracks going the opposite direction , Vladimir Yakunin , head of Russian Railways , told Russian TV .
He said no one was injured in the smaller explosion .
Markin said investigators are " studying the site of the accident , questioning the witnesses and conducting all kinds of forensic and technical examinations . "
Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov said , " Criminology experts have come to a preliminary conclusion that there was an explosion of an improvised explosive device equivalent to seven kilos of TNT .
" Several leads are being pursued now .
A criminal case has been opened under Article 205 ( " terrorism " ) and Article 22 ( " illegal possession or storage of weapons or explosives " ) of the Russian Criminal Code . "
Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev said on TV that there are possible suspects in this crime .
" There are several people who could be involved in this crime , " he said .
One of them , he said , is a " stocky - built man of about 40 years old , with red hair . "
" There are some traces left at the crime scene which could help in the investigation , " he said .
" We are getting a lot of information now , and I am very thankful for people who have responded to our requests to render their assistance in investigating this crime . "
A total of 681 people -- 20 of them employees -- were on the Nevsky Express as it traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Friday night .
The Nevsky Express is Russia 's fastest train , equivalent to a bullet train .
The crash happened at 9:25 p.m. ( 1825 GMT ) when the train was 280 kilometers ( 174 miles ) from St. Petersburg , Russian state radio said .
At least three carriages carrying more than 130 people derailed and turned on their sides , and emergency workers were working to free anyone who may still be trapped inside .
Yakunin told Russian TV that the company will pay a compensation of 500,000 rubles ( $ 17,240 ) to the victims ' families and 200,000 rubles ( $ 6,897 ) to those injured .
The crash happened 44 minutes after another high - speed train , the Sapsan , had successfully traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on the same rails , a representative of the Russian Transport Police said during a video conference call Saturday .
In August 2007 , an explosion on the tracks derailed the Nevsky Express , injuring 60 people in what authorities called a terrorist act .
About 27,000 passengers on 60 trains were facing delays Saturday as a result of the accident , Russian State TV reported .

Joe Lieberman : Let 's not make a deal !
The Huffington Post and Roll Call are both reporting that Joe Lieberman notified Harry Reid that he will filibuster health - care reform if the final bill includes an expansion of Medicare .
Previously , Lieberman had been cool to the idea , saying he wanted to make sure it would n't increase the deficit or harm Medicare 's solvency ( and previously to that , he supported it as part of the Gore / Lieberman health - care plan ) .
That comforted some observers , as the CBO is expected to say it will do neither .
Someone must have given Lieberman a heads - up on that , as he 's decided to make his move in advance of the CBO score , the better to ensure the facts of the policy could n't impede his opposition to it .
To put this in context , Lieberman was invited to participate in the process that led to the Medicare buy - in .
His opposition would have killed it before liberals invested in the idea .
Instead , he skipped the meetings and is forcing liberals to give up yet another compromise .
Each time he does that , he increases the chances of the bill 's failure that much more .
And if there 's a policy rationale here , it 's not apparent to me , or to others who 've interviewed him .
At this point , Lieberman seems primarily motivated by torturing liberals .
That is to say , he seems willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score .
This leaves Reid in a tough spot .
Sam Stein runs through his remaining options , none of which are very good :
The first is to convince the Senator to support Democrats in breaking a Republican filibuster before casting a vote against the bill .
This would allow for the legislation to pass with Lieberman still registering his opposition .
Lieberman , however , has said he considers the procedural vote to cut off debate to be of the same significance as a vote on the bill itself .
The second path is to try and pick up a Republican moderate .
But this too seems unlikely , as Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , Reid 's best bet , has also expressed opposition to the Medicare buy - in provision .
The third path would be to appease Lieberman and wipe the provisions that he deems controversial from the bill .
This , however , would likely lose Reid several progressive votes -- advancing the cause no further .
The final path would be to try the reconciliation , the parliamentary procedure that would allow Democrats to pass chunks of health care reform by a simple up or down vote .
There are a host of hurdles that come with going down this route , including questions over what , exactly , could be passed .
And at this point both the White House and Reid 's office seem hesitant to use the procedural tool , even after Lieberman 's latest round of opposition .
Reid could also try and find another compromise , but it 's not clear there are many of those left .
And at this point , the underlying dynamic seems to be that Lieberman will destroy any compromise the left likes .
That , in fact , seems to be the compromise : Lieberman will pass the bill if he can hurt liberals while doing so .
From Lieberman 's perspective , the compromise is killing the compromise .

At the age of one , my daughter began suffering from severe cavities .
At the same time , my teeth where also infected with up to four cavities .
I know what it is like to feel stress from a child suffering from tooth decay , because I have experienced it first hand .
For my daughter , her teeth started to decay so rapidly , that one of them just disintegrated and chipped apart in a matter of about two weeks time .
Two years later , using the nutritional program I developed , my daughter has teeth that are now hard , and resilient , they no longer chip , she has abundant energy , and has remained pain and infection free .
1. November 2006 Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients - Early Childhood Caries
2. Summer 2006 Natural Parenting Australia - Early Childhood Caries
Update : I have since discovered that in addition the the below dietary recommendations , that a liberal supply of bone marrow ( from grassfed animals , or wild fish ) , say anywhere from 1 teaspoon - several tablespoons daily , helps the teeth stabilize , and also is supportive in creating a healthy child .
Tooth decay is a preventable , treatable , and usually a curable occurrence .
You will learn what its cause is , how to treat it , and what you need to be aware of for your and your child 's health .
Included on this page , is a part of a protocol to follow , that will significantly improve the health of your child 's teeth and gums , and it will very likely , slow down , the process of tooth decay .
I encourage you to purchase the print edition of my book , Available by November 1st , because I put in a special 25 page section on healing children 's tooth decay .
" In a group of children whose mothers had the special nutritional reinforcement during gestation and lactation and who had been provided with the same dietary adjuncts during the winter and spring months of infancy and early childhood , not a single carious cavity has developed .
A number of these children are now in public schools .
Their physical development is distinctly above that of the average children of their age , as is also their efficiency in school work . "

1 Re-enamelization ( teeth growing back ) of enamel requires several factors , including enough minerals such as calcium , phosphate , magnesium , and the variety of enzymes needed to regrow tooth enamel such as adenosine diphophatase .
2
Tooth decay begins many generations back .
“ The weakness of calcium deficiency is passed from parent to child .
By following the same paternal pattern of ‘ poor food selection , ’ each new crop of babies becomes weaker .
‘ The sins of the parents are passed on to the third and fourth generation . ’” 4
The weakness is caused not just by a lack of calcium , but by a lack of fat soluble & water soluble vitamins .
“ When Dr. Price analyzed the foods used by isolated primitive peoples he found that they provided at least four times the water soluble vitamins , calcium and other minerals , and at least TEN times the fat soluble vitamins from animal foods such as butter , fish eggs , shellfish and organ meats …
Many tribes required a period of premarital nutrition , and children were spaced to permit the mother to maintain her full health and strength , thus assuring subsequent offspring of physical excellence . ”
5 Many primitive groups Dr. Price studied had a tooth cavity rate close to 0 .
Weston Price also noticed in groups following their traditional diet that decayed teeth either fell out painlessly , or they covered themselves over with a hardened layer of enamel .
Weston Price treated many cases of cavities with a success rate of over 90 % .
At the end of this article is a copy of Dr. Price ’s tooth decay controlling diet for children .
Below on this page on my web site I ’ve scanned an x-ray image showing how Price ’s tooth decay controlling diet healed a girls teeth which had two cavities per tooth , which full dentures where recommended .
6
Not eating enough nutrients is n’t the only reason why teeth would decay .
They also could decay because the body has become too toxic .
We unknowingly ingest these toxins daily .
The most toxic substances are drugs , white sugar , breakfast cereals , cheap vegetable oils and hydrogenated oils .
There is a complete list of toxic elements below .
After years of this behavior , combined with smoking cigarettes , too many medications , and lack of exercise , the liver starts to become weak .
The liver is the bodies nutrient store house .
The toxic accumulations from cellular metabolism , as well as ingested food products inhibit the bodies ability for normal function .
It ’s very likely that there are deeper health problems than simply tooth decay .
Calcium & Childhood Tooth Decay
Teeth are made of calcium and phosphorus .
Would it surprise you to learn , that we are far below the standard for these minerals when compared to the intake of calcium and phosphorus of our ancestors ?
65.1 % of Women on average are below the Standard of 1 gram of calcium per day .
Only 3.7 % of women are at twice the standards , which means , that going into pregnancy , approximately 96 % of women are calcium deprived .

Introduction to Cause and Treatments of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay
For teeth to re mineralize , the surface of the tooth needs to be clean .
Any toothpaste which is pasty contains glycerin .
The glycerin takes about 27 washes with water to remove from the tooth ’s surface .
There are many alternative products such as tooth liquids , tooth powders , sea salt and baking soda , and herbs to clean and treat teeth .
The method for healing children 's teeth begins as follows .
Preferably your child is breastfeeding .
Since the cause of tooth decay , as we now know , is a deficiency in nutrients , caused by wrong diet choices prior to conception , during pregnancy and during the lactation phase , we heal tooth decay by providing a remedy to the nutrient loss .
The vehicle for these nutrients is breast milk .
So breastfeeding is extremely helpful , and that includes night feeding .
If your child is not breastfeeding , then you can modify the suggestions and still produce excellent results .
After the treatment protocol and some pictures , I have provided you with a list of foods you must avoid .
As the toxic conditions created in the bloodstream by these foods , is a substantial factor in your child 's tooth decay .
In trying these Treatments you will also find many other health improvements in your child , including increased alertness , intelligence , and a more positive mood .
While it is possible that your child 's teeth may still decay even on this protocol , you will find that the secondary dentine , the middle layer of the tooth , can regrow .
What happens on this protocol , is that there are enough nutrients , body building substances and proper body chemistry to ensure that the tooth pulp , the inner layer of the tooth does not get exposed .
When the pulp is protected , their will be no infection .
No infection , means no pain .
No pain , means you do not need to have a dangerous medical procedure done on your child !!!!!
My daughter 's one tooth crumbled away .
Now the stub of that tooth , is has hard as a diamond .
The butter oil , and the special dietary protocols we are following are the cause of it .
The Babies True Needs of Calcium and Phosphorus Probably the main cause of tooth decay , is a deficiency in Calcium and Phosphorus in the womb time , and in the breast milk .
Since the infant is growing at a rapid rate , it will exhaust the mother 's supply of bone building nutrients rapidly , so the supply must be replenished quickly .
Testimonial : " When my 4 year old daughter 's teeth began to have lots of tooth decay ( for her age ) , we visited a few dentists and all of them were blaming me that I did not brush her teeth enough .
But I did ...
Basically , they wanted to do dental anesthesia on her and repair all her cavities at once .
My husband and I talked and decided not to put her through this .
After all , she had no pain at all and her teeth did not bother her .
I decided to take the matter into my own hands .
I started researching about tooth decay , and stumbled upon Rami 's web site .
I even wrote to him , and he was very helpful .
A while later , when his book was published , I bought it .
I already knew about the diet from Rami's book , and I was implementing parts of it , but I guess that was not enough to protect my oldest daughter from tooth decay ....
This book gave me hope for my daughter 's teeth - and now I know that we are responsible for our health .
I have also forgiven the dentists that kept showing me how to brush her teeth , I mean , they do n't know better ... When I asked one of the dentists if my daughter does not have enough nutrients in the body , and that 's maybe why her teeth decay ( because the body takes all the essential nutrients from the teeth first ) , he disregarded it and said this could not be the case because all her teeth are formed very well .
I did not argue with him , because I knew he was not taught anything about diet in his medical school .
I just stopped going to dentists and now I try my best to follow the diet ( for my daughter and rest of family ) Rami outlines in his book .
If you are discouraged and do n't know what to do , get this book .
I was very worried and upset about my daughter 's teeth at first , but now I am actually very calm because I know I am doing the right thing . "

How to Get the Butter Oil & Cod Liver Oil
Butter Oil , is a key ingredient to re-enameling teeth because it contains certain fats and activating substances that help bond the nutrients in the body to the bones .
The butter must be from cows or goats eating rapidly growing green grasses .

Ideally we would prevent tooth decay before it started .
How do we do this ?
Tooth decay begins from an inherited weakness .
The primary weakness is not usually genetic heritage , but from nutritional heritage .
A lack of nutrients and body building substances during pregnancy , from a mother who is nutrient deficient , is the main origin of tooth decay in young children .
Ideally , mother 's could follow the nutritional protocols listed on this web site , during pregnancy , to help prevent tooth decay .
Of particular importance during pregnancy is the consumption of the butter and cod liver oil mixture .
I have a web site dedicated to pre-conception health .
Toxic Foods To Avoid !
Sugar – White Sugar , Brown Sugar , Organic Sugar , Evaporated Cane Juice , Corn Syrup , Commercial Jams
Flour & Grain Products – White Flour , Wheat Flour , Organic Flour , any unsoaked grain products .
Examples : bread , crackers , cookies , doughnuts , breakfast cereals , muffins , pastries , tortillas , bagels , and sandwiches ( most store bought flour products even from the health food store need to be avoided ) .
Hydrogenated Oils - like Margarine and Low quality vegetable oils , Vegetable Oil , Soybean Oil , Crisco , Canola , and Safflower
Any type of junk , convenience food , or modern fast foods

Take responsibility for your health .
And know that , by following the Dietary protocols explained by Dr. Price , many people have stopped or remineralized their tooth decay .
The secondary dentin can turn hard and glassy and thus can hypothetically cover the tooth 's surface .
You must also see my foods to avoid list , and avoid the foods mentioned because they can deplete the body of nutrients .
good luck ,
