The 7 July bombers who killed 52 people in terrorist attacks in London in 2005 were once described by Britain 's security service as ' clean skins ' .
The vivid phrase implied that a gang of homegrown terrorists had come from nowhere , without an intelligence trail .
But Dame Eliza Manningham - Buller , the director - general of MI5 , is bracing herself for embarrassing revelations on the full extent of what the British intelligence community knew about the bombers , and in particular the ringleader of the attacks , Mohammad Sidique Khan .
The disclosures will add to pressure for a full public inquiry .
Manningham - Buller is retiring in April and some Whitehall sources have suggested this is a pre-emptive move by MI5 to avoid embarrassment over revelations about intelligence failings .
Senior security officials insist it was always known Manningham - Buller would leave her post in April .
MI5 now admit that far from being a ' clean skin ' , Khan had been on their radar screen since 2003 .
And The Observer can now reveal that more than a year before he detonated his Tube bomb , Khan had been listed as a ' desirable suspect ' by MI5 , along with fellow bomber Shehzad Tanweer .
One senior security official gave a chilling warning that even with the increase in resources MI5 has now been given , it is unlikely they would have been able to pick up somebody like Khan , given the information they had at the time .
He said : ' If the threat was the same as in 2005 - that is , we were looking at 50 potential terror networks in the UK - we would have a better chance of picking up somebody like Khan .
But we are now dealing with some 200 potential terror networks in the UK and to be quite honest we would n't have a hope in hell .
' We ca n't put every person who expresses anger about British foreign policy under 24 - hour surveillance , or we would be talking about a Stasi - style secret police force . '
Although legal restrictions mean
The Observer is not able to report the full extent of MI5 's intelligence on the events of 7 July , this paper has seen remarkable detail about the security service 's knowledge of Khan , including transcripts of conversations involving him that were picked up by MI5 surveillance officers .
They show that a year before the July attacks , Khan had jihadist leanings and wanted to help militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The transcripts reveal that he was also highly critical of Britain .
At one stage Khan mentions terrorism , although there is no indication he has knowledge of any operation or planning of an attack .
Reports from the Home Office and from Parliament 's Intelligence and Security Committee inquiry into the July attacks cleared MI5 of any blame for not forestalling the bombings .
They accepted the security service 's claim that officers were fully stretched investigating other active terror plots and resources were spread too thinly to mount surveillance on every potential Islamic militant .
However , the MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee were not given transcripts of the conversations now seen by The Observer .
MI5 believed that the recorded conversations showed no evidence of terrorist intent , but merely of discussions about financial fraud .
Before 7 July , MI5 had recordings and photographs of Khan on file , and he was viewed as a potential Islamic terrorist .
He had been picked up by MI5 surveillance officers involved in a counter - terrorism operation that had focused on more than 50 potential British terrorists in Britain .
MI5 , however , did not consider Khan a top priority because there was no indication he was preparing an attack .
Instead of labelling him an ' essential ' suspect and putting him under full surveillance - a costly affair that can take up to 20 officers - he was described only as a ' desirable ' suspect .
Photographs were taken of Khan at the home of another terror suspect under surveillance .
At one stage a photograph of Khan was distributed to foreign terror suspects imprisoned overseas .
The Observer has learnt however that a photograph of Khan was not shown to a detainee who knew of his extremist views , because it was not thought to be of sufficient quality .
This detainee recognised Khan after seeing his picture following the 7 July bombing .
Had Khan been identified from his photograph earlier , he might have been picked up sooner .
In February 2005 , the security service received a report naming two individuals who had travelled to Afghanistan , both with extremist views .
Although MI5 tried to discover who these individuals were , it was only after 7 July that one of them was identified as Khan .
Despite the growing body of evidence that the security service missed the opportunity to thwart the 7 July attacks , senior security officials remain adamant they could not have done anything differently .
They claim it was only after the London atrocities that it was possible to work out that Khan was the individual in certain bugged conversations .
He was often known by a different name and was simply an unidentified individual in separate counter - terrorism surveillance operations .
They point out that at the time the priority of MI5 officers was to target those known to be a ' real and live ' threat .
As a result , security officials say , at least two other terror attacks were prevented .
Trojan Man
Sitting in my section is probably the best looking couple I ’ve ever laid eyes on .
The man is matinee idol handsome .
The woman looks like she stepped out of the pages of Vogue .
They delight in each others presence .
Perfect teeth flash , crystalline laughter echoes , eyes dance , happy superficial chatter , small touches are exchanged .
It ’s got to be a first or second date .
There ’s none of the usual silences that belie years spent together .
The woman is really into this guy .
She tosses her hair , runs a finger seductively along her wine glass stem , and somehow manages to wiggle without moving .
It ’s fun to watch .
Matinee smiles eagerly .
The evening is going his way .
He ’s got champagne on ice at home .
He ’ll invite her up for a nightcap .
They ’ll talk and he ’ll surprise her with a kiss .
Clothes will drop to the floor , the tumble into bed , mad passion , lit cigarettes , more talk .
I ’ll even wager Matinee burned a mood music mix CD that ’s playing on his Bang & Oulfsen .
Vogue Girl leans forward and plants a kiss on her date ’s cheek .
Yes things are going his way .
Matinee signals for the check .
I ’m happy .
When a guy knows he ’s getting laid the tip size expands proportionally with the ego trip .
I print up the check .
It ’s a $ 100 bucks .
I walk over and deliver it .
Matinee reaches into his breast pocket for his wallet .
As he draws it out something falls and lands in the middle of the aisle with a click .
I look down automatically .
On the floor is a solitary Trojan Condom .
I look up .
Matinee is staring at it too .
Uh oh .
When Vouge girl sees that condom she ’ll think her date is a presumptuous bastard and the night will be over .
My tip is evaporating before my eyes .
It ’s time to act .
I throw the checkbook to the floor .
It lands on top of the condom .
A lucky shot .
“ How clumsy of me ! ” I exclaim .
Bending down I pick up the check , palm the prophylactic , and hand the book to Matinee .
“ Thank you . ” he says with a trace of relief .
“ Your welcome sir . ”
I stand off to the side while he examines the bill .
I sneak a peek at the condom .
“ Ribbed for her pleasure . ”
How nice .
The man slaps down six twenty dollar bills .
A twenty percent tip .
Not too shabby .
Matinee looks up at me .
I permit myself a small smile .
He peels off another twenty .
“ That ’s so generous ! ” Vouge cries happily .
“ He ’s a very good waiter . ” Matinee replies .
Baby you have no idea how good .
They get up to leave .
Vouge waves cheerfully .
“ Have a great evening . ” I say .
“ We will . ” Matinee says winking .
They exit .
I go into the kitchen .
I think about putting the condom in the tea box .
Nah .
Too much trouble .
I toss it in the garbage and wash my hands thoroughly .
I go back to the table to collect my money .
$ 40 easy bucks .
Thank you Trojan Man !
A 500 MW wind farm with the power to supply clean electricity to over 415,000 homes , more than all the demand in Suffolk , was approved for construction last week .
The project is being developed by Airtricity and Fluor .
Comprised of 140 - turbines the project will cut CO2 emissions by 1.5 million tonnes a year – the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road .
Airtricity , one of Europeâ€™s leading renewable energy companies , together with its joint venture partner Fluor , has been awarded a lease from The Crown Estate to build and operate the offshore wind park at Greater Gabbard in the United Kingdom .
The award of the lease to the Airtricity / Fluor joint venture is part of the second round competition for UK offshore wind farm developments by The Crown Estate .
The sites available for offshore wind farm development are located in the three strategic areas announced by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in July 2003 : the Thames Estuary , the Greater Wash and the North West ( Liverpool Bay ) .
On December 18 2003
The Crown Estate announced the award of lease option agreements to 12 successful bidders for the development of offshore wind farms .
The successful developers will be required to obtain all statutory planning consents from the government to allow construction to take place .
Airtricity have built wind projects in the UK before , including the Arklow Bank project in the Irish Sea , the first phase of which is already constructed through a co-development agreement with GE .
Fluorâ€™s role , once all permitting and financing has been secured , would be to provide the engineering , procurement and construction for the project .
The Greater Gabbard Project is located approx .
26 km from the Suffolk coast and comprises one site located in the outer Thames Estuary on two sand banks known as the Inner Gabbard and The Galloper .
It is regarded as an ideal site for an offshore wind farm due to high wind speeds , low water depth , suitable ground conditions and minimal environmental sensitivities .
Airtricity / Fluor will immediately initiate an environmental impact assessment study , which will take approximately 15 months to complete .
My experience with the Cape Wind project makes me envious of a 15 month process .
It has been over three years since Cape Wind has applied for approval of its project .
This new wind project will most likely be approved and built in less than three years .
On completion of the environmental impact assessment , and following the successful acquisition of all permits , construction of the wind farm will commence .
Commenting on winning the lease , Eddie Oâ€ ™Connor , Airtricityâ€™s Chief Executive said , â€ œAirtricity and Fluor are delighted to be playing such a significant part in the development part of offshore wind energy in the UK .
Together we will assist the UK Government to meet its commitment of 10 percent of UK electricity being derived from renewable sources by 2010 .
Awarding of this project confirms that Airtricity is a world leader in renewable energy , and we look forward to moving this development to the next stage .
â€ 
Patrick Flaherty , a Fluor senior vice president , said : â€ œWe are very pleased to have received this important award from the Crown Estate for the Greater Gabbard Offshore wind farm Development .
Our partnership with Airtricity effectively combines the knowledge of the renewable energy business with the skills of permitting , financing , and constructing wind energy and large - scale offshore projects .
Fluor and Airtricity are committed to making this project a success for all stakeholders.â€ 

A couple weeks ago , I asked a friend how close he thought we were to a time when Americans would get so frustrated with their corrupt and dysfunctional government that they take to the streets with torches .
He replied : that wo n’t happen as long as they ’ve got TV .
I think my friend has a good point .
TV appears to be electronic Soma .
As long as ordinary Americans are glued to the tube , there is little hope that they will be able to focus the requisite attention and energy necessary to fix their government .
It ’s not that all heavy TV viewers would become active participants in their government if we took away their TVs .
As long as they are glued to their hypnotic televisions , though , they wo n’t be active participants in their own government .
As long as American citizens suckle off their television sets , government will be run unabashedly by big corporations .
American citizens do n’t seem to be inclined to give up their TV viewing , despite the fact that giving up most of their viewing would free them up to monitor their government and to advocate for needed changes .
According to the Nielsen Media Research Study released in September 2006 , the average American household watched television more than 8 hours per day during the 2005 - 2006 television year .
Individuals watched an average amount 4 hours and 35 minutes per day
To watch TV for 4 ½ hours per day , every day , is virtually the same amount of time many people dedicate to working full time jobs ( 37.5 hours / week x 50 weeks ) .
This is an astonishing amount of passive viewing .
It ’s astonishing because the average television show is so incredibly lacking in quality — if you doubt my broad - brush slander of TV shows , do this experiment : simply turn on your television to a randomly chosen station ( other than PBS ) and watch for a few minutes .
If you happen upon a innocuous looking news program , watch it only after consulting the high quality media criticism provided by the media site links displayed on the home page to Dangerous Intersection .
Additional criticism of local newscasts is provided here .
What would we have to gain from giving up most of that television watching ?
Families will start talking with each other again , according to many anecdotes .
Here ’s some additional benefits : “ better mental clarity , ( desired ) weight loss , exploring new hobbies , better relationships , more energy , higher productivity , greater emotional stability , and even better sex . ”
People will knit themselves back into communities .
For those viewers who fail to be highly selective , sitting and watching television is one of those modern activities ( another is being a sports spectator ) that gives the illusion that one is doing something when one is actually doing nothing .
As long as one is under the illusion that one is doing something , one will be oblivious to any suggestion that one needs to start doing something .
The statistics are incredibly distressing .
TV Turnoff Network presents a sampling of these statistics here .
For example :
40 % of Americans always or often watch television while eating dinner .
Parents spend an average of 38.5 minutes in meaningful conversation with their children per week .
Ten or more hours of television viewing per week negatively affects academic achievement .
Children under 7 spend 95 % of their television - time without their parents .
American children spend 900 hours per year in school , but 1,023 hours watching television .
The average American child sees 200,000 violent acts on TV by age 18 .
This includes 16,000 murders .
Only 16 % of programs show the long - term consequences of violence .
Only 4 % of shows emphasize anti-violence themes .
Here ’s a recent statistic : America now has more TV ’s than people .
Even more distressing , check out this article in Scientific American , “ Television Addiction Is No Mere Metaphor , ” by Robert Kubey and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi .
The article concludes that many television viewers qualify as “ addicts ” in every meaningful sense of that term :
The term “ TV addiction ” is imprecise and laden with value judgments , but it captures the essence of a very real phenomenon .
Psychologists and psychiatrists formally define substance dependence as a disorder characterized by criteria that include spending a great deal of time using the substance ; using it more often than one intends ; thinking about reducing use or making repeated unsuccessful efforts to reduce use ; giving up important social , family or occupational activities to use it ; and reporting withdrawal symptoms when one stops using it .
All these criteria can apply to people who watch a lot of television .
Yes , TV helps many people feel relaxed .
“ Within moments of sitting or lying down and pushing the “ power ” button , viewers report feeling more relaxed . ”
But there is a price to pay for this sense of relaxation :
What is more surprising is that the sense of relaxation ends when the set is turned off , but the feelings of passivity and lowered alertness continue .
Survey participants commonly reflect that television has somehow absorbed or sucked out their energy , leaving them depleted .
They say they have more difficulty concentrating after viewing than before .
In contrast , they rarely indicate such difficulty after reading .
After playing sports or engaging in hobbies , people report improvements in mood .
After watching TV , people ’s moods are about the same or worse than before . . . [ V ] iewers ’ vague learned sense that they will feel less relaxed if they stop viewing may be a significant factor in not turning the set off .
Viewing begets more viewing .
The authors report that the longer people sit in front of the TV set , the less satisfaction they said they derived .
Heavy viewers generally reports that they enjoyed TV less than light viewers .
This same article got especially interesting when it considered the triggers for these responses .
It ’s not the content of the programs .
Rather , it ’s the “ stylistic tricks ” utilized by producers : the cuts , edits and zooms .
In 1986 Byron Reeves of Stanford University , Esther Thorson of the University of Missouri and their colleagues began to study whether the simple formal features of television–cuts , edits , zooms , pans , sudden noises–activate the orienting response , thereby keeping attention on the screen .
By watching how brain waves were affected by formal features , the researchers concluded that these stylistic tricks can indeed trigger involuntary responses and “ derive their attentional value through the evolutionary significance of detecting movement … .
It is the form , not the content , of television that is unique . ”
The orienting response may partly explain common viewer remarks such as : “ If a television is on , I just ca n’t keep my eyes off it , ” “ I do n’t want to watch as much as I do , but I ca n’t help it , ” and “ I feel hypnotized when I watch television . ”
In the years since Reeves and Thorson published their pioneering work , researchers have delved deeper .
Annie Lang ’s research team at Indiana University has shown that heart rate decreases for four to six seconds after an orienting stimulus .
In ads , action sequences and music videos , formal features frequently come at a rate of one per second , thus activating the orienting response continuously .
The orienting response is overworked .
Viewers still attend to the screen , but they feel tired and worn out , with little compensating psychological reward .
The power of these triggers ca n’t be getting any less in this day and age of wide screen televisions with brilliant colors and full - spectrum sound .
Maybe the low quality shows do n’t improve in quality when viewed in the state - of - the - art home theater , but watching them does become more compelling .
Human animals are rigged early in life to attend to bright and shiny things such as changes in sounds and images of television shows .
Many of us become helpless to turn the set off .
Many people can’t even muster the strength to turn the set off in order to get to sleep .
Who often wins when it ’s a struggle between television use in a couple ’s bedroom versus a healthy sex life ?
The TV .
Heavy viewers have “ poorer attentional control ” and they use TV “ to distract themselves from unpleasant thoughts and to fill time . ”
Other studies have shown that when cable TV moved into communities , “ both adults and children in the town became less creative in problem solving , less able to persevere at tasks , and less tolerant of unstructured time . ”
When heavy viewers cut back on viewing , they become edgy and dysfunctional .
Their nerves become frayed .
Television - watching can be viewed as an addiction because “ millions of people sense that they cannot readily control the amount of television they watch . ”
In my experience , most heavy viewers know that they are spending inordinate amounts of time watching TV and they already know they should be attending to other things .
What ’s the best evidence that television is an addiction ?
“ Just say no ” does n’t work as advice to heavy viewers .
This leaves me with little to say , of course , other than to platitudinous suggestion that we need to keep in mind the addictive power of non-selective television viewing .
This suggestion should be made available on TV , but do n’t expect it any time soon .

Haskell User 's Operating System and Environment
Note : Kenny Graunke has made available a a newer version of House , ported to GHC 6.8.2 ( October 2008 )
House is a demo of software written in Haskell , running in a standalone environment .
It is a system than can serve as a platform for exploring various ideas relating to low - level and system - level programming in a high - level functional language .
More details are available in our ICFP 2005 paper : A Principled Approach to Operating System Construction in Haskell .
House is based on
A PS2 mouse driver ( Iavor Diatchki ) .
Simple graphics support , using VBE 2.0 and a variant of Grub to boot into graphics mode and get access to a linear frame buffer .
Interestingly enough , we were able to implement the graphics primitives in Haskell , with decent performance , and our Haskell implementation for parsing , decompressing and rending GIF images was fast enough to let us use House to present our slides at ICFP 2005 .
( Thomas Hallgren ) .
Support for running binary executables in a separate address space ( Andrew Tolmach ) .
Page fault handlers and system call handlers are written in Haskell .
A driver for NE2000 compatible network cards ( Iavor Diatchki ) .
( This is the type of card emulated by QEMU . )
A driver for Intel PRO / 100 network cards ( Thomas Hallgren ) .
( This is the type of card found in e.g. IBM Thinkpad laptops . )
A network protocol stack , with basic support for Ethernet , IPv4 , ARP , DHCP , ICMP ( ping ) , UDP , TFTP and TCP .

There is also work in progress on implementing an L4 compatible microkernel based on this platform ( Rebekah Leslie and Mark P Jones ) .
Teens smoke , take drugs , have unprotected sex and ride with drunk drivers , not because they think they are invulnerable or have n't thought about the risks , says a new Cornell study .
In fact , they are more likely to ponder the risks , take longer ( about 170 milliseconds more ) weighing the pros and cons of engaging in high - risk behavior than adults -- and actually overestimate the risks .
It 's just that they often decide the benefits -- the immediate gratification or peer acceptance -- outweigh the risks , says Valerie F. Reyna , professor of human development at Cornell .
With Frank Farley of Temple University , Reyna reviewed the scientific literature on why adolescents make bad decisions , and on how interventions could help them do the right thing more often .
The findings are published in the September issue of the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest .
The researchers found that while adults scarcely think about engaging in many high - risk behaviors because they intuitively grasp the risks , adolescents take the time to mull over the risks and benefits .
" In other words , more experienced decision - makers tend to rely more on fuzzy reasoning , processing situations and problems as gists [ the essence of their actions ] rather than weighing multiple factors , " said Reyna .
In another study , published September 's Journal of Experimental Psychology : Applied , she found that doctors make better decisions by processing less information and making sharper black - and - white distinctions among decision - making options .
" This leads to better decisions , not only in everyday life but also in places like emergency rooms where the speed and quality of risky decisions are critical , " she said .
The findings on teenagers imply that interventions that use risk data regarding smoking or unprotected sex , for example , may actually backfire if young people overestimate their risks anyway .
Instead , interventions should help young people develop " gist - based " thinking in which dangerous risks are categorically avoided rather than weighed in a rational , deliberative way .
“ Name a person , living or dead , from the country India . ”
If asked in the western world , the most common answer would be obvious : “ Ghandi ” .
It is another matter that his name is “ Gandhi ” , and not “ Ghandi ” , to which he is commonly referred in the west , but nevertheless , this individual seems to have wielded such influence that India almost seems to be known as “ the land of Ghandi ” in the west .
In India , he is also a well - known figure , often hailed as the “ father of the nation . ”
It is unlikely that any individual living in India would not know of him .
But whether most people from India know much beyond the name ( for instance , that he was involved in India ’s freedom struggle ) is a matter of debate .
His brand of non-violence was unknown to most Indians until recently .
A few months ago , a Hindi movie titled “ Lage Raho Munnabhai ” ( Carry on Munnabhai ) was released in India .
It went on to become India ’s biggest box office success in a long time .
It tells the story of a gangster , named ‘ Munnabhai ’ , who accidentally stumbles upon the work of Gandhi .
Inspired by the writings , he begins practicing Gandhi ’s tenets of non-violence and turns his life around .
When I first heard of the film ’s plot , I winced .
“ Bollywood ” , India ’s equivalent of “ Hollywood ” , is obsessed with violence .
Surely , a Bollywood film about Gandhi , I imagined , would butcher his philosophy .
Worse yet , the film is a sequel to a mediocre movie .
When I heard people saying that it changed their lives , I dismissed it as idiocy .
After all , some people claim that the Matrix movies “ changed their lives ” .
Nevertheless , a few weeks ago , out of sheer morbid curiosity , I decided to check out the film .
I was startled .
The film is a typical ‘ Bollywood ’ film in that its plot is highly unrealistic .
But the film presents Gandhi ’s thoughts with such clarity and such passion that it is difficult not to be moved by it .
Gandhi is well - known for propagating the concept of non-violence .
He believed that whenever one is being oppressed with violence , one must not use violence in return .
Instead , he propagated the use of a unique concept known as ‘ passive resistance ’ .
“ If someone slaps you on your cheek , show them the other cheek , ” was his famous illustration of the concept .
He believed that acts of violence only beget more violence .
“ An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind , ” is another of Gandhi ’s famous quotes .
Gandhi saw it like this :
If a person hits you , and you hit that person back , the same person would hit you back again , thus creating an endless chain of violence .
By practicing non-violence , Gandhi believed that the hearts of even the cruelest and most violent individuals could be won .
Even if the violent individuals could not be moved directly , it would move other parties , who would apply pressure on the violent individuals , and force them to eventually abandon their oppressive actions .
What I did not realize about Gandhi ( until I watched this movie ) was that his philosophy is much larger .
Non-violence constitutes only a small part of it .
What Gandhi really propagated was a concept that is underappreciated today : integrity .
Integrity does not mean merely living an “ ethical ” life , as in living a life without breaking the law .
It means living a life without contradictions .
It does not take a lot of perspicacity to figure out that we live in an extremely schizophrenic world .
Wars are fought in different parts of the world in the name of peace .
Between their beauty regimens , pop stars travel in their limos and choppers to ‘ Live 8 ’ concerts purporting to wipe out world hunger .
The list goes on …
It seems to be acceptable today to a have one set of lifestyle standards for yourself and another set of standards for those for whom you show concern .
You may not be content unless you live in a luxury apartment , but it ’s OK if someone you sponsor lives in a public shelter .
Even the major “ philanthropists ” of today , be they Bill Gates or Bono , live decadent lifestyles , in sharp contrast to the people whose conditions they seek to alleviate .
For that matter , do n’t many of us well - meaning individuals who claim to care for the poor contradict ourselves by blowing money on holidays and restaurants ?
It was these very contradictions of which Gandhi disapproved .
To him , the lifestyle of a man of true integrity would be in complete sync with his beliefs .
A man who stood on a his privileged pedestal and tried to help the less fortunate , in his view , was a ‘ coward . ’
Such a man , while possessed with good intentions , was afraid of giving up his privileged position in society , and essentially lived a hypocritical existence .
Gandhi often spoke of the “ truth ” and the true way of life , for which courage was required .
Indeed he recognized that it is not easy to wholly accept the truth and also practice what you preach .
It is all too easy to be confused , and to maintain the status quo lifestyle you are living .
Gandhi believed that it takes courage to attain the necessary clarity of thought .
Once we attain that clarity of thought , we are forced to confront our own shortcomings and hypocrisies .
Gandhi believed that we all understand the “ truth ” on some level or the other .
We intentionally keep our understanding of it foggy , however , for fear that it will hold a mirror to us .
Where the movie “ Lage Raho Munnabhai ” really succeeds is in showing how difficult it is to lead a life of Gandhian integrity .
The protagonist , a gangster at first , finds it nearly impossible to live by Gandhi ’s principles .
Rather unsurprisingly , he has never been in prison thanks to the nexus of politicians and gangsters in India .
However , when he adopts passive resistance , he is arrested almost every other day .
Indeed , as the protagonist discovers in the movie , living a life of ‘ Gandhian ’ integrity requires enormous patience and sacrifice , something fast disappearing in today ’s times .
In India , the release of “ Lage Raho Munnabhai ” has resulted in an increased consciousness of Gandhian values .
Questions are increasingly being asked about where the youth of today is headed .
Is concern for the downtrodden going to become more and more passive in the future ?
Will charity become a completely commoditized affair ?
Will celebrity - studded events such as ‘ Live 8 ’ concerts ( as admirable as their causes are ) be the only way by which the youth will take notice of problems elsewhere in the world ?
Have we ended up becoming so selfish and self - obsessed that this schizophrenic balancing of a decadent lifestyle with a passive “ concern for the poor ” has already become all - too - normal to us ?

101st at Tuy Hoa , 1966 ( Photo : Jim Coyne )
When , one wonders , will mutiny begin among the troops in Iraq ?
Recently I talked by email about the war with Jim Coyne , an airborne - infantry friend who served two tours as a gunship door - gunner in Viet Nam and then made a career in journalism .
I asked ,  Do they [ I meant the officer corps , the official military ] actually believe the optimistic twaddle this time around ?
Do they really not know what is happening ?
Jim ’s response :  In my opinion , they really do n’t know ; they may not even want to know on some level .
You know as well as I , these are mission - oriented folks ; can do folks ; failure and its introspective handmaidens are not options to them .
And in a tactical mission - oriented world our military does n’t really fail very often ; in a strategic military / political world such as the Mideast and Iraq , however , we simply cannot win .
 Again , as in Viet Nam , the career officer corps salutes and marches toward the sound of battle .
Eventually however ( and it wo n’t be long now ) it ’s the grunts who will begin to revolt , first in small ways ( as in the 101st in late 1968 , ‘ No sir .
We are not going up that hill again .’) and then , quickly thereafter ( As in 1973 , " F___ you , asshole . " )
By that time the media may get wind of things and spin it exponentially out of control .
That ’s what I think . 
So do I .
We have two sharply differing versions of Iraq .
One comes from the professional officers .
It holds that the military is making progress and the insurgents losing ground .
The Iraqi people love us and want the benefits that we will bring them .
The increasing attacks by insurgents are signs of desperation .
Things seem bad only because the media emphasize the negative .
The officers see light at the end of the tunnel .
The body counts are great ; the bad guys ca n’t much longer take the pounding we are giving them .
Onward and upward .
The other view comes from enlisted men ( and from a lot of reporters before being edited to say whatever the publisher believes ) .
These assert that the Iraqis hate us and we , them ; that the insurgency is growing in strength , that we are not making progress but going backward , that our tactics do n’t work and we ca n’t win .
The pattern is so common in recent wars as to be routine .
The enlisted men know that the US is losing .
The officers do not know it , or refuse to know it .
This will eventually have consequences .
When men die pointlessly in a war they know cannot be won and that means nothing to them , when they realize that they are dying for the egos of draft - dodging politicians safe in Washington they will revolt .
It happened before .
It will happen again .
But when ?
Next year , I ’d guess .
It is important to understand that officers and enlisted men are very different animals .
For example , enlisted men do things ( drive the tank , repair the helicopter ) whereas officers are chiefly administrators .
But the important difference is psychological .
Enlisted men are blue - collar guys or technicians .
They carry little ideological overburden .
They want to fix the tank or finish the field exercise and then go drink beer and get laid .
Above all , they are realists .
If the new radio does n’t work , or Baghdad turns out to be a tactically irresolvable nightmare , the enlisted guys feel very little urge to pretend otherwise .
This is why officers do not like reporters to be alone with the troops .
And they seriously do n’t .
The standard response of the officer corps is that the troops cannot see the Big Picture .
( Unless of course the enlisteds say what the officers want to hear , in which case their experience on the ground lends irresistible authority ) .
But the Big Picture rests on the Little Picture .
If a soldier sees slow disaster where he is , and hears the same thing from guys he meets from everywhere else in the country , his conclusions will not be without weight .
Sooner or later , on his third tour with a pregnant wife at home and seven friends killed by bombs , he will say , in the crude but expressive language of soldiers ,  f___ this s__t . 
By contrast , officers can’t conclude anything but the positive .
There are several reasons .
Career officers , first , are politicians .
You do n’t get promoted by saying that the higher - ups are otherworldly incompetents .
An officer ’s loyalty is to his career , and to the officer corps , not to the country or to his troops .
If this sounds harsh , note how seldom an active - duty officer will criticize policy , yet when he retires he may suddenly discover that said policy resulted in unnecessary deaths among the troops .
Oh ?
Then why did n’t he say so when it would have saved lives ?
There is a curious moral cowardice among officers .
They will fly dangerous missions over Baghdad , but they wo n’t say that things are n’t going well .
They do n’t go against their herd .
Further , and I want to say this carefully , officers often are not quite adults .
They can be ( and usually are ) smart , competent , dedicated , and physically brave , and some are exceedingly hard men .
But there is a simple - mindedness about them , an aversion to the handmaidens of introspection , a certain boyishness as in kids playing soldier .
A lot of make - believe goes into an officer ’s world .
Enlisted men , grown up , see things as they are .
Officers are issued a world by the command and then live in it .
Note the heavy emphasis of the military , meaning the officer corps , on ritual and pageantry .
It is adult kid -stuff .
Three thousand men building a skyscraper just show up , do their jobs , and go home .
The military wants its men standing in squares , precisely at attention , thumbs along the seams , with brass perfectly polished .
It wants stirring music , snappy salutes , and the haunting tones of taps ,  Yes sir , yes sir , three bags full , sir . 
This is justified as necessary for discipline .
It is n’t .
A gunny sergeant has no difficulty maintaining his authority without the hoop - la
Officers remind me of armed Moonies .
There is the same earnestness , the same deliberate optimism - by - policy .
Things are going well because doctrine says they are .
An officer is as ideologically upbeat as Reader ’s Digest , and as unreflective .
This is the why they do n’t learn , why the US is again flailing about , trying to fight hornets with elephant guns .
 Yessir , can do , sir . 
Well , sometimes , and sometimes not .
It is not arrogance , more like a belief in gravitation .
And so we hear phrases that embody the eternal precedence of oo - rah !
over realism :  There is no substitute for victory ,  or  The difficult we do immediately ; the impossible takes a little longer ,  or  Defeat is not an option . 
But sometimes it is an inevitability .
I think Jim is right .
Sooner or later , a unit wo n’t go up the hill again .
Then it will be over .

This actually happened to me , about three years ago .
At the time , I was working at the Royal Museum in Edinburgh , Scotland , classifying dead seabirds .
They would bring in the corpses from the latest natural disaster , covered in oil or chemical spillage .
I would examine their plumage , briefly decide on cause of death , and add the results to the statistical database whilst making comments about the museum getting more shags than I did .
So one day , I think it was a Thursday , I was sitting at my lab bench as usual .
Tony the message boy brought up a cardboard box , and inside was a remarkably well - preserved Arctic Tern corpse .
I washed my hands and laid it out on the table , but inspecting front and back I could see no cause of death .
I was about to head off to KFC for lunch when I heard a strange buzzing noise and this slightly disoriented man walked in .
After a few seconds , I noticed the resemblance .
His hair was close - cropped , not like my straggly mane .
His eyes were marked by fine wrinkles and he looked thinner , gaunter , tireder .
But he was exactly my height , and there was something very familiar about him .
" Who are you ? " I asked him .
" I think you already know . "
" But you ca n't be ... what are you ?
Do I have an older brother ? "
" I 'm you , " the stranger said , " twenty years later .
I 've come back to warn you . "
" How do I know you 're me ? " I demanded .
" Do n't you remember .
When I was a child we made a password for this occasion .
Devonian chicken slurry . "
I looked at him .
I did sort of remember a conversation about time travel and identity , and yet , now I was a real scientist and not just a kid with too many Robert Silverberg books , I had to take such things less trustingly .
" You must have overheard me .
Maybe I talk in my sleep . "
" You know you do n't do that . "
" How can I possibly know I do n't talk in my sleep ? " I asked him .
He was stumped .
" Ok , let 's think about childhood memories , " he said .
" Remember how you buried the goldfish under the cherry tree . "
It still was n't proof .
Maybe he was friendly with the dog that dug in the garden .
Maybe he read my mind .
But we had facilities in the museum to do DNA testing .
I took a blood sample from each of us and told my double to hide in the supplies cupboard .
He was muttering about having no time to waste , but I said he'd come 20 years and a couple of hours would n't matter .
As a concession to his worries , I locked the lab door .
The test results seemed to confirm it .
We shared the same DNA , or at least I could n't find any differences between us .
Results that were a trillion to one against .
I returned to the stranger to give him the news .
" So you have the same body as me , as well as the same mind , " I said .
" Assuming I can trust the test .
For all I know you 're a clone of me aging faster due to cellular damage from the cloning process .
Or maybe I 'm a clone of you .
Ew . "
" We have the same mind , " he said .
" Cloning does not explain that . "
" Actually the same mind thing proves nothing , because if someone created you with some kind of matter duplication ray and you have an identical body it is likely you will have an identical brain .
And possibly vice versa . "
I considered more hypotheses .
" You could be an evil duplicate of me sent back in time by a spurned lover or a scientific rival or a great crested grebe angry at finding his great grandfather spent his last minutes on my dissecting table . "
" This is ridiculous , " the interloper said , his patience snapping .
" See that bird on your dissecting table .
It is infected by a horrendous new virus that will wipe out the human race .
Unless you utterly destroy it now , all humanity will be reduced to a few hundred scientists scrabbling in research labs trying desperately to find a cure . "
" On the other hand , " I said .
" If I spend any more time talking to you , I 'll get fired from here , that 'll seriously damage my chances of ever getting more lab work or someday an academic position , and I 'll never even have the slightest possibility of being part of a scientific program aimed at combatting mysterious bird viruses . "
I weighed things up .
" Either way , I have to bid you farewell . "
He got angry at that point , but I had a scalpel easily to hand .
I stuffed his body in the incinerator and got back to work .
On my way home I chuckled at his warnings , thinking , " Hey , I 'm not dying of some bird disease . "
I got off the bus and walked up to my flat .
In the stairs 47 of me stepped out of the shadows and started bludgeoning me with baseball bats , rolling pins and metal bars .
I lapsed into a coma for three months , and when I awakened I could remember nothing .
That was the point at which I realised my future self had been full of shit .
Introduction
In my previous feature on CSS layouts , I talked a bit about the different CSS layout approaches available to a designer when building a web site .
In this feature , I ’d like to focus on a dynamic resolution dependent layout implementation that I think provides a strong alternative for those trying to find a balance between fluid and fixed layouts .
With dynamic layouts , the possibilities really are quite endless .
You can change 3 - column layouts to 2 - column layouts , provide appropriate font - sizes to increase legibility , and even reward higher resolution viewers with extra content and larger images .
And no , you do n’t have to put php in the CSS or lose the caching benefits of using external stylesheets to make it work .
Before I really got into JavaScript , I was always frustrated by how I could never really get a fluid layout to look right across all the different resolutions users were using to see my sites .
Columns never really scaled exactly the way I wanted them to and tiny font - sizes on higher resolutions , which were okay on lower resolutions , killed content legibility .
When I tried to drop 800x600 layouts , I ended up inconveniencing users that did n’t maximize their browser windows .
Until I saw The Man in Blue ’s article on Resolution Dependent Layouts , I felt fixed layouts failed to take advantage of the dynamic medium of the web and fluid layouts failed to truly adapt to the variety of viewing methods .
While The Man in Blue ’s implementation is a great piece of work , I think we can create our own version that ’s a bit more modular and easier to develop for both programmers and designers .
See It In Action
I ’ve built a quick demo page showcasing how a dynamic resolution dependent layout can offer adaptive alternatives with a very basic XHTML wireframe .
Just resize your browser to see the layout change accordingly .
What ’s nice about this method is that I do n’t have to load a completely new CSS file from scratch for each layout .
I only need to load the rules needed to adapt the default layout to the browser width size .
It ’s not so much a stylesheet switcher as it is a stylesheet adapter .
Implementation
To follow along , download dynamiclayouts.zip , which contains the files used in the demo above .
The first thing we want to do is to place inside the head element all the stylesheets we ’re going to be calling on to determine each dynamic layout .
Here ’s an example set from the demo :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/default.css " title = " default " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/thin.css " title = " thin " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/wide.css " title= " wide " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href=" css/wider.css " title= " wider " / >
Notice that we ’ve added title attributes to all of the link elements and designated the dynamic CSS stylesheets as “ alternate stylesheets ” in the rel attribute .
Be sure to indicate your primary CSS stylesheet by setting its title attribute to “ default . ”
The “ default ” stylesheet is used as the foundation for all of the dynamic layouts and if JavaScript is disabled , this will be the stylesheet that the site will use to display the page .
If you use multiple stylesheets to build the default view of your site , you ’ll want to title all of them as “ default ” so the script does n’t discard them when the layout is dynamically altered .
If you want to adapt this method to create a true CSS switcher , just remove the “ default ” title attribute and the script will disable the foundation stylesheet completely and use only the rules in the alternative stylesheet .
Next , we want to include the dynamiclayout JavaScript file :
< script src=" scripts/dynamiclayout.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
Inside the JavaScript take a look at the dynamicLayout function .
function dynamicLayout ( ) { var browser Width = getBrowserWidth ( ) ; //Load Thin CSS Rules if ( browserWidth < 750 ) { changeLayout ( " thin " ) ; } //Load Wide CSS Rules if ( ( browserWidth >= 750 ) && ( browserWidth <= 950 ) ) { changeLayout ( " wide " ) ; } //Load Wider CSS Rules if ( browserWidth > 950 ) { changeLayout ( " wider " ) ; } }
The heart of our process is in the browser width detection on the first line and we ’re going to use The Man In Blue ’s getBrowser Width ( ) function to help us find it .
Check out the code here :
function getBrowserWidth ( ) { if ( window.innerWidth ) { return window.innerWidth;} else if ( document.documentElement && document.documentElement.clientWidth != 0 ) { return document.documentElement.clientWidth ; } else if ( document.body ) {return document.body.clientWidth;} return 0 ; }
For the demo , I ’ve set it up so the site adapts to 3 different resolution scenarios based on browser width : smaller than 750 px , larger than 750 px ( but smaller than 950 px ) and larger than 950 px .
The changeLayout functions that are used in dynamicLayout correspond to the title attributes in our alternative stylesheets .
As you can see , it ’ll be pretty easy to tweak the if statements to your own needs .
Now , inside of your “ alternative stylesheets ” , you ’ll want to specify the rule changes needed to change your default layout to adapt to that particular resolution scenario .
The CSS rules in the alternative stylesheets are applied after the default CSS file is loaded so they ’ll override any rules that do n’t have ! important selectors applied to them .
While you could redo every CSS rule in the default stylesheet , often layouts do n’t need many changes to make them work in different situations .
In the demo , for example , while the “ default ” stylesheet uses over 10 rules to create the foundation design ( some sites use over 100 rules ) , the “ thin ” CSS stylesheet need only to change a few rules and selectors to make the site work on small browser widths :
/* -----
Thin CSS Rules ----- */ body { font - size :.8em ; } # container{ width :80 % ; } # primaryContent{ width : 100 % ; line - height : 125 px ; } # secondaryContent{ width : 100 % ; line - height : 125 px ; }
This is one of the key strengths to using this method for creating dynamic layouts .
We can easily switch from fixed to fluid layouts based on what ’s going to be best for the user and each layout is conveniently contained in it ’s own external file , so we only need to specify the changes needed to adapt a design for a particular situation .
This makes it easier to understand , faster to design ( because it reduces CSS redundancy ) and better to develop with because it keeps the presentation layer neatly separated from the behavior layer .
To finish up , we ’re just use John Resig ’s winning addEvent function to run our functions when the page is loaded and when the users resize their browser windows .
//addEvent( ) by John Resig function addEvent ( obj , type , fn ) { if ( obj.addEventListener ) { obj.addEventListener( type , fn , false ) ; } else if ( obj.attachEvent ) { obj [ " e " + type+fn ] = fn ; obj[ type+fn ] = function ( ) { obj [ " e " +type+fn ] ( window.event ) ; } obj.attachEvent( " on " +type , obj[ type+fn ] ) ; } } // Run dynamicLayout function when page loads and when it resizes .
addEvent ( window , ' load ' , dynamicLayout ) ; addEvent ( window , ' resize ' , dynamicLayout ) ;
If you feel changing the layout on resize is a bit too jarring , just remove the second addEvent call to dynamicLayout on resize to limit layout adaptation to occurring only when the web page is first loaded or refreshed by the user .
One nice thing about using these functions is that you can easily adapt the code with a little cookie magic to create a better stylesheet switcher to provide your users the choice of what layout option they prefer .
Final Thoughts
Before I leave you be , I ’d like to take some time to talk about how I think this implementation should have been created .
Ideally we should be manipulating the @import CSS rules to choose the appropriate stylesheet to tack on the end of the default CSS file .
Unfortunately , W3 C ’s specifications for dealing with CSS rules in JavaScript are so badly implemented across the browsers that we have to use a hacked CSS stylesheet switcher function based on disabling link elements from 2001 to make dynamic layouts work sanely .
C’mon people , help me with the magic making .
I honestly believe that proper CSS rule implementation by the browser vendors could create the low barrier of entry needed to get a majority of designers to the next level of web development : DOM manipulation .
It would be so much easier to learn how to manipulate the presentation layer , if we could use the same vocabulary for making changes in CSS in JavaScript .
For example , how nice would it be to be able to use following :
var defaultSheet = document.styleSheets [0 ] ; defaultSheet.insertRule ( " #container{width:500 px ;} " ) ;
or
totalRules = defaultSheet.cssRules.length ; lastRule = defaultSheet.cssRules[totalRules - 1 ] ; defaultSheet.addImport("/css/wide.css " , lastRule ) ;
Yeah , well too bad for us .
Most of the syntax for manipulating CSS rules is forked between IE and Gecko browsers and Safari refuses to change the page rendering even though it recognizes the methods .
It ’s sad to see how this prevents a lot of exciting possibilities and I hope the recent JavaScript renaissance will help people recognize these limitations so they can ask for them to be fixed .
If you want to read more about the problems with CSS rule implementation in JavaScript , check out Peter - Paul Koch ’s article on the subject .
Anyway , I ’m off my soap box now .
Have fun with dynamic resolution dependent layouts and be sure to keep in touch with your favorite browser vendor about CSS rules !

The first our wonderful commander in chief and his buddies in the military and the Republican congress heard of all the problems at Walter Reed was in this weekend 's Washington Post .
Funny that , since Salon.com reported on many of the very same problems two years ago .
That means that not only are these problems not new .
But the Pentagon and White House knew about them at least two years ago ( and who does n't think they knew long before that ? ) .

By all means let 's be open - minded , but not so open - minded that our brains drop out .
Richard Dawkins , in " Science , Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder , "
Sometimes , especially with Web 2.0 companies , jargon can get a little bit out of hand .
When someone says that a service allows you to " build an API for any website " , it can be a bit difficult to understand what that really means .
However , put simply , Dapper is a scraper .
Nothing more .
It allows you to scrape content from a Web page and convert it into an XML document that can be easily used at another location .
Though you wo n't find the words " scrape " or " scraper " anywhere on its site , that is exactly what it does .
What separates Dapper from other scrapers , both legitimate and illegitimate , is that it is both free and easy to use .
In short , it makes the process of setting up the scraper simple enough for your every day Internet user .
While one has never needed to be a geek to scrape RSS feeds , now the technologically impaired can scrape content from any site , even those that do n't publish RSS feeds .
Though the TechCrunch profile of the service says that Dapper " aims to offer some legitimate , valuable services and set up a means to respect copyright " others are expressing concern about the potential for copyright violations , especially by spam bloggers .
Either way though , both the cause for concern and the potential dangers are very , very real .
What is Dapper
When a user goes to create a new " Dapp " , he or she first needs to provide a series of links .
These links must be on the same domain and in similar formats ( IE : Google searches for different terms or different blog posts on a single site ) for the service to work .
Once the links have been defined , the user is then taken to a GUI where they pick out fields .
In a simple example where the user would create their own RSS feed for a blog , the post title might be one field , perhaps called " post title " and the body would be a second , perhaps called " post body " .
Dapper , much like the service social bookmarking Clipmarks , is able able to intelligently select blocks of text on a Web page , making it easy to ensure that the entire post body is selected and that extraneous information is omitted .
Once the fields have been selected , the user can then either create groups based upon those fields or simply save the dapp for future use .
Once the Dapp has been saved , they can then use it to create both raw XML data , an RSS feed , a Google Gadget or any number of other output files that can be easily used in other services .
If you are interested in viewing a demo of Dapper , you can do so at this link .
There is little doubt that Dapper is an impressive service .
It has taken the black art of scraping and made it into a simple , easy - to - use application that just about anyone can pick up .
Though it might take a few tries to create a working Dapp , and certainly spending some time reading up on the service is required , most will find it easy to use , especially when compared to the alternatives .
However , it 's this ease of use that has so many worried .
Though scrapers have been around for many years , they have been either difficult to use or expensive .
Dapper 's power , when combined with its price tag and sheer ease of use , has many wondered that it might be ushering not a new age for the Web , but a new age for scrapers seeking to abuse other 's hard work .
Cause for Concern
While being easy to use or free is not necessarily a problem in and of itself , in the rush to enable users to make an API for any site , they forget that many sites do n't have one or restrict access to their APIs for very good reasons .
RSS scraping is perhaps the biggest copyright issue bloggers face .
It enables a plagiarist or spammer to not only steal all of the content on the blog right then , but also all of the content that will be posted in the future .
This is a huge concern for many bloggers , especially those concerned about performing well in the search engines .
This has prompted many blogs to either disable their RSS feeds , truncate them or move them to a feed monitoring service such as Feedburner .
However , if users can simply create their own RSS feeds with ease , these protections are circumvented and Webmasters lose control over their content .
Even with potential copyright abuse issues aside , Dapper creates potential problems for Webmasters .
It bypasses the usual metrics that site owners have .
A user who reads a site , or large portions of it , through a Dapp will not be counted in either the feed statistics or , depending on how Dapper is set up , even in the site 's logs .
All the while , the site is spending precious resources to feed the Dapp , taking money out of the Webmaster 's pocket .
This combination of greater expense , less traffic and less accurate metrics can be dangerous to Webmasters who are working to get accurate traffic counts , visitor feedback or revenue .
Worse still , Dapp users also bypass any ads or other monetization tools that might be included in the site or the original RSS feed .
This has a direct impact on sites trying to either turn a profit or , like this one , recoup some of the costs of hosting .
Despite this , it 's the copyright concerns that reign supreme .
Though screen scraping is not necessarily an evil technology , it is the sinister uses that have gotten the most attention and , sadly , seem to be the most common , especially in regards to blogs .
Even if the makers of Dapper is aiming to add copyright protection at a later date , the service is fully functional today and , though the FAQ states that they will " comply with any verified request by the lawful owner of the content to cease using his content , " there is no opt - out procedure , no DMCA information on the United States Copyright Office Web site , no information on how to prevent Dapper from accessing your site and nothing but a contact page to get in touch with the makers of the service .
( Note : An email sent to the makers of Dapper on the 22nd has , as of yet , gone unanswered )
In addition to creating a potential copyright nightmare for Webmasters the site seems to be setting itself up for a lawsuit .
In addition to not being DMCA Safe Harbor compliant ( PDF ) , thus opening it up to copyright infringement lawsuits directly , the service seems to be vulnerable to a lawsuit under the MGM v. Grokster case , which found that service providers can be sued for infringement conducted by its users if they fail an " inducement " test .
Sadly for Dapper , simply saying that it is the user 's responsibility is not adequate to pass such a test , as Grokster found out .
The failure to offer filtering technology and encouragement to create API 's for " any " site are both likely strikes against Dapper in that regard .
To make matters more grim , copyright is not the only issue scrapers have to worry about , as one pair of lawyers put it , there are at least four different different legal theories that make scraping illegal including the computer fraud and abuse act , trespass against chattels and breach of contract .
All in all , copyright is practically the least of Dapper 's problems .
When it 's all said and done , there is a lot of room for concern , not just on the part of Webmasters that might be affected by Dapper or its users , but also its makers .
These intellectual property and other legal issues could easily sink the entire project .
Conclusions
It is obvious that a lot of time and effort went into creating Dapper .
It 's a very powerful , easy to use service that opens up interesting possibilities .
I would hate to see the service used for ill and I would hate even worse to see all of the hard work that went into it lost because of intellectual property issues .
However , in its current incarnation , it seems likely that Dapper is going to encounter significant resistance on the IP front .
There is little , if any protection or regard for intellectual property under the current system and , once bloggers find out that their content is being syndicated without their permission by the service , many are likely to start raising a fuss .
Even though Dapper has gotten rave reviews in the Web 2.0 community , it seems likely that traditional bloggers and other Web site owners will have serious objections to it .
Those people , sadly , most likely have never heard of Dapper at this point .
With that being said , it is a service everyone needs to make note of .
The one thing that is for certain is that it will be in the news again .
The only question is what light will it be under .

( CREATORS ) --
The purpose of this old - fashioned newspaper crusade to stop the war is not to make George W. Bush look like the dumbest president ever .
People have done dumber things .
What were they thinking when they bought into the Bay of Pigs fiasco ?
How dumb was the Egypt - Suez war ?
How massively stupid was the entire war in Vietnam ?
Even at that , the challenge with this misbegotten adventure is that WE simply cannot let it continue .
It is not a matter of whether we will lose or we are losing .
We have lost .
Gen. John P. Abizaid , until recently the senior commander in the Middle East , insists that the answer to our problems there is not military .
" You have to internationalize the problem .
You have to attack it diplomatically , geo - strategically , " he said .
His assessment is supported by Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , the senior American commander in Iraq , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who only recommend releasing forces with a clear definition of the goals for the additional troops .
Bush 's call for a " surge " or " escalation " also goes against the Iraq Study Group .
Talk is that the White House has planned to do anything but what the group suggested after months of investigation and proposals based on much broader strategic implications .
About the only politician out there besides Bush actively calling for a surge is Sen. John McCain .
In a recent opinion piece , he wrote : " The presence of additional coalition forces would allow the Iraqi government to do what it cannot accomplish today on its own -- impose its rule throughout the country .
...
By surging troops and bringing security to Baghdad and other areas , we will give the Iraqis the best possible chance to succeed . "
But with all due respect to the senator from Arizona , that ship has long since sailed .
A surge is not acceptable to the people in this country -- we have voted overwhelmingly against this war in polls ( about 80 percent of the public is against escalation , and a recent Military Times poll shows only 38 percent of active military want more troops sent ) and at the polls .
We know this is wrong .
The people understand , the people have the right to make this decision , and the people have the obligation to make sure our will is implemented .
Congress must work for the people in the resolution of this fiasco .
Ted Kennedy 's proposal to control the money and tighten oversight is a welcome first step .
And if Republicans want to continue to rubber - stamp this administration 's idiotic " plans " and go against the will of the people , they should be thrown out as soon as possible , to join their recent colleagues .
Anyone who wants to talk knowledgably about our Iraq misadventure should pick up Rajiv Chandrasekaran 's " Imperial Life in the Emerald City : Inside Iraq 's Green Zone . "
It 's like reading a horror novel .
You just want to put your face down and moan :
How could we have let this happen ?
How could we have been so stupid ?
As The Washington Post 's review notes , Chandrasekaran 's book " methodically documents the baffling ineptitude that dominated U.S. attempts to influence Iraq 's fiendish politics , rebuild the electrical grid , privatize the economy , run the oil industry , recruit expert staff or instill a modicum of normalcy to the lives of Iraqis . "
We are the people who run this country .
We are the deciders .
And every single day , every single one of us needs to step outside and take some action to help stop this war .
Raise hell .
Think of something to make the ridiculous look ridiculous .
Make our troops know we 're for them and trying to get them out of there .
Hit the streets to protest Bush 's proposed surge .
If you can , go to the peace march in Washington on January 27 .
We need people in the streets , banging pots and pans and demanding , " Stop it , now ! "

The GOP's $ 3 Billion Propaganda Organ The American Right achieved its political dominance in Washington over the past quarter century with the help of more than $ 3 billion spent by Korean cult leader Sun Myung Moon on a daily propaganda organ , the Washington Times , according to a 21 - year veteran of the newspaper .

Printer friendly George Archibald , who describes himself “ as the first reporter hired at the Washington Times outside the founding group ” and author of a commemorative book on the Times ’ first two decades , has now joined a long line of disillusioned conservative writers who departed and warned the public about extremism within the newspaper .
In an Internet essay on recent turmoil inside the Times , Archibald also confirmed claims by some former Moon insiders that the cult leader has continued to pour in $ 100 million a year or more to keep the newspaper afloat .
Archibald put the price tag for the newspaper ’s first 24 years at “ more than $ 3 billion of cash . ”
At the newspaper ’s tenth anniversary , Moon announced that he had spent $ 1 billion on the Times – or $ 100 million a year – but newspaper officials and some Moon followers have since tried to low - ball Moon ’s subsidies in public comments by claiming they had declined to about $ 35 million a year .
The figure from Archibald and other defectors from Moon ’s operation is about three times higher than the $ 35 million annual figure .
The apparent goal of downplaying Moon ’s subsidy has been to quiet concerns that Moon was funneling vast sums of illicit money into the United States to influence the American political process in ways favorable to right - wing leaders – and possibly criminal cartels – around the world .
Though best known as the founder of the Unification Church , Moon , now 86 , has long worked with right - wing political forces linked to organized crime and international drug smuggling , including the Japanese yakuza gangs and South American cocaine traffickers .
Moon insiders , including his former daughter - in - law Nansook Hong , also have described Moon ’s system for laundering cash into the United States and then funneling much of it into his businesses and influence - buying apparatus , led by the Washington Times .
The Times , in turn , has targeted American politicians of the center and left with journalistic attacks – sometimes questioning their sanity , as happened with Democratic presidential nominees Michael Dukakis and Al Gore .
Those themes then resonate through the broader right - wing echo chamber and into the mainstream media .
Washington
Times articles are routinely cited by C - SPAN , for instance , without explanations to viewers that the newspaper is financed by an ultra - right religious cult leader , a convicted tax fraud and a publicly identified money - launderer .
Most American listeners just think they ’re getting straightforward news .
The Times also has led attacks on investigators who threatened to expose crimes committed by Republican and right - wing operatives .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Times targeted Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh , who recounted in his memoir Firewall the importance of the Times in protecting the Reagan - Bush administration ’s legal flanks .
When journalistic and congressional investigations began uncovering evidence of drug trafficking by the Nicaraguan contra rebels , the Washington Times counter - attacked , too , although in that case the Moon organization may have had a direct interest in containing the probes that could have exposed its relationship with South American drug lords .
Buying Influence Besides the estimated $ 3 billion - plus invested in the Washington Times , Moon has spread money around to influential right - wingers , often coming to their rescue when they are facing financial ruin as happened with Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell in the mid-1990s .
[ See below . ]
Moon also has paid lucrative speaking fees to political figures , such as former President George H.W. Bush who has appeared at Moon - organized functions in the United States , Asia and South America .
At the launch of Moon ’s South American newspaper in 1996 , Bush hailed Moon as “ the man with the vision . ”
Moon has key defenders , too , in the U.S. Congress , such as Sen. Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
In 2004 , Moon was given space in the Senate ’s Dirksen building for a coronation of himself as “ savior , Messiah , Returning Lord and True Parent . ”
[ See The Hill , June 22 , 2004 ]
Though primarily allied with the Republican Right , Moon has tossed money to some African - American ministers to gain favor with a key Democratic constituency .
Moon ’s multi-billion - dollar political investments , in turn , have shielded him from sustained scrutiny since 1978 when he was identified by the congressional “ Koreagate ” investigation as part of a covert Korean influence - buying scheme .
As a result of those findings about his finances , he was convicted in 1982 of tax fraud .
Ironically , however , as Moon implemented the influence - buying blueprint exposed by the “ Koreagate ” probe – investing in U.S. media , politicians and academia – he became an untouchable .
He founded the Washington Times in 1982 and quickly put it into the service of Republican power .
President Ronald Reagan hailed Moon ’s publication as his “ favorite newspaper ” ; it even helped raise money for the Nicaraguan contras ; and President George H.W. Bush invited its editor Wesley Pruden to the White House in 1991 “ just to tell you how valuable the Times has become in Washington , where we read it every day . ”
Washington
Times defenders argue that the newspaper is independent of Moon ’s religion and does n’t proselytize for his faith .
But the argument misses the point because Moon ’s organization is only a religious entity on one level .
More substantively , it is an international conglomerate with investments in fishing , restaurants , gun manufacturing , tourism , banks , real estate and media .
Since its finances often operate on the shady side of the law , Moon ’s organization requires , most of all , political influence for protection .
Similarly , Moon ’s operation is not really “ conservative ” in the normal sense of the word .
While it has worked with everyone from right - of - center Republicans to neo - fascist organizations , it also has joined forces with the reclusive communist leaders of North Korea when that was to Moon ’s advantage .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Moon , North Korea & the Bushes . ” ]
Power Struggle Veteran Washington
Times journalist Archibald as well as other Times employees who recently spoke to The Nation magazine have described a bitter internal struggle at the newspaper .
Times president “ Douglas ” Dong Moon Joo is standing by Pruden and other right - wing editors who have run the Times for years , while other influential Moon operatives believe it ’s time to abandon the newspaper ’s hard - right positions .
“ A nasty succession battle is now heating up at the paper , punctuated by allegations of racism , sexism and unprofessional conduct , that have implications far beyond its fractious newsroom , ” wrote Max Blumenthal in The Nation .
“ According to several reliable inside sources , Preston Moon , the youngest son of Korean Unification Church leader and Times financier Sun Myung Moon , has initiated a search committee to find a replacement for editor - in - chief Wesley Pruden – a replacement who is not Pruden ’s handpicked successor , managing editor Francis Coombs .
“ Preston Moon wants to wrest control of the paper from Pruden and Coombs , according to a Times senior staffer , in order to shift the paper away from their brand of conservatism , which is characterized by extreme racial animus and connections to nativist and neo-Confederate organizations .
A Harvard MBA , Preston Moon is said to be seeking to install an editorial regime with more widely palatable politics . ”
Archibald ’s essay describes Pruden as “ an unreconstructed Confederate from Little Rock , Arkansas , who still believes the South and slavery were right and Lincoln was wrong in saving the Union . ”
Pruden ’s father , Wesley Pruden Sr. , was a Baptist minister and chaplain to Little Rock ’s segregationist Capital Citizens Council , which spearheaded the opposition to President Dwight Eisenhower ’s order in 1957 to integrate the city ’s Central High School .
In the 1990s , Pruden ’s Washington Times continued to tap into those old segregationist ties , such as “ Justice ” Jim Johnson , to get salacious allegations about President Bill Clinton and his wife , Hillary .
The mainstream press soon followed , setting the stage for the Republican congressional sweep in 1994 and Clinton ’s impeachment in 1998 .
In 2000 , the Washington Times again was at the center of the assault on Al Gore ’s candidacy – highlighting apocryphal quotes by Gore and using them to depict him as either dishonest or delusional .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Al Gore vs. the Media . ” ]
By then , however , the Washington Times had the help of a rapidly expanding right - wing media as well as mainstream journalists from the New York Times and the Washington Post who had come to realize the career advantage of tilting their reporting to the right .
Arguably one of the measures of the Washington Times ’ success was how the major U.S. news organizations increasingly seemed to march to the same drummer , even when not under direct pressure to do so .
Over the past half dozen years , it has often been hard to distinguish between the fawning coverage of George W. Bush from the Washington Times and from the Washington Post .
Both major Washington dailies bought into Bush ’s false claims about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction with almost no skepticism .
Currently , the Washington Times seems inclined to continue serving as a leading defender of Republican power and thus of President Bush .
Calling itself “ America ’s Newspaper , ” the Moon - financed Times also has championed the cause of anti-immigration activists , another hot - button issue on the Right .
But the Times and other right - wing news outlets risk a credibility crisis as more and more Americans turn away from the Bush presidency and are turned off by the right - wing rhetoric demonizing citizens who have objected to Bush ’s policies .
Nevertheless , history will surely record that Moon ’s $ 3 billion - plus investment succeeded in buying a remarkable degree of Washington influence – and legal protection – for his dubious political / business / religious empire .
The extraordinary rise of Sun Myung Moon also tells a cynical story about how “ respectability ” is just one more Washington commodity that can be purchased with enough money .
Known for crowning himself at lavish ceremonies and ranting for hours in Korean about the proper use of sex organs , Sun Myung Moon may have the distinction of being the most unusual person ever to gain substantial influence in the U.S. capital .
He has proved that in Washington , money talks .
When Moon became a major benefactor of the American conservative movement starting in the latter half of the 1970s , it was a time when the conservatives desperately needed money to build what they called their counter - establishment .
From a mysterious and seemingly bottomless slush fund , Moon ladled out cash to sponsor lavish conferences , to finance political interest groups and to publish the Washington Times .
Despite his strange goals – including the need to replace democracy and individuality with his own personal theocratic rule over the most intimate details of every person ’s life – Moon lured into his circle some of the most prominent political figures of the modern era , including George H.W. Bush who grasped Moon ’s value as a deep pocket for the conservative movement and for the Bush family .
Moon began building his political influence in Washington at a time when he was best known to Americans as the leader of the Unification Church , called the “ Moonies . ”
Moon was blamed by thousands of American parents for brain - washing their children and transforming them into automatons who gave up their previous lives to devote nearly every waking hour in the service of Rev. Moon .
Gradually , however , Moon ’s money gained him access to the nation ’s ruling elite .
The worst of the negative press coverage subsided .
But few Americans , even those who took his money , knew much about his life and his true allegiances .
Who Is Moon ?
Moon was born on Jan. 6 , 1920 , in a rural , northwestern corner of Korea , a rugged Asian peninsula then occupied by Japan , an occupation that would continue through the first 25 years of Moon ’s life .
Allied forces liberated the peninsula from the Japanese in 1945 and then divided Korea into two sections , the south controlled by the United States and the north occupied by Soviet troops .
In this post - war period , Moon , who had been raised within a Christian sect , moved to southern Korea and joined a mystical religious group called Israel Suo-won .
The group preached the imminent arrival of a Korean Messiah and practiced a strange sexual ritual called “ pikarume , ” in which ministers purified women through sexual intercourse , the so - called “ blessing of the womb . ”
As he developed his own theology , Moon returned to the North , to communist - ruled North Korea , where he soon ran into legal troubles .
North Korean authorities arrested him twice , apparently on morals charges connected to his sexual rites with young women .
Moon ’s supporters , however , have tried to portray Moon as the victim of communist repression , claiming that he was arrested not for sex charges but for espionage .
Whatever the real story about his detention in North Korea , Moon ’s luck soon changed .
On Oct. 14 , 1950 , with war raging on the Korean peninsula , United Nations troops overran the prison where Moon was held , freeing Moon and all the other inmates .
According to Unification Church histories ,
Moon then trekked south , carrying on his back an injured prisoner named Pak Chung Hwa .
For years , church officials even published a photograph purportedly showing Pak piggy - backing on Moon across a river .
But much of that story appears to be propaganda .
Several church sources have since admitted that the photo was a hoax , that Moon is not the man in the picture and the location is not where Moon was .
Moon ’s southward journey ended in the South Korean port of Pusan , where he resumed his missionary work .
He later moved to Seoul , South Korea ’s capital , where he founded his own church in May 1954 .
He called it T’ong - il Kyo , or Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity .
It became known as the Unification Church .
At the center of Moon ’s theology was a new twist to the Old Testament story about the Fall of Man.
Instead of biting into a forbidden apple , Eve copulated with Satan and then passed on the sin by having sex with Adam .
Thousands of years later , God sent Jesus to restore man to his original purity , Moon taught .
But Jesus failed because he was betrayed by the Jews and died before he could father any sinless children .
Sex , therefore , remained at the center of Moon ’s theology , the need for a Messiah to purify the human race through the reversal of the contamination caused by Satan ’s seduction of Eve .
Moon taught that the failure of Jesus to begin this purification process by fathering children forced God to send a second Messiah , who turned out to be Moon himself .
Moon saw his task as starting this sexual purification process and thus establishing God ’s Kingdom on Earth .
The ultimate goal would be a worldwide theocracy ruled by Moon and his followers cleansed of Satan ’s influence .
Political power and religious authority went together , Moon lectured .
“ We cannot separate the political field from the religious , ” Moon said .
But in South Korea , Moon found that government continued to be an obstacle to his religious plans .
When he began to concentrate his religious recruitment on young idealistic college students , especially from an all - girls Christian school , Moon landed in legal hot water again .
The South Korean government arrested Moon in 1955 for allegedly conducting more sexual “ purification ” rites , according to several U.S. intelligence reports which are now public .
Moon was freed three months later because none of the young women would testify for fear of public humiliation , according to an undated FBI summary , released under a Freedom of Information Act request .
“ During the next two years in the national news media of South Korea , Rev. Moon was the butt of scandalist humor , ” the FBI report said .
Six Marys Church officials repeatedly have denied the reports of Moon ’s sexual rituals .
But the charges received new attention in 1993 with the Japanese publication of The Tragedy of the Six Marys -- a book by the early Moon disciple , Pak Chung Hwa , whom Moon supposedly carried to South Korea .
According to Pak ’s book , Moon taught that Jesus was intended to save mankind by having sex with six already - married women who would then have sex with other men who would pass on the purification to other women until , eventually , all mankind would have pure blood .
Pak contended that Moon took on this personal duty as the second Messiah and began having sex with the “ six Marys . ”
But Pak alleged that Moon began to abuse the practice by turning the “ six Marys ” into a kind of rotating sex club .
Pak wrote that Moon ’s first wife divorced him after catching him in a sex ritual .
In all , Pak estimated that there were at least 60 “ Marys , ” many of whom ended up destitute after Moon discarded them .
According to the testimony of one “ Mary , ” named Yu Shin Hee , she met Moon in the early 1950s and became a follower along with her husband .
Devoted to the church , her husband abandoned her and her five children , whom she then put into an orphanage .
She , in turn , agreed to become one of Moon ’s “ six Marys . ”
But Yu Shin
Hee claimed that Moon tired of her after just one “ blood exchange , ” a phrase referring to sexual intercourse .
Still , she was required to have sex with other men .
Seven years later , a broken woman with no money , she tried to return to her children , but they also rejected her .
When Moon impregnated another one of the women , Moon sent her to Japan where she gave birth to a baby boy , according to Pak ’s account .
Moon later admitted fathering the child , who died in a train crash at the age of 13 .
But Pak wrote that Moon refused to admit responsibility for other illegitimate children born to the women .
“ By forwarding this teaching , he violated mothers , their daughters , their sisters , ” Pak wrote .
( After The Tragedy of the Six Marys was published , the Unification Church denounced the allegations as spurious .
Under intense pressure , the aging Pak Chung Hwa agreed to recant .
However , his book ’s accounts tracked closely with U.S. intelligence reports of the same period and interviews with former church leaders . )
Moon ’s history of sexual liaisons out of wedlock also was corroborated by Nansook Hong , one of Moon ’s daughters - in - law who broke with the so - called True Family in 1995 over abuse she suffered at the hands of Moon ’s eldest son , Hyo Jin Moon , during their 14 - year marriage .
Nansook
Hong reported in her 1998 book ,
In the Shadow of the Moons , that family members , including Moon himself , acknowledged that he had “ providential ” sex with women in his role as the Messiah .
Nansook Hong said she learned about Moon ’s sexual affairs when her husband , Hyo Jin , began justifying his affairs as mandated by God , as his father claimed his affairs were .
“ I went directly to Mrs. Moon with Hyo Jin ’s claims , ” Nansook Hong wrote .
“ She was both furious and tearful .
She had hoped that such pain would end with her , that it would not be passed on to the next generation , she told me .
“ No one knows the pain of a straying husband like True Mother , she assured me .
I was stunned .
We had all heard rumors for years about Sun Myung Moon ’s affairs and the children he sired out of wedlock , but here was True Mother , confirming the truth of these stories .
“ I told her that Hyo Jin said his sleeping around was ‘ providential ’ and inspired by God , just as Father ’s affairs were .
‘ No , Father is the Messiah , not Hyo Jin .
What Father did was in God ’s plan . ’ ”
Later , in a discussion about the extramarital sex , Moon himself told Nansook Hong that “ what happened in his past was ‘ providential , ’ ” she wrote .
As for the sexual purification rituals , Nansook Hong said the rumors had followed the church for decades , despite the official denials .
“ In the early days of the Unification Church , members met in a small house with two rooms , ” Nansook Hong wrote .
“ It was known as the House of the Three Doors .
It was rumored that at the first door one was made to take off one ’s jacket , at the second door one ’s outer clothing , and at the third one ’s undergarments in preparation for sex . ”
As for Chung Hwa Pak ’s Tragedy of the Six Marys , Nansook Hong said Moon succeeded in persuading his old associate to rejoin the church and then got him to disavow the memoirs .
“ I ’ve always wondered what the price was of that retraction , ” Nansook Hong wrote .
Madeleine Pretorious , a Unification Church member from South Africa , also had worked closely with Moon ’s temperamental son , Hyo Jin , and had learned from him that the long - denied accounts of Moon ’s sexual rites with female initiates were true .
“ When Hyo Jin found out about his father ’s ‘ purification ’ rituals , that took a lot out of wind out of his sails , ” Pretorious told me in an interview after she left the church in the mid-1990s .
In late 1994 , during conversations in Hyo Jin 's suite at the New Yorker Hotel , " he confided a lot of things to me , " Pretorious said .
Hyo Jin also had discovered that the Reverend Moon fathered a child out of wedlock in the early 1970s .
Moon arranged for the child to be raised by his longtime lieutenant Bo Hi Pak , Pretorious said .
The boy – now a young man – had confronted Hyo Jin , seeking recognition as Hyo Jin 's half - brother .
Pretorious said she later corroborated the story with other church members .
Intelligence Ties
The alleged sexual rituals , which involved passing around women , would become a point of embarrassment later , but the practices apparently helped the Unification Church in recruiting men in the early days .
By the late 1950s , Moon had managed to build a small cadre of loyal followers and was reaching out beyond Korea .
By the early 1960s , the church also was pulling in better educated young men , including some with connections to South Korea 's intelligence services .
Kim Jong - Pil and three other young English - speaking army officers became closely associated with Moon 's church during this transitional phase as the institution evolved from an obscure Korean sect into a powerful international organization .
Beyond his association with Moon ’s sect , Kim Jong - Pil was a rising star in South Korea ’s intelligence community .
In 1961 , he founded the KCIA , which centralized Seoul 's internal and external intelligence activities .
Another one of the promising young KCIA officers was Colonel Bo Hi Pak , also a Moon disciple .
With these KCIA officers , however , it was never clear whether the benefits of the religion were paramount or if they simply recognized the potential that an international church held as a cover for intelligence operations .
In many countries , especially the United States , churches are granted broad protections against government interference .
With missionaries traveling around the world and with church members attending international religious conferences , a church also provided an effective cover for spying , money - laundering or passing on messages to agents .
In 1962 , KCIA founder Kim Jong - Pil traveled to San Francisco where he met with Unification Church members .
According to an account later published by a congressional investigation , Kim Jong - Pil promised discreet support for Moon 's church .
At the same time of his contacts with associates from the Unification Church , Kim Jong - Pil was in charge of another sensitive negotiation : talks to improve bilateral relations with Japan , Korea ’s historic enemy .
Those talks put Kim Jong - Pil in touch with two other important figures in the Far East , Japanese rightists Yoshio Kodama and Ryoichi Sasakawa , who once hailed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini as " the perfect fascist . "
Kodama and Sasakawa were jailed as fascist war criminals at the end of World War II , but a few years later , both Kodama and Sasakawa were freed by U.S. military intelligence officials .
The U.S. government turned to Kodama and Sasakawa for help in combating communist labor unions and student strikes , much as the CIA protected German Nazi war criminals who supplied intelligence and performed other services in the intensifying Cold War battles with European communists .
Kodama and Sasakawa obliged U.S. intelligence by dispatching right - wing goon squads to break up demonstrations , according to the authoritative book , Yakuza , by David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro .
Kodama and Sasakawa also allegedly grew rich from their association with the yakuza , a shadowy organized crime syndicate that profited off drug smuggling , gambling and prostitution in Japan and Korea .
Behind the scenes , Kodama and Sasakawa became power - brokers in Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party .
Kim Jong - Pil 's contacts with these right - wing leaders proved invaluable to the Unification Church , which had made only a few converts in Japan by the early 1960s .
Immediately after Kim Jong - Pil opened the door to Kodama and Sasakawa in late 1962 , 50 leaders of an ultra-nationalist Japanese Buddhist sect converted en masse to the Unification Church , according to Kaplan and Dubro .
" Sasakawa became an advisor to Reverend Sun Myung Moon 's Japanese branch of the Unification Church " and collaborated with Moon in building far - right anti-communist organizations in Asia , Kaplan and Dubro wrote .
The church 's growth spurt did not escape the notice of U.S. intelligence officers in the field .
One CIA report , dated Feb. 26 , 1963 , stated that " Kim Jong - Pil organized the Unification Church while he was director of the ROK [ Republic of Korea ] Central Intelligence Agency , and has been using the church , which had a membership of 27,000 , as a political tool . "
Though Moon 's church had existed since the mid-1950s , the report appeared correct in noting Kim Jong - Pil 's key role in transforming the church from a minor Korean sect into a potent international organization .
New Worlds
With alliances in place in Tokyo and Seoul , the Unification Church next took aim at Washington .
In 1964 , Bo Hi Pak , who was emerging as one of Moon ’s most able lieutenants , moved to America and started the Korean Cultural and Freedom Foundation , a front that performed the dual purpose of helping Moon meet important Americans , while assisting the KCIA in its international operations .
Bo Hi Pak named KCIA founder Kim Jong - Pil to be the foundation 's " honorary chairman . "
The foundation also sponsored the KCIA ’s anti-communist propaganda outlets , such as Radio of Free Asia , according to the congressional report on the “ Koreagate ” scandal .
Moon 's church also was active in the Asian People 's Anti-Communist League , a fiercely right - wing group founded by the governments of South Korea and Taiwan .
In 1966 , the group expanded into the World Anti-Communist League , an international alliance that brought together traditional conservatives with former Nazis , overt racialists and Latin American “ death squad ” operatives .
Retired U.S. Army Gen. John K. Singlaub , a former WACL president , told me that “ the Japanese [ WACL ] chapter was taken over almost entirely by Moonies . ”
By the 1970s , the U.S. public was aware of Moon and his church , but much of the attention was negative .
Parents complained that the church brainwashed their children and pressured them to cut off contacts with their families , while proclaiming Moon their “ True Father . ”
The totalitarian nature of Moon 's church stood out in his staging of mass marriages , or " blessings , " in which he would pair up husbands and wives who had never met .
Moon also regulated the sexual behavior of even his married followers , a practice that replaced the more personal method of “ blessing the womb ” that allegedly had prevailed in the church ’s early days .
In 1973 , amid American reversals in Indochina , alarm began to spread within Seoul ’s right - wing dictatorship about the strength of the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea in case of aggression from the communist North .
Those fears led the KCIA , long known for its gross human rights violations , to begin plotting how to bolster its friends in the United States and undermine its enemies .
Lee Jai Hyon , the chief cultural and information attaché at the South Korean embassy in Washington , later testified before the U.S. Congress that he sat in on a series of meetings chaired by the KCIA ’s station chief , involving senior embassy officials .
Lee Jai
Hyon described six sessions over a five - week period in spring 1973 at which a conspiracy was outlined to “ manipulate , ” “ coerce , ” “ threaten , ” “ co-opt , ” “ seduce , ” and “ buy off ” political and other leaders of the United States .
Lee Jai Hyon said one of the South Koreans participating in the operation was Moon 's top aide Bo Hi Pak .
At the time , Moon was raising concerns among U.S. immigration authorities for bringing hundreds of foreign followers to the United States on tourist visas and then assigning them to mobile fund - raising teams .
But Moon , who owned property outside New York City while maintaining a residence in South Korea , somehow managed to secure a “ green card ” from the Nixon administration on April 30 , 1973 .
The permit making Moon a “ lawful permanent resident ” also granted him more legal rights than would be available to a foreign visitor .
“ The advantages of using the First Amendment were seen early , ” wrote Robert Boettcher , the former staff director of the House Subcommittee on International Relations , in his 1980 book , Gifts of Deceit .
“ Before Moon moved to the United States in 1971 , he and his small band of followers realized the operation would have the most flexibility if it was called a church .
Businesses , political activities , and tax - exempt status could be protected . ”
As Moon stepped up his activities , however , the FBI soon began to suspect that Moon ’s activities had a political motive .
The FBI summary of its evidence about Moon ’s church was marked by a number indicating that the Unification Church was under a counter - intelligence investigation in the 1970s .
Although blacked - out portions obscured who was stating some of the conclusions – an individual source or the FBI – the report described the church as " an absolutely totalitarian organization " which was part of an international " conspiracy " that functioned by its own rules .
" One of the central doctrines of the Moon relig [ i ] ous aspects is what they call heavenly deception , ” the FBI report said .
“ It basically says that to take from Satan what rightfully belongs to God , you may do most anything .
You may lie , cheat , steal or kill . "
Making Friends
Despite the FBI 's concerns , Moon began making friends in Washington the old - fashioned way : by spreading around lots of money .
Moon also had his followers cozy up to government officials .
According to the FBI summary , Moon designated " 300 pretty girls " to lobby members of Congress .
" They were trying to influence United States senators and congressmen on behalf of South Korea , " the FBI document read .
" Moon had laid the foundation for political work in this country prior to 1973 [ though ] his followers became more openly involved in political activities in that and subsequent years , " a congressional investigative report on the " Koreagate " influence - buying scandal stated in 1978 .
The report added that Moon 's organization used his followers ' travels to smuggle large sums of money into the United States in apparent violation of federal currency laws .
Moon organized rallies in support of the Vietnam War and in defense of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal .
Moon sponsored a National Prayer and Fast Committee , using the slogan : " forgive , love , unite . "
The public rallies earned Moon a face - to - face " thank you " from the embattled President on Feb. 1 , 1974 .
Intercepted Message
In late 1975 , the CIA intercepted a secret South Korean document entitled " 1976 Plan for Operations in the United States . "
In the name of " strengthening the execution of the U.S. security commitment to the ROK [ South Korea ] , " it called for influencing U.S. public opinion by penetrating American media , government and academia .
Thousands of dollars were earmarked for " special manipulation " of congressmen ; their staffs were to be infiltrated with paid " collaborators " ; an " intelligence network " was to be put into the White House ; money was targeted for " manipulation " of officials at the Pentagon , State Department and CIA ; some U.S. journalists were to be spied on , while others would be paid ; a " black newspaper " would be started in New York ; contacts with American scholars would be coordinated " with Psychological Warfare Bureau " ; and " an organizational network of anti-communist fronts " would be created .
Several months later , in summer 1976 , Moon returned to the United States and delivered a flattering pro-U.S. speech at a red - white - and - blue flag - draped rally at the Washington Monument .
" The United States of America , transcending race and nationality , is already a model of the unified world , " Moon declared on Sept. 18 , 1976 .
Calling America " the chosen nation of God , " Moon said , " I not only respect America , but truly love this nation . "
While professing his love for America in public , Moon shared with his followers a very different sentiment in private .
He despised American concepts of individuality and democracy , believing that he was destined to rule through a one - world theocracy that would eradicate all personal freedoms .
" Here 's a man [ Moon ] who says he wants to take over the world , where all religions will be abolished except Unificationism , all languages will be abolished except Korean , all governments will be abolished except his one - world theocracy , " Steve Hassan , a former church leader , told me .
" Yet he 's wined and dined very powerful people and convinced them that he 's benign . "
In 1976 , Moon ’s search for growing influence in the United States seemed to be following the KCIA script .
Moon started a small - circulation newspaper in New York City that featured a column by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson .
Moon promoted the anti-communist cause through front groups which held lavish conferences and paid speaking fees to academics , journalists and political leaders .
In 1976 , Moon , Bo Hi Pak and other church members deepened their investments in the U.S. capital , buying stock in the Washington - based Diplomat National Bank .
Simultaneously , South Korean agent Tongsun Park was investing heavily in the same bank .
But the South Korean scheme backfired in the late 1970s with the explosion of the " Koreagate " scandal .
Rep.
Donald Fraser , a Democrat from Minnesota , led a congressional probe which tracked Tongsun Park 's influence - buying campaign and exposed the KCIA links to the Unification Church .
The “ Koreagate ” investigation revealed a sophisticated intelligence project run out of Seoul that used the urbane Park as well as the mystical Moon to cultivate U.S. politicians as influential friends of South Korea – and conversely to undermine politicians who were viewed as enemies .
Though it 's clear the church did collaborate with the KCIA during the 1960s and 1970s , it 's less clear whether Moon was using the KCIA or it was using him .
Most likely , the relationship was symbiotic , each using the other to advance their overlapping but different interests .
The alliance with the KCIA gave Moon political protection and business opportunities , while the KCIA got a cover for promoting South Korean interests inside the United States , the country responsible for South Korea 's defense .
The “ Koreagate ” investigation traced the church 's chief sources of money to bank accounts in Japan , but could follow the cash no further .
In the years since , the sources of Moon ’s money have remained cloaked in secrecy .
In the mid-1990s when I inquired about the vast fortune that the Unification Church has poured into its American operations , the church 's chief spokesman refused to divulge dollar amounts for any of Moon 's activities .
" Each year the church retains an independent accounting firm to do a national audit and produce an annual financial statement , " wrote the church ’s legal representative Peter D. Ross .
" While this statement is used in routine financial transactions by the church , [ it ] is not my policy to make it otherwise available . "
In 1978 , Fraser got a taste of the negative side of Moon ’s propaganda clout as the South Korean religious leader ’s new U.S. conservative allies mounted a strong defense against the “ Koreagate ” allegations .
In pro-Moon publications , Fraser and his staff were pilloried as leftists .
Anti-Moon witnesses were assailed as unstable liars .
Minor bookkeeping problems inside the investigation , such as Fraser 's salary advances to some staff members , were seized upon to justify demands for an ethics probe of the congressman .
One of those letters , dated June 30 , 1978 , was written by John T. " Terry " Dolan of the National Conservative Political Action Committee ( NCPAC ) .
Dolan 's group was pioneering the strategy of " independent " TV attack ads against liberal Democrats .
In turn , Moon 's CAUSA International helped Dolan by contributing $ 500,000 to a Dolan group , known as the Conservative Alliance or CALL .

With support from Dolan and other conservatives , Moon weathered the “ Koreagate ” political storm .
Facing questions about his patriotism , Fraser lost a Senate bid in 1978 and left Congress .
Though Moon had helped defeat his chief congressional critic , the evidence unearthed by Fraser became the foundation of a tax - fraud conviction of Moon in 1982 and his sentencing to two years in federal prison .
A Media Empire Despite his felony conviction , Moon pressed ahead with his boldest bid for political influence .
In 1982 , Moon launched the Washington Times .
The Times was just what the Reagan administration wanted , a reliable voice for its version of events that would push the message into the public debate .
Though Moon would have to subsidize his publications with hundreds of millions of dollars from his seemingly bottomless pool of cash , the newspaper – over the next two decades – would change the parameters of how the U.S. press corps works and affect the course of U.S. presidential campaigns .
Where all that money came from , however , would remain one of Washington ’s least examined secrets .
Authors Scott Anderson and Jon Lee Anderson wrote in their 1986 book , Inside the League , that Sun Myung Moon was one of five indispensable Asian leaders who made the World Anti-Communist League possible .
The five were Taiwan ’s dictator Chiang Kai-shek , South Korea ’s dictator Park Chung Hee , yakuza gangsters Ryoichi Sasakawa and Yoshio Kodama , and Moon , “ an evangelist who planned to take over the world through the doctrine of ‘ Heavenly Deception , ’ ” the Andersons wrote .
WACL became a well - financed worldwide organization after a secret meeting between Sasakawa and Moon , along with two Kodama representatives , on a lake in Yamanashi Prefecture , Japan .
The purpose of the meeting was to create an anti-communist organization that “ would further Moon ’s global crusade and lend the Japanese yakuza leaders a respectable new façade , ” the Andersons wrote .
Mixing organized crime and political extremism , of course , has a long tradition throughout the world .
Violent political movements often have blended with criminal operations as a way to arrange covert funding , move operatives or acquire weapons .
Drug smuggling has proven to be a particularly effective way to fill the coffers of extremist movements , especially those that find ways to insinuate themselves within more legitimate operations of sympathetic governments or intelligence services .
In the quarter century after World War II , remnants of fascist movements managed to do just that .
Shattered by the major Allies – the United States , Great Britain and the Soviet Union – the surviving fascists got a new lease on political life with the start of the Cold War , helping both Western democracies and right - wing dictatorships battle international communism .
Some Nazi leaders faced war - crimes tribunals after World War II , but others managed to make their escapes along “ rat lines ” to Spain or South America or they finagled intelligence relationships with the victorious powers , especially the United States .
Argentina became a natural haven given the pre-war alliance that existed between the European fascists and prominent Argentine military leaders , such as Juan Peron .
The fleeing Nazis also found like - minded right - wing politicians and military officers across Latin America who already used repression to keep down the indigenous populations and the legions of the poor .
In the post - World War II years , some Nazi war criminals chose reclusive lives , but others , such as former SS officer Klaus Barbie , sold their intelligence skills to less - sophisticated security services in countries like Bolivia or Paraguay .
Other Nazis on the lam trafficked in narcotics .
Often the lines crossed between intelligence operations and criminal conspiracies .
Auguste Ricord , a French war criminal who had collaborated with the Gestapo , set up shop in Paraguay and opened up the French Connection heroin channels to American Mafia drug kingpin Santo Trafficante Jr. , who controlled much of the heroin traffic into the United States .
Columns by Jack Anderson identified Ricord ’s accomplices as some of Paraguay ’s highest - ranking military officers .
Another French Connection mobster , Christian David , relied on protection of Argentine authorities .
While trafficking in heroin , David also “ took on assignments for Argentina ’s terrorist organization , the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance , ” Henrik Kruger wrote in The Great Heroin Coup .
During President Nixon ’s “ war on drugs , ” U.S. authorities smashed the famous French Connection and won extraditions of Ricord and David in 1972 to face justice in the United States .
By the time the French Connection was severed , however , powerful Mafia drug lords had forged strong ties to South America ’s military leaders .
An infrastructure for the multi-billion - dollar drug trade , servicing the insatiable U.S. market , was in place .
Trafficante - connected groups also recruited displaced anti-Castro Cubans , who had ended up in Miami , needed work , and possessed some useful intelligence skills gained from the CIA ’s training for the Bay of Pigs and other clandestine operations .
Heroin from the Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia soon filled the void left by the broken French Connection and its mostly Middle Eastern heroin supply routes .
Enter Rev. Moon During this time of transition , Sun Myung Moon brought his evangelical message to South America .
His first visit to Argentina had occurred in 1965 when he blessed a square behind the presidential Pink House in Buenos Aires .
But he returned a decade later to make more lasting friendships .
Moon first sank down roots in Uruguay during the 12 - year reign of right - wing military dictators who seized power in 1973 .
He also cultivated close relations with military dictators in Argentina , Paraguay and Chile , reportedly ingratiating himself with the juntas by helping the military regimes arrange arms purchases and by channeling money to allied right - wing organizations .
“ Relationships nurtured with right - wing Latin Americans in the [ World Anti-Communist ]
League led to acceptance of the [ Unification ]
Church ’s political and propaganda operations throughout Latin America , ” the Andersons wrote in Inside the League .
“ As an international money laundry , … the Church tapped into the capital flight havens of Latin America .
Escaping the scrutiny of American and European investigators , the Church could now funnel money into banks in Honduras , Uruguay and Brazil , where official oversight was lax or nonexistent . ”
In 1980 , Moon made more friends in South America when a right - wing alliance of Bolivia military officers and drug dealers organized what became known as the Cocaine Coup .
WACL associates , such as Alfred Candia , coordinated the arrival of some of the paramilitary operatives who assisted in the violent putsch .
Right - wing Argentine intelligence officers mixed with a contingent of young European neo- fascists collaborating with Nazi war criminal Barbie in carrying out the bloody coup that overthrew the elected left - of - center government .
The victory put into power a right - wing military dictatorship indebted to the drug lords .
Bolivia became South America ’s first narco - state .
One of the first well - wishers arriving in La Paz to congratulate the new government was Moon ’s top lieutenant , Bo Hi Pak .
The Moon organization published a photo of Pak meeting with the new strongman , General Garcia Meza .
After the visit to the mountainous capital , Pak declared , “ I have erected a throne for Father Moon in the world ’s highest city . ”
According to later Bolivian government and newspaper reports , a Moon representative invested about $ 4 million in preparations for the coup .
Bolivia ’s WACL representatives also played key roles , and CAUSA , one of Moon ’s anti-communist organizations , listed as members nearly all the leading Bolivian coup - makers .
Soon , Colonel Luis Arce - Gomez , a coup organizer and the cousin of cocaine kingpin Roberto Suarez , went into partnership with big narco - traffickers , including Trafficante ’s Cuban - American smugglers .
Nazi war criminal Barbie and his young neo - fascist followers found new work protecting Bolivia ’s major cocaine barons and transporting drugs to the border .
“ The paramilitary units – conceived by Barbie as a new type of SS – sold themselves to the cocaine barons , ” German journalist Kai Hermann wrote .
“ The attraction of fast money in the cocaine trade was stronger than the idea of a national socialist revolution in Latin America . ”
[ An English translation of Hermann ’s article was published in Covert Action Information Bulletin , Winter 1986 ]
A month after the coup , General Garcia Meza participated in the Fourth Congress of the Latin American Anti-Communist Confederation , an arm of the World Anti-Communist League .
Also attending that Fourth Congress was WACL president Woo Jae Sung , a leading Moon disciple .
As the drug lords consolidated their power in Bolivia , the Moon organization expanded its presence , too .
Hermann reported that in early 1981 , war criminal Barbie and Moon leader Thomas Ward were seen together in apparent prayer .
On May 31 , 1981 , Moon representatives sponsored a CAUSA reception at the Sheraton Hotel ’s Hall of Freedom in La Paz .
Moon ’s lieutenant Bo Hi Pak and Bolivian strongman Garcia Meza led a prayer for President Reagan ’s recovery from an assassination attempt .
In his speech , Bo Hi Pak declared , “ God had chosen the Bolivian people in the heart of South America as the ones to conquer communism . ”
According to a later Bolivian intelligence report , the Moon organization sought to recruit an “ armed church ” of Bolivians , with about 7,000 Bolivians receiving some paramilitary training .
But by late 1981 , the cocaine taint of Bolivia ’s military junta was so deep and the corruption so staggering that U.S. - Bolivian relations were stretched to the breaking point .
“ The Moon sect disappeared overnight from Bolivia as clandestinely as they had arrived , ” Hermann reported .
The Cocaine Coup leaders soon found themselves on the run , too .
Interior Minister Arce - Gomez was eventually extradited to Miami and was sentenced to 30 years in prison for drug trafficking .
Drug lord Roberto Suarez got a 15 - year prison term .
General Garcia Meza became a fugitive from a 30 - year sentence imposed on him in Bolivia for abuse of power , corruption and murder .
Barbie was returned to France to face a life sentence for war crimes .
He died in 1992 .
But Moon ’s organization suffered few negative repercussions from the Cocaine Coup .
By the early 1980s , flush with seemingly unlimited funds , Moon had moved on to promoting himself with the new Republican administration in Washington .
An invited guest to the Reagan - Bush Inauguration , Moon made his organization useful to President Reagan , Vice President Bush and other leading Republicans .
Domestic Spying
An early concern of the Reagan administration was the possibility that a popular movement – similar to the anti-Vietnam War protests – would undermine the hard - line policies that the new U.S. government considered indispensable for stopping the spread of Soviet influence in Central America .
Staunch anticommunists in the administration also suspected that some groups opposed to U.S. intervention in the region could be discredited for holding suspect political loyalties .
Though Moon ’s organization itself had been exposed by the “ Koreagate ” investigation as a foreign intelligence operation , the administration still turned to it to help probe the loyalty of Americans .
Starting in 1981 , the FBI cooperated with one of Moon ’s front groups during a five - year nationwide investigation of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador ( CISPES ) , a domestic organization critical of Reagan ’s policies in Central America .
According to FBI documents obtained by Boston Globe reporter Ross Gelbspan , the FBI collected reports from Moon ’s Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles ( CARP ) , which was spying on CISPES supporters .
The reports came from CARP members at 10 university campuses around the United States and included commentaries on the purported political beliefs of Reagan ’s critics .
[ Boston Globe , April 20 , 1988 ]
One CARP report called a CISPES supporter “ well - educated in Marxism ” while other CARP reports attached “ clippings culled from communist - inspired front groups . ”
The Globe investigation reported that Frank Varelli , who worked for the FBI from 1981 to 1984 coordinating the CISPES probe , said an FBI agent paid members of the Moon organization at Southern Methodist University while the Moon activists were raiding and disrupting CISPES rallies .
“ Every week , an agent I worked with used to go to SMU to pay the Moonies , ” Varelli said in an interview .
Because of the CARP harassment , CISPES closed its SMU chapter .
While Moon ’s organization was helping to spy on American citizens , the case against Moon as a suspected intelligence agent for South Korea was petering out .
It ’s still not clear why .
“ I do n’t think there was any doubt that the Moon newspaper took a virulently pro-South Korea position , ” Oliver “ Buck ” Revell , then a senior FBI official in the national security area , told me .
“ But whether there was something illegal about it ... ”
His voice trailed off .
As for the internal security investigation of Moon , Revell added only : “ It led its full life . ” Part Two : Mysterious Cash Back to Home Page
While occasional drinking is not a decision I take lightly , it is also a decision in which I am not ( quite ) alone .
Lisa Felter McKenney , a teacher in Chicago whose first child is due in January , said she feels comfortable at her current level of three drinks a week , having been grudgingly cleared by her obstetrician .
“ Being able to look forward to a beer with my husband at the end of the day really helps me deal with the horrible parts of being pregnant , ” she said .
“ It makes me feel like myself : not the alcohol , but the ritual .
Usually I just take a few sips and that ’s enough . ”
Ana Sortun , a chef in Cambridge , Mass. , who gave birth last year , said that she ( and the nurse practitioner who delivered her baby ) both drank wine during their pregnancies .
“ I did n’t do it every day , but I did it often , ” she said .
“ Ultimately I trusted my own instincts , and my doctor ’s , more than anything else .
Plus , I really believe all that stuff about the European tradition . ”
Many women who choose to drink have pointed to the habits of European women who legendarily drink wine , eat raw - milk cheese and quaff Guinness to improve breast milk production , as justification for their own choices in pregnancy .
Of course , those countries have their own taboos .
“ Just try to buy unpasteurized cheese in England , or to eat salad in France when you ’re pregnant , ” wrote a friend living in York , England .
( Many French obstetricians warn patients that raw vegetables are risky . )
However , she said , a drink a day is taken for granted .
In those cultures , wine and beer are considered akin to food , part of daily life ; in ours , they are treated more like drugs .
But more European countries are adopting the American stance of abstinence .
Last month , France passed legislation mandating American - style warning labels on alcohol bottles , beginning in October 2007 .
If pregnant Frenchwomen are giving up wine completely ( although whether that will happen is debatable — the effects of warning labels are far from proven ) , where does that leave the rest of us ?

What amount ?
Signs bear a warning that some women choose to ignore .

“ I never thought it would happen , ” said Jancis Robinson , a prominent wine critic in Britain , one of the few countries with government guidelines that still allow pregnant women any alcohol — one to two drinks per week .
Ms. Robinson , who spent three days tasting wine for her Masters of Wine qualification in 1990 while pregnant with her second child , said that she studied the research then available and while she was inclined to be cautious , she did n’t see proof that total abstinence was the only safe course .
The drug stops developing sperm from maturing
Tests on rats show blocking connections to cells which " nurture " developing sperm makes the animals infertile .
The US and Italian researchers say they used relatively low doses of the molecule and found no obvious side effects , and the effect was reversible .
But they told Nature Medicine that work was now needed to see if their approach is equally effective and safe in men .
High dosage
When sperm are being made in the body in a process called spermatogenesis they sit next to other cells , called Sertoli cells , which nurse and help them grow .
If the connection between these two cell types is broken , infertility can result in men .
In the study authors used a recently developed molecule called Adjudin to dislodge the developing sperm from the Sertoli cells .
However Adjudin is also known to be toxic at high doses .
To get round this , the researchers linked it chemically to a hormone , called FSH , which acts in the testicles where sperm are made .
The FSH , which the researchers made inactive so it would merely act as a carrier and not cause any effect itself , delivered Adjudin to where it was needed , allowing much lower doses to be given .
This made the developing sperm cells " fall off " too early , before they were properly mature , resulting in complete but temporary loss of fertility in the rats .
More research is needed to assess if the same approach could work in humans .
But the researchers , led by Dr Dolores Mruk , from the Center For Biomedical Research in New York , said : " We anticipate that this compound could become a male contraceptive for human use . "
' Promising ' research
Dr Richard Anderson , from the University of Edinburgh , who has been investigating hormonal male contraceptives in the UK , said : " This is very promising .
" A non-hormonal approach to male contraception using a drug which specifically targets a process in spermatogenesis has long been a very attractive option , as it leaves hormone production by the testis intact . "
He said it appeared the drug effects could be fully reversible , although only a single dose was given in the study .
" Clearly there are enormous amounts of work needed to translate this to humans .
" Adjudin may be ineffective in men , as the biochemistry of the cell junctions it targets may be different , and the precise molecular basis of its mechanism of action is unknown .
" However , perhaps the most important aspect of this study is the demonstration that using FSH targeting , drugs that are otherwise too toxic , can be delivered in safe yet effective doses . "
Google is building an AI .
I 've gone and let the cat out of the bag right up front , because I do n't want you to hear my thesis halfway through and feel I 've been wasting your time .
If you are n't interested in hearing why I think Google is in the process of building the world 's first large - scale Artificial Intelligence , please stop now , because that 's all this essay is about .
Still here ?
Cool .
Let 's get to it , then !
As usual , today 's blog entry will be a synthesis of various personal observations and wild , drunken speculation .
In other words , take all this with more than a grain of salt .
It 's just my own personal opinion of the moment , nothing more .
What do I mean by AI ?
First things first :
When I say " AI " , I 'm not talking about the creation of Hal 9000 , or any equally science - fiction - ish possibly evil and / or superhuman intelligence .
That might well happen someday , but I have no idea ( nor even an opinion ) as to whether such an eventuality will occur in this century .
In short , this is n't intended to be a science - fiction essay .
If you 're interested in that sort of thing , I might recommend starting with William Gibson 's Neuromancer , then perhaps moving on to an Isaac Asimov or Neal Stephenson or Orson Scott Card book .
But that 's not the kind of AI I 'm talking about .
When I say AI , I 'm talking about a system that 's reasonably self - aware ( although perhaps not to the level of a human being or even a dog ) , and in particular one that can solve interesting problems that will make the " owner " of the AI a whole bunch of money .
Whether or not it can pass the Turing Test is irrelevant , as long as it's a system that 's smart enough to make useful decisions and predictions for me and you .
Most software developers consider computers to be nothing more than fancy programmable calculators , and most software we write is unintelligent .
I mentioned this very briefly in a short essay I wrote a few days ago about a famous book on AI called Gödel , Escher , Bach .
We program the computers to operate at what you might call " base level " intelligence , meaning they 're just executing routines that we 've told them to execute .
Mostly fetching data from databases , putting it back into the databases , and transforming it in various ways .
Very mechanical .
It 's useful , and it 's enabling people to buy things through our website , but most of our code is n't intelligent in any sense of the word .
At the next level up the intelligence heirarchy , we 're trying to build monitoring systems that observe our base - level systems and try to figure out when things are going wrong — for instance , queues backing up .
The monitoring systems are n't intelligent either , but the two kinds of systems combined are slightly more intelligent than systems with no monitoring or diagnostics , because in tandem they 're somewhat self - aware .
I 'll now take a momentary detour to make some of the general inflammatory statements that have made my blogs infamous .
What can I say ... I aim to displease !
My asbestos suit is on for the moment , and I hope you 've donned yours as well .
It is my studied opinion that our use of C++ is killing us , because systems written in C and C++ are opaque to external diagnostics — unless you go to tremendous lengths to build windows into the systems yourself .
Systems written in higher - level languages ( starting with Java , and working up the spectrum ) are automatically layered , and have more hooks and facilities for reflection and introspection built into the language and virtual - machine frameworks , so you automatically get code that 's slightly more " intelligent " .
Or at least it 's more tractable to building intelligence into it .
This is not the only reason C++ is hurting us , not by a long shot .
The fact that it 's a language that makes it inconvenient to build anything other than brutishly unintelligent systems is only the beginning .
I 'm gradually preparing a paper in which I demonstrate that we 've spent well over ( company - confidential large number elided ) staff - years doing nothing but porting our C++ code from chipset to chipset , from OS to OS , and from compiler version to compiler version .
We 're in the middle of two such ports right now , and more will come .
Porting the C++ code has been a horrendous resource drain , and it's been destabilizing our systems more and more each year .
Worse , each time around it gets harder , owing both to the astounding growth of our C++ code base , and also to the fact that C++ is as un-parseable as Perl , and hence not amenable to any kind of automated porting support .
Porting C++ code constitutes an unacceptably high tax on our ability to innovate , one that I do n't think we should be paying .
And that tax is just from porting the code and hoping it will continue to work at least as well as it did before the port .
In addition to C++'s lack of introspection facilities and its lack of portability , I can think of half a dozen other areas in which C++ is killing us , including the nearly nonexistent code - sharing support , the incredibly long and unavoidable build times , the increasing difficulty of hiring people who can write good C++ code and who actually wish to do so , the dangerous traps laid by C++'s language syntax and semantics , the never - ending security holes , and others as well .
Believe you me , I am on a crusade against the use of C++ in the creation of our servware at Amazon , and I have much war left to wage .
But not today .
Today I 'll leave this very brief discussion of our C++ systems with the observation that building separate monitoring systems does make the combined system one step smarter , and it 's good that we 're doing it .
But until we reach the collective understanding that it 's every engineer 's personal responsibility to write self - monitoring code , and that you can't easily do that in an unintelligent language , our systems are never going to be as effective as we need them to be .
For now , my advice is that if you are a person who loves C++ , you should start learning Java right now .
You will very quickly ( faster than you think ) become a better Java programmer than most folks who learned how to program in Java directly , and you will become far more effective than you are today .
I recommend Java because its syntax and semantics are reasonably close to those of C++ , and because Java is the most widely supported , well - studied , and well - documented language platform out there next to C ++.
It 's an easy step for you .
I promise .
Not My Idea
A simple Google search for " is Google building an AI ? " turns up all sorts of links to people who 've already reached the same conclusion and written about it .
One of the first entries is Google as Artificial Intelligence , where a blogger tests Google 's AI abilities by typing in questions like " what is the best time to visit Montreal " , and getting some pretty good results .
I might try that approach — pretending Google is already an AI and asking random questions — later in this essay .
The author of that blog decides that Google will eventually become conscious enough to pass the Turing Test , but it 's obviously not there yet .
Here 's an even better one : The Secret Source of Google 's Power , which is another blog essay ( of course ! ) that asks questions like " What are all those OS researchers doing at Google ? "
The author links to the OS papers published by Googlers .
For that matter , take a look at the entire list , which includes a great many papers on AI , machine learning , data mining , and so on .
In fact there 's all sorts of speculation as to what Google is building .
It 's well - known that they 're doing some Firefox work .
And they 're hiring all sorts of people in different disciplines , including compiler design , cognitive science , OS and kernel development , natural language processing , machine learning , and a host of other interesting areas .
You could make a compelling argument that they 're building an OS , a giant networked computer , a worldwide data store , or just about anything else .
And you 'd probably be right .
High - Profile Hires
Although Google seems to hire a lot of Ph.D. researchers , they also hire people from the industry .
In July they hired Adam Bosworth , who left his position as chief architect and senior vice president at BEA to join Google .
He 's considered one of the top experts in Web Services , and he was part of the original development team for Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
They 've also snagged Joe Beda , Microsoft 's lead architect for the presentation subsystem of Longhorn ( the next - generation Windows ) , and Josh Bloch , distinguished engineer for Java at Sun , author of Effective Java .
They also hired Peter Norvig , the author of one of the all - time best books on AI ; he 's now their Director of Search Quality .
But we have lots of high - profile hires too ; I could easily list the names of some really famous people working for Amazon , although I wo n't embarrass them .
( I 'll give you a hint , though ; at least one of them is featured prominently in various places in Gödel , Escher , Bach ) .
But what about down here in the rank - and - file ?
In the various development groups , are we trying to hire the same kinds of people as Google is hiring ?
You can bet your b- hind we 're not .
We hire people who know C++.
That in itself is sufficient to get into most groups here .
Basic data structures , basic algorithm analysis , and a brain full of useless C++ trivia , and you 've likely got yourself an offer .
In fact , I wanted to make an offer to a Ph.D. in cognitive science this summer , and after I was forced to turn him down , I promised I 'd make a huge stink about it .
I 'll believe I 'll do that right now !
This candidate had recently graduated with a Cognitive Science doctorate , although his earlier background was in particle physics .
He had done his Ph.D. thesis on a model for how the human brain makes associations , and he 'd written a bunch of code to simulate his model .
He had done stints as a visiting scientist at Los Alamos research laboratories ( you know , the place where among other things they invented the atom bomb ) , and my phone screen with him was one of the strongest screens in my ten - year interviewing history .
He was amazing .
And he really wanted to come work for me .
This guy 's strongest language was Python , which is in heavy use at Google , NASA , and Industrial Light & Magic , among other places .
Not surprising , since that 's the language he'd used for his research in cog sci and in the particle accelerator labs .
It 's a good language , a powerful language , and it's used increasingly ( as it happens ! ) for Artificial Intelligence research .
Unfortunately , this candidate 's C++ knowledge , while decent , was a bit rusty , so the two other Bar Raisers who happened to be on the loop forced me to turn him down .
I was pissed off then , and I 'm pissed off now .
So are the recruiters who were on the loop .
Stink , stink , stink .
I hope I 've fulfilled my promise about making a stink .
The whole thing stunk .
He went off to be a full time research scientist at Los Alamos , and we lost a valuable hire .
Shame on us .
Build an AI in a Trillion Easy Steps
Everyone knows how you build an AI .
It 's well - documented , and there are plenty of great books about it .
Peter Norvig 's are very good .
The basic ingredients are : Search , search , and more search .
Sound familiar ?
I used to be uninterested in search , primarily because I had n't thought very deeply about it .
I thought of search as primarily being a problem of screen - scraping and mundane indexing , sort of the super - scale equivalent of doing M-x search - forward - regexp in Emacs .
Was I ever wrong .
I 'd forgotten , of course , the famous aphorism that " AI is Search " , and I did n't bother thinking about what you 'd need to do in order to take search a step beyond screen - scraping and mundane indexing .
I started becoming interested in it through a rather circuitous route .
Early in the year I started on an " anarchy project " ( that 's what we used to call " Just Do It " type projects back at Geoworks ) to do a sort of taxonomy of everything we interview SDEs for , called the Fundamental Fifty .
It 's an interesting ( and not yet finished ) story in itself .
The goal was to write down everything we consider important for an SDE - 1 or SDE - 2 to know that would make them better at their jobs .
In case you 've been following the F50 , I should mention that it 's been in temporal stasis for a few months , in part because I inherited a bunch of new responsibility that needed to be sorted out , and in part because as we were building the site and the content , we realized that some of the skill areas we 'd chosen were rather fast - moving targets : things that did n't have a very long shelf life .
The Amazon - specific stuff , in particular , was a moving target that did n't seem very " fundamental " after a while , given that some of our Dev Centers were n't using it at all .
So we 're in the process of separating out the short shelf - life skills and replacing them with things that are a bit more timeless and generally useful , to avoid the whole thing becoming the " Fashionable Fifty " .
In any case , Michael H. did me the tremendous favor of taking the proposed F50 to the Dean of the School of Engineering at Princeton ( which you may or may not know is the Alma Mater of our very own Jeff Bezos ) .
Dean Maria
Klawe was nice enough to take a look at it , and her feedback was : " Why is n't machine learning in the list ? "
Oops .
Yeah .
Why is n't ( or more precisely , was n't ) machine learning in the list ?
The answer is that at the time , while I 'd considered it to be important , I thought it was a bit too " hardcore " to put into a skills list that we wanted all of our engineers to be good at .
I already had some pretty hefty stuff in there , and if you 've been privy to the endless email - list arguments about whether SDEs need to know things like basic big-Oh algorithm analysis , you 'll know that my list was already going to strike fear into the hearts of many an engineer here , without Artificial Intelligence being added to the list .
I wrestled with the question for a while , and decided : " Screw it .
It 's in . "
And then I set out to repair my super - rusty AI skills , which I had n't done much with since I took an AI course in college 13 or 14 years ago .
I 'd done a fair amount of work with heuristic search , and I 've even got a pretty snazzy implementation of the A* search algorithm in my online computer game ( which I have n't looked at all year , but which continues to live a life of its own , interestingly ) .
But I 'd never looked at neural nets , or genetic algorithms , or Bayesian filters , or statistical pattern recognition , or any of that other machine learning stuff .
I was missing out .
Since then , I 've spent more of my precious little free time studying AI for myself than working on the F50 .
Shame on me , I guess — although I 'd hate to ask people to be qualified in something that I know virtually nothing about myself , so hopefully you can't fault me too much for the decision .
In any case , I 've found that not only is Search absolutely wonderful in its own right , it 's also absolutely essential to just about everything we do in computing , period .
While I studied search , it gradually dawned on me that Google is building an AI .
Maybe we are , too : who knows what those A9 guys and gals are up to down there .
Taking over the world , I suspect !
The reason I titled this meandering section " Build an AI in a Trillion Easy Steps " is that there 's actually one more important ingredient in the Secret Sauce that constitutes Artificial Intelligence , and that 's Data .
Lots of it .
Tons and tons .
Billions , maybe trillions of pieces of data .
Do we know anyone who has that much data ?
AI Winter and Thaw
By way of background , it 's important to remember that in the 1980s there was a huge AI boom , perhaps similar to the dot - com bubble , in which investors poured literally billions of dollars into companies doing AI .
It came crashing down in roughly 1990 / 1991 , and Richard Gabriel ( a famous AI guy who wrote the famous " Worse is Better " paper ) coined the term " AI Winter " .
AI was dead .
Well , actually it had just gone into hibernation .
The research was still happening , at least in university settings and hidden - away research labs , but at a slower pace .
AI was just ahead of its time by several decades .
In the early 1990s there was a bunch of consolidation , wherein a bunch of AI companies merged or folded , and the rise of the Web pretty much kept everyone 's attention for the next decade , give or take .
As far as I can tell , one of the many reasons that AI " failed " in the 1980s is that they were mostly trying deterministic approaches : rule - based pattern matching , logic systems , heuristic search and hill climbing , and so on .
At least , that 's what my AI course was mostly about in 1991 .
Those are useful techniques , and they 've yielded great results in certain domains .
But the term " Artificial Intelligence " sets expectations pretty high .
I imagine investors were looking for a program smart enough to , say , answer the phone at work every time their spouse called , while they were off at the golf course .
What they got , however , were polynomial solvers .
Investors evidently did n't appreciate the enormous value in having all their polynomial - solving needs eradicated forever , and they slashed their AI budgets down to a first - order polynomial with a coefficient of zero .
What 's happened to AI since then ?
For starters , the Web came along , making lots more data available than ever before .
Unfortunately , a web page is effectively just a bag of words ; a good search engine ( or AI ) needs to be able to guess at the meaning of the page somehow , and word counting does n't cut it .
Natural languages like English are ambiguous , and there is n't a big central database of " concepts " anywhere , so it 's hard to figure out things like , oh , whether the word " Ford " refers to a car company , a president , a river crossing , or something else .
Search engines need a way to figure out the semantics of the pages somehow .
Some people think it would be nice if there were something like a " semantic web " , in which everyone used some sort of universal metadata schema to mark up their data , imbuing it with meaning .
That way the search engines would n't have to guess ; they 'd know ( to some level , anyway ) what the content was " about " .
And presumably you 'd get better search results .
I , for one , am not looking forward to going back and marking up every document I 've ever authored or produced with a bunch of new semantic data .
I doubt you are , either .
So a lot of people think the Semantic Web will never really take off , because people are lazy .
So deterministic approaches did n't produce AI , and the semantic web probably wo n't either .
What other options are there ?
These days , statistical learning approaches ( perceptrons , SVMs , kernels , decision trees , and a bunch of others ) are all the rage .
They started to get really popular in the 90s , but that was after it was too late to get any more funding .
Plus , statistical machine - learning approaches need access to enormous training sets .
Getting that sort of data together for processing is , needless to say , a nontrivial task .
And even with access to the data , the algorithms still require massive number - crunching power .
Do we know anyone who has that much computing power ?
If you have enough computing power and enough data , AI ( by some more realistic definition ) starts to come back within reach .
It 's still not easy , but it 's becoming possible .
And I think Google is building one .
Just a hunch ; I know no more than you do .
But it sure seems like the kind of thing they 'd do .
However , they 're not the only ones trying .
Now that the dot - com bubble - burst is well behind us , and the world financial markets appear to be recovering , people are looking for places to invest their money .
AI is gradually coming back in vogue , although people are being more cautious about it .
They 're not looking so much for " general " intelligence as they are looking for practical expert systems that can help solve specific , interesting problems .
What kinds of problems would you be interested in , if you had access to an AI ?
What Everyone Wants
Everyone wants to be rich — at least wealthy enough to pursue their interests .
Even better , everyone wants to live forever .
Woody
Allen put it best : " I do n't want to be immortal through my work .
I want to be immortal through not dying . "
( Source : type " woody allen immortal " into Google ) .
People mostly figure that if they were to live healthy for a long time — hundreds of years , say — then there would be plenty of time to get rich .
So there 's a lot of money in the suite of industries surrounding the human body : medical , pharmaceutical , bioengineering , neuroscience , bioinformatics , and so on .
For first - hand evidence of this , go visit the campus of the University of Washington up the road , at the south end near the UW Hospital .
There are huge , sprawling , luxurious - looking buildings there that were n't around when * I * went to school there , and most of them are dedicated to health - sciences research .
Heck , the new Computer Science building is n't too shabby , either .
Hey , and there 's an Amazonian , Albert W. , in the picture on the right .
Hi , Albert !
There will always be a lot of money pumped into the bio-science fields , because , well , once you 're really rich , it 's a sure bet that at some point , the thought of buying a bio - science miracle will cross your mind .
Well , the human body and brain are reeeeeaallly complex .
It takes a lot of neurons to remember all that C++ trivia .
It also requires massive computing power to search ( hint , hint ) through the vast combinatorial possibilities offered by our genotype in an attempt to decipher and influence it .
Who 's going to solve problems like these ?
Who has the data - storage capacity , the computing resources , and the Ph.D. researchers and AI experts on staff ?
I know who my money 's on .
I do n't think it 's entirely unreasonable to assume that online " AIs " will soon become more reliable medical diagnostic tools than your doctor .
Doctors make mistakes all the time .
Case in point : my brother Dave , who died of aggressive T - cell lymphoma at age 24 , six years and six days ago exactly ( 2 days after I joined Amazon ) , was twice mis-diagnosed by his family - practice doctor as having bronchitis , when in fact it was pneumonia caused by a tumor the size of his fist growing behind his heart .
Dave had most of the classic warning signs of cancer , but none of us suspected that 's what they were , and his doctor was , of course , worthless .
If it had happened today , typing his symptoms into Google might have saved his life .
I just typed " pain coughing night sweats " into Google , and the 5th and 6th results , both above the fold , say " cancer symptoms " .
You want to know what I think an AI is ?
Anything smart enough to save your brother 's life .
I was going to give you some more examples of things I 'd ask the Google at Delphi , to get you thinking about what exactly it means to have a " practical AI " , but I 'm afraid my last example has knocked the wind out of me a little .
So I 'll wrap up .
Google already has an AI .
If it 's smarter than a doctor , then it 's smart enough to be called an AI .
Why , then , am I not going to Google ?
It 's a question several people have asked me lately .
I 'll tell you why .
It 's because I 've met Jeff Bezos , and I 've seen him in action , and he 's the smartest guy I 've ever met .
If anyone in the world can match Google , it 's Jeff , and if any company can do it , it 's Amazon .
I 'm surrounded by smart people trying to do the right thing .
That 's enough for me .
Let 's get to it !
[ Note , 2/24/2006 :
Well , it 's clear the writing was on the wall .
Amazon was very cool , but I could n't resist the pull , and I left 6 months later .
I 'll give you three guesses where I went , and the first two do n't count .

Technology has a weird way of elevating people into a new position where they are both more powerful and more dependent — they can get more done , but only with the enabling technology .
Take that technology away and their knees start to knock and they can't function at all ...
Can you imagine trying to get something done on the web without a search system tucked under your arm ?
Me neither .
Good blog , sir .
Posted by : Todd Stumpf at December 31 , 2004 12:32 AM
Sweden has more blond beauties per capita , Italy and France have far better cuisine , and most of the free world can boast of better weather .
But over the past 30 years , the citizens of Denmark have scored higher than any other Western country on measures of life satisfaction , and scientists think they know why .
In a paper appearing in the Dec. 23 issue of the medical journal BMJ , researchers review six likely and unlikely explanations , and conclude that the country ’s secret is a culture of low expectations .
“ It ’s a David and Goliath thing , ” said the lead author , Kaare Christensen , a professor of epidemiology at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense .
“ If you ’re a big guy , you expect to be on the top all the time and you ’re disappointed when things do n’t go well .
But when you ’re down at the bottom like us , you hang on , you do n’t expect much , and once in a while you win , and it ’s that much better . ”
The researchers arrived at their findings by a process of elimination and humor .
Blonds may have more fun , they argue , but Sweden has a higher prevalence of them .
As for climate , Danes “ bask in a somewhat colder and cloudier version of the balmy English weather . ”
They also eat fatty foods and drink a lot , and genetically they are not significantly different from their gloomier Scandinavian neighbors .
And in 1992 the Danes won the European Championship in soccer , creating “ such a state of euphoria that the country has not been the same since . ”
But on surveys , Danes continually report lower expectations for the year to come , compared with most other nations .
And “ year after year , they are pleasantly surprised to find that not everything is getting more rotten in the state of Denmark , ” the paper concludes .

During the process of building the forms that we would test , we tried to respect Luke ’s suggestions regarding the relationship between label placement and formatting and the type of form content — well - known data versus unfamiliar data that requires thought .
Thus , you ’ll find both types of data on each of the pages that we tested .
To add some real - world flavor , we paired inputs fields for well - known data with other slightly more difficult form elements such as drop - down list boxes .
Moreover , doing so helped us to confirm our previous findings about forms .
Our test subjects comprised both expert users — primarily designers and programmers , but also some usability experts — and novice users .
We requested users to complete all of the forms that we presented to them .
Our gaze - path recordings were complete once a user clicked the submit button .
Test 1 : Left - Aligned Labels to the LefDuring the process of Input Fields
Excessive distances between some labels and their input fields forced users unnecessarily to take more time to interact visually with the form .
This was the first case we tested , because it ’s the most popular format in use on the Web .
Not surprisingly , both classes of users performed very well in associating the label with the proper input field .
For all users , we found that there was a single saccade between the label and the input field , which means that users easily perceived the connection between them .
However , a medium saccade duration of 500ms ( milliseconds ) was typical , which is quite long , showing that users were experiencing heavy cognitive loading .
The whitespace between labels and their input fields worked well in visually guiding the users ’ gaze path toward the input fields .
In fact , there were no fixations over whitespace .
However , excessive distances between some labels and their input fields forced users unnecessarily to take more time to interact visually with the form .
Figure 1 shows the eyetracking data for this test .
Figure 1 — Testing left - aligned labels to the left of input fields
Since we included a drop - down list box in the form , we also had the opportunity to confirm our previous findings about them : that they are the most eye - catching form elements .
When facing a simple form on a white page , the first fixation of all users was on the drop - down list box .
This form element clearly conveys its meaning and how a user must interact with it , giving it a higher importance in the user ’s mind .
Moreover , in our first test form , the item selected in the drop - down list showed just a number , with no reiteration of the meaning the label communicated .
We found that most test subjects , including the expert users , were forced to recheck the label to remind themselves of the value of the numbers the drop - down list contained .
Test 2 : Right - Aligned Labels to the Left of Input Fields
The right alignment of the labels reduced the overall number of fixations by nearly half , showing that this layout greatly reduced the cognitive load required for users to complete the task .
While the meaning of the labels and their placement to the left of the input fields was exactly as in the previous test , the right alignment of the labels reduced the overall number of fixations by nearly half , showing that this layout greatly reduced the cognitive load required for users to complete the task .
Also , the form completion times were cut nearly in half .
There was almost no saccadic activity between the labels and their corresponding input fields , both because users very quickly understood the meaning of the input fields and because of the ease of the lateral eye movement .
While we had 500 ms saccades with the left - aligned labels , with right - aligned labels , the saccade times between the labels and the input fields were only about 170 ms for expert users and 240 ms for novice users .
My initial concern with this particular form design was that it would be difficult for users to make the transition between typing their data into an input field and moving their eyes to the beginning of the next label , because its position was unpredictable .
Well , I could n’t have been more wrong .
Their diagonal eye movements were very quick , and there was no need for them to reposition the fovea over the initial word , as the eyetracking data in Figure 2 shows .
Figure 2 — Testing right - aligned labels to the left of input fields
Most users — both expert and novice — needed to recheck the input field ’s corresponding label in this case , too — though the relative brevity of the saccades made this task slightly simpler than in the previous test .

This software was sponsored by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and was maintained by the SIMILE project , in particular :
Just over a year ago , a hacker penetrated the corporate servers at Valve , the game company behind the popular first - person shooter Half - Life .
He came away with a beta version of Half - Life 2 .
" We heard about it , " says 23 - year - old Frank , a well - connected media pirate .
" Everyone thought it would get bootlegged in Europe . "
Instead , the hacker gave the source code to Frank - it turned out that he was a friend of a friend - so that Frank could give Half - Life 2 to the world .
" I was like , ' Let 's do this thing , yo ! ' " he says .
" I put it on Anathema .
After that , it was all over . "
Anathema is a so - called topsite , one of 30 or so underground , highly secretive servers where nearly all of the unlicensed music , movies , and videogames available on the Internet originate .
Outside of a pirate elite and the Feds who track them , few know that topsites exist .
Even fewer can log in .
Within minutes of appearing on Anathema , Half - Life 2 spread .
One file became 30 files became 3,000 files became 300,000 files as Valve stood helplessly by watching its big Christmas blockbuster turn into a lump of coal .
The damage was irreversible - the horse was out of the barn , the county , and the state .
The original Half - Life has sold more than 10 million games and expansion packs since its late 1998 release .
Half - Life 2's official release finally happened in November , after almost a year of reprogramming .
When Frank ( who , like all the pirates interviewed for this article , is identified by a pseudonym ) posted the Half - Life 2 code to Anathema , he tapped an international network of people dedicated to propagating stolen files as widely and quickly as possible .
It 's all a big game and , to hear Frank and others talk about " the scene , " fantastic fun .
Whoever transfers the most files to the most sites in the least amount of time wins .
There are elaborate rules , with prizes in the offing and reputations at stake .
Topsites like Anathema are at the apex .
Once a file is posted to a topsite , it starts a rapid descent through wider and wider levels of an invisible network , multiplying exponentially along the way .
At each step , more and more pirates pitch in to keep the avalanche tumbling downward .
Finally , thousands , perhaps millions , of copies - all the progeny of that original file - spill into the public peer - to - peer networks : Kazaa , LimeWire , Morpheus .
Without this duplication and distribution structure providing content , the P2P networks would run dry .
( BitTorrent , a faster and more efficient type of P2P file - sharing , is an exception .
But at present there are far fewer BitTorrent users . )
It 's a commonly held belief that P2P is about sharing files .
It 's an appealing , democratic notion : Consumers rip the movies and music they buy and post them online .
But that 's not quite how it works .
In reality , the number of files on the Net ripped from store - bought CDs , DVDs , and videogames is statistically negligible .
People do n't share what they buy ; they share what is already being shared - the countless descendants of a single " Adam and Eve " file .
Even this is probably stolen ; pirates have infiltrated the entertainment industry and usually obtain and rip content long before the public ever has a chance to buy it .
The whole shebang - the topsites , the pyramid , and the P2P networks girding it all together - is not about trading or sharing at all .
It 's a broadcast system .
It takes a signal , the new U2 single , say , and broadcasts it around the world .
The pirate pyramid is a perfect amplifier .
The signal becomes more robust at every descending level , until it gets down to the P2P networks , by which time it can be received by anyone capable of typing " U2 " into a search engine .
This should be good news for law enforcement .
Lop off the head ( the topsites ) , and the body ( the worldwide trade in unlicensed media ) falls lifeless to the ground .
Sounds easy , but what if you can't find the head ?
As in any criminal conspiracy , it takes years of undercover work to get inside .
An interview subject warned me against even mentioning Anathema in this article : " You do not need some 350 - pound hit man with a Glock at your front door . "
The upper reaches of the network are a " darknet , " hidden behind layers of security .
The sites use a " bounce " to hide their IP address , and members can log in only from trusted IP addresses already on file .
Most transmissions between sites use heavy - duty encryption .
Finally , they continually change the usernames and passwords required to log in .
Estimates say this media darknet distributes more than half a million movies every day .
It 's also , by any reading of the law , a vast criminal enterprise engaged in wholesale copyright infringement .
But the Feds are getting smarter .
Last spring , the FBI and US Department of Justice launched a series of raids codenamed Fastlink .
Working with cops in Sweden , the Netherlands , and eight other countries , the operation seized more than 200 computers .
One confiscated server alone contained 65,000 pirated titles .
Fastlink rubbed out a few topsites , but new ones filled the void .
The flow of illicit games and movies slowed briefly , then resumed .
In April , federal agents interrogated Frank and impounded all his computer equipment .
So far , no charges have been filed .
" But the Feds had no idea about Half - Life , " he boasts .
" I was never connected to that shit .
If they found out , I 'd be in jail . "
Bruce Forest , a self - described " elder statesman " in the piracy scene , started ripping and trading in the ancient days of the late ' 80s .
While he no longer actively traffics in bootlegged media , he maintains contacts that give him access to the most exclusive topsites .
What the topsites do n't know is that three years ago , Forest came in from the cold .
" Basically , I 'm a double agent , " he concedes .
" Though I do n't fink anyone out .
I 'm not a cop . "
As a consultant for one of the world 's largest entertainment companies , Forest notifies his bosses whenever one of their movies appears on a topsite .
Thanks to his unparalleled access , he enjoys a bird 's - eye view of the scene .
And because he 's ostensibly on the right side of the law , he 's uncommonly open with information .
This makes him an anomaly within the paranoid byways of the media darknet .
Forest runs his business from the first floor of his rural Connecticut home .
He 's in his mid-40s but moves with jerky , adolescent energy .
His brown hair is in perpetual disarray , and he pads around his office with bare feet , dressed in cargo shorts and a faded polo .
Gold and platinum albums from his days as a producer at Island Records , MCA , and Arista line one wall .
A baroque array of computer equipment fills the next , including 13 CPUs and 16 external hard drives ( for a total of 3 terabytes of storage ) .
His desk runs the length of the room and supports five full - size LCD displays .
I hear a soft ping .
" That tells me a movie just made its first appearance on a topsite . "
He points to a window on the monitor .
It shows an innocent - looking list of files from an FTP site .
The uppermost file says , " Hellboy .
SCREENER.Proper.READ NFO PRE VCD . "
Translation :
The DVD of one of the year 's biggest box office hits has been pirated two months before its intended release date .
" The FBI would kill to be sitting here looking at this , " he says .
Even first - run movies get ripped .
" Remember what happened to The Hulk ? " he asks .
On June 6 , two weeks before its official release , a near - final version of The Hulk showed up online .
To hear studio executives tell it , the bootleg went straight to the P2P networks and spread like a contagion .
" Bullshit , " says Forest .
" Trying to distribute The Hulk through the P2Ps would take months , not hours . "
That 's because files on the public file - sharing networks , where no single node is much more powerful than the next , spread at a glacial pace .
Furthermore , when users connect to a P2P network - FastTrack , for example - they connect only to a small proportion of the number of other users connected at the same time .
So unless a topsite seeds a file across the P2P network , the odds are slim that someone searching for a copy will actually find it .
Forest pushes a hand through his hair , leaving it standing on end , and rotates in his Aeron to look me in the eye .
" Here 's what actually happened : Universal gave the workprint to its Manhattan ad agency .
Then the print got to SMF .
And bam ! "
SMF , Forest explains , is a piracy group that specializes in acquiring movies in theatrical release .
Before the folks at SMF could release the movie to a topsite , they had to compress it - from roughly 9 Gbytes to 700 Mbytes , small enough to fit on a single CD .
Now the film drops .
Forest wo n't say to which topsite SMF first posted The Hulk , only that " SMF had affiliations with certain sites , so it must have been one of those . "
Within an hour , word had spread that The Hulk had appeared on the topsites , and the " races " began - copying and distributing the files to as many other servers as possible , as quickly as possible .
" The races are over like that , " says Forest , snapping his fingers .
" It 's amazing . "
Soon ,
The Hulk was working its way down the pyramid onto slightly less exclusive sites called dumps .
" These sites are a little slower , and they are n't getting stuff first , " explains Forest .
" On the other hand , they 're getting a lot more traffic . "
With as much as several terabytes of data storage , the dumps are the workhorses of the distribution process , storing hundreds of thousands of media files filtered down from the topsites and rolling them to the next layer of the pyramid , the distribution channels .
In 24 hours , SMF 's single version of The Hulk had metastasized into at least 50,000 copies .
Within 72 hours , the movie was all over the most popular P2P networks .
Before it reached even a single shared file folder on Kazaa , Forest estimates there were already several hundred thousand copies in circulation , guaranteeing that casual computer users would be able to find and download it easily .
One of Forest 's computers pipes up again .
Another bootleg has just started its race down the pyramid .
Movie pirates get their booty from one of three sources : industry insiders , projectionists , or agents placed inside disc - stamping plants and retail outlets .
" Half the kids in the scene work at Best Buy or Blockbuster to get their hands on stuff they can release , " says Frank .
" At the factory , maybe 15 percent of CDs and DVDs are defective , " says Forest , " usually just because the label is off a little bit . "
They 're dumped into a rubbish bin , ripe for the picking .
Release groups break down broadly by medium - videogame , film , music , television - and then often into genre .
One release group , for instance , specializes in obscure Japanese anime .
Another works exclusively in Xbox games .
Every release group has the same ultimate goal :
Beat the street date of a big - name album , videogame , or movie by as much time as possible .
In 2003 , Frank and his friends started a release group devoted to first - run movies .
They placed an online ad , and a projectionist in Maryland responded .
The projectionist , who never told Frank his name , proposed to send them the movies shown in his theater in exchange for free downloads from the topsites .
Frank 's posse wanted to test the guy first - standard procedure for a release group .
" We had to know he was n't a narc , " says Frank , " and that he could get us quality product on a regular basis . "
Frank 's projectionist passed this test by providing the group with a high - quality copy of Spy Kids 3D : Game Over .
The bootleg was posted the day after it hit theaters .
Theaters get movies several days in advance so that exhibitors can check for defects in the reels .
" Our dude would just run the film before anyone got to work , and record it from the booth , " he says .
Frank and his friends christened their group " MaTinE . "
Because their supplier - the projectionist - could get them high - quality recordings , MaTinE got noticed .
" Eventually , we were putting our movies on one of the best topsites in the world , " says Frank .
He wo n't tell me the name of the site , noting it got busted by the FBI .
" I can't have them thinking I put the heat on them , know what I mean ? "
The quality of bootlegged films varies , depending on the technology used to capture the original reel .
The best are produced using expensive TV studio equipment that can convert film to video .
The next best are " telesyncs , " copies of a movie in which the visuals have been captured by camcorder but the audio comes directly from a patch into the projector .
" The top telesync groups , like Centropy , VideoCD , and TCF , are using $ 10,000 camcorders they get directly from Japan , cams you can't find in the US , " says Frank .
The least desirable releases are " cams , " made by an audience member with a camcorder .
I ask Frank how his group could afford such exotic toys .
" People buy them for us , " he says , as if this explains everything .
" Usually , these people were in the scene at one time , and now they just want free downloads without having to contribute . "
As it turns out , much of the extensive hardware - from superfast processors to servers with terabytes of storage - are donated by these well - heeled patrons .
" Does Bruce Forest do that ? " I ask .
" I do n't know , " Frank says , laughing .
" What did Bruce tell you ? "
In fact , Forest freely admits to being a supplier .
" I have bought everything from hard drives to complete computers for various people in the scene .
I 've probably bought 15 camcorders alone . "
He says he considers it a business expense , and writes it off on his taxes .
Whatever the original source - stamping plant , movie theater , or local Blockbuster - the film has to be properly prepared for distribution over the networks .
Converting analog to digital is a difficult , time - consuming process .
And getting it into a form that can be easily compressed into a digital box many times smaller than its original size is an even bigger undertaking .
If it is n't done well , a topsite will reject the file .
" Quality control is the number one job of the release groups , " says Forest .
" Topsites will only take a file that fits a long list of specifications .
It basically has to be perfect . "
To make sure it is , release groups rely on highly skilled technicians responsible for compressing and packaging the media file .
As Forest and I watch the ripped copy of Hellboy , he pauses the movie .
" Look at this , " he says .
A massive fight has just taken place , and Hellboy is perched on a bridge overlooking a devastated cityscape .
It 's been raining , and the havoc is reflected in a puddle , into which he stares deeply .
" Oh my God .
Look at that reflection .
Do you have any idea how hard that is to capture ? "
Different scenes require different treatments .
" It 's almost like using a paintbrush , " says Forest .
" A good ripper will know exactly how to apply the codec properly . "
A codec , or compression - decompression algorithm , is a method of reducing file size to ease its transfer over the Internet .
Video is normally compressed using variations of MPEG codecs .
A serious ripper will adjust the bitrate of compression in every scene of a movie to account for changing hue and lighting .
Toby is a master ripper .
At 22 , he 's got a big man 's frame but looks malnourished , like he does n't get enough vegetables .
He spends most of his time preparing movies for the Netflix Project .
Started by an anonymous donor - again , an angel investor willing to devote money but not time to media piracy - the Netflix Project aims to archive every film offered by the subscription service .
" Netflix offers about 25,000 movies , " says Toby .
" We 've got maybe half of them . "
Each time
Toby finishes condensing and packaging a movie , it gets placed on a central server .
The archive is free for members who score a password and can get through the encryption .
( Asked for comment , Netflix politely declined . )
I 'd been told Toby would be cagey , but I find him funny and sweet .
In 2000 , he moved to Atlanta to attend college , but after spending a year and a half holed up in his dorm room ripping and burning , he flunked out .
" Computer science is impossible , " he says .
" But I did n't really go to class , so part of it might be my fault , sort of . "
Two weeks before the release of A Perfect Circle 's new album , Thirteenth Step , Kevin races home after high school each day , goes down to his basement , and checks various release sites to see if someone has posted it .
Kevin resides a few levels down the pyramid from the topsite operators ; he 's a courier for a couple release groups dealing in emo and hardcore rips , and A Perfect Circle is the file du jour .
Usually such a sought - after property first appears on sites far more exclusive and glamorous than the ones Kevin has access to , but he 's hopeful a copy will show up soon .
Couriers like Kevin are the grunts of the system , but without the " curries " transferring and duplicating files , the massive distribution network would break down .
Finally Kevin checks a site telling him that a rip of Thirteenth Step has just been uploaded to a secure FTP site - a week before it hits the stores .
He curses under his breath .
More than two minutes have elapsed since the file first appeared .
The race is on , and Kevin is already at the back of the pack .
He opens FlashFXP - a program that allows him to directly transfer files - and begins copying the CD to as many sites as he can .
Then he sits back to watch the race .
Everything now depends on the whimsy of Internet traffic and the speed of the server farms whose bandwidth he is pirating .
With his quick , eager intelligence and , more important , a high degree of focus , Kevin spends hours at a stretch performing the minute tasks of copying and transferring files , usually to networks in the middle levels of the pyramid .
It 's through grunts like him that a song proliferates from 10,000 copies to 1 million .
The night A Perfect Circle 's CD was posted , Kevin stayed up late spreading the file around the Net .
The curries competing against him must have gotten stuck behind some double - wide trailer of a packet , because Kevin 's credits poured in .
Credits are how the curries - and most everyone else - get paid .
Back in the early days of the scene , when there were maybe 100 dedicated geeks trading copies of The Last Ninja over their Commodore 64s , the rule was established that site members had to upload one unit ( kilobytes at first , now megs or even gigs ) for every three they download .
The rule creates an incentive to obtain and release , and it's this odd form of greed that drives the scene .
It 's true , as Forest likes to point out , that no one gets paid ( unless they strike up relations with for - profit Chinese bootleggers , which is considered bad form ) .
But they do get a lot of free stuff - movies , music , games , and software - without having to deal with the spyware , phony files , and traffic jams that plague the public P2P networks .
In fact , pretty much everyone joins the races from time to time .
It 's how the pirates while away their idle hours - the release group operator waiting for a new movie to be delivered , the ripper biding time while his gigabyte - sized files compress .
Yet the best racers are n't even downloading all the pirate media they have access to .
They have credits to burn , but that 's not all that drives them .
" It 's about being the fastest , " Frank says .
The kids in the scene are n't trying to bomb the system .
They do n't care a whit whether major labels suffer more from file - sharing than indie labels , or if a ban on prerelease DVDs affects Miramax 's chances at the Academy Awards .
They do this because it feels mildly rebellious , like smoking a doobie behind the local Kroger or setting off the school fire alarm - and because it 's fun .
Like ants , curries are monomaniacal about tiny tasks - they copy and move files from place to place - but together they form a force so powerful that it threatens to displace the traditional forms of media distribution .
In fact , Forest believes the scene will eventually go legit , and he 's even started a company , called Jun Group , that uses the topsites to promote movies , musicians , and TV shows .
" The topsites do n't care where their files come from , as long as no one else has them , " he says .
Last summer Jun Group dropped a collection of live videos and MP3s from Steve Winwood on the topsites .
" We got 2.9 million downloads , " says Forest , " and album sales took off . "
Behind the Scene
Call it trickle - down file - sharing .
The goods - a game , movie , song , or other piece of copyrighted media fall into an insider 's hands .
Then it 's only a matter of hours before a drop becomes a tidal wave .

1. THE INSIDER
Industry and theater employees run their own straight - to - video operations .
Hackers looking for prerelease videogames target company servers .
And before that long - awaited CD hits Amazon.com , moles inside disc - stamping plants have already got a copy .
2. THE PACKAGER
The pirated goods are passed on to a release group .
These groups take multi-gigabyte movie files and squeeze them down for easy online trading .
3. THE DISTRIBUTOR
Release groups are known to have exclusive relationships with certain so - called topsites .
These are the highly secretive sites at the top of the distribution pyramid .
When a topsite operator drops a file , the avalanche begins .
4. THE COURIERS
Alerted by release groups , worker bees spring into action , copying and transferring files from the topsites to lower - level dump sites , and then from there to P2P networks like Kazaa and Morpheus .
For the couriers , the payoff is props from their peers and credits redeemable for goods on upper levels of the pyramid .
5. THE PUBLIC
After the file is copied thousands of times the P2P networks saturate , allowing casual file - traders easy access to the newest movies , music , and videogames .

Behind the Scene
The powder is 30 times hotter than the hottest pepper
The powder is so hot that Blair Lazar 's customers have to sign a legal waiver before tasting it .
When Mr Lazar himself tried his " 16 Million Reserve " he says his tongue swelled up and hurt for several days .
The pure capsaicin , 30 times hotter than the hottest pepper and 8,000 times hotter than Tabasco sauce , is distilled from several tons of fresh peppers .
Mr Lazar describes the powder , produced in a laboratory by workers wearing sealed suits and masks to avoid inhaling the dust , as " pure heat " .
The final product is a white , crystalline powder .
Capsaicin does not actually burn , instead it stimulates nerve endings in your mouth , giving the sensation of burning .
Over the past decade or so , manufacturers have taken the humble chilli pepper and distilled it into ever more fiery sauces .
The names of the concoctions - After Death Sauce and Insanity Sauce are just two - give some idea of the pain that is involved during and after consuming them .
The spiciness of the sauces is measured in what are known as Scoville Units .
The higher the number of units , the bigger the burn , although some manufacturers say that beyond about 350,000 units , the measurement becomes meaningless .
Jonathan Schell , who ended his Nation magazine column , “ Letter From Ground Zero , ” last February , now takes up “ The Crisis of the Republic ” in what will be a series of periodic , longer essays appearing in the Nation under that rubric .
For all its wealth , its power , its dreams of military domination over the last half - century - plus , the United States , Schell argues in this introduction to his new series , has misunderstood the nature of power in our time and so has become “ the fool of history . ”
Our tale , as he tells it , is not one of imperial success followed by crisis , but of a deep and abiding kind of failure ; nor is it a tale of a successful empire now in crisis , but of a failed empire now in a state of disarray .
In his seminal book , The Unconquerable World , he suggested just why this was so by tracing the way , from the late 18th century on , the globe experienced an ever upward ratcheting of the means of destruction and of the imperial violence that went with it until , with the coming of nuclear weapons , we reached beyond the limits of power , even of the planet itself .
At the same time , what also ratcheted ever upward was a kind of “ people power , ” deeply connected to the idea of national sovereignty and independence , that simply would not ( and still will not ) give way .
It is in this context that the United States is “ too late for empire . ”

Too Late for Empire
by Jonathan Schell
[ This article , which will appear in the August 14/21 issue of The Nation , is posted here with the kind permission of the editors of that magazine . ]
Repetition
Anyone who wants to write about the constitutional crisis unfolding in the United States today faces a peculiar problem at the outset .
There is a large body of observations that at one and the same time have been made too often and yet not often enough  too often because they have been repeated to the point of tedium for a minority ready to listen but not often enough because the general public has yet to consider them seriously enough .
The problem for a self - respecting writer is that the act of writing almost in its nature promises something new .
Repetition is not really writing but propaganda  not illumination for the mind but a mental beating .
Here are some examples of the sort of observations I have in mind , at once over - familiar and unheard :
President George W. Bush sent American troops into Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction , but they were n’t there .
He said that Saddam Hussein ’s regime had given help to al - Qaeda , but it had not .
He therefore took the nation to war on the basis of falsehoods .
His administration says that the torture at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere has been the work of a few bad apples in the military , whereas in fact abuses were sanctioned at the highest levels of the executive branch in secret memos .
His administration lambastes leakers , but its own officials illegally leaked the name of a CIA operative , Valerie Plame , in order to politically discredit her husband .
He flatly stated to the public that all wiretaps of Americans were ordered pursuant to court warrants , whereas in fact he was authorizing and repeatedly reauthorizing warrantless wiretaps .
These wiretaps violated a specific law of Congress forbidding them .
His administration has asserted a right to imprison Americans as well as foreigners indefinitely without the habeas corpus hearings required by law .
Wars of aggression , torture , domestic spying , and arbitrary arrest are the hallmarks of dictatorship , yet Congress , run by the president ’s party , has refused to conduct full investigations into either the false WMD claims , or the abuses and torture , or the warrantless wiretaps , or the imprisonment without habeas corpus .
When Congress passed a bill forbidding torture and the president signed it , he added a “ signing statement ” implying a right to disregard its provisions when they conflicted with his interpretation of his powers .
The president ’s secret legal memos justifying the abuses and torture are based on a conception of the powers of the executive that gives him carte blanche to disregard specific statutes as well as international law in the exercise of self - granted powers to the commander in chief nowhere mentioned in the Constitution .
If accepted , these claims would fundamentally alter the structure of the American government , upsetting the system of checks and balances and nullifying fundamental liberties , including Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures and guarantees of due process .
As such , they embody apparent failures of the president to carry out his oath to “ preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
Opposing One - Party Government
The need to repeat these familiar points , as I have just done ( while also begging the indulgence of the reader , as I do ) , is itself a symptom of the crisis .
The same concentration of governmental and other power in the hands of a single party that led to the abuses stands in the way of action to address them .
The result is a problem of political sanitation .
The garbage heaps up in the public square , visible to all and stinking to high heaven , but no garbage truck arrives to take it away .
The lawbreaking is exposed , but no legislative body responds .
The damning facts pour out , and protests are made , but little is done .
Then comes the urge to repeat .
The dilemma is reflected in microcosm in the news media , especially television  a process particularly on display in the failure to challenge the administration ’s deceptive rationale for the Iraq War .
The reasons for severe doubt were , at the very least , available before the war , and they were expounded in many places .
More truthful , contrary voices could and did speak up , especially on the Internet , the freest of today ’s media .
But they were not widely heard .
They were drowned out by the dominant voices in the mainstream , acceding to the deceptions of power and their variations and derivatives .
All over the world , autocratic - minded rulers , from Italy ’s former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to Russia ’s President Vladimir Putin , have learned that de facto control of the political content of television is perhaps the most important lever of power in our day .
They have learned that it does not matter politically if 15 percent or even 25 percent of the public is well informed as long the majority remains in the dark .
The problem has not been censorship but something very nearly censorship ’s opposite : the deafening noise of the official megaphone and its echoes  not the suppression of truth , still spoken and heard in a narrow circle , but a profusion of lies and half lies ; not too little speech but too much .
If you whisper something to your friend in the front row of a rock concert , you have not been censored , but neither will you be heard .
The one major breach in the monopoly has been made by the Supreme Court , especially in its decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld requiring application of the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to detainees .
The decision ’s reasoning , if it carries the day in practice , would roll back many of the usurpations by the executive , which has already claimed that it will apply the Geneva Conventions to prisoners in U.S. custody ( though there is doubt what this will mean ) and will seek a constitutional opinion by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act court on its wiretapping .
When the Supreme Court speaks , it is more than repetition .
It is effective action .
Yet in the last analysis , the outcome of the contest will be decided in the political arena , where public opinion and , ultimately , voters are the decision - makers .
It ’s notable that the reaction to the Supreme Court ’s decision in Hamdan by one Republican congressional leader was to accuse Democrats who applauded the decision of wanting “ special privileges for terrorists . ”
One - party monopoly of power is not the only inhibiting factor .
Any oppositionist who is honest will keep in mind that a majority , however narrow , of Americans voted that one party into power in a series of elections .
Especially important was the presidential election of 2004 , when many , though not all , of the abuses were already known .
( And then the election itself was subject to grave abuses , especially in Ohio . )
The weight and meaning of that majority does not disappear because it was demonstrably misinformed about key matters of war and peace .
It ’s one thing to oppose an illegitimate concentration of power in the name of a repressed majority , another to oppose power backed and legitimated by a majority .
In the first case , it will be enough to speak truth to power ; in the second , the main need is to speak truth to one ’s fellow citizens .
As the end is restoring the democratic process , so the means should be democratic .
It ’s true that since 2004 the president ’s positive ratings in the polls have plummeted , but there is no guarantee that this shift in opinion will translate into Republican defeats in the forthcoming congressional election , and a renewal of Republican majorities in both houses of Congress would add another stamp of approval to the Bush policies , however misguided .
The mechanisms inhibiting opposition to state power , especially when backed by electoral majorities , are not something new .
Even in the freest countries there is at all times a conventional wisdom , which may wander more or less far from reality .
Sometimes it strays into a fantasyland .
Then marginal voices ( which of course are not correct merely because they are marginal ) have a special responsibility to speak up , and sometimes they shift the mainstream  as happened , for instance , in the 1960s regarding the Vietnam War and legal segregation .
For the better part of a century , segregation fit squarely within the banks of the American mainstream .
Then it did n’t .
A Persistent Pathology
As the mere mention of Vietnam suggests , the repetition dilemma also has causes that go deeper into the past .
I embarked on journalism in 1966 as a reporter in Vietnam .
The experience led , naturally and seamlessly , to a decade of writing about the war , the opposition to the war and , finally , when the war “ came home , ” to the constitutional crisis of the Nixon years and its resolution via Nixon ’s resignation under threat of impeachment .
The war and the impeachment were connected at every point .
It was n’t just that Nixon ’s wiretapping was directed against Daniel Ellsberg , war critic and leaker of the Vietnam - era Pentagon Papers ; or that the “ plumbers ” outfit that carried out the Watergate break - in was founded to spy on , disrupt and attack war critics ; or that Nixon ’s persistence in trying to win the war even as he withdrew American troops from it drove him into the paranoia that led him to draw up an “ enemies list ” and sponsor subversions of the electoral process  it was that his entire go - it - alone , imperial conception of the presidency originated in his pursuit of his war policy in secrecy and without congressional involvement .
And now , 30 years later , we find ourselves facing an uncannily similar combination of misconceived war abroad and constitutional crisis at home .
Again a global crusade ( then it was the Cold War , now it is the “ war on terror ” ) has given birth to a disastrous war ( then Vietnam , now Iraq ) ; again a president has responded by breaking the law ; and again it falls to citizens , journalists , judges , justices , and others to trace the connections between the overreaching abroad and the overreaching at home .
In consequence , not only are we condemned to repeat ourselves for the duration of the current crisis , but a remarkable number of those repetitions are already repetitions of what was said 30 years ago .
Consider , for instance , the following passage from a speech called “ The Price of Empire , ” by the great dissenter against the Vietnam War Sen. William Fulbright .
“ Before the Second World War our world role was a potential role ; we were important in the world for what we could do with our power , for the leadership we might provide , for the example we might set .
Now the choices are almost gone : we are almost the world ’s self - appointed policeman ; we are almost the world defender of the status quo .
We are well on our way to becoming a traditional great power  an imperial nation if you will  engaged in the exercise of power for its own sake , exercising it to the limit of our capacity and beyond , filling every vacuum and extending the American ‘ presence ’ to the farthest reaches of the earth .
And , as with the great empires of the past , as the power grows , it is becoming an end in itself , separated except by ritual incantation from its initial motives , governed , it would seem , by its own mystique , power without philosophy or purpose .
That describes what we have almost become . ”
Is there a single word  with the possible exception of “ almost ” at the end of the paragraph  that fails to apply to the country ’s situation today ?
Or consider this passage from Fulbright ’s The Arrogance of Power with the Iraq venture in mind :
“ Traditional rulers , institutions , and ways of life have crumbled under the fatal impact of American wealth and power but they have not been replaced by new institutions and new ways of life , nor has their breakdown ushered in an era of democracy and development . ”
Recalling these and other passages from Fulbright and other critics of the Vietnam era , one is again tempted to wonder why we should bother to say once more what has already been said so well so many times before .
Perhaps we should just quote rather than repeat  cite , not write .
Of course , people like to point out that Iraq is not Vietnam .
They are right insofar as those two countries are concerned .
For instance , today ’s anarchic Iraq , a formerly unified country now on or over the edge of civil war , is wholly different from yesterday ’s resolute Vietnam , divided into north and south but implacably bent on unity and independence from foreign rule .
And of course the two eras could scarcely be more different .
Most important , the collapse of the Soviet Union has effectuated a full - scale revolution in the international order .
The number of the world ’s superpowers has been cut back from two to one , China has become an economic powerhouse , market economics has spread across the planet , the industrial age has been pushed aside by the information age , global warming has commenced , and rock music has been replaced by rap .
Yet in the face of all this , American policies have shown an astonishing sameness , and this is what is disturbing .
In our world of racing change , only the pathologies of American power seem to remain constant .
Why ?
The Pitiful Helpless Giant
Perhaps a clue can be found in the famous speech that Sen. Joseph McCarthy gave in Wheeling , West Virginia , in February 1950 .
This was the occasion on which he announced his specious list of Communists in the State Department , launching what soon was called McCarthyism .
He also shared some thoughts on America ’s place in the world .
The allied victory in World War II had occurred only five years before .
No nation approached the United States in wealth , power , or global influence .
Yet McCarthy ’s words were a dirge for lost American greatness .
He said , “ At war ’s end we were physically the strongest nation on earth and , at least potentially , the most powerful intellectually and morally .
Ours could have been the honor of being a beacon in the desert of destruction , a shining living proof that civilization was not yet ready to destroy itself .
Unfortunately , we have failed miserably and tragically to arise to the opportunity . ”
On the contrary , McCarthy strikingly added , “ we find ourselves in a position of impotency . ”
By what actions had the United States thrown away greatness ?
McCarthy blamed not mighty forces without but traitors within , to whom he assigned an almost magical power to sap the strength of the country .
America ’s putative decline occurred “ not because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade our shores , but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this nation . ”
And , he raved on in a later speech , “ we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster .
This must be the product of a great conspiracy , a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man .
A conspiracy of infamy so black that , when it is finally exposed , its principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men . ”
McCarthy seemed to look at the United States through a kind of double lens .
At one moment the nation was a colossus , all - powerful , without peer or rival ; at the next moment a midget , cringing in panic , delivered over to its enemies , “ impotent . ”
Like the genie in Aladdin ’s bottle , the United States seemed to be a kind of magical being , first filling the sky , able to grant any wish , but a second later stoppered and helpless in its container .
Which it was to be depended not on any enemy , all of whom could easily be laid low if only America so chose , but on Americans at home , who prevented this unleashing of might .
If Americans cowered , it supposedly was mainly before other Americans .
Get them out of the way , and the United States could rule the globe .
The right - wing intellectual James Burnham named the destination to which this kind of thinking led .
“ The reality , ” he wrote , “ is that the only alternative to the communist World Empire is an American Empire , which will be , if not literally worldwide in formal boundaries , capable of exercising decisive world control . ”
McCarthy ’s double vision of the United States must have resonated deeply , for it turned out to have remarkable staying power .
Consider , for example , the following statement by the super - hawkish columnist Charles Krauthammer , penned 51 years later , in March 2001 ( six months before Sept. 11 ) .
Again we hear the King Kong - like chest - beating , even louder than before .
For the end of the Cold War , Krauthammer wrote , had made the United States “ the dominant power in the world , more dominant than any since Rome . ”
And so , just as McCarthy claimed in 1950 , “ America is in a position to reshape norms , alter expectations and create new realities . ”
But again there is a problem .
And it is the same one  the enemies within .
Thus again comes the cry of frustration , the anxiety that this utopia , to be had for the taking , will melt away like a dream , that the genie will be stuffed back into its bottle .
For the “ challenge to unipolarity is not from the outside but from the inside .
The choice is ours .
To impiously paraphrase Benjamin Franklin : History has given you an empire , if you will keep it . ”
The remedy ?
“ Unapologetic and implacable demonstrations of will . ”
We find expressions of the same double vision  a kind of anxiety - ridden triumphalism  again and again in iconic phrases uttered in the half - century between McCarthy and Krauthammer .
Walt Rostow , chair of the State Department ’s Policy Planning Council , articulated a version of it in 1964 , on the verge of the Johnson administration ’s escalation of the Vietnam War , when he spoke in a memo to Secretary of State Dean Rusk of “ the real margin of influence which flows from the simple fact that at this stage of history , we are the greatest power in the world  if only we behave like it . ”
Madeleine Albright , then UN ambassador , gave voice to a similar frustration when she turned to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and asked , “ What ’s the point of having this superb military you are always talking about if we ca n’t use it ? ”
But it was Richard Nixon who gave the double vision its quintessential expression when , in 1970 , at the pinnacle of America ’s involvement in Vietnam , he stated , “ If , when the chips are down , the world ’s most powerful nation , the United States of America , acts like a pitiful , helpless giant , the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world . ”
For Nixon , as for McCarthy and Krauthammer , the principal danger was on the home front .
As he said on another occasion , “ It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight .
The question all Americans must ask and answer tonight is this :
Does the richest and strongest nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which rejects every effort to win a just peace ? ”
And , even more explicitly , “ Because let us understand : North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States .
Only Americans can do that . ”
The question is how the United States could be a “ giant ” yet pitiful and helpless , the “ richest and strongest ” yet unable to have its way , in possession of the most superb military force in history yet unable to use it , the “ greatest power the world had ever known ” yet at the same time paralyzed .
Why , if the United States has had no peer in wealth and weaponry , has it for more than a half - century been persistently , incurably complaining of weakness , paralysis , even impotence ?
“ Losing ” Country X
McCarthy , of course , presented the “ loss ” of China as Exhibit A in his display of the deeds of his gallery of traitors .
For example , in the Wheeling speech , he specifically mentioned John Service , of the State Department ’s China desk , and charged that he “ sent official reports back to the State Department urging that we torpedo our ally Chiang Kai - shek and stating , in effect , that communism was the best hope of China . ”
By such false accusations  including the spurious allegation about the Communists in the State Department  did McCarthy transpose the “ lost ” war in China to the domestic sphere , where the phantom saboteurs of American global hegemony were supposedly at work .
Soon , the Communist tactic of the purge was adopted by the American government , with the result that many of those most knowledgeable about Asia , such as Service , were driven out of government .
As has often been pointed out , whether the United States “ lost China ” depends on whether you think the United States ever had it .
The question has lasting importance because the alleged loss of one country or another 
China , Laos , Vietnam , Chile , Iran , Nicaragua , Iraq  became a leitmotif of American politics , especially at election time .
In each of these cases , the United States “ possessed ” the countries in question ( and thus was in a position to “ lose ” them ) only insofar as it somehow laid claim to control the destinies of peoples on a global basis , or , as Fulbright said , an imperial basis .
But if there is one clear lesson that the history of recent empires has taught , it is that modern peoples have both the will and the capacity to reject imperial rule and assert control over their own destinies .
Less interested in the contest between East and West than in running their own countries , they yearned for self - determination , and they achieved it .
The British and French imperialists were forced to learn this lesson over the course of a century .
The Soviet Union took a little longer , and itself collapsed in the process .
The United States , determined in the period in question to act in an imperial fashion , has been the dunce in the class , and indeed under the current administration has put forward imperial claims that dwarf those of imperial Britain at its height .
It is only because , in country after country , the United States has attempted the impossible abroad that it has been led to blame people at home for the failure .
Fortunately , American involvement in China in the 1940s was restricted to aid and advice , and virtually no fighting between Americans and Mao ’s forces occurred .
Now that the price of the military intervention in Vietnam  a much smaller country  is known , we can only shudder to imagine what intervention in China would have cost .
Perhaps one of the few positive things that can be said about the Vietnam disaster is that if the United States was determined to fight a counterinsurgency war , it was better to do it in Vietnam than in China .
But even without intervention , the price of China ’s defection from the American camp was high .
The causes of McCarthyism were manifold , but in a very real sense , what the country got instead of war with Mao was the “ war ” at home that was McCarthyism .
The true causes of the Nationalist government ’s fall  its own incompetence and corruption , leading to wholesale loss of legitimacy in the eyes of its own people  were expunged from consciousness , and the lurid fantasy of State Department traitors and conspirators was concocted in their place .
Then the delusion that Chiang could return from what then was called the island of Formosa ( the Portuguese name for Taiwan ) to retake the mainland was fostered by the China lobby .
Delusion ran wild .
Myths were created to take the place of unfaceable truths .
The internal conspiracy to destroy the United States , said McCarthy , was supposedly headed by , of all people , Truman ’s secretary of state , Gen. George Marshall .
“ It was Marshall , with Acheson and Vincent eagerly assisting , ” he said , “ who created the China policy which , destroying China , robbed us of a great and friendly ally , a buffer against the Soviet imperialism with which we are now at war . ”
And he added for good measure , “ We have declined so precipitously in relation to the Soviet Union in the last six years .
How much swifter may be our fall into disaster with Marshall at the helm ? ”
Impotent Omnipotence
Another event , scarcely more than a month before Mao declared the existence of the People ’s Republic of China , also fueled McCarthy ’s theme of thrown - away greatness .
On Aug. 29 , 1949 , the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb  Joe - 1 , named after Joseph Stalin .
At once , in an experience strangely parallel to the loss of China from America ’s sphere of interest , intoxicating dreams of atomic monopoly and the lasting military superiority that was thought to go with it shriveled up .
Not superiority but stalemate was suddenly the outlook  not dominance but the stasis of the “ balance of terror . ”
The outlines of the new limitations soon took shape in the long , wearying , poorly understood , and publicly disliked Korean War , in which America ’s atomic arsenal , whose use was considered but rejected , was no help .
The theme of thwarted American greatness was sounded again , when Gen. Douglas MacArthur , who proposed using atomic weapons in Korea , announced , “ There can be no substitute for victory , ” and was fired by Truman for insubordination .
Meanwhile , a connection with the enemy within was discovered when Soviet spying on the Manhattan Project came to light .
Scientists had long known that there could be no “ secret ” of the bomb  that the relevant science was irretrievably available to all  and that the Soviet Union would be able to build one .
The Soviet timetable had indeed been speeded up by the spying , but now it seemed to McCarthy and others that the domestic traitors were the prime agents of the sudden , apparent reversal of American fortune .
( Truman sought to compensate for the loss of the atomic monopoly with his prompt decision to build the H - bomb . )
The full implications of the ensuing nuclear standoff sank in slowly .
As the Soviet Union gradually built up its arsenal , American strategic thinkers and policy - makers awakened to some unpleasant discoveries about nuclear arms .
The bomb , too , had a distinctly genie - like quality of looking formidable at one instant but useless the next .
Even in the days of American nuclear monopoly , between 1945 and the first Soviet explosion of 1949 , nuclear weapons had proved a disappointing military instrument .
Stalin had simply declared that nuclear weapons were for scaring people with “ weak nerves , ” and acted accordingly .
And once the monopoly was broken , no use of nuclear weapons could be planned without facing the prospect of retaliation .
During the 1950s , Dwight Eisenhower tried to squeeze what benefit he could out of the United States ’ lingering numerical nuclear superiority with his “ massive retaliation ” policy , but its prescription of threatening nuclear annihilation to gain advantage in far - flung local struggles was never quite believable , perhaps even by its practitioners .
By the late 1950s , a new generation of strategists was awakening to the full dimensions of a central paradox of the nuclear age : Possession of nuclear arsenals did not empower but rather paralyzed their owners .
Henry Kissinger remarked , “ The more powerful the weapons , the greater the reluctance to use them , ” and fretted about “ how our power can give impetus to our policy rather than paralyze it . ”
Here at the core of the riddle of American power in the nuclear age was the very image of the pitiful , helpless giant , a figure grown weak through the very excess of his strength .
But the source of this weakness , which was very real , had nothing to do with any domestic cowards , not to speak of traitors , or any political event ; it lay in the revolutionary consequences for all military power of the invention of nuclear arms , even if  with a hint of defensiveness , perhaps  the United States now called itself a “ superpower . ”
( The H - bomb was first called “ the super . ” )
Here was a barrier to the application of force that no cultivation of “ will ” could change or overcome .
But the policy - makers did not accept the verdict of paralysis without a struggle .
Within the precincts of high strategy , the “ nuclear priesthood ” mounted a sustained , complex intellectual insurrection against this distasteful reality of the nuclear age .
Even in the face of the undoubted reality that if the arsenals were used , “ mutual assured destruction ” would result , they looked for room to maneuver .
One line of attack was the “ counterforce ” strategy of targeting the nuclear forces rather than the society of the foe .
The hope was to preserve the possibility of some kind of victory , or at least of relative military advantage , from the general ruin of nuclear war .
Another line of attack was advocacy of “ limited war , ” championed by Kissinger and others .
The strategists reasoned that although “ general war ” might be unwinnable , limited war , of the kind just then brewing in Vietnam , could be fought and won .
Perhaps not all war between nuclear adversaries had been paralyzed .
Thus , the impotent omnipotence of the nuclear stalemate became one more paradoxical argument , in addition to those drummed into the public mind by McCarthy and his heirs , in favor of American engagement in counterinsurgency struggles .
And this time the United States , unprotected by the prudence of a George Marshall , did go to war .
The results are the ones we know .
American military might was no more profitable when used against rebellious local populations in limited wars than it was in general , nuclear wars .
This time , the lessons were learned , and for a while they stuck : Peoples , even of small countries , are powerful within their own borders ; they have the means to resist foreign occupation successfully ; military force will not lead them to change their minds ; the issues are therefore essentially political , and in this contest , foreign invaders are fatally disadvantaged from the outset ; if they are not willing to stay forever , they lose .
The Decline of Power
By the late 1970s , adverse experience sufficient to illuminate the utterly novel historical situation of the United States in the late 20th century was in hand .
Undoubtedly , it had the biggest heap of weapons of any country .
Without question , they were the most varied , sophisticated , and effective in the world at their job of killing people and blowing things up .
The question was what the United States could accomplish with this capacity .
Certainly , if a conventional foe lacking nuclear arms arrayed itself in battle against the United States , it could be handily defeated .
That was the mistake that Saddam Hussein made in 1990 when he sent his army out into the Kuwaiti desert , where it was pulverized from the air .
But few wars in fact conformed to this conventional pattern any longer .
Of far greater importance was what happened to two kinds of war that had historically been the most important  wars of imperial conquest and general , great - power wars , such as the First and Second World Wars .
During the 20th century the first kind had become hopeless “ quagmires , ” owing to the aroused will of local peoples everywhere who , collectively , had put an end to the age of imperialism .
The second were made unfightable and unwinnable by the nuclear revolution .
It was these two limitations on the usefulness of military force , one acting at the base of the international system , the other at its apex , that delimited the superiority of the superpower .
( The paradox of impotent omnipotence was even more pronounced for the other superpower , the Soviet Union , which actually disappeared . )
Very possibly , the United States , with all its resources , would have been the sort of globe - straddling empire that Joseph McCarthy wanted it to be had it risen to preeminence in an earlier age .
It was the peculiar trajectory of the United States , born in opposition to empire , to wind up making its own bid for empire only after the age of imperialism was over .
Though it ’s hard to shed a tear , you might say that there was a certain unfairness in America ’s timing .
All the ingredients of past empires were there  the wealth , the weapons , the power , hard and soft .
Only the century was wrong .
The United States was not , could not be , and cannot now be a new Rome , much less greater than Rome , because it cannot do what Rome did .
It cannot , in a post - imperial age , conquer other countries and lastingly absorb them into a great empire ; it cannot , in the nuclear age , not even today , fight and win wars against its chief global rivals , who still , after all , possess nuclear arsenals .
Even tiny , piteous , brutalized , famine - ridden North Korea , more a cult than a country , can deter the United States with its puny putative arsenal .
The United States , to be sure , is a great power by any measure , surely the world ’s greatest , yet that power is hemmed in by obstacles peculiar to our era .
The mistake has been not so much to think that the power of the United States is greater than it is as to fail to realize that power itself , whether wielded by the United States or anyone else  if conceived in terms of military force  has been in decline .
By imagining otherwise , the United States has become the fool of force  and the fool of history .
In this larger context the repeated constitutional crises of the last half - century assume an altered aspect .
The conventional understanding is that an excess of power abroad brings abuses at home .
The classic citation is Rome , whose imperial forces , led by Julius Caesar , returning from foreign conquest , crossed the river Rubicon into the homeland and put an end to the republic .
( Thus both the proponents of American empire and its detractors can cite Rome . )
But that has not been the American story .
Rome and would - be Rome are not the same .
Empire and the fantasy of empire are not the same .
It is rather the repeatedly failed bid for imperial sway that has corrupted .
It was not triumph but loss  of China , of the atomic monopoly , among other developments  that precipitated the McCarthyite assault on liberty at home .
It was persistent failure in the Vietnam War , already a decade old and deeply unpopular , that led an embattled , isolated , nearly demented Richard Nixon to draw up his enemies list , illegally spy on his domestic opposition , obstruct justice when his misdeeds became known , ramble drunkenly in the Oval Office about using nuclear weapons and ultimately mount an assault on the entire constitutional system of checks and balances .
And it is today an unpopular President Bush , unable either to win the Iraq War or to extricate himself from it , who has launched his absolutist assault on the Constitution .
Power corrupts , says the old saw .
But is power the right word to use in the face of so much failure ?
The sometimes suggested alternate  that weakness corrupts  seems equally appropriate .
In a manner of speaking perhaps both saws are true , for in terms of military might the United States is unrivaled , yet in terms of capacity to get things done with that might , it so often proves weak  even , at times , impotent , as McCarthy said .
The pattern is not the old Roman one in which military conquest breeds arrogance and arrogance stokes ambition , which leads to usurpation at home .
Rather , in the case of the United States , misunderstanding of its historical moment leads to misbegotten wars ; misbegotten wars lead to military disaster ; military disaster leads to domestic strife and scapegoating ; domestic strife and scapegoating lead to usurpation , which triggers a constitutional crisis .
Crises born of strength and success are different from crises born of failure .
Fulbright warned of the corruption of imperial ambition and the arrogance of power .
But we need also to speak of the corruption of imperial failure , the arrogance of anxiety .
What the true greatness  or true power  of the United States is or can be for the world in our time is an absorbing question in pressing need of an answer .
Our very conceptions of greatness and power  military , economic , political , moral  would need searching reconsideration .
Those true powers  especially the economic  also have an “ imperial ” aspect , but that is another debate .
An advantage of that debate is that it would be about things that are real .
Jettisoning the mirage of military domination of the globe that has addled so many American brains for more than half a century and also shunning the panic - stricken fears of impotence that have accompanied the inevitable frustration of these delusions , the debate would take realistic stock of the nation ’s very considerable yet limited resources and ask what is being done with them , for good or ill , and what should be done .
Perhaps it will still be possible to shoehorn the United States into a stretched definition of “ empire , ” but it would look nothing like Britain or Rome .
Or perhaps , as I believe , a United States rededicated to its constitutional traditions and embarked on a cooperative course with other nations would find that it possesses untapped reserves of political power , though it will take time for American prestige to recover from Bush ’s squandering of it .
Restoring Illusion
Until very recently those authentic questions went substantially unexplored outside scholarly journals , and the country instead busied itself repairing the imperial illusions so rudely dashed by the Vietnam War .
Suppressing the lessons of the Chinese Revolution had been easy , since the United States had not fought in China .
Getting over the lessons of Vietnam took longer .
Many segments of American society , none more than the military , had learned them deeply and vowed “ never again . ”
( The poignancy of the generals ’ recent outspoken statement against the conduct of the war in Iraq lies precisely in the officers ’ chagrin that they did indeed let it happen again . )
The lessons were formulated in military terms in the so - called Powell doctrine , requiring that before military action proceeded there must be a clear military  not political  objective , that there must be a commitment to the use of overwhelming force and that there must be an “ exit strategy . ”
Nevertheless , in other quarters the lessons were named a “ Vietnam syndrome , ” an illness , and other explanations were brought forward .
The lessons of Vietnam were not so much forgotten as vigorously suppressed , in the name of restoring the reputation of America ’s military power .
Ronald Reagan said of the Vietnam military , “ They came home without a victory not because they were defeated but because they were denied a chance to win . ”
After the first Gulf War , President Bush crowed , “ By God , we ’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all ! ”
The country was getting ready for the second Iraq War , which violated every tenet of the Powell doctrine .
A parallel evolution was occurring in the constitutional domain .
The lesson most of the country learned from Watergate and the forced resignation of Richard Nixon was that the imperial presidency had grown too strong .
( In general , our imperial - minded presidents have had much more success rolling back freedom at home than extending it abroad . )
Dick Cheney , who had served as chief of staff for President Gerald Ford , drew an opposite lesson  that the powers others called imperial were in fact the proper ones for the presidency and had been eviscerated by the opposition to Vietnam and the Watergate scandal .
As he has put it , “ Watergate and a lot of the things around Watergate and Vietnam , both during the 1970s , served , I think , to erode the authority the president needs to be effective , especially in the national security area . ”
Taking the Nixon presidency as a model rather than a cautionary tale , he sees new usurpation as restoration .
In doing so , he brings an old theme back in new guise  that American weakness in the world is caused by domestic opponents at home .
In his view , domestic subversion  this time of executive authority , not misguided imperial ambition  is the country ’s problem .
Can this pattern be broken ?
Voices are already being heard advising that the opposition to the Iraq War and the failed vision it embodies should , with the next election in mind , now embrace a generalized new readiness to use force .
But that way lies only a new chapter in the sorry history of the pitiful , helpless giant .
The needed lesson is exactly the opposite  to learn or relearn , or perhaps we must say re-relearn , the lessons regarding the limitations on the use of force that have been taught and then rejected so many times in recent decades .
Only then will we be able to stop repeating ourselves and , giving up dreams of imperial grandeur , start saying and doing something new .

JON CARROLL
There were two very fine photographs on the front page of this very newspaper the other day .
The first showed the speaker of the House driving off in a hydrogen - powered car after a news conference on gas prices .
The second showed him , about 100 yards down the road , getting out of the energy - efficient car and lumbering toward the SUV that would take him the rest of the way to wherever he was going .
Coming soon -- the Potemkin Congress .
Politicians are trying very hard to convince us that they have not been cowering before the mighty oil companies for just ever .
They are talking bravely of taxing windfall profits , and prohibiting accounting tricks that keep profits high , and -- well , a bunch of stuff that will never happen .
Bill Frist is talking about giving each of us $ 100 just for being ourselves .
He feels our pain .
Well , no , he does n't , but he 's hired someone to feel our pain .
Is there a more transparent trick than " Vote for me and I 'll give you $ 100 " ?
It 's beyond satire .
What 's next ?
Free orgasms ?
Wait , they 're already free .
The system works .
It is equally amusing watching the oil companies explain how their record profits are not profits as such , and that with the costs of exploration and the growing need for energy and -- did you even try to follow it ?
We 're rolling in money , but we 're not actually rolling in money !
This is not money !
We are not here !
Unless you 're a stockholder , in which case we are here and this is money .
One might say to the American people :
What did you expect ?
You voted for a guy who made his money in the oil business .
( What he did in the oil business : not so clear . )
You voted for a vice president who set energy policy by having secret meetings with oil company executives .
You were in favor of a war that was fought to guarantee our oil supply .
You cheered when economy - stimulating tax cuts were enacted .
You are now paying $ 3 a gallon at the pump in what Daniel Yergin has called " the permanent shortage , " and you feel betrayed ?
This was an act between consenting adults ; it 's a little late for buyer 's remorse .
Not that one would expect the Democrats to do much better .
Our political institutions are , in the area of corporate governance , largely irrelevant .
The government could n't help even if the government wanted to help .
That train left the station 30 years ago .
Which does not mean that we are without hope .
In fact , we are the problem .
There are no large oil companies without large demand for oil , and we are doing the demanding .
If you were running a business where people would apparently pay just about anything to get your product , would n't you keep raising your prices ?
If gas is a large part of your budget , make it a smaller part of your budget .
I understand that it is hard for some people to drive less .
I feel sorry for traveling salesmen and landscapers and farmers .
Heck , I feel sorry for all of us , one way or the other .
But the pain is going to come , one way or another .
We can choose to control the pain ourselves , or we can wait until it gets so bad we have to accept whatever solution is at hand .
The sooner you choose , the more choices you 'll have .
Four percent of the world 's population ; 25 per cent of the energy use -- that 's us .
And , maddeningly enough , the world wants to catch up .
It wants big cars and bright lights and the wonders of exurban commuting .
We 've led the way in excess , and now we 're going to lead the world in regret .
And no one will feel sorry for us , because we 've pillaged and invaded and belittled and overthrown and generally wiped our feet on the rest of the world .
I know , I know , it was n't you .
But it 's your problem anyway ; it 's your karma anyway .
We do understand , have always understood , that the deluded narcissists in Washington are not going to help us out .
We might be able to help ourselves out .
We might form communities of interest , communities of need , and figure out how to share energy expenses .
Neighborhood shopping trips ; neighborhood carpooling ; neighborhood consciousness - raising .
It 's happened in race relations ; it 's happened in women 's rights ; why can't it happen in energy policy ?
I do not believe that there 's one big solution for this mess .
I do suspect that there are a million small solutions .
Anyway , it 's the only thing we have left to try .
Either that or , you know , better drugs .
Here , I know .
If you vote for me , I 'll give you your own gas pump !
No more expensive driving to the station ; throw money away in the privacy of your own home .
When producers integrated racially segregated teams on the television show “ Survivor , ” they may have done the contestants a favor .
A recent study has shown that despite initial tensions , racially diverse groups make better decisions .
In a study of mock juries , published in the April issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , researchers found that both black and white jurors in racially mixed juries performed better than members of all - white juries .
Jurors in the diverse jury raised more facts about the case , made fewer factual mistakes , and acknowledged the role of race more often than jurors in the all white jury .
“ Survivor ’s ” producers drew sharp media criticism when they announced this summer that the 13th season would begin with racially divided teams .
Politicians and columnists from around the country worried that it would promote divisiveness and racial stereotypes .
Before the show aired , Thomas Pettigrew , a psychology professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who has studied racial prejudice for more than fifty years , said that pitting races in competition against each other could actually generate and promote prejudice .
Samuel Sommers , author of the jury study and an assistant professor of psychology at Tufts University , found the controversy surrounding the show more interesting than the segregation itself .
By dividing groups by race , Sommers said he thought that “ Survivor ” was just artificially replicating what seems to happen naturally , noting that we normally find ourselves in groups of people like ourselves .
In Sommers ’s study , he assembled mock juries that watched 30 minutes of televised courtroom footage .
A black defendant was accused of sexual assault against a white woman , but there were no other race - related facts in the case .
Before the deliberation began , Sommers asked each juror whether he or she thought the defendant was guilty and how likely it was that he had committed the crime .
To his surprise , Sommers found that white jurors in all - white juries were significantly more likely to vote “ guilty ” than white or black members of integrated juries .
The jurors had not discussed their verdicts with other jurors , which meant , according to the study , that their decisions could only be attributed to the racial composition of their group .
Sommers also found that diversity impacted more than the jurors ’ initial perceptions of the case .
Three of his assistants watched videotapes of each jury ’s deliberations .
They measured different indicators of jury performance , such as the number of case facts raised , the number of factual inaccuracies , and how often race was mentioned in deliberations .
On average , all - white juries made twice as many factual errors and deliberated for 12 minutes less .
Sommers suggests that they were vulnerable to “ groupthink ” — a pressure to conform to what they thought was the group ’s consensus without taking the time to weigh the facts .
It is difficult to generalize Sommers ’s results to other settings — particularly that of a TV show like “ Survivor ” — because the jury situation forced participants to work together towards a consensus and placed a premium on making a just decision .
In contrast , on “ Survivor , ” the prize is awarded to one person , so contestants make decisions for personal gain even when they compete in teams .
Because “ Survivor ” integrated the teams early in the show , it ’s hard to compare the differences in decision - making between segregated and racially diverse teams .
Even if diversity helped teams work together effectively , they were still full of conflict , at least initially .
Sommers acknowledges this initial tension , but argues that “ a little bit of conflict can be a good thing — especially to make the right decision . ”

It takes less than 50 milliseconds to decide if you like a website
Researchers found that the brain makes decisions in just a 20th of a second of viewing a webpage .
They were surprised as they believed it would take at least 10 times longer to form an opinion .
The study , published in the journal Behaviour and Information Technology , also suggests that first impressions have a lasting impact .
Speedy conclusions
The Canadian team showed volunteers glimpses of websites , lasting for only 50 milliseconds .
My colleagues believed it would be impossible to really see anything in less than 500 milliseconds
Gitte Lindgaard , Carleton University
The researchers found that the speedily formed conclusions closely tallied with opinions of the websites that had been made after much longer periods of examination .
Gitte Lindgaard of Carleton University in Ottawa , Canada , and lead researcher of the paper expressed her surprise at the results .
" My colleagues believed it would be impossible to really see anything in less than 500 milliseconds , " she told the website of the Nature journal , which reported the research .
The judgements were being formed almost as quickly as the eye can take in information .
Lasting impressions
The researchers also believe that these quickly formed first impressions last because of what is known to psychologists as the " halo effect " .
If people believe a website looks good , then this positive quality will spread to other areas , such as the website 's content .
Since people like to be right , they will continue to use the website that made a good first impression , as this will further confirm that their initial decision was a good one .
As websites increasingly jostle for business , Dr Lindgaard added that companies should take note .
" Unless the first impression is favourable , visitors will be out of your site before they even know that you might be offering more than your competitors , " she warned .
VIDEO - There is no doubt that Iran 's nuclear program is an attempt by the Islamic Republic to gain military nuclear weapons , and the United States will not allow Tehran to go nuclear , the US Under - Secretary of State for Political Affairs , Ambassador Nicholas Burns , said during the Herzliya Conference Sunday evening .
" Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon , there 's no doubt about it , " Burns said , adding : " There 's no debate among experts .
It 's seeking a nuclear weapon at its plant at Nantz . "
Watch live broadcast of Herzliya Conference
The US under - secretary added that his country " is not seeking , at all , a confrontation with Iran , " but said that " the policy of the United States is that we cannot allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons state . "
His declaration was met with applause among the delegates attending the conference .
" The US has not gone out to look for an argument with Iran , " Burns emphasized , but Iran has refused to back down in its attempt to destabilize the region , prompting the US to station " two battle groups in the Persian gulf , " and to target Iranian networks enabling attacks on US soldiers in Iraq .
" We have an absolute right to defend our soldiers , " he added . .
Burns outlined a series of diplomatic steps taken by Washington against Iran , and urged the countries of the European Union to end their economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic .
' 2007 year of decision '
He also highlighted Iran 's divisive role in the Middle East , support of Palestinian terror groups , Hizbullah , and attempt to topple the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora .
" In Lebanon , in a couple days time , President Chirac will host a conference , so that the democratic nations stand up in the world against Hizbullah , against those who want to destabilize the democratic government of Siniora , " Burns said , adding that the US will help this effort .
" We 're all going to defend a democratically elected government from that axis …and we 're going to help democracy survive and hopefully prosper , " he said .
Burns expressed hope that Iran would return to the negotiating table , and said the offer for negotiations was still open .
He affirmed Washington 's close alliance with Jerusalem , saying : " We are committed to our alliance with Israel .
We are committed to being Israel 's strongest security partner .
I can't remember a time when the relationship between our two countries was stronger than it is today . "
Transportation Minister and former defense minister Shaul Mofaz , who had met with Burns before their joint appearance at the Herzliya conference , said the coming year would be a crucial time for deciding the future of the Middle East .
" The year of 2007 is a year of decisiveness , " Mofaz said .
" Iran of 2007 has all the components to threaten us existentially , and the whole of the region . "
" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad believes he is on a divine mission .
I 'm the last person to call him insane , " Mofaz said .
" Although I am not qualified as a psychologist , it 's clear to me we are dealing with a person driven by an extremist ideology , who is determined to fulfill his mission , " he added .
" Iran is the heart of the problem in the Middle East .
It is the urgent threat to the world .
And it must be dealt with , before it's too late , " he said , adding : " The world can't allow a situation in which a fundamentalist country - that does n't hide its intentions - holds nuclear weapons .
The free world does n't have the privilege to drag its feet on Iran and hope for best . "
The shuttles may not be able to lift Google ’s stock price , but they have struck a chord with employees .
“ It ’s the most useful Google fringe benefit , ” said Wiltse Carpenter , a 45 - year - old software engineer .
Mr. Carpenter has been with Google only a few months , but before that he had commuted from San Francisco to the same Highway 101 exit since 1992 , having worked at Silicon Graphics and Microsoft , two Google neighbors .
“ It ’s changed my quality of life , ” he said .
That sentiment is not surprising .
Even Googlers have to worry about the area ’s high real estate prices , which have sent families to the outer confines of the region in search of cheaper housing .
And the hopping cultural and social life of San Francisco remains a magnet for young workers , even though the commute to offices in Silicon Valley , some 35 miles to the south , can take well over an hour .
A recent survey showed that traffic was the No. 1 concern for the area ’s residents — for the 10th year in a row .
But on a rainy winter afternoon , as some 20 Google employees hopped onto the 4:40 p.m. back to the Mission and Noe Valley districts of San Francisco , those concerns seemed distant .
The shuttle merged onto Highway 101 , made its way across three lanes packed with slow - moving vehicles and into the carpool lane , where it began speeding past hundreds of commuters .
Inside , most riders appeared to abide by the shuttle ’s etiquette rules .
Cellphone conversations are allowed if they are work - related and sotto voce .
But loud personal calls are definitely out .
In fact , except for a couple snuggled together , no one sat on adjacent seats .
Many took out iPods or laptops and worked , surfed the Web or watched videos .
“ People tend to be quiet and respectful that this is people ’s downtime , ” said Diana Alberghini , a 33 - year - old program manager .
Google will not discuss the cost of the program , which it operates through Bauer ’s Limousine , a private transportation company in San Francisco .
But the shuttles appear to be having the desired effect on recruiting .
Michael Gaiman , a 23 - year - old Web applications engineer who lives in San Francisco and was recently hired , said he turned down an offer from Apple before accepting the job at Google .
“ It definitely was a factor , ” Mr. Gaiman said of the shuttle .

With Christmas just a few days away , churches around the world , including in Pakistan , are decked for the festive season .
We wish all our Christian friends a Happy Christmas .
We were originally going to design a little ATP Christmas Card and put it up here ( like Pakistani newspapers do ) .
Instead , we thought , it better to make this into a little tour of Pakistani churches and turn it into an ATP Photo - Quiz ( it has been a while since the last one ) .
This also gives us an opportunity to write about Christian Churches in Pakistan , having written in the past about a Hindu Mandir and Sikh Gurdwara .
There are literally hundreds and hundreds of churches spread all over Pakistan , where ever Christian communities have lived in the past or now live .
Here we present you with pictures of 15 of them organized into three clusters of 3 , 6 and 6 ) .
How many of these Pakistani churches can you identify by name and location ?
And what additional information or stories do you have about them .
My own sense is that no reader would be able to identify all of them on sight , largely because they are from all over the country ( Hint # 1 ) .
I certainly could not have .
A little Internet snooping would , of course , get you to most of them ( Hint # 2 ) .
And that would be perfectly fine ( and educational ) .
But before you do that , do try to see which ones you can identify immediately ; I could identify 6 for sure and 2 more ‘ probably . ’
The top cluster ( above ) has three famous Pakistani churches all in the North of the country ( Hint # 3 ) .
The middle cluster ( below ) has six more Pakistani churches all in built in classical church architectural styles and all going back to the British days ( Hint # 4 ) .
These include some of the most famous and largest churches in Pakistan ( Hint # 5 ) and include some Cathedrals ( Hint # 6 ) .
Many of the grandest churches in Pakistan were built during the British days , but contrary to popular belief most functional churches have been built in the last 50 years , are fairly small , and often in smaller towns with local congregations .
Their architectures vary ( much like the architectures of mosques in Europe and North America ) by affluence and spirit of architectural innovation amongst the community .
The bottom cluster ( below ) have six more Pakistani churches with more innovative architectural styles .
The first two are pre-independence ( Hint # 7 ) , the remaining four much more recent ( Hint # 8 ) .
The city most represented in these 15 pictures is Karachi ( Hint # 9 ) , although I suspect there are as many – if not more – churches in Lahore ; but I may be wrong .
I should also add that although there is a large diversity of functional churches operational in Pakistan , at least two of the churches featured here were recently the subject of cowardly acts of violence and displays of religious intolerance ( Hint # 10 ) that I , as a Pakistani , am deeply shamed by .

Industrial Hemp Farming
Act introduced in Congress Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday February 13 , 2007 Print This Email This
An act to legitimize hemp farming has been introduced in Congress , according to a press release .
" For the second time since the federal government outlawed hemp farming in the United States , " the release states , " a federal bill has been introduced that would remove restrictions on the cultivation of non-psychoactive industrial hemp . "
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , a maverick 2008 presidential candidate , is the chief sponsor behind the bill , H.R. 1009 .
Nine co-sponsors , including fellow White House hopeful Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , are all Democrats .
The bill " would give states the right to regulate farming of the versatile hemp crop , " the release says .
" It is indefensible that the United States government prevents American farmers from growing this crop , " the release quotes Rep. Paul .
" The prohibition subsidizes farmers in countries from Canada to Romania by eliminating American competition and encourages jobs in industries such as food , auto parts and clothing that utilize industrial hemp to be located overseas instead of in the United States . "
Paul states that the passing of the act would " help American farmers and reduce the trade deficit -- all without spending a single taxpayer dollar . "
The release cites fifteen states which have passed pro-hemp legislation , including seven ( Hawaii , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Montana , North Dakota and West Virginia ) which " have removed barriers to its production or research . "
Rep .
Paul 's bill would , the statement continues , " remove federal barriers and allow laws in these states regulating the growing and processing of industrial hemp to take effect . "
A hemp activist leader , quoted in the release , asserts that " the DEA has taken the Controlled Substances
Act 's antiquated definition of marijuana out of context and used it as an excuse to ban industrial hemp farming " and says passage of the new act " will bring us back to more rational times when the government regulated marijuana , but told farmers they could go ahead and continue raising hemp just as they always had . "

“ Da police are not here to create disorder ; dere here to preserve disorder . ” — Richard J. Daley , Chicago mayor , explaining to the media the role of the police during the riotous 1968 Democratic National Convention .
Police keep order .
That ’s why , for example , they issue tickets for “ disturbing the peace . ”
Thus the only logical conclusion to Mayor Daley ’s famous quote above — other than dismissing it as the result of a tangled tongue — is sometimes disorder spawns order .
Sounds impossible , right ?
Wrong .
According to a computational study conducted by a group of physicists at Washington University in St. Louis , one may create order by introducing disorder .
While working on their model — a network of interconnected pendulums , or “ oscillators ” — the researchers noticed that when driven by ordered forces the various pendulums behaved chaotically and swung out of sync like a group of intoxicated synchronized swimmers .
This was unexpected — should n’t synchronized forces yield synchronized pendulums ?
But then came the real surprise :
When they introduced disorder — forces were applied at random to each oscillator — the system became ordered and synchronized .
“ The thing that is counterintuitive is that when you introduce disorder into the system — when the [ forces on the pendulums ] act at random — the chaos that was present before disappears and there is order , ” said Sebastian F. Brandt , Washington University physics graduate student in Arts & Sciences and lead author of the study , which appeared in the January 2006 edition of Physical Review Letters .
Insights into other realms
The physicists ’ research is not only hard to grasp for non-physicists , but puzzling for physicists , too .
As supervisor Ralf Wessel , Ph.D. , Washington University associate professor of physics said , “ Every physicist who hears this is surprised . ”
Research on the role of disorder in complex systems is quite new and not well understood .
Wessel hopes that one day its theoretical understanding will be better than it is today .
Nevertheless , the researchers believe the model could provide insights outside the realm of theoretical physics .
Neurons , for example , have been modeled as interconnected , or “ coupled , ” oscillators because of the way they interact with one another .
In the model , coupled oscillators can be imagined as being tethered to their nearest neighbor , thus influencing their movement .
Neurons , on the other hand , may display repetitive electrical activity that can be influenced by the activity of neighboring neurons .
Though it ’s a bit of a stretch , admits Babette K. Dellen , Ph.D. , the study may help to solve previously unexplained observations .
Dellen first noticed the disorder - order phenomenon while studying neurology .
She set the project aside and then Brandt joined the research group and became intrigued with the concept of disorder - induced synchronization and delved more deeply .
Finally , the three put the paper together .
Dellen explains that neurons can exhibit synchronous activity in response to a stimulus .
To this point , she said , nobody has come up with an adequate explanation .
And Wessel said , “ Here , what Dellen discovered , is that maybe the details of neurons are completely irrelevant .
Maybe it is only a property of oscillators . ”
Oscillators like a child on a swing
A vital similarity between the model system and neurons is that they are both “ nonlinear ” — meaning that there is not a linear , or straight - ahead , correlation between the applied force and displacement .
In other words , the oscillators in the model may be likened to a child on a swing .
Within a small range , the child will move in constant proportion to how hard you push them — if you push twice as hard , they will go twice as far .
But nearly all complex systems in nature , like the physicists ’ model , are nonlinear .
Once the child gets to a certain height , pushing twice as hard will not make the child go twice as far .
Neurons are composed of many elements and are typically nonlinear .
“ When you hear your favorite music twice as loud you do n’t double the pleasure , ” mused Brandt , explaining how one aspect of the brain — hearing — is nonlinear .
While other research has shown that disorder can create order , these studies often involved manipulating parameters within the systems such as changing pendulum length .
The researchers say that their work is novel because it involves changing externally applied forces .
Thus , they believe , their findings might have potential in the real world , where it would be more difficult to change parameters within the system — neurons , for example — but relatively simple to apply an external forcing .
“ This is of course basic research , ” said Brandt .
“ But what you can learn from this is that complex systems … sometimes behave in a very unexpected way , completely opposite to your intuition or expectation .
It will be interesting to see if the mechanism that we have found can actually be put to some use . ”
DIGG THIS
The wave — and make no mistake , it ’s a global one — has just crashed on our shores , soaking our imperial masters .
It ’s a sight for sore eyes .
It ’s been a long time since we ’ve seen an election like midterm 2006 .
After all , it ’s a truism of our politics that Americans are almost never driven to the polls by foreign - policy issues , no less by a single one that dominates everything else , no less by a catastrophic war ( and the presidential approval ratings that go with it ) .
This strange phenomenon has been building since the moment , in May 2003 , that George W. Bush stood under that White - House - prepared “ Mission Accomplished ” banner on the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared “ major combat operations have ended . ”
That “ Top Gun ” stunt — when a cocky President helped pilot an S - 3B Viking sub reconnaissance Naval jet onto a carrier deck and emerged into the golden glow of “ magic hour light ” ( as his handlers then called it ) — was meant to give him the necessary victory photos to launch his 2004 presidential reelection campaign .
As it turned out , that moment was but the first “ milestone ” on the path to Iraqi , and finally electoral , hell .
Within mere months , those photos would prove useless for anyone but liberal bloggers .
By now , they seem like artifacts from another age .
On the way to the present “ precipice ” ( or are we already over the edge ? ) , there have been other memorable “ milestones ” — from the President ’s July 2003 petulant “ bring u2018em on ” taunt to Iraq ’s then forming insurgency to the Vice President ’s June 2005 “ last throes ” gaffe .
All such statements have , by now , turned to dust in American mouths .
In the context of the history of great imperial powers , how remarkably quickly this has happened .
An American President , ruling the last superpower on this or any other planet , and his party have been driven willy - nilly into global and domestic retreat a mere three - plus years after launching the invasion of their dreams , the one that was meant to start them on the path to controlling the planet — and by one of the more ragtag minority rebellions imaginable .
I ’m speaking here , of course , of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq , of perhaps 15,000 relatively lightly armed rebels whose main weapons have been the roadside bomb and the sniper ’s bullet .
What a grim , bizarre spectacle it ’s been .
The Fall of the New Rome
But let ’s back up a moment .
After such an election , a bit of history , however quick and potted , is in order — in this case of the post - Cold War era of U.S. supremacy , now seemingly winding down .
In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , to be followed by the relatively violence - free collapse of the Soviet Union , there was a brief moment of conceptual paralysis among leadership elites in this country , none of whom had even imagined the loss of the “ Evil Empire ” ( in President Ronald Reagan ’s famous Star Wars- ian phrase ) until it suddenly , miraculously evaporated .
In this forgotten moment , we even heard hopeful mutterings about a “ peace dividend ” that would take all the extra military money that obviously was no longer needed to defend against a missing superpower and use it to rebuild America .
A mighty country , soon to be termed a “ hyperpower , ” straddling the globe alone and without obvious enemies — that should have been a formula for declaring victory ( as many Cold Warriors promptly did ) and acting accordingly ( which none of them did ) .
It should have been the moment for the Long Peace .
But in an enemy - less world , there was a small problem called the Pentagon ( and the vast military - industrial complex that had grown up around it ) .
So , while the peace - dividend - that - never - was vanished in the post - Cold - War morning fog , some new , prefab enemies did make their appearances with startling speed .
They essentially had to .
These new dangers to our country were termed “ rogue states , ” an obvious step or two down from a single Evil Empire .
They were , in fact , so relatively weak militarily that you needed to pile them up into a conceptual heap to get an enemy that would keep an empire and its global network of bases in military restocking mode .
Not too many years down the line , the Bush administration would indeed pile three of them up in just this way into the gloriously labeled “ axis of evil ” ; this was that old Evil Empire rejiggered for midget powers ( or alternatively the Axis powers of World War II shrunk to Mini - Me standards ) .
Back in 1990 , Saddam Hussein , our former ally in a Persian Gulf struggle with Iran for regional supremacy , invaded Kuwait and , voil ! , you had the first Gulf War .
His military , already weakened by its eight - year bloodletting with Iran , was not exactly a goliath for a superpower to reckon with ; but Americans took a tip from the dictator ( who liked to see images of himself puffed to gigantic proportions everywhere in his land ) , blew his face was up to Hitlerian size , and stuck it on every magazine and in every TV news report in town ( “ Showdown with Saddam ” ) .
His genuinely evil - dictator face took the place of a whole nuclear - armed Evil Empire , while American troops slaughtered helpless Iraqi conscripts , burying them alive in their own trenches or wiping them out from the air on the aptly named “ Highway of Death ” out of Kuwait City .
Not so long after , in 1992 , under the aegis of then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney , a small group of unknown Defense Department staffers — Paul Wolfowitz , I. Lewis Libby , and Zalmay Khalilzad — unveiled a new draft Defense Planning Guidance , a document for developing military strategy and planning Pentagon budgets .
It was the first such since the Cold War ended and , leaked to the New York Times , it was denounced as an extremist vision and buried .
As the website Right Web describes it , the document “ called for massive increases in defense spending , the assertion of lone superpower status , the prevention of the emergence of any regional competitors , the use of preventive — or preemptive — force , and the idea of forsaking multilateralism if it did n’t suit U.S. interests . ”
Sound familiar ?
No wonder .
It was the very imperial program for eternal American dominance and endless war against the planet ’s rogue states that George W. Bush ’s administration would officially adopt .
By then , Wolfowitz was the number two man at the Pentagon ; Libby , the Vice President ’s good right hand ; and Khalilzad was the new , post- invasion U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan .
In a post -9/11 atmosphere of belligerent fear , their program went mainstream .
Having been attacked not by a rogue state but by a squad of 19 terrorists pledging allegiance to a stateless terrorist organization , we were “ at war ” with evil itself .
By 2002 , the administration had conducted a “ successful ” war in Afghanistan ; the Taliban had been crushed ; Osama bin Laden was MIA ; and the neocons were riding high .
The rest of us found ourselves in a Global War on Terror , or the Long War , or World War III , or even World War IV or whatever our rulers chose to call it that week .
( As we would learn in Iraq , counting was not one of their skills . )
Dazzled beyond any reasonable imperial sense by the power to dominant that they believed American military superiority gave them , top Bush administration officials essentially proclaimed the U.S. an empire by fiat , a superduperpower the likes of which the world had never seen .
In their infamous 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States of America ( essentially the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance document recycled ) , they swore that we would remain so forever and feed the Pentagon so much money that it would be bulked up into the distant future to suppress any potential superpower or bloc of powers that might emerge .
They insisted that we would go our own way , strike whomever we pleased , torture anyone we wished , and jail without recourse anyone we cared to sweep up or kidnap anywhere on Earth .
The rest of the world could either approve or be damned , but it would be full speed ahead for us .
Their acolytes in right - wing think tanks and lobbying outfits around Washington , along with Washington ’s assembled punditry ( and some liberal tag - alongs ) declared the world on the verge of a Pax Americana and this nation the globe ’s New Rome .
In the meantime , domestically , Karl Rove and his pals were working to ensure that the Republican Party would be dominant against all challengers for a generation or more .
This was to be a domestic version of “ full spectrum dominance . ”
The two — the global Pax Americana and the Party ’s Pax Republicana seemed joined at the hip back then , each reinforcing the unilateral , do n’t - tread - on - me , I ’ll - do - anything - I - wish dominance of the other .
It was Rovian Abramoffism at home and Cheney - izing Wolfowitzism abroad .
How deeply they misunderstood the nature of power in our world , and how thoroughly they miscalculated the limited nature of the power of the New Rome !
If you want to take the measure of how far we ’ve come since then , consider the spectacle of this last election season .
Take Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist .
Like the President , deep into this September he was still excoriating the Democrats not just for their positions on the Iraq War , but for their “ surrender ” policies in the war on terror .
As he put it in a PBS interview with Jim Lehrer on September 14th :
“ I ’d say , u2018 Wake up , Harry Reid .
Wake up , Harry Reid … ’
I think that [ the president ] has got it right , that we ’re not going to do what Harry Reid wants to do , and that is surrender , to wave a white flag , to cut and run at a time when we ’re being threatened … as we all saw just three or four weeks ago , in a plot from Britain that was going to send 10 airplanes over here . ”
He then characterized the Democratic Party as a group “ who basically belittle in many ways this war on terror , who do want to wave this white flag and surrender . ”
By late October , however , according to Washington Post reporters Peter Slevin and Michael Powell , Frist had fully grasped that the global and domestic programs of dominance no longer were working together .
So he offered the following succinct advice — a flip - flop of the first order — to congressional candidates :
“ The challenge is to get Americans to focus on pocketbook issues , and not on the Iraq and terror issue . ”
Just another “ milestone ” on the path to … well , that ’s the question , is n’t it ?
Oil Wars
After September 11 , 2001 , the President and his advisors were determined to run an invasion of , and war against , Iraq that would be the anti-Vietnam conflict of all time .
From the draft to the body count , they were going to reverse all our Vietnam “ mistakes . ”
Above all , they were going to win quickly and decisively .
The result ?
In no time at all , they had brought us deep into the Iraqi “ big muddy ” ( as the Vietnam - era phrase went ) .
Now , looming in the distance — think of it as the dark at the end of this particular horror - fest of a tunnel — is the worst Vietnam nightmare of all : defeat .
Just check Juan Cole ’s Informed Comment website , for his “ Top Ten Ways We Know We Have Lost in Iraq , ” if you do n’t believe me .
Unlike in Indochina , however , this time there ’s something essential at stake .
Whatever we were doing in the largely peasant land of Vietnam , in terms of global wealth and resources , it was just what Henry Kissinger and other frustrated U.S. policy - makers of that era always called it , a third - or fourth - rate power of no real value to anyone ( other , of course , than its own inhabitants ) .
In Iraq , where a continuing American presence only ensures a deeper plunge into chaos , mayhem , blood , and horror as well as fragmentation and potential dissolution , departure nonetheless remains largely inconceivable .
After all , Iraq has something everyone desperately values : Oil .
In quantity .
A “ sea ” of oil in the words of former Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz .
In a backhanded way , the President has finally acknowledged the obvious — that his war in Iraq was , in significant part , an oil invasion , an oil occupation ( remember it was only the Oil Ministry that we guarded in otherwise looted Baghdad ) , and so is also bound to be an oil defeat .
As energy - obsessed Bush administration planners saw it , Iraq was to be the lynchpin — hence those permanent bases that were on the drawing boards as American troops invaded — of a Bush administration strategy for dominating the oil heartlands of the planet .
After Vietnam , the United States proved quite capable of putting itself back together ( despite years of fierce culture wars ) .
After Iraq — and keep in mind that we undoubtedly have at least a couple of years of horror to go — the question is whether the world will be similarly capable or whether the oil lands of the planet will lie in ruins along with the global economy .
Extremity on Display
So , just past the midterm election mark of 2006 , what ’s left of the New Rome ?
You could say that George W. Bush ’s dark success story has involved bringing his version of the United States into line with the look of the “ rogue ” enemies and terrorist groups he set out to destroy .
By the time Americans went to the polls on November 7th , 2006 to repudiate his policies , he had given our country the ultimate in makeovers , creating the look of an Outlaw Empire .
We now have our own killing fields in Iraq where , the latest casualty study tells us , somewhere between 400,000 and 900,000 - plus “ excess Iraqi deaths ” have occurred since the 2003 invasion .
And do you remember Saddam ’s “ torture chambers ” ( which the President used to cite all the time ) ?
Now , we are the possessors of our own global prison system , our own ( rented , borrowed , or jerry - rigged ) torture chambers , our own leased airline to transport kidnapped prisoners around the planet , and a Vice President who has openly lobbied Congress for a torture exemption for the CIA and spoke glibly on the radio about “ dunking ” people in water .
And , thanks to a supine Congress , we have the laws to go with it all .
The administration went after the right to torture or treat captives any way its agents pleased in places not open to any kind of oversight remarkably quickly after the September 11th attacks .
By late 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld ’s office was instructing agents in the field in Afghanistan to “ take the gloves off ” with a captive .
( Inside the CIA , as Ron Suskind has told us in his book The One Percent Doctrine , Director George Tenet was talking even more vividly about removing “ the shackles ” on the Agency . )
Inside the White House Counsel ’s office and the Justice Department , administration lawyers were already hauling out their dictionaries to figure out how to redefine “ torture ” out of existence .
But why such an emphasis on torture ( which is largely useless in the field , as everyone knows ) ?
What administration officials grasped , I believe , is this :
If you could manage to get the right to legally employ extreme ( and normally repugnant ) acts of torture , then you would have in your possession the right to do anything .
Think of the urge to abuse as the initial extreme expression of this administration ’s secret obsession with the creation of a “ wartime ” commander - in - chief presidency which would leave Congress and the courts in the dust .
If you want to measure where this has taken Bush officialdom in five years , consider their latest legal defensive measure .
According to the Washington Post , the administration has just gone to court to declare American “ alternative interrogation techniques ” — which simply means “ torture ” — as “ among the nation ’s most sensitive national security secrets . ”
It is trying to get a federal judge to bar “ terrorism suspects held in secret CIA prisons ” from even revealing to their own lawyers details about what was done to them by American interrogators .
In other words , torture is now to be put in the secrecy vault like a national treasure .
Next thing you know , we ’ll be sending it to the Smithsonian .
Reflected in this desperate maneuver , you can catch a glimpse of an administration driven to the extremity of going to courts it despised — and thought it had cut out of the process of foreign imperial governance — simply to bury its own extreme misdeeds .
You can feel the fear of the docket ( and perhaps of history ) in such a stance .
Another example of the extremity into which this administration has driven itself and the rest of us lies in an editorial published in the four main ( officially private ) military magazines , the Army Times , Air Force Times , Navy Times , and Marine Corps Times , on the very eve of the midterm elections .
It called for Donald Rumsfeld ’s resignation just after the President had given him his vote of confidence once again .
Realistically speaking , this can only be seen as an extreme military intervention in the American electoral process .
In so many ways , the American Constitutional system has been shredded and this — whether we are to be an outlaw empire ( and a failing one at that ) — is what Americans were voting about this last Tuesday ( though it was called “ Iraq ” ) .
The Wave
The history of recent American politics at the polls might be seen this way :
Not so long after he declared the successful completion of his Iraqi dreams , George W. Bush found himself , to the surprise of his top advisors and supporters , hounded by Iraq ’s Sunni insurgency .
He essentially raced not John Kerry ( who recently offered yet another example of his special lack of dexterity on the campaign trail ) but that insurgency to the finish line in November 2004 .
With a little help from his friends in Ohio and the Rove smear - and - turnout operation , he managed to squeak by .
Then , in another of those milestone moments on the way to disaster , he declared that he had “ political capital ” to spare and would spend it .
The next summer , two storms hit the endlessly vacationing President in Crawford , Texas — Hurricanes Cindy and Katrina .
Cindy
Sheehan tore away the bloodless look of casualty - lessness in Iraq ( where body counts , body bags , and the return of the dead to these shores was being hidden away from both cameras and attention ) .
She gave a mother ’s face to a son ’s death and to a nation ’s increasing frustration .
Katrina revealed to many Americans that the Bush administration had been creating Iraq - like conditions in the “ homeland . ”
And that was more or less that .
The President ’s approval rating plunged under 40 % and has ( a few momentary blips aside ) bounced around between there and the low 30s ever since .
By election 2006 , presidential “ capital ” was a concept long consigned to the dustbin of history .
Imagine where that “ capital ” will be by 2008 .
Our President has been wedded to his war of choice in a way unimaginable since Lyndon Baines Johnson quit the presidential race after the Tet Offensive in 1968 .
Based on what ’s happened so far , there ’s every reason to believe that , in 2008 , he will still be wedded to it ( as would potential Presidential candidate Sen. John McCain ) and his approval ratings may be bouncing in the 20 % - 30 % range by then .
So what part of the 2001 dream team and its “ vision ” of the world are we left with ?
To answer this , you first have to realize that yesterday ’s electoral “ wave ” of repudiation is hardly an American phenomenon .
It ’s global and , if anything , we were way late into the water .
All you have to do is look at the latest polling figures ( which are but extensions of previous , similar polls ) to see that wave in country after country .
The most recent international survey of opinion — in Britain , Canada , Israel , and Mexico — found that Bush ’s America is viewed as “ a threat to world peace by its closest neighbors and allies . ”
In Britain , the land of the “ special relationship , ” only Osama bin Laden outranks our President as a global “ danger to peace . ”
While he comes in a dozen points behind bin Laden , he does manage to best Kim Jong Il , North Korea ’s grim leader , as well as those shining stars of the diplomatic firmament , the President of Iran and the leader of Hezbollah .
And these are the countries most likely to have positive views of the U.S .
As hectorer - in- chief , George W. Bush has , hands down , used the word “ must ” more than any combination of presidents in our history .
Only recently , he repeatedly told the North Koreans that they must not develop ( and then test ) nuclear weapons ; he told the Iranians that they must halt their nuclear program ; and his minions told the Nicaraguans that they must not vote for former Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega .
The results : The North Koreans tested a weapon ; the Iranians went right on enriching uranium ; and the Nicaraguans , poverty - stricken and threatened with nothing short of economic ruin if their democratic vote went into the wrong column , simply ignored him .
All these decisions were based on assessments of the limits of power that had been revealed by the desperate acts of a failing empire stretched to its military and economic limits .
If these are the “ rogue ” parts of the global wave , all you have to do is look at Russia ’s reassertion of interest and power in its old energy - rich Central Asian bailiwick ( much coveted by the Bush administration ) ; or the expansion of Chinese economic power in Southeast Asia and energy power in Africa to see other aspects of the global wave of reassessment under way .
In fact , the global part of the election was long over by November 7 , 2006 .
For vast majorities abroad , the vision of the U.S. as an Outlaw Empire is nothing new at all .
The wave here has perhaps only begun to rise , but here too those presidential “ musts ” ( along with the President ’s designation of the Democrats as little short of “ enemy noncombatants ” ) have begun to lose their effect .
Hence the presidential plebiscite of yesterday .
No matter what else flows from it , the fact that it happened is of real significance .
A majority of the American people — those who voted anyway — did not ratify Bush ’s Outlaw Empire .
They took a modest step toward sanity .
But what will follow ?
Here , briefly , are five “ benchmark ” questions to ask when considering the possibilities of the final two years of the Bush administration ’s wrecking - ball regime :
Will Iraq Go Away ?
The political maneuvering in Washington and Baghdad over the chaos in Iraq was only awaiting election results to intensify .
Desperate call - ups of more Reserves and National Guards will go out soon .
Negotiations with Sunni rebels , coup rumors against the Maliki government , various plans from James Baker ’s Iraq Study Group and Congressional others will undoubtedly be swirling .
Yesterday ’s plebiscite ( and exit polls ) held an Iraqi message .
It ca n’t simply be ignored .
But nothing will matter , when it comes to changing the situation for the better in that country , without a genuine commitment to American withdrawal , which is not likely to be forthcoming from this President and his advisors any time soon .
So expect Iraq to remain a horrifying , bloody , devolving fixture of the final two years of the Bush administration .
It will not go away .
Bush ( and Rove ) will surely try to enmesh Congressional Democrats in their disaster of a war .
Imagine how bad it could be if — with , potentially , years to go — the argument over who “ lost ” Iraq has already begun .
Is an Attack on Iran on the Agenda ?
Despite all the alarums on the political Internet about a pre-election air assault on Iran , this was never in the cards .
Even the hint of an attack on Iranian “ nuclear facilities ” ( which would certainly turn into an attempt to “ decapitate ” the Iranian regime from the air ) would send oil prices soaring .
The Republicans were never going to run an election on oil selling at $ 120 — $ 150 a barrel .
This will be no less true of election year 2008 .
If Iran is to be a target , 2007 will be the year .
So watch for the pressures to ratchet up on this one early in the New Year .
This is madness , of course .
Such an attack would almost certainly throw the Middle East into utter chaos , send oil prices through the roof , possibly wreck the global economy , cause serious damage in Iran , not fell the Iranian government , and put U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq in perilous danger .
Given the administration record , however , all this is practically an argument for launching such an attack .
( And do n’t count on the military to stop it , either .
They ’re unlikely to do so . )
Failing empires have certainly been known to lash out or , as neocon writer Robert Kagan put the matter recently in a Washington Post op - ed , “ Indeed , the preferred European scenario [ of a Democratic Congressional victory ] —
‘ Bush hobbled ’ — is less likely than the alternative : u2018 Bush unbound . ’
Neither the president nor his vice president is running for office in 2008 .
That is what usually prevents high - stakes foreign policy moves in the last two years of a president ’s term . ”
So when you think about Iran , think of Bush unbound .
Are the Democrats a Party ?
If Rovian plans for a Republican Party ensconced in Washington for eons to come now look to be in tatters , the Democrats have retaken the House ( and possibly the Senate ) largely as the not - GOP Party .
The election may leave the Republicans with a dead presidency and a leading candidate for 2008 wedded to possibly the least popular war in our history ; the Democrats may arrive victorious but without the genuine desire for a mandate to lead .
Unlike the Republicans , the Democrats in recent years were not , in any normal sense , a party at all .
They were perhaps a coalition of four or five or six parties ( some trailing hordes of pundits and consultants , but without a base ) .
Now , with the recruitment of so many ex-Republicans and conservatives into their House and Senate ranks , they may be a coalition of six or seven parties .
Who knows ?
They have a genuine mandate on Iraq and a mandate on oversight .
What they will actually do — what they are capable of doing ( other than the normal money , career , and earmark - trading in Washington ) — remains to be seen .
They will be weak , the surroundings fierce and strong .
Will We Be Ruled by the Facts on the Ground ?
In certain ways , it may hardly matter what happens to which party .
By now — and this perhaps represents another kind of triumph for the Bush administration — the facts on the ground are so powerful that it would be hard for any party to know where to begin .
Will we , for instance , ever be without a second Defense Department , the so - called Department of Homeland Security , now that a burgeoning $ 59 billion a year private “ security ” industry with all its interests and its herd of lobbyists in Washington has grown up around it ?
Not likely in any of our lifetimes .
Will an ascendant Democratic Party dare put on a diet the ravenous Pentagon , which now feeds off two budgets — its regular , near - half - trillion dollar Defense budget and a regularized series of multibillion dollar “ emergency ” supplemental appropriations , which are now part of life on the Hill .
What this means is that the defense budget is not what we wage our wars on or pay for a variety of black operations ( not to speak of earmarks galore ) with .
Do n’t bet your bottom dollar that this will get better any time soon either .
In fact , I have my doubts that a Democratic Congress with a Democratic president in tow could even do something modestly small like shutting down Guantanamo , no less begin to deal with the empire of bases that undergirds our failing Outlaw Empire abroad .
So , from time to time , take your eyes off what passes for politics and check out the facts on the ground .
That way you ’ll have a better sense of where our world is actually heading .
What Will Happen
When the Commander - in - Chief Presidency and the Unitary Executive Theory Meets What ’s Left of the Republic ?
The answer on this one is relatively uncomplicated and less than three months away from being in our faces ; it ’s the Mother of All Constitutional Crises .
But writing that now , and living with the reality then , are two quite different things .
So when the new Congress arrives in January , buckle your seatbelts and wait for the first requests for oversight information from some investigative committee ; wait for the first subpoenas to meet Cheney ’s men in some dark hallway .
Wait for this crew to feel the “ shackles ” and react .
Wait for this to hit the courts — even a Supreme Court that , despite the President ’s best efforts , is probably still at least one justice short when it comes to unitary - executive - theory supporters .
I would n’t even want to offer a prediction on this one .
But a year down the line , anything is possible .
So we ’ve finally had our plebiscite , however covert , on the failing Outlaw Empire of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
But what about their autocratic inclinations at home .
How will that play out ?
Will it be :
All hail , Caesar , we who are about to dive back into prime - time programming .
Or will it be :
All the political hail is about to pelt our junior caesars as we dive back into prime - time programming ?
Stay tuned .

It ’s good to see stars actually paying for their purchases in designer stores .
Gwyneth Paltrow was snapped the other day shopping with her RED American Express credit card at Prada .
The American Express RED has only launched in the UK and the American Express will donate a percentage of your yearly spend to Global Fund financed programs in Africa which helps support women and children affected by HIV / AIDS
It ’s amusing to see that Gwyneth walks out of Prada flashing the credit card thoughâ€¦ staged much ?
Though it isnâ€™t the only charity work she is doingâ€ ¦

There ’s been a lot of talk on the tech blogs about LG ’s Korean - only LP - 4100 Sobriety phone and the possibility it will roll out in the United States .
The phone has a built - in breathalyzer and is selling very well in Korea .
Indeed , given that between 15 and 30 % of all road deaths ( depending on your country ) involve drivers over the legal blood alcohol limits , and there ’s been so much kerfuffle since it was shown at CES in January , you ’d think it ’d be a certainty to debut shortly .
But apparently not .
LG emphasised when we asked that “ this phone will not be launching in the US this year , and at this time there are no plans to bring it over to the US at all .
The original article announcing this phone was incorrect . ”
We have previously tested a personal breathalyser and thoroughly recommend them as essential kit for anyone who consumes alcohol and then drives / rides , so obviously we ’re very keen on this idea , particularly for young people who are , according to the statistics , particularly at risk .
Strangely , in addition to the breathalyser , the cell phone is equipped with an advanced universal remote control feature and it is styled like a sports car .
There ’s also a 1.3 megapixel camera and an MP3 player .
Indeed , even LG Australia was quick to point out that it had no plans for distributing the phone , and Australians are at the extreme end of the drinking and driving scale .
Go figure ????

For letters section
Wednesday is my favorite day of the week , because I when my Geek in Review goes live , it means that I have between 18 and 24 hours before the slow panic of " what the hell am I going to write about next week ? " kicks in .
The panic for this week was rather severe and overwhelming , because it was n't until Monday night that I had any ideas at all .
Monday afternoon ,
Anne said to me , " I want Zankou Chicken tonight .
Do you think you can pick it up ? "
Zankou Chicken is the best chicken in the world , and as far as I know is only available in a few places in Los Angeles , including my local location in Pasadena , which happens to be next door to my Friendly Local Comic Shop .
" Of course I can pick it up , " I said , visions of a comic shopping spree swimming in my head .
She went to work , I went to Zankou Chicken , and I also went to the comic shop .
I bought my books , talked with the owner , and by the time I was in my car driving home , I had most of this week 's column written in my head .
In an increasingly globalized world where vertically - integrated multi-national companies storm into communities , reduce our choices and homogenize our shopping experience , the Friendly Local Shop is an endangered species , and it's not just comic and book shops that are at risk .
While you may be able to save a few bucks on a CD at Target , if you have a Friendly Local Music Shop and go there instead , the owner may see you picking up Interpol , and suggest Joy Division .
They may see you picking up The Red Hot Chili Peppers , and throw themselves between you and the register , just to save you from yourself .
While you may be able to get 10 % off if you use your preferred customer card at the bookstore in the mall , is cranky manager guy going to take the time to talk with you , and suggest a graphic novel you may have missed , like Kinetic ?
While you may be able to save a few bucks on the latest d20 source book in that same bookstore ( if they stock it , that is ) do n't count on stumbling across any new games , like the boxed version of Kill Doctor Lucky , or High School Drama .
And I can guarantee you that the bookstore in the mall wo n't stay open late because the owner really wants to do a Shadowrun one - off , and will provide pizza and Mountain Dew for any players who show up this Friday at 7 .
I love my Friendly Local Comic Shop as much as I 've always loved my Friendly Local Game Shop , and I would hate it if they were forced out of business .
In fact , I believe that in most communities , they are load bearing pillars of their respective cultures , and if we allow them to be overwhelmed and wiped out by big box stores or national chains , the next generation of geeks will be in serious trouble .
So my column this week is about why we all need to work hard to Save the Friendly Local Game / Comic / Music shops , and why it 's in our best interests to do it :
The Geekwire is asas its ever been ( thank you , SG Corporate Overlords ! ) so you can read it today with confidence .
If you like it , I 'd be ever - so - grateful if you 'd vote it up at Netscape .
( Do n't waste your time with Digg ; the bury - brigade as targeted me with their sock puppet army , so all of my stories get disappeared rather quickly .
Good times .
Good times . )
There comes a moment in the life of every sitcom where a desperately uncool father tries to act hip around his children 's friends .
The results , disastrous as they always are , should have given the UK government pause as it contemplated its own attempt at hipness — putting some videos on YouTube .
The clips were uploaded by the Central Office of Information under the username " publicservice " and dealt with such YouTube - appropriate topics as " transformational government " and " sharing the leadership challenge . "
While a commendable attempt to get the word out about government plans to " save money by consolidating service departments , " the videos did n't impress the Guardian 's Charles Arthur .
" Bluntly ?
Six minutes is far too long , " he wrote last week .
" The videos are n't paced for the youth market that YouTube really hits .
If the Cabinet Office does want to see how its videos ought to look , it should offer the raw footage for video mashup artists to work with , and laugh when they mock it , which they will . "
Actually , people are already mocking the COI , which was was forced to pull the videos soon after posting them because it turned out not to own the rights for online distribution of the clips .
YouTube is n't just a good place to embarrass the British government , though .
The US government is also feeling some heat after a Lockheed Martin engineer posted a 10 - minute video designed to blow the whistle on security and safety problems with the Coast Guard 's Deepwater system .
Michael De Kort uploaded the video when he believed that he had no other options for making his concerns public .
" My thought was , ' What could I do that would be novel enough that it draws attention to itself , and through drawing attention to itself , something gets done ? ' "
De Kort explained to the Washington Post .
De Kort was laid off a few days after posting the video , though Lockheed Martin said that job cuts have been coming for some time , and that De Kort was aware that his position would be affected .
A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman , which jointly run the project , said , " Anybody with a webcam and something to say , regardless of whether it's true or not , can say it on YouTube " — and she 's right ( just think of the recent faux - amateur political attempt at smearing Al Gore with a YouTube video ) .
YouTube and similar sites provide a great way to get around the " filter " of the traditional media , but the filter does exist for a good reason .
When it 's working correctly , it sifts out the chaff , presenting only stories that have been vetted for real merit ( when it 's not working correctly , articles about a guy who apparently did nothing to JonBenet Ramsey dominate the front page of CNN.com , while the Iranian president 's debate challenge to President Bush gets pushed to the side ) .
But YouTube at least provides a way for people to make their message available , after which it can be checked out by others .
That 's what happened in this case , as the lead Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee in the House has asked for more answers from the Coast Guard on De Kort 's allegations .
I ’m all fired up after two days of the most amazing work bringing together some very remarkable people to talk about a TSF strategy to ensure that we can give the next generation excellent analytical skills despite the global collapse in the supply of maths teaching capacity .
The headliners were :
Alan Kay of the Squeak project and Squeakland educational software platform ,
Guido van Rossum of Python fame ,
James Dalziel of the LAMS project , IMO the “ next big thing ” in the e-education space ,
Zelda Holtzman , CEO of the Shuttleworth Foundation
There were about 15 of us , covering several programming environments ( scheme , smalltalk / squeak , python , logo ) and a variety of educational frameworks ( UK , South Africa , participants from France , Switzerland , Netherlands , USA … ) .
The idea was to bring together people who potentially have the ability to shape up a framework that can take off like wildfire .
The risk was that , with so many strong opinions from different backgrounds , we would not be able to make progress .
Suffice it to say that after two days in the bunker , I think we did brilliantly !
I saw real bridges being built between Alan and Guido , two great men who ’s collaboration might give us the tools to teach logic from the earliest days of education ( think of 5 year - olds writing code visually ) through to high level instruction ( we all know how effective Python is for university type problems , right ? ) .
Instead of fighting over turf or syntax , I sensed a genuine willingness to synthesize the best work from both camps into something that could have both Python ’s pop-culture widespread appeal , and pedagogical foundations that build on years of Alan ’s experience in the Squeak world .
The mouse might yet become the snake ’s strongest ally .
We also heard from people who help to shape educatonal policy in the UK , South Africa and elsewhere , and I was even more convinced that the problems we want to solve through this initiative are universal , even though the crisis is most evident in countries like South Africa .
So I hope we can mobilise a global response , and if you have access to global agencies interested in education then please put them in touch with Helen King , who coordinates the international work of TSF .
What ’s this all about ?
The big picture is that I believe we should be building an analytical skills curriculum that is post - mathematical .
Mathematics is a beautiful but abstract art , that has traditionall been the vehicle for the development of analytical capacity in young minds , but has equally traditionally been seen as dry and difficult .
We need to teach mathematics NOT because people should become mathematicians ( I could not pass my first year maths exam tomorrow though I did reasonably well at the time ) but rather people we want society in general to have the ability to apply known tools and patterns to solve the problems it encounters .
That ’s what learning maths gives us during our formative years .
So what could replace traditional mathematics instruction ?
Why , software engineering – but not the way it is taught today .
We do n’t want to produce a society of software engineers any more than we used to want to produce a society of mathematicians .
We want to produce a society that knows how to :
Learn a set of tools quickly and efficiently .
In life , the set of tools we apply to the problems we face changes every few years .
So it ’s not the specific SET of tools you learn , its the ability to grok a new toolset , figure out when to use , and do so efficiently that counts .
Break problems into simpler pieces , solve them using familiar tools .
The whole process of analysis is about taking a big hairy problem that is new and unfamiliar , and teasing it into pieces that look solvable based on tools that you already know .
Put those simpler answers back together to make an answer to the big problem .
This is the synthesis part – taking the results of your analysis and making them meaningful in the real world .
Anyway , the traditional way to teach these life skills has been to drill kids in mathematics .
That was always quite a tough sell .
Nowadays , its a tough sell in the face of even tougher competition for learner mental bandwidth from cell phones , MTV , instant messaging and the myriad other bling - bling commercials desperate to get your attention when you are 12 and about to get your first credit card .
So we need something that is sexy , exciting , challenging , and interesting .
I ’m pretty convinced that basic technology is becoming pervasive , so by the time our R&D here bears fruit it ’s reasonable to expect that most kids even in developing countries have access to technology , whether that looks like a $ 100 laptop or a TuxLab ( another awesome TSF project ) .
And kids LOVE technology .
They love the games , they love the puzzles , they love figuring out how to make those darn machines do what they want .
This initiative , then , is about figuring out how to build a curriculum that will produce generations that can do the 1 , 2 , 3 above NOT because they learned mathematics , but because they explored the world of technology .

Both comments and pings are currently closed .
Hamas accepts the existence of the state of Israel but will not officially recognise it until the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , according to the group 's leader in Damascus , Khaled Meshaal .
In comments made to Reuters , Mr Meshaal softened his anti-Israel rhetoric , suggesting that Hamas does not seek the destruction of Israel as written in the group 's charter .
He said that Israel is a " reality " and " there will remain a state called Israel , this is a matter of fact " .
" The problem is not that there is an entity called Israel .
The problem is that the Palestinian state does not exist , " he said .
Israel and the international community have demanded that the Hamas government recognise Israel as a prerequisite to receiving tax revenues and international funding .
Its refusal to do so has led to Palestinian Authority employees receiving little or no wages for almost a year and a severe depression in the Palestinian economy .
Mr Meshaal , who Israel tried to assassinate in 1997 by injecting poison into his ear , is seen as a hardliner who has used his influence in the last year to move Hamas from a political direction to greater confrontation with Israel .
He was seen as the driving force behind the Hamas - led attack on Israeli positions near Gaza in June last year , which led to the capture of the Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit and a full scale confrontation with Israel .
Because Mr Meshaal is the conduit for much of Hamas 's finances , he is able to exert a major influence on the armed wing of the group , which diverged from the political wing led by Ismail Haniyeh , the Palestinian prime minister .
Palestinian observers have long suspected that Mr Meshaal , who has never set foot in Gaza or the West Bank , is a pragmatist whose ultimate aim is to lead the Palestinian Liberation Organisation .
Hamas is not currently a member of the PLO but as the dominant political force in the Palestinian territories , it is only a matter of time and negotiation before it takes its place .
The PLO is dominated by Fatah and leftist groups who were powerful in the 1960s and 1970s but whose influence has waned .
The current head is Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president who took over after the death of Yasser Arafat .
Mr Meshaal 's comments are far from the rhetoric of the Hamas charter , which was published in 1988 .
In the pre-amble , the charter notes that " Israel will rise and will remain erect until Islam eliminates it as it has eliminated its predecessors " .
But speaking in Damascus , Mr Meshaal said : " As a Palestinian today I speak of a Palestinian and Arab demand for a state on 1967 borders .
It is true that in reality there will be an entity or state called Israel on the rest of Palestinian land . "
Mr Meshaal 's comments caused some surprise among Hamas officials in Gaza , although they were quick to point out there was little substantial divergence from other statements by the group .
Ahmed Yusuf , an advisor to Mr Haniyeh , said that Hamas recognised Israel 's de facto existence but was not going to recognise it officially .
" Israel is there , it is part of the United Nations and we do not deny its existence .
But we still have rights and land there which have been usurped and until these matters are dealt with we will withhold our recognition , " he said .
Obscure Idiocracy is both bold and smart Filmmaker Mike Judge strikes again

Mike Judge always can take heart in Office Space .
His last film as a director flopped in theaters before becoming a huge hit on video and cable .
So maybe there 's hope for his widely ignored Idiocracy , due on DVD Jan .
9 .
Starring Luke Wilson , Idiocracy did n't just flop in theaters last fall .
It barely played theaters at all .
Dumped by its studio after a year on the shelf , it opened with no fanfare — in fact , no ads — and did dismal business , though the few critics who saw it generally raved .
And well they should have .
Idiocracy is a savage sci- fi satire on today 's deplorable dumbing - down of American culture .
Taking a cue from Woody Allen 's Sleeper , it sends an average guy named Joe ( Wilson ) 500 years into the future via a suspended - animation experiment .
He turns out to be the smartest man alive .
The reasons are established in a hilarious intro , showing how an intelligent couple never manage to reproduce , while a low - IQ doofus launches a tidal wave of equally stupid offspring .
And lo , the dumb did inherit the Earth .
Joe 's adventures include a stint on the staff of a chaotic White House and a campaign to save crops by the radical concept of using water on them .
Of course , not everyone may appreciate all this .
It 's OK to laugh with smug superiority at the idiots in Dumb & Dumber .
But when the dummies are us , well that 's tough , as the creators of Josie & the Pussycats learned when they railed against the gullibility of the same pop consumers they courted as ticket buyers .
Bottom line : Despite some cheesy effects and an uneven laugh quotient , Idiocracy has its heart — and its brain — in the right place .
Of course , as creator of Beavis & Butt - head , Judge may be responsible for some of the same dumbing - down he attacks .
But those cartoon characters were n't role models — just outrageous losers .
Besides , give him props for creating yet another Austin - made movie with an elaborate fantasy world that could be set anywhere .
Granted , Idiocracy is n't as sophisticated as Richard Linklater 's A Scanner Darkly or Robert Rodriguez 's Sin City , but it 's just as nervy and boldly creative .
America may be getting dumber , but filmmakers in Texas ' capital city are looking smarter than those in Hollywood .
The Illusionist
No need to wait for The Prestigeto reach DVD Feb. 20 .
You can see a far better spin on similar material with The Illusionist .
Both films involve acclaimed magicians enthralling European audiences in the early 1900s , but similarities end there .
As a haunting romantic thriller with strong performances and an intriguing plot , The Illusionist is rewarding entertainment .
Edward Norton plays the titular magician , whose popularity perturbs a power - mad Austrian prince ( Rufus Sewell ) .
Police chief Paul Giamatti gets the dirty work of bringing Norton down , and that becomes more vital when Norton comes between the prince and his paramour ( Jessica Biel ) .
Shot in Prague but set in Vienna , The Illusionist is rich in period detail and keeps the viewer guessing until its final scene .
Like its lead character , the movie makes magic .

The science of sleep is one of the biggest mysteries in the world .
If you think about it , sleep is kind of like a preview of death – no one can fully describe the experience .
Although sleep research is a fairly new field , its findings have helped us understand this phenomenon more .
Take a closer look at what happens to your body through these sleep facts .
Quick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts
You spend ⅓ of your life sleeping .
The average person dreams 4 - 6 times per night .
About 50 - 70 million US adults suffer sleep disorders .
Adults need 7 - 8 hours of sleep per night to function properly .
There are 5 stages of sleep .
The sleep cycle has 2 different types : non-Rapid Eye Movement ( non-REM ) and Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ) sleep .
Non-REM sleep lasts 4 stages .
REM is the last stage of sleep and is also known as the dreaming stage .
Humans secrete growth hormones during slow - wave sleep .
Sleep is essential because it replenishes the muscular , skeletal , nervous , and immune systems .
Sleep increases a person ’s sensory threshold , making them less respondent to stimuli .
Sleep disorders are divided into 2 types .
Parasomnias are sleeping disorders that involve abnormal movements or behaviors such as sleepwalking .
Dyssomnias are characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep , as well as oversleeping .
In 1913 , Henri Pieron published “ Le probleme physiologique du sommeil , ” which was the first book to examine sleep physiologically .
Humans forget 95 - 99 % of their dreams by morning .
Babies need to sleep 12 - 16 hours per day .

Sleep cleanses your brain .
When we sleep , cerebrospinal fluid flushes through the brain to wash away the day ’s worth of harmful , excess proteins and toxins .
Think about that on your next Netflix binge .
Talking in your sleep is known as somniloquy .
Sleep talking is scientifically known as somniloquy .
Much like sleepwalking and sleep paralysis , it is a parasomnia .
It ’s not really a serious condition , but it can be treated and avoided .

Light affects your sleeping habits .
Our body clock is also known as Circadian rhythm .
This internal clock primarily responds to light cues .
It creates more melatonin at night , and less when it senses light in the morning .
Thus , exposure to light late at night and dark environments in the morning can throw off a person ’s circadian rhythm .
Because of the reversed cues , the body tends to reverse the melanin production needed to sleep .
There ’s one for sleep facts that ’ll explain your messed - up body clock .
The fear of sleep is called somniphobia .
Somniphobia or hypnophobia refers to the irrational fear and severe panic towards falling asleep and dreaming .
Usually , a person develops somniphobia due to post - traumatic stress .
However , this phobia may also develop in people who have associated traumatic experiences with sleeping .
The sudden feeling of falling while you sleep is called a myoclonic jerk .
It sounds more like an insult , but I ’m sure we ’ve all experienced being startled awake by a falling sensation .
Scientifically , there is still no explanation for why we get myoclonic jerks .
However , anxiety , caffeine and physical activity close to bedtime makes a myoclonic jerk more likely .
They are also more frequent in younger people .
A snail can sleep for three years .
Aside from their shocking number of teeth , these small critters have some more astonishing tricks up their sleeve .
Nap time for a snail can last from a few hours up to 3 years .
The University of Chicago conducted the first ever sleep study .
In 1925 , Nathaniel Kleitman opened the world ’s first sleep laboratory at the University of Chicago .
Dubbed the Father of American Sleep Research , Dr. Kleitman eventually discovered rapid eye movement ( REM ) with his student , Dr. Eugene Aserinsky .
Now , sleep studies are known as polysomnography .
These sleep studies record a patient ’s vitals and brain waves throughout their slumber , and are used to diagnose sleep disorders .
In Japan , napping at work is honorable .
In Japan , napping at your job is seen as a sign of diligence — you worked so much to the point of exhaustion .
The Japanese call it inemuri , which translates to “ present while sleeping . ”

Cats spend ⅔ of their lives asleep .
People have a love - hate relationship with cats .
It ’s somewhat understandable , since cats tend to be the exact opposite of the warm , eager demeanor loved by many in dogs .
Another stark difference is that cats spend a lot of time asleep .
Like , a 15 - hour average kind of a lot .
Now , why do cats sleep so much ?
Cats sleep for a majority of the day because they are crepuscular creatures .
This means that they are only active during twilight and doze off for the rest of the day .
Sleep deprivation can have the same effects as alcohol .
Putting off sleep for 16 hours can make you act like a person with the blood alcohol level of .05 % .
Sleep masks trick our body clocks .
Wearing sleep masks obstructs light from our senses , which aids in the production of enough melatonin to fall asleep .
Before the 1800s , people slept in batches .
Before , people had a “ first ” and “ second sleep . ”
Towards the evening , they would sleep for 3 - 4 hours , wake for 2 - 3 hours to do some activities , then go back to sleep until morning .
Sleep is a constant cycle .
Although we say that we “ slept through the night , ” sleep is n’t a stagnant process .
instead , you cycle through the stages of sleep throughout the night in 90 - minute intervals .
People do n’t sneeze in their sleep .
While asleep , humans are actually more prone to sneezing because the mucous membranes swell when lying down .
However , the brain shuts down the neuroreceptors that stimulate our sneezing reflex .
That way , only very strong stimuli can wake one to sneeze .

People born blind often have difficulty falling asleep .
For people with no way to perceive light , their circadian rhythm ( internal clock ) is unable to distinguish a day and night cycle .
The U.S. celebrates National Nap Day on March 9th .
Boston University professor William Anthony Ph.D created National Nap Day with his wife Camille Anthony in 1999 .
The couple established this holiday to promote sufficient sleeping habits .
It ’s set after daylight savings , since people are most tired after the hour changes .
Lack of sleep costs the U.S. over $ 411 Billion per year .
According to a study , sleep deprivation in the U.S. workforce costs $ 411 billion in productivity .
Overall , the resulting lack of productivity shaves 1.2 million working days annually .
Hawaii has the shortest sleep duration of all U.S. states .
With only 54 % of its population getting the recommended sleep duration , Hawaii ranks first in the most sleep - deprived U.S. states .
Meanwhile , South Dakota has the highest proportion of adequate sleepers at 72 % of its population .
There ’s one for sleep facts you did n’t expect .
The best sleep music matches a person ’s BPM while falling asleep .
A Hong Kong study found that participants who listened to music 30 - 45 minutes before bedtime had better sleeping conditions .
Over a course of 3 months , the participants fell asleep quicker , slept deeper , and felt better in the morning .
The magic trick lies in the selected songs ’
BPM , which all ranged from 60 - 80 BPM .
This range emulates the average person ’s heart rate as they fall asleep .
Now that ’s one for sleep facts you ’d want to try yourself .
The world record for the longest period without sleep is 11 days .
Californian student Randy Gardner set the world record for the longest time without sleep in 1964 at approximately 264 hours .
However , health specialists highly discourage from attempting this .
Within 3 to 4 days without sleep , you may start having hallucinations .
Sleep is a biological function for a reason – it is not advisable to pull all - nighters all the time .

Insects sleep , too .
Most insects only stay active during the day or nighttime .
Once insects rest , they enter a state called torpor .
It ’s not exactly how sleep is for humans , but it ’s similar in the way that it lessens response to minor stimuli .
Sleeping on your stomach can help with digestion .
Sleeping in a “ freefall ” position has been linked to lessening heartburn .
How ’s that for cool sleep facts ?
Humans are the only mammals that willingly delay sleep .
Every other mammal in the animal kingdom will succumb to sleep once they feel exhausted .
However , humans can “ fight ” against sleep for a certain period .
Sleep deprivation kills faster than starvation .
The human body can go for three weeks without food , but the highest record for surviving days without sleep is currently 11 days .
Sleep deprivation impacts essential bodily processes that keep us alive .
In a way , it causes the body to “ shut down . ”
A 1989 sleep study conducted on rats showed that they succumbed to sepsis after 32 days of no sleep .
Whales and dolphins never fall asleep fully .
Instead , one half of their brain stays awake so they can still breathe through the surface .
High altitudes affect sleep .
The higher the altitude , the more it disrupts sleep .
Usually , sleep disturbance occurs at altitudes of 13,200 ft or more .
Experts point to reduced oxygen levels and altered air pressure as the main cause of sleep disturbances at these altitudes .
Acclimation to high altitudes usually takes two to three weeks .
Difficulty in getting up in the morning is a real condition called dysania .
Dysania is not fully recognized as a formal condition yet , medical professionals still acknowledge its occurrence .
This sleep disorder is typically associated with serious mental health conditions such as depression .
Not sleeping makes you hungry .
You know you ’re hungry when the stomach secretes a hormone called ghrelin that sends hunger signals to the brain .
Sleep deprivation causes larger production of ghrelin , which increases the chances of midnight snacking .
Changes in leptin levels also makes you more prone to binge eat .
Sleeping in public is totally cool in Japan .
Sleeping in public is a norm in Japan .
You are extremely unlikely to get robbed if you fall asleep in public , since it ’s already a part of everyone ’s culture .
Chickens dream .
Chickens have been shown to experience the rapid eye movement ( REM ) cycle in their sleep .
A baby can cost new parents 750 hours of sleep .
For first - time parents , having a baby can remove 750 hours from their usual total sleeping hours for an entire year .
Watching TV burns more calories than sleeping .
But it ’s not by a lot .
Watching TV only burns 10 % more calories than sleep .
Bears do n’t poop during hibernation .
You might wonder , “ How do animals keep in their poop when they hibernate ? ”
Before an animal goes into hibernation , they will eat a lot to sustain them until they wake .
So , where does all the food go ?
Bears keep their food in by eating grass and twigs , creating a plug or stopper in their bowels .
With this stopper , they can sleep continuously without having to poop .
However , once they wake up , it all comes out .
Back in Medieval Times , bedrooms were n’t private .
Aside from absurd , ominous art , we can all agree that the Medieval Ages was a weird time .
During this period , beds were placed in areas where guests could see them .
Usually , beds would be placed by a window , so passersby can admire whoever is sleeping .
Sounds like something out of a thriller movie by today ’s standards .
Full moons have been linked to difficulty sleeping .
Even in sleep labs ’ windowless rooms that do n’t have environmental and time - based cues , full moons have been observed shortening and disturbing sleep cycles .
To this day , it remains unexplained by science .
Oversleeping is an actual disorder called hypersomnia .
For people who suffer from hypersomnia , oversleeping is actually a medical disorder .
A person with hypersomnia suffers extreme sleepiness throughout the day , regardless of napping .
Hypersomniacs also sleep for unusually long periods at night .
Around 8 % of people have reported ‘ sleep sex . ’
Sexsomnia is a phenomenon where two or more people have sex unconsciously .
There has yet to be a scientific explanation for sexsomnia , but experts suggest unfulfilled sexual frustration and dreams about sex as the usual culprits .
Regular exercise helps you sleep .
One of the sleep facts to consider in your daily routine : Exercising regularly has been proven to help with falling ( and staying ) asleep .
However , exercising erratically or immediately before bedtime can mess with your body clock .
Sleep improves your memory .
Sleep - deprived individuals have been shown to score lower on short - term memory tests compared to those who had a good night ’s sleep .
Definitely one of the sleep facts to remember .
Athletes need more sleep .
Due to heavier physical activity , athletes may need up to 10 hours of sleep to repair their muscles and replenish their energy .
Flat - faced dogs are prone to sleep apnea .
Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder characterized by periodic stops in breathing .
Snoring loudly and feeling exhausted after a night ’s sleep usually indicate sleep apnea .
Because of their facial structure , flat - faced dogs such as pugs and bulldogs are more prone to developing sleep apnea later in life .
Over 100 million people suffer from sleep apnea worldwide .
Sleep apnea often requires treatment at sleep centers .
For obstructive sleep apnea , doctors administer a continuous positive airway pressure device ( CPAP ) to the patient .
The CPAP is a mask fitted over the nose / mouth that gently blows air into the airway to keep it open during sleep .
Getting enough sleep can curb unhealthy eating habits .
Sufficient sleeping hours helps regulate the hormones that control your appetite .
If you get the right amount of sleep , you ’ll tend to eat fewer calories overall .
Dying in your sleep is an actual medical condition .
Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome ( SADS ) is the sudden , unexplained death of adolescents and adults in their sleep .
However scary that may seem , this condition is very rare .
You can sleep with your eyes open .
Although a person typically closes their eyes to hinder light , there are still some instances where a person can fall asleep with their eyes open .
The faces you see in your sleep are real .
The brain ca n’t create a made - up face for your dreams .
Technically , each person you see in your dreams is someone you ’ve already encountered in your waking life .
How ’s that for sleep facts ?
A person grows .3 inches while sleeping .
However , they will shrink down to normal once gravity pushes against their bones when they wake .
Our brains stay active when we sleep .
The ancient Greeks once believed that sleep is a completely passive process which shuts down the brain .
However , some parts of the brain work harder when we ’re asleep compared to our waking hours .
Women need more sleep than men .
According to a U.K. study , women need 20 more minutes of sleep than men .
The researcher attributed women ’s tendency to multi-task and use more parts of their brain as the reason for the additional time needed .
Now that ’s one for interesting sleep facts .
British computer users are demanding Tony Blair stand up to Microsoft and stop them being ripped off over Windows Vista pricing .
So far , nearly 5,000 people have signed an official petition on Number 10's website calling on Prime Minister Blair to take action against Microsoft 's alleged overcharging .
According to the e-petition , the latest to grace Number 10's beta site since last November 's launch , consumers are paying around double for copies of Windows Vista Ultimate simply based on where they live rather than any special features .
" I can see no reason for there to be such a huge difference in prices between the UK and US other than Microsoft 's belief that the UK customers will pay more than their US counterparts , " the e-petition says .
The e-petition comes as The Register 's Thomas C Green flagged up that Microsoft is failing to adjust its pricing for Irish consumers on Amazon to take account of exchange rate differences and the weakness of the dollar .
Windows Vista Ultimate shoppers in the Republic can pay up to €600 , the equivalent of $ 780 , compared to US counterparts who are paying a maximum of $ 450 - depending on their retailer .
According to the e-petition organisers , Windows Vista Ultimate in the UK is priced at £ 350 but can be purchased in the US for just £ 195 - again , owing to the weakness of the dollar and to sterling 's strength .
A Microsoft spokeswoman defended the company 's pricing saying editions of Windows Vista are " comparable " with different versions of Windows XP .
The spokeswoman said Microsoft 's prices vary by region based on " exchange rate , local taxes , duties , local market conditions , and retailer pricing decisions . "
The call to stand up to Microsoft is the latest embarrassing incident in the government 's flirtation with participatory democracy through the internet .
Since e-petition 's were launched , more than a million people have condemned Number 10's proposed new road - tax and vehicle tracking scheme while just under 5,000 have called for Blair to replace God Save the Queen as Great Britain 's national anthem with Spandau Ballet 's Gold .
Brits should start brushing up on their Spandau .
The PM is unlikely to challenge Microsoft and Gold was just only behind Windows Vista Ultimate in signatures at time of going to press . ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bats , lauded for scooping up mosquitoes and other nasty pests but reviled for drinking blood and spreading rabies , now have another unpopular habit to live down -- it appears they eat songbirds , scientists said on Tuesday .

Spanish and Swiss researchers said they had nailed down controversial evidence that one large species of bat preys on little birds as they migrate through the dark of night over the Mediterranean .
They said giant noctule bats , large bats with an 18 - inch ( 45 - centimetre ) wingspan , were eating mostly insects during the spring but appeared to have a diet heavy in bird meat during the autumn .
No other animal preys on birds that migrate at night , and this species of bat may have switched to this abundant food source recently , they reported in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE .
“ In the course of a few million years , bats colonised most ecological niches and learnt to exploit a wide array of food sources including arthropods , pollen , fruit , small terrestrial vertebrates and even blood , ” Ana Popa - Lisseanu and Carlos Ibanez of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas in Seville , Spain , and colleagues wrote .
Researchers on the team had earlier reported finding bird feathers in the faeces of the bats , creating a storm of controversy , with some biologists saying the bats must have accidentally eaten feathers floating in the air .
So the Swiss and Spanish researchers decided to look for more direct evidence .
It is hard to tell what is going on in the middle of the night high in the air over the sea , so they analysed the blood of the bats .
Chemical variants called isotopes can tell what an animal has been eating and carbon and nitrogen isotopes are especially useful for pinpointing the sources of a diet .
The researchers tested the blood of the bats throughout the year and found strong evidence that the flying mammals ate only insects in the summer , ate a few songbirds in the spring , and then preyed heavily on birds in the autumn .
This could be because both parents and their naive young migrate from Africa back to Europe in the autumn , the researchers said .
“ Every year , approximately five billion passerines ( songbirds ) cross the Mediterranean basin during their autumn migrations , ” the Ibanez team wrote in their report .
“ A big proportion of them are small - sized ; as an example , more than 90 percent of migrating passerines mist - netted in the study area have an average body mass of less than 20 g ( 0.8 ounces ) .
They thus represent a multitude of potential hunting targets for a large bat like Nyctalus lasiopterus . ”
The ability of giant noctule bats to catch migrating birds while they fly at night appears to be unique , Ibanez and colleagues said .
“ So far , no predator had been reported to exploit this extraordinarily diverse and abundant food reservoir represented by nocturnally migrating passerines , ” they wrote .
Andrei Illarionov has often sharply contradicted Mr Putin 's ministers
Economic adviser Andrei Illarionov said Russia was no longer politically free but run by state corporations acting in their own interests .
" I did not sign a contract with such a state , " Mr Illarionov told reporters .
He had been the most vocal critic in the corridors of Russian power for some time , BBC correspondents say .
His remarks are seen by some experts as potentially embarrassing for Mr Putin , as Russia prepares to take over presidency of the G8 club of industrialised nations later this week .
Mr Putin 's office said the president had signed a decree relieving Mr Illarionov of his post , and made no further comment .
' Impossible to remain '
" It is one thing to work in a country that is partly free .
It is another thing when the political system has changed , and the country has stopped being free and democratic , " Mr Illarionov told reporters in Moscow .
He said that " therefore it is absolutely impossible to remain " in his post .
Mr Illarionov added that Russia 's economic policy and the economic model of the state had changed .
Mr Illarionov was sidelined by the president last year
He also said : " Until not long ago no - one put any limits on me expressing my point of view .
Now the situation has changed . "
Viktor Chernomyrdin , ambassador to Ukraine and a former Russian prime minister , dismissed Mr Illarionov 's criticism of the government as groundless .
" There was so much malice in him , he was being overly negative , " he is quoted by Russia 's Interfax news agency as saying .
" It was a mistake to keep him in the Kremlin for so long . "
Analysts quoted by the AFP news agency say Mr Illarionov had already lost much of his influence on the Kremlin but was kept on as " window dressing " to ease Western concerns about growing state control over the economy .
Mr Illarionov has recently criticised government economic policy with such gusto that he sounded more like the Kremlin 's arch opponent than its employee , the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says .
A year ago , he condemned the Russian authorities attack on the giant Yukos as the swindle of the year , our correspondent says .
The Kremlin took away some of his duties , like his role as Russia 's representative to the G8 , sidelining the respected economist .

WASHINGTON , March 11 — A leading Senate Democrat demanded on Sunday that Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales step down , saying he had politicized his office at the expense of the nation ’s laws .
The call by Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , came as the Justice Department faced growing criticism over the ouster of eight United States attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s use of expanded surveillance powers to improperly obtain personal records of citizens .
In an interview on the CBS News program “ Face the Nation , ” Mr. Schumer , the Senate ’s third - ranking Democrat , said Mr. Gonzales had shown more interest in carrying out President Bush ’s agenda than in upholding the law and protecting the rights of citizens .
The senator also said Mr. Gonzales , a former White House counsel who has run the Justice Department since 2005 , had been “ even more political ” than his predecessor , John Ashcroft , who was among the most polarizing members of Mr. Bush ’s cabinet in the president ’s first term .
The envelope paradox
[ Addendum 20151130 : I have since written this up in greater and more formal detail .
If you find the details here lacking , please consult my math.se post about it . ]
This is on my mind because someone asked about it in IRC yesterday and I was surprised at how coherently I was able to explain it on the spur of the moment .
There are several versions of this paradox .
My favorite version goes like this : you 're going to play a game with an adversary .
The adversary writes two different numbers on slips of paper and puts them in an envelope .
The numbers are completely arbitrary ; they could be absolutely any numbers whatsoever : zero , or π , or -1428573901823.00013 , or anything else .
You pick one slip at random from the envelope and examine the number written on it .
You then make a prediction about whether the other number is larger or smaller .
If your prediction is correct , you win a dollar ; if it is incorrect , you lose a dollar .
Clearly , you can break even in the long run simply by making your prediction at random .
And it seems just just as clear that there is no strategy you can use that does better than breaking even .
But this is the paradox : there is a strategy you can use that does better than breaking even .
( This is what W.V.O. Quine calls a " veridical paradox " : it 's something that seems impossible , but is nevertheless true . )
Spoilers follow , so you might want to stop reading here for twenty - four hours and try to figure out a winning strategy yourself .
Let 's call the number you get from the envelope A and the number still in the envelope B .
You can see A , and you are trying to predict whether B is larger or smaller than A .
Here 's your winning strategy .
Before you see A , choose a random number R. If A < R , then conclude that A is " small " , and predict that B is larger .
If A > R , make the opposite prediction .
There are three possibilities .
Either ( 1 ) A and B are both less than R , or ( 2 ) they are both greater than R , or else ( 3 ) one is less than R and one is greater .
In case 1 , you predict that B > A , and you have a 50 % probability of being correct .
In case 2 , you predict that B < A , and you have a 50 % probability of being correct .
But in case 3 , you win every time !
If A < R < B then you see A , conclude that A is " small " , and predict that B > A , which is correct ; if B < R < A then you see A , conclude that A is " large " , and predict that B < A , which is correct .
Since you 're breaking even in cases 1 and 2 , and you have a guaranteed win in case 3 , you have a better - than - even chance of winning overall .
There 's some positive probability p ( which depends on the method you use to choose R ) that you have case 3 , and if so , then your expected positive return on the game is p dollars per game .
The paradoxical part is that it initially seems as though you can't get any idea , just from looking at A , of whether it 's larger or smaller than the unknown number B .
But you can get such an idea , because you can tell from looking at A how big it is , and big numbers are more likely to be larger than B than small numbers are .
What you 've done with R is to invent a definition of " large " and " small " numbers : numbers larger than R are " large " and those smaller than R are " small " .
It 's an arbitrary definition , and it does n't always succeed in distinguishing large from small numbers — it thinks that R+1 and 1000000 R +1000000 are both " large " — but it can distinguish some large numbers from some small numbers , and it never gets confused and concludes that x is large and y is small when x is actually smaller than y .
So it may be arbitrary , and extremely coarse , but it is never actually wrong .
In the cases where this very coarse method of deciding " large " from " small " fails to distinguish A from B , you get no new information , but that 's okay , because you can still break even .
But if you get lucky and the adversary has chosen numbers that you can distinguish , then you win .
Another way to look at the paradox is like this : suppose the adversary is required to choose his two numbers at random .
Then you have a simple winning strategy : if A is positive , predict that B is smaller , and if A is negative , predict that B is larger .
Even when both numbers are positive or both are negative , you win half the time ; if one is positive and one is negative , you are guaranteed a win .
If the adversary knows that this is what you are doing , he can cut you back to merely breaking even , by limiting himself to always choosing positive numbers .
But you can foil this strategy of his by choosing your " positive " and " negative " classes to be divided somewhere other than at 0 : instead of " positive " being " > 0 " and " negative " being " < 0 " , you make them mean " > R " and " < R " .
The adversary still wants to choose two numbers that are always positive , but since he does n't know how big R is , hw does n't know how large he has to make his own numbers to get them both to be " positive " .
Still , this suggests the best strategy for the adversary : choose two very very large numbers that are close together .
By doing this , he can make your expected win close to zero .
The envelope paradox is often presented in a different form : you are given two envelopes .
One contains a bunch of money , say x dollars .
The other contains twice as much .
You open one envelope at random and examine its contents .
Then you choose one envelope to keep .
A naïve analysis goes like this : I open the first envelope and see x .
I can keep this envelope and collect amount x .
If I switch , I have a 50 % chance of ending up with 2 x and a 50 % chance of ending up with x/2 , for an expected outcome of 5 x / 4 .
Since 5x/4 > x , I should always switch .
This is what Quine calls a " falsidical paradox " : the reasoning seems good , but leads to an impossible conclusion .
The strategy of always switching can't possibly be correct , because you could apply it with without even seeing what is in the envelope .
You could keep switching back and forth all day , never opening either envelope , and increasing your expected winnings to infinity .
The tricky part , again , is that having seen x in the envelope , you cannot conclude that there is exactly a 50 % chance of x being the larger of the two amounts .
You get some information from the size of x , and if x is a large amount of money , then the probability that x is the larger of the two amounts is thereby greater than 0.5 .
To do a full analysis , one has to ask the question of how the original amounts were selected .
Say that the two amounts are b and 2 b ; let 's call b the " base amount " .
How did the adversary select b?
Let 's say that the probability of the base amount being any particular amount x is P( x ) .
It is impossible that b has an equal probability of being every number , because $ $ \int_{ - \infty}^\infty P( x ) dx$$ is required to be 1 , and if P ( b ) is the same for every possible base amount b , then it is a constant function , and constant functions do not have the required property .
When you see x in the envelope , you know that one of two situations occurred .
Either x is the base amount , and so is smaller , which occurs with probability P( x ) , or x / 2 is the base amount , and x itself is the larger , which occurs with probability P ( x / 2 ) .
Since these are the only possibilities , the a posteriori likelihood that x is the smaller number is P( x ) / ( P( x / 2 ) + P( x ) ) .
This is equal to 1/2 only if P ( x ) = P( x / 2 ) .
Although this can occur for particular values of x , it can't be true for every x .
As x increases , P( x ) approaches zero , so for sufficiently large x , we must have P ( x / 2 ) > P( x ) , so P ( x / 2 ) + P( x ) > 2P ( x ) , and P( x ) / ( P( x / 2 ) + P( x ) ) < P( x ) /2P(x ) = 1/2 .

The Pentagon claimed a victory for America 's missile defence system last night when a mock warhead was successfully destroyed in space in a test which cost $ 85 m ( £ 45 m ) .
A target missile was launched from Kodiak island , Alaska , yesterday morning .
Seventeen minutes later , an interceptor missile left a silo in California , hitting the target above the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 18,000 mph .
Military chiefs hailed the test as a " total success " for the defence system , originally known as Star Wars , which has been plagued by political opposition and technical troubles since it began in 1983 .
A real interceptor missile has never before successfully destroyed a target missile .
In the previous such attempts , in 2004 and 2005 , the rockets jammed in their silos .
" What we did today is a huge step in terms of our systematic approach to continuing to ... develop a missile defence system for the United States , for our allies , our friends , our deployed forces around the world , " said Lieutenant General Henry Oberling , the Pentagon 's missile defence chief .
He said the system now had a " good chance " of shooting down a real enemy long - range missile .
" I feel a lot safer and sleep a lot better at night , " he said .
Critics dispute the Bush administration 's claim that the system , which has cost almost $ 100 bn to date , is vital to protect against attacks from " rogue states " such as North Korea .
They argue that the end of the cold war rendered the scheme obsolete , and the test was unrealistic because the military knew the size , speed , and timing of the missile at which they were aiming .
The Pentagon said the interception was only a secondary aim of yesterday 's test : the main point had been to gather and analyse data .
But since the test was declared a success before any data had been analysed , opponents suggested it had been partly a public relations exercise .
" It makes you wonder how serious they are about the primary purpose of the test , " Philip Coyle , the Pentagon 's chief weapons - tester during Bill Clinton 's presidency , told Reuters .
Lt Gen Oberling refused to reveal the military 's judgment of whether the system in its current form could destroy a North Korean missile aimed at America .
In July , Pyongyang unsuccessfully tried to test a Taepodong 2 missile believed to be capable of reaching the north - west US .
" What we saw today was a very realistic trajectory for the threat , for the target , and [ for ] intercept speeds , " Lt Gen Obering said .
" We do n't know ... what a Taepodong 2 is going to look like or perform . "

SAN FRANCISCO -- Former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader said he is considering a presidential run in 2008 and strongly suggested today he would enter the race if Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton wins the Democratic Party nomination .
" She 's just another bad version of ( former President ) Bill Clinton , " Nader told KGO radio host Ronn Owens in San Francisco .
Asked to describe Clinton , a front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination a year in advance of the primaries , Nader said : " Flatters , panders , coasting , front - runner , looking for a coronation , not taking on the huge waste in the military budget as a member of the Armed Services commission , never going after the corporate crimes against pensions , against workers .
...
She has no political fortitude . "
Asked specifically if he would run in 2008 , Nader said it is " too early to say .
... ( I'm ) considering it .
We 're going to see what the Democrats come up with . "
Nader made the statements in San Francisco while on a book tour to push his new memoir , " The Seventeen Traditions . "
Nader also spoke at the Commonwealth Club in California .
Nader gained more than 2.7 percent of the national popular vote as the Green Party candidate for president in 2000 , which some analysts said came primarily at the expense of Democrat Al Gore and helped Republican George W. Bush win the White House .
In a second run four years later , Nader gained less than one - half of 1 percent .
Phil Trounstine , who worked as communications director for former Democratic California Gov. Gray Davis , said Nader 's hint that he might run for president again may tarnish his reputation as a longtime progressive and consumer advocate .
" To an awful lot of people , Ralph Nader appears to be threatening , once again , to play the role of a spoiled brat whose purpose in life appears to be ... electing Republicans by draining off votes from Democrats , " said Trounstine , who heads the San Jose State Center for Policy and Research .
Nader 's presidential aspirations are viewed by many as evidence that he is on " an enormous ego trip with potentially destructive impact , " Trounstine said .
Nader 's is the subject of a searing new documentary , " An Unreasonable Man , " which chronicles his early work as a consumer advocate and the turn in his career toward presidential politics .
In the film , critics lambaste Nader , the author of " Unsafe at Any Speed , " for abandoning his consumer advocacy , and suggest he is the ultimate egotist .
None of that jabbing appears to bother Nader , who says he is not interested in legacy , but in holding politicians ' feet to the fire .
On his trip , he has been highly critical of Democrats in Congress , saying they have n't held Bush accountable or done enough to stop the Iraq War .
He has urged progressives to form a " Pelosi Watch " group and planned a visit to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco office to underscore his opposition to the war .
And he assessed the other leading Democratic presidential contenders , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards .
Obama " has capacity ... whether he gets specific in his proposals , that 's what a lot of people are waiting for , " Nader said .
" He has n't shown that much political fortitude ... in his two years in the Senate . "
And of Edwards , Nader said , " I like the way he 's emphasizing the poverty in the country , the sinking of the middle class . "
But he said Edwards , who met today with high tech executives in the Bay Area , is " not very good on foreign relations .
He does n't challenge the military budget .
He should go after things like abuses of the Patriot Act against the civil liberties of the American people . "
Britney Spears is reportedly expecting a baby girl .
The sexy singer - who has a seven - month - old son , Sean Preston - has allegedly told friends her second baby is due in October .
It is rumoured Britney will announce the happy news at a press conference today ( 04.05.06 ) .
The star and husband Kevin Federline are said to be thrilled they are expecting another child .
A source revealed : " Britney will never admit it but she 'd always hoped for a little girl .
Now her family will be complete .
" Britney and Kevin have already started decorating the nursery at their Malibu mansion .
A source told America's In Touch Weekly magazine : " She is going with pink . "
The pop babe has been at the centre of pregnancy speculation for weeks .
The 24 - year - old ' Toxic ' singer recently sparked fresh rumours after being photographed with an apparent baby bump during a holiday in Hawaii .

You ’ve secretly always wanted to be with a lesbian but never thought you ’d have a chance .
At this point , you are probably wondering what the down side might be … here it is .3 REASONS NOT TO DATE A LESBIAN:1 . I may not be attracted to you .
It ’s true .
Then again , how many dates have you been on with straight women who lacked the necessary chemistry too ?
The only way to find out is to try , right ?
2. I am an unabashed feminist .
If I cook for you , you might have to do dishes .
3 . I do n’t know all the moves .
In fact , I ’m pretty clueless when it comes to guys , whether it be flirting over drinks or lights out in the bedroom .
As they say though , practice makes perfect .
So what do you think ?
Still interested ?
If you are , let ’s give this a try .
France 's Suicide Valley Canyon Clean - up Reveals Auto Graveyard
Tons of mangled cars piled up at the bottom of the Grand Canyon de Verdon in Provence are sombre evidence of France 's high suicide rate .
But on a brighter note , engineers now clearing the accumulated wreckage of 100 years are uncovering a veritable auto museum .
In the last decade China has emerged as a powerful , resurgent economic force with the muscle to challenge America as the global superpower .
But , in his controversial new book , Will Hutton argues that China 's explosive economic reforms will create seismic tensions within the one - party authoritarian state and asks : can the centre hold ?
For more than 2,000 years , China 's conceit was that it was the celestial kingdom , the country whose standing was endowed by heaven itself and whose emperors tried to reproduce heavenly harmony on Earth .
All China basked in the reflected glow ; foreigners were barbarians beyond the gilded pale who should not be allowed even to learn the art of speaking and writing Chinese .
When I first visited China in the autumn of 2003 , such articles of Confucian faith seemed very far away , submerged by the lost wars and the 26 humiliating treaties of the 19th century , subsequent communist revolution and now the economic growth to which Beijing 's motorway rings and Shanghai 's skyline are tribute .
This was a new China that had plainly left behind obeisance to the canons of Confucianism and the later cruelties of Mao .
More than three years and a book later , I am less convinced .
All societies are linked to their past by umbilical cords - some apparent , some hidden .
China is no different .
Imperial Confucian China and communist China alike depended - and depend - upon the notion of a vastly powerful , infallible centre : either because it was interpreting the will of heaven or , now , of the proletariat .
In neither system have human rights , constitutional checks and balances or even forms of democracy figured very much .
As a result , China has poor foundations on which to build the subtle network of institutions of accountability necessary to manage the complexities of a modern economy and society .
Sooner or later , it is a failing that will have to be addressed .
China is both very confident about its recent success and very insecure about its past , a potent mix that breeds a deep - seated xenophobia and shallow arrogance .
China 's economy in 2007 will be nearly nine times larger than it was in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping won the power struggle with the Maoists and began his extraordinarily sinuous , gradualist but successful programme of market - based economic reforms , groping for stones to cross the river , as he called it .
China is now the fourth largest economy in the world - after the United States , Japan , and Germany - and is set to become the second largest within a decade .
More than 150 million workers have moved to China 's booming cities and 400 million people have been removed from poverty .
It is a head - spinning achievement .
China is the new factor in global politics and economics , and its rulers and people know it .
It now has more than $ 1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves , the world 's largest .
It is the single most important financier of the United States ' enormous trade deficit .
It is the world 's second largest importer of oil .
Before 2010 , it will be the world 's largest exporter of goods .
It is , comfortably , the world 's second largest military power .
Last year , the Pentagon 's four - yearly defence review stated that China is the power most likely to ' field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages ' .
A new great power is in the making , but one whose pursuit of its self - interest takes the amorality of power to a new plane .
It is not just the Chinese who should be concerned about its institutional and moral failings ; all of us should be .
In China , you can almost smell the new self - confidence : it is in the skyscrapers built in months ; it is in the brash and unashamed willingness to rip off and copy Western brands ; it is in the well - groomed and inscrutable demeanour of the rich entrepreneurs , self - confident officials and assured academics .
I sat in a Beijing bar just over a year ago with a typical member of China 's new class of rich businessmen who double up as members of the party , a combination of commercial and political power that China knew well as the old Confucian mandarinate , now strangely reproducing itself in a new guise after Mao tried to eliminate it forever in the Cultural Revolution .
In surprisingly fluent English and with his Mercedes waiting outside , he praised China 's communist regime and its curious mix of capitalism and communism with all the enthusiasm of a Tory businessmen praising Thatcher .
Chinese corruption ?
Think of Enron and party - funding scandals in London , he declaimed .
Double standards between communist rhetoric and practice ?
What about the US and Britain 's invasion of Iraq , and Guantanamo Bay ?
What I failed to realise , he insisted , betraying both assurance and insecurity , is that China will not surrender again the natural rank that it should never have lost .
Western values , institutions and attitudes were being revealed for being straw men , blown away by resurgent China and the pragmatism of its communist leaders .
Yet Western values and institutions are not being blown away .
The country has made progress to the extent that communism has given up ground and moved towards Western practices , but there are limits to how far the reformers can go without giving up the basis for the party 's political control .
Conservatives insist that much further and the capacity to control the country will become irretrievably damaged ; that the limit , for example , is being reached in giving both trade unions more autonomy and shareholders more rights .
It is the most urgent political debate in China .
The tension between reform and conservatism is all around .
For example , the party 's commitment now is no longer to building a planned communist economy but a ' socialist market ' economy .
The 26,000 communes in rural China , which were once the vanguard of communism , were swept away by the peasants themselves in just three years between 1979 and 1982 , the largest bottom - up act of decollectivisation the world has ever witnessed .
Hundreds of millions of peasants are , via long leases , again farming plots held by their ancestors for millenniums .
China 's state - owned enterprises no longer provide life - long employment and welfare for their workers as centrepieces of a new communist order ; they are autonomous companies largely free to set prices as they choose in an open economy and progressively shedding their social obligations .
Equally amazing , China 's communists have declared that the class war is over .
The party now claims to represent not just the worker and peasant masses but entrepreneurs and business leaders , whom it welcomes into its ranks .
The party refers to this metamorphosis as the ' three represents ' : meaning that the party today represents ' advanced productive forces ' ( capitalists ) ; ' the overwhelming majority ' of the Chinese ( not just workers and peasants ) ; and ' the orientation ... of China 's advanced culture ' ( religious , political and philosophical traditions other than communism ) .
Party representatives say that the country is no longer pledged to fight capitalism to the death internationally , but , instead , wants to rise peacefully .
China has joined the World Trade Organisation and is a judicious member of the United Nations Security Council , using its veto largely in matters that immediately concern it , such as Taiwan .
But for all that , it remains communist .
The maxims of Marxist - Leninst - Maoist thought have to stand , however much the party tries to stretch the boundaries , because they are the basis for one - party rule .
Yet the system so spawned is reaching its limits .
For example , China 's state - owned and directed banks cannot carry on channelling hundreds of billions of pounds of peasant savings into the financing of a frenzy of infrastructure and heavy industrial investment .
The borrowers habitually pay interest only fitfully , and rarely repay the debt , even as the debt mountain explodes .
The financial system is vulnerable to any economic setback .
Equally , China is reaching the limits of the capacity to increase its exports , which , in 2007 , will surpass $ 1 trillion , by 25 per cent a year .
At this rate of growth , they will reach $ 5 trillion by 2020 or sooner , representing more than half of today 's world trade .
Is that likely ?
Are there ships and ports on sufficient scale to move such volumes - and will Western markets stay uncomplainingly open ?
Every year , it is also acquiring $ 200bn of foreign exchange reserves as it rigs its currency to keep its exports competitive .
Can even China insulate its domestic financial system from such fantastic growth in its reserves and stop inflation rising ?
Already , there are ominous signs that inflationary pressures are increasing .
These ills have communist roots .
It is the lack of independent scrutiny and accountability that lie behind the massive waste of investment and China 's destruction of its environment alike .
The pace of desertification has doubled over 20 years , in a country where 25 per cent of the land area is already desert .
Air pollution kills 400,000 people a year prematurely .
A hacking cough in the Beijing smog or the stench when the wind comes from the north in Shanghai are reminders of just how far China still has to go .
Energy is wasted on an epic scale .
But the worst problem is water .
One - fifth of China 's 660 cities face extreme water shortages and as many as 90 per cent have problems of water pollution ; 500 million rural Chinese still do not have access to safe drinking water .
Illegal and rampant polluting , a severe shortage of sewage treatment facilities , and chemical pollutants together continue to degrade China 's waterways .
In autumn 2005 , two major cities - Harbin and Guangzhou - had their water supplies cut off for days because their river sources had suffered acute chemical spills from state - owned factories .
Enterprises are accountable to no one but the Communist party for their actions ; there is no network of civil society , plural public institutions and independent media to create pressure for enterprises to become more environmentally efficient .
Watchdogs , whistleblowers , independent judges and accountable government are not just good in themselves as custodians of justice ; they also keep capitalism honest and efficient and would curb environmental costs that reach an amazing 12 per cent of GDP .
As importantly , they are part of the institutional network that constitutes an independent public realm that includes free intellectual inquiry , free trade unions and independent audit .
It is this ' enlightenment infrastructure ' that I regard in both the West and East as the essential underpinning of a healthy society .
The individual detained for years without a fair trial is part of the same malign system that prevents a company from expecting to be able to correct a commercial wrong in a court , or have a judgment in its favour implemented , if it were against the party interest .
The impact is pernicious .
The reason why so few Britons can name a great Chinese brand or company , despite China 's export success , is that there are n't any .
China needs to build them , but doing that in a one - party authoritarian state , where the party second - guesses business strategy for ideological and political ends , is impossible .
In any case , nearly three - fifths of its exports and nearly all its hi-tech exports are made by non-Chinese , foreign firms , another expression of China 's weakness .
The state still owns the lion 's share of China 's business and what it does not own , it reserves the right to direct politically .
Mark Kitto , a former Welsh Guardsman , has found at first - hand how difficult it is to sustain private ownership in China .
He built up three Time Out equivalents in Beijing , Shanghai and Guangzhou but , after seven years of successful magazine publishing , learnt last year that he was about to become a partner of the state .
The only terms on which his licence to publish could be retained was if he were to accept a de facto takeover from China Intercontinental Press , controlled by China 's State Information Council , the propaganda mouthpiece of the Communist party .
It did not matter that he owned the shares , wanted to retain his independence and had been careful to stay within the party 's publishing guidelines .
The party now wanted control of his magazines and simply took it .
It is an example repeated many times over .
China must become a more normal economy , but the party stands in the way .
Chinese consumers need to save less and spend more , but consumers with no property rights or welfare system are highly cautious .
To give them more confidence means taxing to fund a welfare system and conceding property rights .
That will mean creating an empowered middle class who will ask how their tax renminbi are spent .
Companies need to be subject to independent accountability if they are to become more efficient , but that means creating independent centres of power .
The political implications are obvious .
China 's future is shrouded in uncertainty .
My belief is that what is unsustainable is not sustained .
Change came in the Soviet Union with the fifth generation of leaders after the revolution ; the fifth generation of China 's leaders succeed today 's President Hu Jintao in 2012 .
No political change will happen until after then , but my guess is that sometime in the mid to late 2010s , the growing Chinese middle class will want to hold Chinese officials and politicians to account for how they spend their taxes and for their political choices .
What nobody can predict is whether that will produce another Tiananmen , repression and maybe war if China 's communists pick a fight to sustain legitimacy at home or an Eastern European velvet revolution and political freedoms .
Either way , China 's route to becoming a world economic power is not going to proceed as a simple extrapolation of current trends .
This book has been something of a personal intellectual odyssey .
My hypothesis when I began was that China was so different that it could carry on adapting its model , living without democracy or European enlightenment values .
I have changed my mind and now see more clearly than ever the kinds of connection I identified in The State We 're
In between economic performance and so - called ' soft ' institutions - how people are educated , how trust relations are established and how accountability is exercised ( just to name a few ) - are central .
They are equally important to a good society and the chance for individual empowerment and self - betterment .
Early in my research , I tried out the still - emergent thesis at a small dinner in Lan Na Thai , one of the restaurants in Shanghai 's Ruijin guest house , a complex of refurbished old mansions and traditional pavilions in the French quarter where communist leaders reputedly once ate and slept .
Over stir - fried curried chicken and crispy fried flying sea bass , the Chinese guests repeated politely and persuasively that China was making up new economic and political rules .
Afterwards , I chanced to have a few words alone with one of the local rising government stars as we walked out of the complex .
He kept his eyes on the ground .
' Do n't allow yourself to be dissuaded , despite what you have heard .
You are right that China is not different .
I want my children to see a China with human rights and democratic institutions .
And I am not alone . '
He jumped into a taxi and was gone .
I have often thought about that chance exchange .
Britain and the West take our enlightenment inheritance too easily for granted , and do not see how central it is to everything we are , whether technological advance , trust or well - being .
We neither cherish it sufficiently nor live by its exacting standards .
We share too quickly the criticism of non-Western societies that we are hypocrites .
What China has taught me , paradoxically , is the value of the West , and how crucial it is that we practise what we preach .
If we do n't , the writing is on the wall - for us and China .
China 's quest for oil
China 's foreign policy is increasingly driven by the need to feed its growing appetite for oil .
General Xiong Guangkai , deputy chief of the Chinese general staff , has said that China 's energy problem needs to be taken ' seriously and dealt with strategically ' .
That means less reliance on the Middle East ; less transportation of oil via sea-lanes policed by the US navy ; more capacity for the Chinese navy to protect Chinese tankers ; and more oil brought overland by pipeline from central Asia .
Over the past two years , China has pulled off a string of strategic oil deals .
In April 2005 , Petro China and Canadian company Enbridge signed a memorandum to build a $ 2bn ' gateway ' pipeline to move oil from Alberta to the Pacific Coast .
In Venezuela , President Hugo Chavez is to build a Chinese - financed pipeline to the Pacific coast through Colombia , having given China oil and gas exploration rights in 2005 .
Saudi Arabia surrendered to Chinese courtship in 2004 and accorded exploration rights .
In Sudan , a major source of oil , China 's blind eye to human rights and mass murder if it hinders its interests is demonstrated by Zhou Wenzhong 's comment when Deputy Foreign Minister about the situation in Darfur where more than 250,000 have died .' Business is business , ' he said .
' We try to separate politics from business and , in any case , the internal position of Sudan is an internal affair , and we are not in a position to influence them . '
Wrong : China has substantial influence on Sudan if it chose to exercise it .
It does not , a commentary on China 's approach to foreign policy and an awesome warning of the future if an unreconstructed China became yet more powerful .
Tiananmen : the legacy
The image of a single student halting a tank in Tiananmen Square is one of the most arresting in modern history .
But the protests spread well beyond Beijing for six weeks in spring 1989 to encompass demonstrations in 181 cities .
The party and army were divided over how to respond ; 150 officers openly declared that they would not fire on demonstrators after martial law was declared , and at least a third of the central committee wanted to reach a compromise with the protesters .
The party 's then general secretary , Zhao Ziyang , proposed a partial meeting of demands for reform .
Nobody should be killed .
That was not the view of Deng and the party elders - the eight ' immortals ' , veterans of the Revolution .
A ' counter - revolutionary ' riot had to be suppressed .
But before Deng could act , he had to leave Beijing to ensure that army groups 28 and 29 , personally loyal to him , would provide the core of the force rather than the uncertain army groups based around the capital .
Once in place , Zhao was then brutally deposed , remaining under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
Martial law was imposed on 19 May and a fortnight later the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square .
Official estimates were that 5,000 soldiers and police officers were wounded and 223 killed .
Civilian losses - 2,000 wounded and 220 killed - were lower .
Many still languish in prison .
Tiananmen is the event that cannot be discussed in China ; websites mentioning it are blocked .
It was no ' counter - revolutionary riot ' but a demand for freedoms that infected all China and very nearly succeeded .
Current leader Hu Jintao and his successors know they are not Deng and cannot command the loyalty of key elements of the army in the same way .
Their best strategy is to deliver growth and jobs while trying to keep the lid on China 's growing but still disconnected social protests .
Whether the policy will carry on working is the open question asked daily in Beijing 's inner circles .

Mike 's latest perceptions
Last Update : June 27 , 2003
The following is organized in chronological order .
Mike May was totally blind from age 3 through 46 .
Some of his experiences since regaining low vision , March 7 , 2000 , are things , which would have not been possible without some vision , others are things , which , may be more convenient with some sight but could be done just fine without sight .
To answer the second most asked question , here is what Mike can currently see .
His uncorrected vision is roughly 20/1000 and he is near - sighted according to Doctors Goodman and Carson .
This means he can count fingers at 2 to 5 feet depending upon the lighting .
Mike can read one - inch high letters half a foot away if the contrast is good .
He can see colors quite well and get most visual information from colors .
People ’s shapes are recognizable up to 10 or 20 feet but Mike could not tell you if they were short or tall , or had blonde or dark hair over 15 feet away .
Mike May can see large objects at quite a distance ; buildings hundreds of feet away , the moon , clouds , forests and cars on the road .
He often has to touch things to identify what they are and how far away they are .
His brain is constantly cataloging new objects and situations .
Time , fate and experiences will determine what Mike May will eventually see .
He shares his personal experiences along this interesting road in the following journal .

Journal of what Mike is seeing
March 20 , 2000
I took my first airplane flight with low vision .
It was a very bumpy flight and I was keeping my mind off this by working on my computer .
After about 30 minutes into the flight , I suddenly realized that I could look out the window , so I did .
I could see a couple grades of white lines in the distance and brown and green patches sliding by on the ground .
We were at 27,000 feet and I could see the ground .
More significant to me was the fact that being an airplane for me in the past without sight always felt like being in a time machine because I had no connection with the outside world .
This is a foreign concept to most people with sight .
I was so excited to find out what I was seeing that I decided to ask my seatmates .
I turned to the lady next to me and said , “ excuse me , I just got my sight back last week after being totally blind for 43 years .
Could you help me figure out what I am seeing ? ”
There was a big pregnant pause as she decided if I was a lunatic or a miracle .
I broke the silence by asking if the white lines I saw in the distance were mountains .
She said , “ no honey , that ’s haze . ”
From then on , she and her husband gave me a play by play of the central valley , fields , channels , roads , Tehachapi Mountains and finally the Los Angeles coast line .
I could see the water and even the waves .
I picked out white dots , which must have been sailboats and even worse haze .
I parachuted once in 1983 and I would like to do it again so I can see from that perspective .
It is strange to think back over explaining to my kids about what they were seeing out the airplane window when they first flew but now I know first hand the awe they experience .
I love the power of the ocean when I can hear it and now I had a sense of that expanse and power while far above it .
March 25 , 2000
I have just returned from my first conference and my first opportunity to experiment with new travel vision .
It was also my first intense business and social interaction with the use of low vision .
Carrying equipment and boxes can be challenging when you have one hand occupied with a dog or cane .
I was able when necessary to fold up my cane or leave my Seeing Eye dog Josh in the hotel room so I could use both hands to carry equipment .
When standing in line , I did n't have to concentrate on whether or not the line was moving .
I could easily see when the person in front of me moved ahead .
I could easily determine where he end of the line was and it was not necessary to ask .
I was able to more easily orient myself in the complex exhibit hall and to avoid others with canes or dogs .
When I came out of an elevator , I could look both directions and more easily see which way the hall or front lobby was .
I found it very distracting to look at people ’s faces when I was having a conversation .
I can see their lips moving , eye lashes flickering , head nodding and hands gesturing .
First , I tried looking down and if it was a woman , a low cut top would be even more distracting .
It was easiest to close my eyes or tune out the visual input .
This was necessary often in order to pay attention to what they were saying .
I am sure there will come a time when all this visual communication will mean more to me but for now it is just distracting .
Although I can't yet recognize faces , I could remember someone ’s hair color and color of clothing .
If I was talking to one person at our booth and someone I had seen earlier came up to me , I could see who it is and acknowledge him or her before they said anything .
March 26 , 2000
The soccer team I helped coach last Fall got together today for a reunion potluck .
There were 14 kids and 12 adults .
It was fun seeing what people looked like , mostly people I had just met in the fall and did n't know well .
The kids played soccer and asked me to play with them .
I am more tentative with sight than I was without .
My perception of space and how I move in it is still confusing enough that I do n't want to run over one of these little guys while running after the ball .
I was less concerned about this and played with them regularly when we practiced before .
Still I can see the ball flying through the air , which gives me a thrill .
I could always go after it before when it was on the ground but not in the air .
Now I can .
The Picablue team presented me with a large framed photograph of the team , signed by them all .
I could read their signatures and pick out their faces in the picture with some help from the other coach , Charlie .
March 27 , 2000
The travel clues I am getting are extremely helpful .
I have always struggled when working my Seeing Eye Dog , rolling a bag through the airport and then trying to carry a cup of coffee .
It is impossible not to spill the coffee .
Today , I let go of the harness and carried the coffee in that hand .
I walked slowly but I navigated through the people and other obstacles without the benefit of Josh guiding .
On the plane , it was useful to be able to see when the flight attendant was looking at me to take my order .
Particularly , if I had headphones on , this was tricky to determine in the past .
April 3 , 2000
I played a ball game today with my 6 year - old son , Wyndham , which involved kicking the ball back and forth .
The object was to catch the ball , a very visual game to be playing .
It was interesting to see how I was able to judge my eye - hand coordination .
As the game progressed , I was able to run 6 to 10 feet and catch the ball in the air .
Other times , it would slip right through my hands while standing still .
I am taller and faster than Wyndham and he can see much better than me so we were quite evenly matched .
He was better at kicking the ball straight than I was .
We each caught the ball 20 times over the course of an hour .
I had a great sense of satisfaction chasing that white ball around in the air .
April 15 , 2000
One of the biggest events in Davis is Picnic Day , which I attended today with the two boys , Jennifer is out of town .
This is my first parade with some vision and it caught me by surprise .
The setting is important before you hear my description of this first parade .
This is the 3rd Picnic Day for us after moving to Davis 2 years ago .
Today , we found ourselves sitting on the curb surrounded by new friends we had met in town .
Carson was sitting in my lap excitedly describing parade floats and occasionally dashing out to squirt them with silly string .
My eyes were bugging out at all the colors and new visual information , or should I say " my eye "
The first band I saw was the UC Davis Aggie marching band .
They stopped right in front of us , literally 3 feet away .
The instruments burst forth , drowning out what Carson was telling me .
I have never known of music as anything but auditory and yet , just an arms reach away ; this music was every bit as visual as it was audible .
Legs were rising in unison , band members were marching in patterns I could n't quite follow , instruments were flashing and the clothing was all the same .
Only the colors of their hair and the instruments were individual .
It all fit together so beautifully , visually and audibly .
And , for the first time since I got some sight on March 7 , tears ran down my face .
On the one hand it felt odd that I was crying over the Cal Aggie marching band while on the other hand it was wonderful that it did n't make sense , just like having sight or not having sight does n't make sense , it 's just the way it is .
Of course , it was the combination of feelings which contributed to this " goose bump " moment ; happy to be with my boys , friends and to be in a cohesive energetic community .
What a moment , what a day !
April 23 , 2000
The past 5 days have entailed a host of new things to see .
We took 5 days to drive to Ashland and Portland Oregon .
This encompassed Earth Day , Carson 's birthday and Easter .
Twenty hours of driving is so much more palatable when one is able to see the scenery .
One highlight of the trip was seeing my 3 year - old twin nieces for the first time .
It has always been a challenge to tell their munchkin voices apart and they seldom sit still long enough for me to feel the difference between them .
Lanie has lighter blonde hair and Clare 's is a bit darker blonde .
It was fun to be able to recognize them before they said anything .
It did make me nervous watching the two little ones wrestle with Carson and Wyndham .
It 's easier to be a laid - back parent if you can't see these things .
No one got hurt and it was enjoyable to watch the boys interact with their cousins and to know who was who .
We were part of a throwback to the 60's style parade in Portland on Earth Day .
We represented the fish species .
What a crazy colorful costume party it was .
It was fun to see all the colorful people even if I could n't recognize what they were .
It was useful too to be able to see my family so we could stay together in the dense crowd .
Also , on this trip , we went to a couple baseball games for friend 's kids .
I could see the white ball being pitched , hit and thrown as well as the kids on the bright green field .
I was amazed how good these girls were at the game .
I particularly enjoyed seeing if I could tell if the pitch was high or low .
It 's bad enough to have a blind or partially sighted back seat driver ; a partially sighted umpire is even worse but I mostly kept my opinion to myself .
We visited the house we lived in for 6 years outside Ashland and it looked every bit as beautiful as it felt .
I could now see the view of the valley and hills beyond which I knew were there but had n't actually seen visually .
I have been noticing some discomfort when I use the phrase , " nice to see you . "
I have always used that word quite comfortably .
This phrase means much more than just nice to see you with my eyes .
It means good to be with you again ; nice to be in your presence ; nice to hear you ; etc .
Now , when I say , " nice to see you " , everyone takes it literally .
Suddenly the phrase is one dimensional instead of multi dimensional .
It feels weird to have to think about something , which before was so natural .
I notice as I write this update driving down Interstate 5 , that I have to close my eyes when I am composing .
It is too distracting to look around while thinking and writing at the same time .
I still am unable to integrate the visual information along with other sensory input .
The visual sense dominates particularly when I am speaking with someone and seeing their body language .
I will be glad when I can integrate the visual information .
All in good time I suppose .
April 30 , 2000
Just in the nick of time .
I got the okay from Dr. Goodman to go skiing as long as I had good eye protection .
So , armed with glasses and goggles , the May family headed for Kirkwood on this absolutely gorgeous weekend for a little , See and Ski .
I particularly wanted to ski for my first time with some vision at Kirkwood because Jennifer and I met there 16 years ago when she volunteered as a guide for our Discovery Blind Sports program .
I learned to ski at Kirkwood 20 years ago and my boys also cut their teeth , almost literally , on the Kirkwood slopes .
I lived one season at Kirkwood with my friend and race guide , Ron Salviolo .
The Kirkwood slopes are so clearly etched in my mind ’s eye , I was anxious to see them with my newly working eye .
The boys wanted to ski a beginner run so this gave me a chance to comfortably look around and to see what I could see .
I was a bit concerned that the visual input would make me tense as people and lift towers flitted by startling me before I could understand what they were .
If seeing the nearby traffic on the slopes was anything like seeing cars zipping by in a vehicle , I thought I might opt to close my eyes and ski the way I know and love so well .
As we skied down Chair 1 at Kirkwood , I got goose bumps , despite the warm sunshine , as a flood of beautiful sights came to me .
Jennifer was in front of me , guiding like usual , and she looked very good , just as I had always imagined , graceful and attractive .
The trees were a deeper green than imagined and so tall .
I knew they were tall but I never thought of trees as much more than obstacles to be avoided .
The way they stood in stark contrast to the white snow was so incredibly vivid .
Above the trees were the distant cliffs and higher still , the blue sky , not a cloud in it .
I could see the different colors of the ridges and guess at what those colors represented .
Yet , I only knew from logic that those cliffs were a couple miles away rather than a couple hundred yards as they appeared .
Good thing I knew these slopes well as I was hardly hearing Jennifer and I was looking at the panorama and not at where I was going .
There was just so much to take in and I could n't absorb it all .
When we rode up the chair lift , I was amazed how steep it appeared looking down the mountain .
I had a picture in my mind of these slopes and the visual image was the same with a whole lot more detail and definition .
Once I stopped gawking at the land and snows capes , I could pay more attention to the skiers and to take on more challenging terrain .
It was difficult at first to distinguish between shadows and stationary objects , whether they were people , poles or rocks .
It was interesting to see skiers and snow boarders , which have such a distinct difference in sound and have an equally different visual countenance .
I even started skiing more independently as Jennifer skied in front of me but stopped calling out directions .
I stopped thinking and really started skiing when the boys dragged me into a gully .
This is where kids always love to ski and I have always hated because it is tricky with a guide to know where the sides of the gully end and the trees or cliffs begin .
Now , I could distinctly see the tree line , which allowed me to cut loose .
I skied ahead of Jennifer , zipping up one side of the gully , across and up the opposite side , just like the other kids , trying to get air when you hit the peak and rotate the reverse direction .
They say that a 4 - wheel drive vehicle is actually more dangerous than a 2 - wheel drive vehicle because the 4 - wheeler encourages one to get into more dangerous situations .
You just get stuck further from home .
I was feeling a bit like this with my newly discovered gully - riding abilities .
What if there was a bamboo pole , marking a rock , which I did n't see ?
What if there was a ditch , which , blended with the rest of the snow ?
Fortunately , this time , the odds were in my favor and I survived my first wild gully run quite happily .
There were so few people on the slopes this last weekend at Kirkwood that I was able to ski , unguided , quite well .
I was happy to have Jennifer and the boys watching out for me nonetheless .
I also had a film crew documenting my experience in order to give publicity to the blind ski program at Kirkwood and to give Kirkwood recognition for its role as one of the most supportive ski resorts in the world in terms of blind skiing over the past 22 years .
My unguided skiing was sloppy particularly when we got up on the black diamond runs .
I was distracted and proud as well too see the boys skiing this rather challenging terrain .
Hard for me to ski well and take all this in at the same time .
I found that my mind and my body were struggling over which was in charge on the slopes .
It is so weird to feel like I know everything about skiing at Kirkwood and at the same time to have this feeling of so much newness that the visual dimension added .
I made the mistake of telling a reporter on the chair lift , as I struggled for an analogy , that this day of skiing was " like having sex with the lights on . "
Of course , this was the sound bite with which they led their news story .
I was trying to make the point that skiing was a fantastic experience and one did not need sight to fully experience it .
At the same time , the visual dimension was not to be ignored .
I felt this mind - body struggle also when I skied my first moguls .
I have learned to ski the bumps by keeping my skis pointed down the mountain and making very committed and regular turns .
When I could see the bumps , I was thinking about when I should turn instead of committing myself as is still necessary , with or without sight .
It does n't work to hold back or sit back when skiing in medium to big moguls .
Although I may have been flailing , I was still very much enjoying the process of experimenting .
I made it through this first bump run without falling and without a guide , just the cameraman , Curtis Fong and my son Wyndham on the slope with me .
At least they are the only ones I could see .
As if I needed it , now I have just one more aspect of skiing to entice me to the slopes .
I look forward to seeing more beautiful panoramas and skiers at Kirkwood and other mountains .
I do n't plan on doing this without a good guide , as I would like to come back from these adventures intact .
I also need someone with good eyeballs to explain to me what I am seeing and to fill in the details I still cannot see .

Another " First " today , going to the beach .
This was the 5th and last day of filming with NBC Dateline .
I spoke to a 4th grade class in Palo Alto , hiked some trails near the Stanford dish and in Golden Gate Park and Baker Beach in San Francisco near the Golden Gate Bridge .
The kids were great and asked every question the pros asked and then a few .
The most “ Silicon Valley ” type question went as follows .
“ What company or industry is responsible for the success of your surgery ?
I assume this kid got Cisco or HP stock for his weekly allowance and was just doing a little due diligence .
I explained , with a smile on my face , that it was the Medical industry and the advancements in stem cell transplants and anti rejection drugs , which made this success possible .
I could n’t name the biotech company responsible for the drug .
A smile was on my face too the whole time I walked up and down the beach on a beautiful day just following a rainstorm .
The Golden Gate Bridge was quite clear off to my right although I could n’t distinguish some scattered clouds from its structure .
The Marin Headlands were straight in front of me and a point of land was off to the left where the sun was headed .
I was mesmerized by the glint of the sunlight on the crest of the waves just before they broke .
Then everything would crash into white bubbles and come rushing toward my bare feet .
I wanted to run into those waves , clothes and all .
The smells and sounds of the ocean have always drawn me .
Couple them with the visual beauty and I was bound to get wet .
The waves rolled toward each other from either side , like stereo merging into monaural .
Just as the sunshine glinted on the wave crest , the wind made a quick whipping sound that was followed by the crash .
It was so amazing to piece the visual images together with the audible images , which I know , and love so well .
The connection was surreal like the first time skiing , everything so familiar and so much more unfamiliar at the same time .
When I would take a break and tare my eyes from the ocean , I enjoyed looking at the colors of the sand , very wet , wet and dry .
When I noticed dark patches behind me , it did n’t register right away that these were my footprints .
I never thought of footprints as images other than when reading about them in an old west novel .
To me , they were the thump ; pivot push and the texture of the sand on my foot not dark splotches following me around like a shadow .
It was intriguing to watch the waves slowly wash those prints away .
Still these impressions remain indelibly in my memory .
There will be lots to learn from the ocean especially up on the rugged cliffs of northern California or on the islands of the Galapagos .
This virgin look at the beach and ocean for the first time in San Francisco was nothing short of incredible and I managed to only get wet up to my knees .

This week was spent in our Nation 's capitol .
Seeing the Washington Monument and the Smithsonian castles were exciting but somewhat overshadowed by my first major scare with my newly acquired eyesight .
This was a wake up call that this first year has a 50 % risk of tissue rejection .
When my eye first started bothering me on Saturday , I chalked it up to my first cold in over a year .
By Tuesday when the wearable computer conference started , I was in lots of pain and could hardly open my eye .
I found an eye doctor close to the conference hotel in McLean , VA .
He and his assistant reported that nothing looked wrong .
I suggested that the problem might be a stray eyelash or two but he said they could not see any lashes .
When I called this same doc the next morning to say things had gotten worse , he said , “ these are signs of early rejection but I do n’t see anything wrong . ”
My San Francisco doctors said not to bother with him any more and to come see them right away .
I arrived back in California that evening and saw Doctors Carson and Goodman today .
We were all trying not to be alarmist .
In fact , we had all lost a bit of sleep , me mostly because of the discomfort .
After looking in my eye with those blasted bright lights , Dr. Carson stepped back , squeezed my shoulder , breathed a sigh of relief , and said , “ the cornea still looks clear .
There is a little inflammation on the stem cells , and , there are two lashes to be pulled . ”
He pulled the lashes , Dr. Goodman confirmed that things looked pretty good and I went on my way .
By this evening , my eye feels normal again .
I am so relieved to look forward to a good night ’s sleep .
I really should take a 2 - month vacation and see the world .
One just does n’t know what tomorrow will bring other than a new sunrise .

I performed my first graduation commencement speech today at Las Positas College In Pleasanton , California , 1500 people attending .
I , along with the college officers and Chancellor were garbed in the robes representing our respective universities and degree colors .
There was quite the pomp and circumstance .
It has been 20 years since I last went through a graduation and this was the first time I was on the stage for more than picking up my diploma .
The entire experience , plus the visuals , made this yet another " goose bump " moment in time .
As we filed through those 1500 people lined up on the soccer field , I had a huge smile as I took in the myriad of people I passed by .
From our position under a large awning on the stage , I could see quite well .
As I stood at the podium , the crowd was nicely contrasted in the bright sunshine against the green grass .
There was a sea of colors punctuated by the movement of people fanning themselves .
I could see the cameraman crouch before me and a child darting up to the stage with a parent in hot pursuit .
Still not being very good at looking , thinking and talking simultaneously , my speech wandered a bit from my original outline .
What I lacked in continuity , I think I made up for in humor and spontaneity .
I was truly blown away by what I was seeing and by the excitement in sharing this graduation milestone with so many hard working people of all ages and cultures .
One of the spontaneous stories went like this .
" Last night , my wife and I had the pleasure of staying with your Vice President Karen Halliday and her husband Jim .
As my wife Jennifer and I were preparing for bed , I was talking about what I could do differently in my speech today .
I mentioned that I liked the goofy intermission routine the MC did at Warren Miller ski movies .
The MC would hold up a hand and say OOO and then Ah when he dropped his hand .
He could then add a little sardonic comedy with audience participation .
The tough part for me was learning the proper Ooo Ah jesters .
We started giggling as we stood there in the guest bedroom , Jennifer coaching me by demonstrating the Ooo Ah and the gestures .
It suddenly occurred to me how this must sound to our hosts in the next room , Jennifer and I taking turns saying Ooo Ah , Ooo Ah .
I would like you to humor me today by an occasional Ooo Ah upon my cues . "
There was a great deal of laughter as the audience realized how we must have sounded to our hosts .
I ended my talk with one grand Oooo Aaah .
Later in the ceremonies , the microphone stopped working and the College President was momentarily unable to continue .
As I reached up to fix my hat , which was falling off , a swell of Ooo Ah came from the crowd .
They thought that was their cue .
Even though I did n't do it on purpose , the comic relief was perfectly timed as the microphone came back on and the President continued .
There really was a lot to ooh and ah about on this beautiful day especially when two days previously , there was some serious concern that tissue rejection might be setting in .
Sure are lots of reasons to appreciate each and every sunrise .

It has happened many times over the past 13 years .
Friends join us at a beautiful cabin ( Tallac House ) on the East shore of Fallen Leaf Lake near South Lake Tahoe .
We arrive late Friday night for a weekend mountain get - away after an all - to - familiar frustrating drive from the Bay Area .
The friends have a hard time finding the cabin , in the dark , a quarter mile off the meandering Fallen Leaf Road .
They stumble into bed without seeing much of the surroundings .
Sight seeing will wait for the morning when the get - away and weekend really starts .
I knew when the sun would rise because it was always punctuated by a hushed shout from the next room , " holy shit ! "
This would be the friend 's reaction as they opened their eyes to the West facing view of Mount Tallac jutting above the far side of the lake , the rising sun framing it in a wash of morning light , the lake in the foreground , smooth as glass with wisps of steam rising off it .
Those two words from the adjacent room painted this picture for me since I first went to Jennifer 's family retreat in 1987 .
In my mind 's eye , I could hear , feel , smell and taste this magnificent panorama .
This Memorial weekend was the second time I have been to the cabin since I regained some sight in March .
I took time this trip to absorb the visual sense of this beautiful mountain setting .
Even on this 80 degree , almost summer day , the snow clearly outlined the top of Tallac .
There were n't any clouds so I could n't confuse the two .
The trees particularly captured my attention .
They are so tall , so very , very tall and each one so individual .
I tried to find two , which looked the same .
If there were a matching set , I could n't see them .
How can they possibly stay rooted in the ground ?
Just an endless trunk reaching toward the sky , no guy wires , nothing , just the trunk and heavy branches waving in the wind and the invisible routes below .
It is a mystery , like flying , something I do all the time but can't really believe is possible .
I perched on the balcony railing , looking over the lake .
I had an irresistible urge to crawl out on to the roof to confirm that the brown things I saw there were indeed pine cones .
I knew logically what they were but I wanted to touch them like pinching myself to make sure this was n't a dream .
I really was seeing them .
I would like to touch the tops of those trees and the top of Mount Tallac as well .
Trusting this new visual information gives a whole new meaning to the term , " hand - eye coordination . "
Quite the memorable Memorial weekend , May 2000 , surrounded by life , the trees , my family and a new way to appreciate them all ; pretty hard to sum it all up in two words .

The Status Quo is pretty good .
I spoke last night in El Paso at the Texas Focus conference to 300 parents and teachers of the blind .
I presented for 70 minutes and covered many of my adventures .
I spent the least amount of time on my new sight and suggested that they watch Dateline for the complete story .
When I described taking the bandages off and seeing Jennifer 's smile for the first time , the spontaneous oooh from the audience gave me chills , recapturing the moment myself .
I have n't had any scares with the eye since the DC episode thank goodness .
I do n't know if I mentioned the excruciating process of having them singe those eyelashes so they do n't grow back .
Major ouch !
I think my acuity has improved somewhat since March 7 .
My ability to figure out what visual things are has definitely improved .
Detailed items and pictures are still the most difficult .
Colors , shapes and movement are the best indicators for me of what is what .
I am gaining a better ability to integrate the vision into my other sensory perceptions so it does n't dominate so much .
Still , I tune out the visual input when it is too distracting , mainly in conversations .
Think of how distracting it is when you are speaking and hear an echo of your own voice .
It is difficult to ignore that echo .
Listening to someone speak and watching him or her at the same time is like that for me .
It is hard to do both , look and listen .
Although my stories of “ first experiences ” diminish with time , my awe for the mundane visual aspects of life does not .
Just looking out my hotel window right now and seeing the roof of the adjacent building and the cars going by , especially since I can't hear them , is exciting .
It is a definite treat to be able to find enjoyment in the mundane aspects of day - to - day life not to mention the really special moments and events , which have taken , place over the past three months .

Riding the Limo , a sleek black tandem , with my brother Patrick .
Hi Mike :
I want to share with your readers the exuberance , fear and excitement I had yesterday when you piloted the tandem for the first time .
I am probably the only fool who would get on the back of the tandem ( stoker ) and let you captain .
All I could think about is let ’s do it , but there was fear !
The fear came from ; no control , no brakes , ca n’t steer , your lack of experience , cars , speeding downhill , road rash , damaging our beautiful tandem ( The Limo ) .
For those of you not closely familiar with bike racing , road rash is the term , which describes the great joy of picking gravel out of one ’s body .
The exuberance and excitement far out - weighed the fear !
I am not certain why everything fell into place the way it did .
Looking at the back of your head I could see you smiling bigger than life , it reminded me of the first time I guided you on the ski slope .
It also reminded me of the trust you have to put in my hands when I captain the tandem or when a guide leads you down the ski slope .
My feeling of pride and of mutual accomplishment hit the stratosphere when you did a U - turn on the open road .
Not an easy task for even an experienced tandem captain and not moments before I told the ABC Camera crew , no way can he do a U - turn ; we 'll have to stop before crossing .
I checked the bike computer and we rode about 3 miles with you as the captain for the first time ; top speed , 21 mph , an adrenaline rush .
Next round , 30 mph , then 40 , but first a lobotomy for me .
Great fun !
Fantastic thrills .
Thanks for including me , thanks to your partners in crime at ABC World News Tonight , Jack Smith and Richard Sergay .

Looking through the eyes of the Summer Solstice
On March 7 , my vision went from light perception to 20/1000 in one eye .
Nothing will ever match that incremental increase .
Nonetheless , a set of binoculars sure gave me a whole new perspective , on things near and far , when I tried them for the first time , over 3 months later , on the Summer Solstice .
I had a low vision evaluation and may eventually get a collection of magnifiers for reading close up and far away .
No telling how long that might be .
There happen to be a pair of binoculars at the checkout counter and so I grabbed a pair , had a quick look at the checker and decided to buy them .
The first time I had a chance to experiment was at the falls above Fallen Leaf Lake near Tahoe .
I love the sounds and the power of pounding water , whether it is the waves or a waterfall .
There are so many audio nuances .
They are intricate and seductive and frightening .
Up close to these particular falls , I could not understand what someone was saying more than 2 feet away .
Over 30 feet away , it is not likely that I would hear a person yelling .
This is what frightened me that my kids could get in trouble and I would n't even know .
This time was different .
I put the binoculars to my face and all sorts of things I could barely see came leaping into view .
The intimidating roar of the water looked so soft and bubbly intermixed with darker ripples of calm .
The frothy white line wound its way through the cliff of brown and various shades of green .
A jagged line of treetops greeted the blue sky at the absolute top of my visual arc just prior to toppling over backwards .
Best of all , back close to the terra firma , was the sight of Carson and Wyndham happily climbing on the rocks .
Even though Jennifer was nearby to watch them , I felt safe being able to know where they were myself and it was fun to see them exploring .
It was a game for me to keep them in my binocular sights .
It was very weird to see so much movement and yet not be able to hear even the slightest sound from them because of the endless snowmelt cascading off Mount Tallac on its final plunge into the lake .
It was fun as well to see Jennifer when I would n't otherwise known where she was let alone being able to enjoy her beautiful trim physique .
She was n't the only pleasant female component of the scenery .
A friend was nice enough to mention that I should turn my glasses toward the lake and look for a raft .
It took a while but it was worth the effort to see a lithe young lady in a blue bikini .
Actually , I could n't tell her age but it is the idea that counts and my imagination was running rampant .
My arms were getting pretty tired from holding up the binoculars but I kept on gazing .
It was a tough choice , the woman or Mother Nature .
The complexity and detail of the falls and surrounding terrain regained my attention .
After methodically scanning the cliff , I began to recognize patterns .
One starkly white tree delineated the midpoint of the cliff .
I could never figure out just how those trees were rooted in what looked like a vertical slope .
It was simply " arm- aching " fascinating .
I would look at something and then take the binoculars away to see what I could see with the naked eye .
I could see the white of the falls but not the fluffy detail .
I could see the green shapes of the trees but not their individual branches .
I could see a dark line , defining the opposite end of the lake , 3 miles away but with binoculars I could see that the line was a tree and the gray line beyond I was told were mountains .
I could n't even find the raft with the naked eye , let alone the half - naked woman upon it .
To quantify these differences , my audio - only threshold among these roaring falls is about 10 feet , with my 20/1000 vision about 50 feet and with the binoculars about 300 feet .
Being so reliant on audio for so many years , I just can't get over a situation like this where the visual channel is so powerful .
Even with the binoculars , I can not see as much as a sighted person with 20 / 20 vision .
However , what I can see with my new low vision is interesting and the binoculars sure bring that sight even more to life .
It is these " visually virgin " experiences , which are so notable .
It is difficult in any event not to be overwhelmed by this incredible natural beauty as perceived by all the senses .
On a bright sunny June 21st at 6,400 feet , perched on a rock below the falls with the boys playing happily and safely nearby , my wife and good friends chatting on the terrace above me , it just does n't get any better .
Appreciating friends , family and nature was a fitting way to spend the Summer Solstice of 2000 , another first and certainly not the last .

Discovering the Stars
After another visual revelation this weekend , I wondered out loud if I should make a list of things at which I should take a look .
A friend said , " no , Mike it 's the fact that you are going ahead with life as usual which makes your learning experience so interesting for you and for your friends . "
This weekend was the 50th anniversary celebration at Enchanted Hills Camp for the Blind .
I attended this heaven - on - earth place in the Napa foothills starting in 1962 as a camper .
I worked there as a counselor and most other positions through the mid ' 80s .
My mother was the Camp Director for 11 years .
It really is a gorgeous place , and for me , it was a second home if not a first .
Saturday night , I was walking from the upper camp to the lower camp with my boys .
It was very dark and they were scared .
I was looking for anything to distract them from thinking about the dense dark woods around us .
When one of them mentioned the stars , I cultivated the conversation .
They told me how many stars they could see and in no time , we reached our cabin .
After the boys and Jennifer were asleep , I walked back up the hill , got my binoculars out of the car and headed for the Recreation Field , the most open place in camp , and , a place I had slept many times with fellow counselors telling me about the stars .
I laid down smack in the middle of the field , wrapped Josh 's leash around my leg and closed my eyes to reflect on being in this place in years past .
When I was ready , I opened my eyes and thought at first I was seeing stars , I mean seeing stars as in the expression .
There were all these white dots , so very many white dots .
When I looked through the binoculars , there were so many white dots I could n't possibly count them .
Back and forth , I went , glasses on , glasses off and they were the real thing , not an expression of my imagination , not a vision from a good author who made me think I was seeing them , this was the Real McCoy , seemingly near enough to touch .
What made it real was the feel of the grass I was laying upon , the dense black of the woods surrounding me , the small sounds of critters in those woods , the slightest of breezes and the musky smell of the earth and plant life near my face and carried by that breeze .
I did n't have to pinch myself to know it was real ; nature was doing that for me .
With the naked eye , I could count somewhere in the range of 25 to 35 stars .
With the binoculars , I could n't keep count .
The stars were too dense and the limited field of vision made it hard to keep track of which ones I had already counted .
It was just fun trying and looking for patterns , scanning for a shooting star .
Maybe if I had focused in one place for a while , I might have seen one although I am assuming it would be obvious .
Maybe it would move too quickly for me to notice .
I laid there for an hour or so , not really aware of time but finally noticing around Midnight it was getting chilly .
Some female counselors walking by on the road caught Josh and me in their flashlights and could not figure out what we were .
They stopped and were talking about wild dogs or a bobcat .
I finally stuck my arm up and waved and they laughed with nervous relief .
With that , and the thought of my boys being very refreshed in 6 hours , I climbed to my feet , shook off my damp clothes and headed for the cabin too .
Every so often I could catch a pinpoint of light through the canapé of trees as Josh guided me down the familiar road .
Strange to be seeing stars and yet needing a dog guide at the same time but that is typical of how this is working for me .
It does surprise me that I have not thought to look at the stars in 3 months of having vision and no one has asked me either .
To think , it was my 6 and 8 year - old boys who opened my eyes to the stars .
How sentimental to experience it in one of the best nature spots in the world .
" How sweet it is . "
( My friend Bryan 's comments when I told him of this experience )
" Outstanding !
I carry in my head all of the usual inspirational things about the stars , and their evocation of the deeper meaning of things .
There is that wonderful science fiction story which said if the earth 's conditions were just a little different , as the case with Venus , then the skies might only part once in a thousand years to reveal the stars .
Then , the story goes , the most profound social and emotional change would take place , as the supposed limits of being and imagination was expanded .
To be sure , I never have found your imagination to be circumscribed , but I wonder if the sight of the stars carried anything with it beyond their optical appearance .
A good point for a glass of beer . "

My first fireworks
I was in Louisville , KY and went with some friends from the Seeing Eye to the Buckhead Grill on the North bank of the Ohio River just over the border from KY in Jeffersonville Indiana .
My Seeing Eye dog Josh was with me at first along with my colleagues Kim and Roland .
It was a beautiful evening , not too humid , a breeze blowing and a pretty clear sky .
The Buckhead was a lively place especially with the prospect of fireworks .
Every table was taken and there was a 90 - minute wait , not so bad in a lazy setting like this .
When a few preliminary amateur fireworks went off , Josh started shaking .
He does n't like thunder and certainly not fireworks .
Drew , one of the Seeing Eye instructors drove me back to the hotel so I could put Josh inside where he would n't hear the fireworks and then we returned to the restaurant .
We had a fun dinner inside the restaurant and just after we finished , the crowd began forming on the deck .
We made a beeline for the deck as soon as the first explosions lit the sky .
Lukas Franck and Kim Burgess were my narrators as our whole group gathered to enjoy the celebration and to share in my first look at the fireworks .
I have never been a great fan of loud explosions .
They remind me of the explosion , which blinded me at age 3 , and they are a bit frightening from a percussive audio standpoint .
This old feeling about fireworks flew directly in the face of the visual experience .
There can't be any better contrast than flashing lights against a black sky .
The bursting patterns were challenging at first to understand but with some explanation from my friends , I began to see the star patterns , the changing colors , the raining lights , the columns and the bursts overlaying each other .
It looked like the circles of color were coming to embrace us .
I could n't tear my eyes away from this visual show and at the same time , my old reaction to the audio gave me an unsettled feeling .
My eyes began to fatigue and still I kept staring .
It did n't work to wait for a boom and then watch because the boom came after the visuals because of slower speed of sound versus light .
When the fireworks were over , I felt a little gitty and glad to close my eyes .
I put some drops in and then some of us walked back to the hotel , crossing the Second Street Bridge back over the Ohio .
We talked about the experience like we had just seen a play or the opera .
I was glad to be talking and thinking and not looking .
We had the calm river and breeze on one side of us and the cars whizzing by just a few feet away on the other .
It was just like the audio and visual components of the fireworks , intimidating and alluring at the same time .

Tarika from Madagascar
The Palms Playhouse is an old tin barn in a field on the outskirts of Davis , which has become , over the years , an intimate stopping point for excellent bands in transit to San Francisco and Berkeley .
The back row , where I used to sit so as not to be blasted by the band , ca n't be more than 30 feet from the stage .
Capacity including staff and the band is 125 .
Last night , I opted for a row closer to the stage so I could see the musicians .
We had no idea what Tarika would be like ; they were described as " a trippy band from Madagascar . "
And indeed they were , both in terms of what I could see and what I heard , plenty loud , 15 feet away from the band and in clear view , at least from my relatively new perspective .
The music and movement captivated me right away .
Five voices , 3 men and 2 women , harmonized perfectly and yet the notes were a bit foreign to my Western ear as you might expect from an island band from half way around the world .
The red guy on the left , who Jennifer described as " more gorgeous than a movie star " played no less than 6 instruments .
My favorite was a " Vali " which sounded like a hammer dulcimer but looked nothing like one .
The Vali was a 2 - inch bamboo tube , about 3 feet long with strings mounted lengthwise along the middle two thirds of the bamboo .
He also played drums , the accordion and a 4 - foot rectangle , which I did not get to check out closely .
I unfortunately did not get to check out closely either the band leader who Jennifer described as " an Amazon woman , beautiful , lean and very animated . "
I could see the animated part and colorful clothing including the gold shoes .
She wrote all the songs and introduced each with an articulate explanation of the politics , history and relationships the music was about .
This was important since the words were not in English .
Some were frenetic , some were lilting and all had tight rhythm even when the red guy was not playing a drum .
To the right of the red guy was the purple guy who played a variety of stringed instruments closely related to the guitar .
The beautiful female leader was center - stage , then a yellow / purple female vocalist / percussionist to the right and finally the blue bass guy on the far right .
They all moved , some more than others but this visual aspect of their performance entranced me .
The leader explained , " We believe that bad spirits of political corruption and sickness settle inside of those who stand still , literally and figuratively .
To have integrity and be healthy , you must move , you must shake the bad spirits out .
That is why we dance this way and this is why I have n't been sick in over 10 years . "
A thought flashed through my head as I watched them moving in unison and then individually that this is what a color organ looks like .
They appeared to move as visual reflections of the music and instruments they played .
There were times I was caught up in the music and could n't say if I was looking or listening , just feeling .
Other moments , I focused on one sense or the other .
A guy with a big head interrupted my view so I had to keep leaning to the side to see around him .
His girlfriend was dancing most of the time .
She looked pretty good too .
I almost drove him away when I began clacking my folded cane to the rapid beats .
I found a very cool way of interlacing the sections so I could keep up with the rapid fire of their fast songs .
I do n't know if he could hear me clacking or if the elastic cane handle was whipping him in the back .
I resisted the leader 's plea for us to get up and dance .
I was enjoying listening and looking , especially at her dancing .
Trying to dance myself would have made me concentrate on my own movement and not that of the band who managed to do so as one .
I was lost too in thoughts of a time I spent in Ghana , 24 years ago , one of the most profound experiences in my life .
Music can carry one away like no other medium , and it did , to that jungle of coconut palms on the coast of West Africa also half way around the world to a place full too of political corruption , subsistence living and beautiful people .
I 'll add Ghana to my list of places to put on my visual tour of the world along with Madagascar .
Maybe I 'll get lucky and see a lemur or even better an aye - aye .

“ Mike , are you tired of all the questions ? ”
The answer is , mostly no .
I do struggle with the fact that I do n't have all the answers .
I am still very much a rookie with this visual stuff .
I am constantly trying to figure things out , and I will give you some answers , just do n’t expect those answers to be definitive .
The answers are my best guess based on limited experience .
I get a little self - conscious when I am around friends or colleagues who have heard my spiel dozens of times and then I am asked by someone new to address the typical questions .
I do n't want to bore my friends or sound like a broken record .
My sister Ann was fun to “ see ” for the first time while I was attending the AER conference in Denver last week .
While walking down a “ happening ” street in down town Denver , Ann suddenly dragged me across the sidewalk to the street and stopped a horse drawn cart so I could check it out .
Only
Ann would have the zubes to do that so I went along .
A while later , we were sitting in a cafe and Ann exclaimed that a well - endowed woman had just come in wearing sequins and had bright pink hair .
When Ann began to stand up I quickly informed her that there was no need to bring the woman over to me , I would subtly check her out when we left the café .
I did n't mind Ann ’s enthusiasm or her questions .
The pink hair was really pink .
I might have thought it was a light bulb if she had n't told me ahead of time that it was hair .
I enjoyed the people watching , couples arm - in- arm , a wide variety of colors and clothes , lots of great smells and sounds emanating from the plethora of restaurants and clubs in that part of Denver .
It felt like the American version of the Ramblas in Barcelona where the evening stroll is the main event and the other stuff is just there as a setting .
It surprised me how many people stopped me and asked if I had been on television .
They were courteous and congratulatory .
It gave me a real sense of what national TV means when people from farm towns to big cities had seen the Dateline piece and recognized me on the street .
Many said that they were glad to see Josh still had a job .

" If it were n't real - I 'd invent it "
I will diverge from previous stories where I share details about the place I am visiting .
I will describe the experience of what I am seeing while keeping the place a secret .
High in the Jura mountains of Switzerland is a special place , which is one of the most stunning and undiscovered views in the world .
Long - time friends , Cass and Fiona , invited me to their chalet in this mountain hide - away to see visually what I have experienced before with my other senses .
In November 1999 , before my operations , I spent a weekend with them getting a play - by - play of mountain nature and vistas from Fiona who paints the most articulate and passionate word pictures imaginable .
Only my boys can match her enthusiasm about discovering the wonderments of nature and she can explain it far better .
Not only do you get a mental image of what she is describing ; you cannot help but be convinced that mother earth is the true essence of what is important .
Fiona was disappointed because it was raining when we got to the chalet .
Still , the countryside was fascinating to me as seen with my new vision and with her assistance .
Rain or shine , the Swiss mountains are pretty incredible , lush foliage , open spaces , jutting peaks , bright flowers , cows , quaint villages , ancient buildings and city lights .
We pulled off one single - track road so I could feel the stone barriers , which were erected to stop the movement of tanks across Switzerland .
All the times I have been to Switzerland and I do n't recall hearing about these barriers .
This time , I could see them and they were even more impressive when I felt the massiveness of their construction .
And , to think these stretched across much of the country .
Fiona tried ever so hard to point out Mont Blanc but amongst the clouds , I just could n't see it 100 miles away .
I could see Lake Geneva , the local peaks and even a house perched on a hillside across the valley .
I was quite happy to learn the color and shape of geraniums and to look at the varying colors of the fields and trees .
It just kept dumping rain so we had to be content with our cozy nest and closer up views .
I would n't have minded seeing some of the animals I have only read about in the Red Wall book series , Stoats , Voles and the like .
Some of these animals did appear as well as a deer and chamois but I could n't pick them out even with binoculars .
After all , the wildlife is designed to blend into its environment and I do best with good contrasts .
A good contrast would be for example ; the Golden Eagle and Red Tail Hawk we saw up close in a demonstration of birds of prey .
Taiga was a young female eagle that flew from her handler 's hand to the cliff above us .
We were nestled in a ravine at the bottom of what was until recently a ski jump .
Taiga flew back and forth , literally inches from our heads in proud avian glory .
I could n't believe how broad her wings were besides being 5 feet long .
The sound was sometimes powerful but fluttery and other times creaky and labored .
The sound of the Red Tail was familiar to me as it is native to the Western United States and reminds me of our former home in the foothills of Southern Oregon .
I could see his outline and colors quite well 10 feet away from the log where we were watching and in detail through the binoculars .
The handler spoke confidently in French about the habits and life style of these birds .
The sound of his voice echoing in the ravine , the cowbells jangling in the distance , Taiga screeching with nervous energy and this close - up view all made for a most dramatic and unique sensory and learning experience .
Early Sunday morning , I awoke to Fiona knocking on the door to inform me that it was a beautiful day and I should look out the window .
She was worried that the clouds would cover the clear sky and I would miss seeing Mont Blanc .
I knelt there at the window , in my underwear , rubbing the sleep out of my eyes and trying to hold the binoculars steady .
It is tricky to zero in on one mountain peak when they surround you and because they reach in layers into the distance .
Fiona says on a really clear day , you can see the Matterhorn .
We tried using trees and telephone poles as reference points so I could look just in the right spot .
The morning sky was a bit muddled so I was trying to sort out the clouds from the snow , from the mountains , from the sky .
Her desire to have me recognize Mont Blanc kept me going but my eyes and brain were getting tired .
I thought I discerned the triangle she was describing and so we left it for the time being .
We had quite a field day at the farmer 's market in the local village of Yverdon .
There were vegetables and fruits lined up in either direction as far as I could see in a multitude of colors .
It was a true visual orgy .
She could n't think of the English word for some of the items ; I could n't tell from touch or smell what they were either , probably something not common in our farmer 's market at home .
I love all the separate shops , one for cheese , another for bread ; some stands no more than 3 feet wide just selling homemade jam or olives .
I particularly like the jams , which give the date , and weather of the day they were prepared .
A weekend in the chalet would have not been complete without Cass 's home made dinner of cheese fondue and an exquisite bottle of 1983 champagne , pressed nearly as long ago as I met Fiona .
The latter was courtesy of Sir James who I had met on my previous visit .
We also had the pleasure of being invited to his chalet where I saw a different vista , a handcrafted lawn and his ceremonial swords from his military service .
I wo n't try to tell the story of those swords ; suffice it to say ; to get the true flavor , you must hear the stories told by Sir James himself .
I was a bit reticent when Fiona suggested walking to another vantage point to get a different angle on the Mont Blanc .
At the same time , I felt like I was learning more on each occasion I looked at the vistas through the binoculars .
She too was learning better how to assist me and , sure enough , I picked out Mont Blanc .
It looked so close .
I could now understand how the snow covered peaks differed from the clouds .
The peaks had a more constant jaggedness while the clouds were billowier .
Most important , there it was , clear as day , the triangle of Mont Blanc .
Part of why I could see it was because of the clearer sky but a lot had to do with practice over the past 2 days in viewing far away vistas .
The warming sun and the power of the mountain gave me goose bumps .
Seeing the mountain made me vividly picture those who have successfully climbed to the peak and the dozens each year who have been killed trying .
How fortunate that Mother Nature and one of her best friends , and mine , have shared with me another day and one of the most incredible natural experiences in the world .
It seems to be my formula , good friends or family , some earth and a challenge equals happiness .

Switzerland , Germany and England in one week
Switzerland was noteworthy because of visiting friends who I was seeing for the first time visually and because of the weekend in the mountains .
My friend Fiona was every bit as beautiful as I had pictured over the past 18 years and I dare say she was a little teary at our reunion .
I was quite happy to look at Fiona but an iridescent green shirt caught my eye as we were walking through the airport .
I was gently admonished for rubbernecking , as the woman wearing the shirt and shorts was also very attractive .
I need to speed up my analysis of these sites so I am not so easily busted .
I enjoyed taking the train from Yverdon Switzerland to Karlsruhe Germany .
On the first stretch , we followed Lake Geneva , which I had viewed the previous day from high among the mountains .
I did n't have anyone to coach me on what I was seeing but I enjoyed looking nonetheless and guessing .
The antiquity of Europe always strikes me in its contrast with the relative newness of the U.S.
A marvelous example of this was in the village of Horb in the Black Forest of Germany .
My friend Sigi and I went into a pub of sorts called Shiff , German for ship .
The wall , just outside the entrance , was painted with the tree of the family who had owned it since 1545 .
Not only was the building still standing and being operated as a pub , the original family still owned and ran it .
The church towers look pretty neat against the sky too .
There was a church next to the pub in Horb .
At my next city , I saw the Cathedral of Coventry England .
The shell of the old church was next to the grand new cathedral .
A Polish gypsy group was performing within this old shell .
There is quite a story about how Churchill knew Coventry would be bombed but he could n't warn the people or it would be known to the Germans that the British had their secret codes .
Over 1000 people died in the bombing .
I spent my last night before returning to the states on an adventure into London .
I dropped off my cases at a hotel at Heath Row airport and took the underground into the city and back .
There are 21 stops from Heath Row Terminal 4 to the Covent Garden underground stop .
They do n't , much to my dismay , announce the stops .
I got quite annoyed about this and tried to walk from my train car into the next so I could speak to the conductor or engineer .
This was n't possible .
I did find an emergency box with a glass tube but I was n't quite annoyed enough to see what would happen if I broke it .
I can't believe the blind people of the UK have n't screamed bloody murder about this most rudimentary access issue .
I was headed into the city to see the play , Buddy , which it turns out , was 6 left / rights away from the stop .
I did n't of course figure this out until I finally got to the theater .
When I asked an Indian restaurant waiter for directions , he asked , " Who is going to take you there ? "
I explained that I had made it this far from California and I reckoned I could make it the last few blocks to the theater on my own .
The play was okay but the theater was too hot so I adjourned to an Italian sidewalk cafe for a late night dinner .
It was a fabulous people - watching spot , a streetlight was overhead and the sidewalk was on my good side , my right side .
Remember , I can see colors , shapes a movement pretty well but not details .
People come in so many shapes and sizes and I think I saw one of each on that bustling London street corner .
High heels have a distinct sound and now I see they also cause women to walk differently ; it looks painful or maybe that is just my mind 's eye speaking .
I never tired of the variety of people and situations milling around me as I savored my pasta , vino , salad and chocolate moose .
I reluctantly gave up my people watching to head back to the hotel and an early - morning flight .
I almost missed my stop on the return trip as its easy to lose track after midnight when counting to 21 .
I can't believe they do n't call out the stops especially when they occasionally come on the loud speaker to tell people , " mind the doors , mind the doors . "
I would n't mind a few station announcements .
RRRRR !

Totally blind again for a day
On a routine follow - up eye exam , Dr. Goodman informed me that the stitches were ready to come out .
He first suggested taking them out right there in the office but then on further reflection , he said , " We should really do this in the operating room just in the rare case that something goes wrong . "
So , we scheduled 2 more visits to San Francisco this week to perform this hospital procedure , which , relative to my two major eye surgeries , was pretty minor .
My apprehension level was high however when they rolled me into the operating room for the third time in 9 months .
Even though the procedure was relatively minor , there was still the anesthetic to deal with , which I hate , and the whole formal hospital routine had to be played out .
I did n't like the idea either of them messing with my newly acquired vision .
As expected , there were no problems .
I was awake enough during surgery to feel Dr. Goodman poking around in my eye but not enough to do anything about it .
It was like a bad dream , which you can't quite wake up from .
I have to admit that my apprehension continued after the surgery .
I lay there in the recovery room with my eye patched , not knowing for sure that everything was still intact .
Once I could walk safely , we left the hospital and went to have lunch with a friend in the area .
It was very weird with the eye patch on and being a total again .
Being woozy from the drugs increased my feeling of ineptness .
Still , I went to lunch , it was a beautiful day and the warmth of the sun and my friends eventually got me grounded again .
Over the course of the next day wearing the patch , I thought about how it felt to be a total in terms of whether or not my skills had changed in 5 months .
I had in fact gotten a little rusty ; nothing I could n't get back in a day or two but it was interesting that the edge had worn off my sense of the space around me .
It reminded me how subtle the bits of information are that make the difference between average and good mobility .
These bits are so subtle that if you think about them , you lose them .
I thought of the times people would ask me , " how did you know that person was there or that doorway was there ? "
When you want to be mobile and you have no visual information to distract you , these subtle bits of information begin to trigger a response to one 's environment .
I had a better sense of these subtleties having been a total , gotten some sight , which interfered with the subtle information , and then been put in this position of having no vision for a day .
I returned to San Francisco for the third time this week .
Even the patches coming off again gave me a funny feeling .
Sure enough , the eye looked fine and I could see the same as two days previously .
This was a wake up call reminding me that I am still in that 50 - 50 - percentage zone where the transplant could reject .
I do n't want to get too cocky about this new low vision .
I do n't want to let those subtle mobility skills get rusty .
I want to continue enjoying the strong skills of a blind person and the emerging skills of a low vision person .

Mostly good but different
At nearly six months of vision , it seems that the more time I spend looking at things and figuring things out , the better I get at seeing .
In 9 days at Fallen Leaf Lake , I got lots of hours gazing about , sometimes with binoculars in hand , other times just seeing what I could figure out with the naked eye .
It is easy to start imagining things when looking at a forest or the many shades and contours of a mountainside .
When it was pretty smooth , I could gaze around and let my mind wander as I wind surfed one and half miles across the width of Fallen Leaf .
When the going got rough wind surfing , and I really had to struggle to balance , I screwed my eyes shut .
The slightest visual influence was distracting to my concentration .
I have wind surfed for years on this lake and usually found my way back to our dock with little or no assistance .
I usually carry a waterproof radio in case I really get off course .
On this trip , I forgot the charger so I had no radios .
I had to rely strictly on my vision and feeling of the wind to help me find my way back .
I can see the docks from as much as a half mile away but I can't tell which dock is ours until I am 100 yards away .
By the time I am within 100 yards , I can usually hear my kids so the vision probably got me into more trouble than it got me out of .
It 's not so bad because the worst that can happen is that I end up at a neighbor 's house and maybe miss dinner or maybe I find a better dinner up wind .
I did manage to get lost once but I made it back in time for dinner .
It was interesting to be able to see other boats in my vicinity .
I could see in which direction they were but I could better judge their distance by sound .
Visually , distances are hard for me to judge over water .
I liked trying to make sense of the ripples and waves .
Were they the leading edge of a strong wind or was it simply the wake from a boat ?
Again , my sense of the wind by feel was more accurate than what I could figure out from seeing the ripples .
In fact , looking at the water distracted me from the subtleties of feeling the wind , which is a big part of wind surfing .
I enjoyed using the binoculars to watch Wyndham jump off a rock at Angora lake .
In this way , I could sit at the picnic table on my lazy behind to observe him rather than swimming out in the cold water to check him out up close .
Life is full of trade offs and this certainly goes for the use of vision .

Watching the Olympics
Until the Olympics came on television this past week , I have found little motivation to look at a television screen .
I loved seeing video of my boys when they were babies and I have tried occasionally to see parts of various programs .
The pictures usually move too fast for me to get a fix on them and make sense of what I am seeing .
Movie screens are a little better but the subject must stay still for me to sort out what I am seeing .
What have I been able to see ?
The 10 - meter platform women divers have been fun to watch .
My brain struggles to fathom the twists and turns the divers make .
They are so talented and so athletic looking .
The slow motion replays are perfect for me to confirm what I think I saw in the dive .
The contrast against the blue pool is perfect for me .
I watched the cycling tonight and learned to know who some of the riders were by the colors of their uniforms .
I could even discern the anguish on the faces of some of the competitors .
I could n't believe how packed together they were .
I have been on a horse going over a jump before but I have to say that my mental image of a horse jumping was different than what I saw for the first time on the screen .
The way the horse stretched forward and bunched their back feet was interesting and different than I imagined .
I have ridden a lot over the years and think of it in terms of smell , feel and emotion .
I seldom have thought of it visually .
It was beautiful to watch because the other senses are n't much good if you can't be on the horse yourself .
I do n't get much sense of the running competitions .
I need some perspective and some sounds to clue me in .
The roar of the crowd is my favorite part of the running .
It is interesting to see the different outfits the runners wear but I can't even tell who is in front because of the camera angle and the way they are staggered .
I have been at two Winter Olympics , Sarajevo and Calgary .
I have been at several Paralympic competitions and ran a torch mile for the LA Olympics .
I sure hanker to be in Sydney for the full Olympic spectator experience but short of that , watching it on television with the enthusiasm of my boys drowning out the announcer , is a fun runner up way to participate .
It is ironic that the boys make it hard for me to hear and now my big head close to the screen makes it hard for them to see .
Good thing the Olympics only last for another week or I might be tempted to get one of those obnoxious big - screen televisions .
We are already talking of taking the family to Salt Lake City for the 2002 games .

A Mobility Wake Up Call
After being totally blind for 43 years and partially sighted for 7 months , I am still learning to use my vision but getting pretty good at using low vision in my mobility bag of tricks .
I find that using my Seeing Eye dog or a cane works best for mobility hence freeing up my limited vision for looking around .
If I use my vision for mobility , I can't do any sight seeing .
Today was a grooming day for me and for my dog .
I used a cane for my walk to the groomers and hair - cutting salon .
Instead of sweeping the cane as I did when I was a total , I now walk with the tip on the ground in a cross - body position .
This seems to work most of the time .
As I neared the hair salon , I wove in and out of obstacles on the sidewalk using my vision .
My cane picked up a hose across the sidewalk and I congratulated myself on my mobility skills .
Right in the middle of that thought , I found myself sprawled on the concrete .
It happened so fast like the " mobility cockiness God " cut me off at the knees .
In fact , there were gray concrete benches , which blended in beautifully with the sidewalk .
While my cane picked up that hose , it missed the concrete bench and I did n't .
I hobbled into the hair salon to get my name on the waiting list and to get a Kleenex as I felt blood dripping down my leg .
The receptionist got rather excited when she saw the blood pooling on the floor in front of all their customers .
She ran to the bathroom to get a paper towel .
Someone was in there so she beat on the door .
Mean time , the pool was expanding .
They got me to one of those hair sinks where I got washed up and eventually stopped bleeding .
This was the first time I had seen blood .
Wow , was it red swirling around in that sink !
It is ironic that I was in route to get my Seeing Eye dog when this injury happened .
It definitely would not have happened if I had been using my Seeing Eye dog rather than my sloppy cane technique .
All in all , I lost a little blood and pride but gained a mobility wake - up call .
They say 4 - wheel drive is actually worse than 2 - wheel drive because you just get stuck further from home .
There may be some similarity between a 4 - wheel vehicle and this low vision stuff .
Blind or sighted , cane or dog , it pays to watch where you are going and your body pays if you do n't .
UC San Diego eyesight evaluation
October 3 , 2000
Ione , Geoff and the Brian imaging team at Stanford ( Brian Wandell , principally ) are quite interested in doing some brain scans to assess how well your visual cortex responds to visual input .
Part of the interest in that would relate to long - term plasticity , so it would be nice if you were available for long - term follow up ( and the same applies to the tests we did here ) .
I attach Ione 's summary of what we learned from the tests .
The preliminary results of the first vision evaluation of Mike May by Dr. Ione Fine :
The results of the Stanford FMRI evaluation of Mike May by Dr. Ione Fine :
Some key points :
(1) ACUITY .
Your acuity for grating patterns is about 20/450 .. not good of course , but better than your previously assessed letter acuity .
Since the interference patterns were as difficult to see as external targets ( or more so ) , this probably reflects neural rather than optical limitations ( as suggested also by Dr. Goodman 's reports of a clear fundus ) .
We do n't know how much , if any , improvement you could expect over time with the use of your new vision .
We do know that improvements can occur on a very slow time scale .
We do n't know much about the role of practice , concentration and determination in affecting such improvements .
Before your age - 3 accident , you would have had essentially normal adult - level vision .
If the accident caused no major neural damage to the retina around the center of gaze , we would tentatively expect you to experience at least a bit of slow improvement .
I compared the situation to second language learning , but that analogy may be misleading .
Someone like you who is quite accustomed to doing six impossible things before breakfast could outperform the average guy on most learning tasks , but we do n't know whether those personal qualities are helpful in this particular situation or not .
My guess , based on accounts of previous cases of restored vision , is that they will help , assuming that you do choose to make considerable use of your limited vision and to try to refine it .
We would be happy to confer with you about prospects for improvement .
It 's encouraging that your tracking and eye movement control are pretty good , and that you experience benefits in clarity when you look at something directly .
(2) DEPTH
You did surprisingly well on constructing 3D perceptual representations from the 2D retinal image using perspective - related cues like occlusion and motion parallax .
These are cues that have analogs in the tactile world ( and perhaps you have thought about them at an abstract level ) .
Interestingly , however , you seemed to be starting absolutely from scratch in another aspect of depth perception -- the use of shading to assess shape .
Although this has no counterpart in the tactile world , it is crucial for 3D form perception in normally sighted adults , who use shading instantly and without conscious effort to infer 3D shape .
You , on the other hand , had to start to figure out the connections between shading and shape as a mathematical exercise .
Perhaps with practice , this will become more automatized , as it must have been automatic when you were three ?
We do n't know for sure , but getting there is a major part of the job of learning to see that still lies ahead .
(3) ILLUSIONS
You are impressively free from some illusions that beset normal vision -- illusions that reflect the constructive processes involved in the perception of 3D objects .
For instance , when an image contour is seen as belonging to a receding surface , normally sighted subjects overestimate the height of that image region ... it is as if they err in the direction of assigning it its 3D extent , which is greater for a receding surface than for a straight up surface of the same image height .
You do n't make this mistake .
You also do n't ( at present ) see " illusory contours " that normally sighted people generate across a physically uniform image region .
These are interpolations of the contours of a " preconsciously inferred " object , that is visible only in bits .

Possible glitch with the transplant
October 7 , 2000
When I was in for an eye check - up a month ago , I was hoping to hear that we could discontinue the anti rejection drugs as planned .
Instead , I learned that I had to keep the drugs going because another surgery was possible .
Six months into my healing from surgery and regaining of sight , Dr. Goodman and Dr. Carson noted a segment of the stem cell tissue looked unhealthy .
They had me putting artificial tears in my eye every waking hour to minimize dryness .
In spite of this measure , they explained that a portion of the tissue was dry and might reject .
The possible solution was to replace this unhealthy segment with new stem cell tissue .
Inserting a patch of new tissue involves risks .
On the one hand , it is important to replace a bad segment before it gets worse and before we are further into the healing process .
On the other , performing surgery and risking infection can jeopardize the transplants .
It is a tough call and so we compromised .
We decided to wait and see how it looked in a few weeks .
Two weeks later , I returned with a fair degree of apprehension .
I did not want to go through surgery again with all its associated downtime and discomfort .
Fortunately , the dryness had cleared up somewhat but there was still some concern .
They told me to keep cranking in the teardrops and to discontinue the cyclosporen drops .
Then , I should discontinue the cyclosporine pills in 3 weeks and see them a week after that .
Because there are a host of potential side effects of the cyclosporine , I am happy to be ending its use .
On the other hand , I do n't want to have come this far and have the transplants reject .
This is another of the major milestones that started just over a year ago .
Seven months into this adventure , I would prefer not to lose the vision I now enjoy .
I am still confident in saying life was just fine without vision but that does n't mean I am not enjoying what I have .
After all , making the most of what you have is the operative philosophy here and it would n't be fitting to be inconsistent .
In a week , I will discontinue the cyclosporine and in two weeks , we will see where we are without the anti rejection and what is up with that dry patch .

Another visual first on an airplane
When I started this journal in March , I wrote about the first time I looked out the window of an aircraft .
I still enjoy looking out the window from time to time but I find myself more often caught up in what happens inside the cabin .
At least 50 percent of the time I fly , I find myself in a medium to long conversation with my seatmate .
On a flight from Washington DC to Denver last week , I had one of those take - off to landing non -stop conversations with a young woman from the DC area .
She introduced me to a new visual experience , which I will tell you about in a moment .
It never ceases to amaze me how much personal information people share in these situations .
Maybe it 's the anonymity , maybe I am less threatening because I am blind , perhaps it is High Altitude Sharing Syndrome or maybe it is the interesting stories and openness about blindness I share that makes them reciprocate .
People tell me about the problems their kids have , their trials and their tribulations .
Many of these folks stay in my memory and some I have had occasional contact with .
For example , Ray was an IBM Executive I met in 1985 on a flight to Japan .
I just got an email from him the other day .
Bill was a founder of a major electronics company who had a Golden Retriever who traveled everywhere with him .
I have stayed at Bill 's place in Aspen on a ski trip .
I met a wonderful woman who is the owner of a high - end Napa winery ; another woman who is the CEO of a major electronic chip company ; a guy whose daughter was struck by lightening and lives now with a 20 - minute memory capacity .
Fascinating folks who shared a slice of their lives with me in 5 intense hours or less .
Back to Ms DC to Denver .
We compared notes about our former top - secret government jobs without actually saying anything about what we did .
She has a new job now , which entails less travel and suits her better for having a child .
When I told her that I worked on a GPS navigation system for the blind , she asked , " did I see you on television ? "
We quickly determined that she had seen the NBC Dateline piece .
She says that she watches many of these evening magazine shows which her husband hates because they are on late and he likes to go to bed early .
We then evolved to discussing what I can now see .
Inevitably , she asked what I could see of her .
Since she was on my left side , I had not had the chance to look at her with my good right eye .
I turned to face her and said I could see blonde hair and the color of her clothing .
She asked if I could tell what color her eyes were and I said only up close .
She then leaned up close and asked again .
This is where it got interesting .
Eyes are quite amazing visually .
I have only looked closely at my wife 's and at my boy 's eyes .
I have to be 6 inches or closer and I need a couple seconds to stare to see any detail .
I would term my visual range for seeing eyes , " kissing distance . "
It is quite unsettling looking into someone 's eyes especially when you are n't used to it .
When Ms. DC to Denver casually leaned close enough for me to stare into her eyes , I could n't even stammer out the answer that her eyes were blue .
I might have been less shocked if she had taken her shirt off and asked what I could see .
I had never seen someone 's eyes other than my family 's and it was very disconcerting .
Although I was tongue tied , she was very sweet about it and probably did n't notice I was flustered .
This was a very intimate experience for me and I can't fathom how sighted people go around seeing each other 's eyes without being flustered too .
I understand a bit better now why so much is made of expressions in the eyes as it is talked about and written about passionately and poetically .
I will certainly remember Ms. DC to Denver for introducing me to yet one more mystery of the sighted world .

A major medical milestone
I was more than a little nervous a week ago when I stopped the Cyclosporine anti rejection drug .
I was pleased to stop because of the potential side - affects of the drug but worried about an increased possibility of tissue rejection .
Nonetheless , Dr. Goodman felt that the eye had been quite good over the past 7 months and despite a small dry patch of tissue , it was prudent to discontinue the Cyclosporine .
All four of the doctors in the office had a look at my eye yesterday and concurred that it still looked healthy .
The dry patch appeared stable ; no deterioration due to being off the anti rejection drug .
I was immensely relieved to hear this .
Also to mark this day in the evolution of my new vision , I spent a couple hours at Stanford University getting my brain scanned and mapped .
Dr. Ione Fine from UC San Diego took me to the Stanford Lab where they have one of the best Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( FMRI ) facilities in the world and experts in conducting and analyzing the data .
What they wanted to find out is what visual stimuli my visual cortex is seeing versus what I perceive .
My doctors say that my eye looks as clear as a person 's eye with 20 /40 or 20/60 vision because of a small cataract .
So , why do I perceive what I see at a level of 20/1000 if the visual data is good as far as the retina ?
There are some areas they can't scan between the retina and the visual cortex .
Maybe the visual data is lost there .
Maybe it is getting to some level of the visual cortex but I do not yet understand the data .
My curiosity about these questions and my inability to turn down a new experience , led me to agree to spend two hours in this FMRI tube at Stanford .
It was incredibly loud .
The first general scan sounded like a new age band made up of a giant dryer with a pair of ski boots being tumbled around plus an enormous set of bag pipes being played in Grace Cathedral .
I would have hummed along but I was warned not to move a muscle while they were scanning .
Another type of scans sounded more like a laser warfare video game at 150 decibels .
I had earplugs in so it was n't terrible .
In fact , for the last 15 minutes of the experiments , I had a hard time staying awake .
It was a perverse treat to be able to remain perfectly still during normal working hours .
Pretty rare for me .
It will take 2 weeks or more for them to process the data and see what has been learned so far .
It is likely that I will have to experience more FMRI scans before the data is conclusive .
I am happy to help this team of Brian , Ione , Alex , Alis and Jonathan with their scientific efforts to understand visual processes .
Two " someones " donated his or her eye tissues to help me out .
It is the least I can do for science to spend some time being a Ginny pig regardless of whether it helps me personally .
Besides , they are half - kidding me that I have the visual - motion capabilities of a cat .
I can't help being curious about that .

Galapagos , An IMAX Experience
I visited the Galapagos in 1983 with a girl friend and it ranks as one of the most incredible places I have been in the world .
I wondered what it would be like to see the animals and life of these islands on the big screen , 60 feet high , with 12000 watts of multi-channel sound .
I saw one IMAX film previously , Fly at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C .
The Galapagos IMAX was n't quite as stunning to me as Fly .
The contrasts were n't ideal for me as the animals were often mixed against a multi-colored background of vegetation .
After all , animals are designed to blend in with their surroundings , which happen to be bad for my visual acuity .
Some of the birds were pretty clear against the sky .
When I saw the giant Galapagos tortoise on the screen , I could fill in the blanks and details from my memory of touching this amazing creature .
I remember feeling a puffy area on its throat which deflated with a sound like sighing .
I could n't see the throat per say on the screen but it seemed like I could .
They handed out 3D glasses to enhance the visual experience .
I got absolutely no benefit from these glasses .
Jennifer said things were much clearer with the glasses .
She tried covering one eye and said it was still better with the glasses on .
I wonder how these 3D glasses work optically because they made no improvement for me .
No matter how big the screen or the sound , there is nothing like being there in person unless you were talking about watching a football game from the 4th level .
It was fun to go with my children and family to see this most spectacular movie .
It just reminds me that the Galapagos is a place I want to take my kids to see and a place I want to check out again myself .

Incremental Improvements
Upon looking at how life has changed 8 months after regaining low vision , the practical advantages of having sight fall into different categories .
There are some minor travel benefits to seeing like being able to see when the person in front of me in line moves forward .
I got around pretty well before having sight and I still cannot drive , so life is not that different now .
It is certainly incredible to see scenery and people although I can't say this has changed how I function , it has added an additional component to life .
The incremental changes are not what you might think , certainly I would not have pegged these differences 8 months ago .
Top on my list is being able to catch a ball in the air .
This is pretty hard to do if you are totally blind and now I can play ball with my boys and catch the ball 80 % of the time it is thrown to me .
I have spent half my life chasing a ball around in one way or another so this is a big deal .
Jennifer laughs at how I can now sort the laundry colors properly .
I used to be a fan of throwing them all in together and washing them on the warm cycle .
Invariably , we would end up with pink under shirts .
Now , it is a kick to be able to clearly sort the laundry into separate white and colored loads .
Life is good !
I have n't done much with reading print yet .
I would have thought this would be a big advantage .
I am so accustomed to braille and synthesized speech on my computer that I rarely look at the screen or at a piece of paper .
I do need practice and magnification to become proficient with sight reading .
I have n't yet gotten the tools I need or taken the time to practice .
So far , I have read labels or titles just for fun and not because I need to .
Odd that when you sum it all up , catching a ball is the most practical improvement I have experienced so far .

Upsetting News
I was stunned today when Dr. Goodman looked into my eye for the standard check - up and immediately said , " Mike , we have a vigorous rejection going on . "
He asked if I had experienced any light sensitivity , discomfort or blurriness .
I said , nothing , which was obvious .
The deduction then is that stopping the cyclosporine anti rejection drugs 3 weeks ago must have set the stage for this rejection .
I am numb and reacting academically about this news .
Just this morning , I gave a talk and mentioned as I always do that there is a 50 - 50 chance of rejection .
And here I am , shifting from the 50 % success column to the 50 % rejection column .
I have n't noticed any blurriness yet so it can feel academic .
Judging from Dr. Goodman 's reaction , this is quite serious .
The action is to crank up all the drugs .
He gave me a steroid injection in the eye .
I start the cyclosporine immediately along with other drops .
It takes a few weeks for the body to acclimate to the cyclosporine .
I will go back to San Francisco the next couple days for more steroid injections .
Dr. Goodman says that these rejections can be reversed but this one is fairly far along , maybe 10 days .
I will have many more " what if " questions when I see him again tomorrow .
I can't even write this down coherently let alone think of the right questions to ask .
Now is the time to rally my personal fortitude and your good vibes .
My son Carson wants to know if the eye rejects , do I get my money back .
November 16 , 2000
Follow Up
I noticed a bit of blurriness today as we made the long drive to the docs in SF .
Dr. Goodman gave me another shot in the eye , this time with Cortisone .
He said some of the cells , which were clumped up yesterday , had disappeared today .
Still , the back of the cornea , the endothelial was still cloudy .
These are the cells which drain the moisture from the cornea and keep it clear .
I will now start taking a new anti rejection drug called Cellsept on top of all the other drugs they are throwing at this situation .
Back to the city several times in the next week .
Stay tuned .
November 17 , 2000
Third day at the Doc's
As I walked East on Bush street , coming from Dr. Goodman 's office and headed for the Ferry Building , I was relying primarily on my cane to keep me from crashing into the many people and obstacles .
It was a beautiful crisp day with a warm feeling in the air and happy people hurrying home from work on a Friday for an extended Thanksgiving weekend .
San Francisco really was at its best and I was absorbing every inch of it , one cane sweep at a time , not even minding the near misses by cars darting out of drive ways , although I would use the occasion to open my eye despite the pain to see what was happening .
It was about a mile and a half walk , mostly down hill and not too many turns that I remembered .
I was lost in my thoughts about this cornea rejection and did n't feel like interrupting that train of thought to ask directions .
When I crossed the first set of cable car tracks that clued me into Powell Street .
When the people traffic got really thick , I knew it was Montgomery Street and the Financial District .
When I hit the bricks , I knew it was Market Street and I again opened my eye to confirm that they were indeed the red bricks of Market Street .
By this time , my eye was feeling much better and I forced it to stay open when I saw the Ferry Building several blocks East at the end of Market , gleaming in the afternoon sun .
I kept my cane sweep moving quickly so I could avoid the growing number of obstacles while focusing on that sunlit spire ahead of me .
There were some tricky crossings and now I used my vision again to help me negotiate them .
I was definitely feeling much better .
As I day - dreamed along Market Street , I recalled my flight to Phoenix last night and how I was absorbing every visual thing I could in case I lost my vision .
I exclaimed to Kim every time I saw lights in the sparsely populated route we were flying .
I learned from my talking GPS that these were places like , Coledale Search Light , Bullhead , Kingman and finally Phoenix .
It was so uniform and massive from the sky .
I was appreciating everything and everybody I saw last night and this morning just in case .
I flew back from Phoenix this morning after being the Keynote speaker at a technology conference in order to get another injection .
After two injections , my eye was pretty sensitive to all the drops I was putting in .
I was n't looking forward to yet another jab in the eyeball .
And , boy was I right .
This third shot really hurt .
This was n't your average poke in the eye , this was a needle full of a mega dose of Cortisone and did it hurt !
I waited in the Doctor 's office for a while to let the pain subside but finally I had to head to catch my 3:30 ferry and so off I went , cotton swab pressed to my eye with one hand and my cane in the other .
It was n't until the beauty of the San Francisco afternoon captured me and I could take my hand down that I thought about the good news from the doctor .
" The eye is continuing to clear up .
He said the rejection seems to be turning around .
We normally give two injections but we are giving you three just to make sure .
Now we just have to turn things over to your body and the immune suppressant drugs .
See you back here in 4 days . "
This was very encouraging news although he cautioned that we were n't out of the woods yet , an obvious analogy as I moved through the heart of " The City . "
Once I got my eye open and could leave it open , I was really enjoying everything visual , small and large .
I braved the last major crossing in front of the Ferry Building .
I then turned left and followed an interesting pattern in the sidewalk .
Pigeons were walking and flying all around .
Yellow machines were parked on the street and sidewalk .
Bright orange fencing closed off a big hole in the parking lot .
Just after the fencing , I turned into the lot and headed for the wooden dock with a round tent looking structure on it .
I could now hear the waves against the pier and see the water and things sticking out of it .
Seagulls screeched and flitted by .
I kept going , right out on the wooden peer , through the doors with my rolling bag clacking along behind me sounding like a train on the tracks .
The wooden pier gave way to a metal pier and I found a place on the rail in line to wait for the Vallejo ferry .
I took in the pylons jutting out of the water and the many boats coming and going around the busy pier .
Just looking at the flowing ripple of the water enchanted me .
As our ferry coasted in , I watched to see how they tied it up .
A guy reached out with a pole and hooked a tie line , which he secured to the boat .
The people moved forward to board the ferry and I realized I was no longer thinking about the eye discomfort .
It was so fun to see all the activity around the pier and just following the line of people into the ferry visually was a pleasure .
I took my favorite seat near a window and settled in for the beautiful ride across the SF Bay .
I may not be out of the woods yet , but I am more confident than ever that things will work out and if they do n't that too is for a good reason .

Fourth rejection visit
I thought I was off the hook with those Cortisone shots but I got another one today .
Dr. Goodman wanted to make extra sure that the rejection is reversed .
The shot was n't as bad this time .
The cornea has cleared on the upper half and is still cloudy on the lower portion .
They should know in a couple weeks how this is going to progress .
Even if it clears up altogether , there may be some long term damage to the cells from the rejection .
We 'll deal with that when the time comes .
For now , the news is good and the eye is headed in the positive direction .
November 29 , 2000
A week without any injections
Looks like the " full court press " has turned the cornea rejection around .
After a week without injections , but lots of other medications , and 2 weeks since the rejection was first observed , the report is good .
The top two thirds of the cornea is clear ; the bottom one third is still swollen .
Dr. Goodman feels that we caught the rejection and turned it around with the best possible results .
He cannot say if the cornea will clear up as good as before the rejection .
As long as I am diligent about my hourly drops and daily pills , the eye may continue to improve .
At my current level of visual processing , I do n't notice any degradation in vision .
I am still having a blast , looking and learning , every moment and every day .

Second Time Skiing
First day of the 2000 - 2001 ski season and it was fantastic !
I skied with family and friends at Kirkwood , a beautiful sunny day and we were practically the only ones there .
It could n't have been better for testing out my new vision on the slopes .
I am able to follow my guide without the guide calling constant verbal directions , as they would do in the past .
Their main job is to steer me away from low - contrast items like bamboo obstacle markers or skiers in white suits lying on the snow .
I have never run into anyone in 20 years of skiing without sight and I do n't want to start now .
It will take many more days of practice before I can use my vision effectively on the slopes .
I can however ski open and uncrowded runs by myself as long as a guide is nearby and watching out for people and obstacles .
We did this often today and I enjoyed the freedom of making my own turns .
The bright sun on the snow makes it so I can see ripples and moguls as well as the tree line and even rocks poking through the snow and certainly lift - towers .
The challenge right now is that I can look only for one type of thing at a time .
I have to focus on that one thing and my processing time for what I see is still slow .
By the time I see a rock while skiing , I usually can't avoid it .
If I am looking for rocks , I can't see the bamboo obstacle markers .
If I am looking for those markers , I can't see the rocks .
I stop to admire the panorama , which takes all my concentration .
That is by far the most stunning part of having some vision on the slopes in the beautiful Sierra Mountains , that and watching our boys ski .
I guess I 'll just have to ski as much as possible so I can get better at visual multi tasking .
It is fascinating to experiment and to keep having little visual break through experiences .
It is all part of

The deafening weapon looks innocuous at first glance
Yet pirates who tried to hijack a liner off the coast of Somalia met something a little more sophisticated than a warning shot across the bow .
The crew of the Seabourn Spirit quickly changed course and headed out into open water to evade the attackers in small boats who had raked the vessel with rockets and automatic weapons fire .
They also deployed a military - grade sonic weapon .
The long range acoustic device , or LRAD , is a high - tech loudhailer capable of causing permanent damage to hearing from a distance of more than 300 metres ( 984ft ) .
Commissioned and designed after the al - Qaeda attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 , the device 's manufacturer , the American Technology Corporation ( ATC ) , calls the LRAD a " non-lethal weapon " with a wide range of uses .
The LRAD typifies a new generation of hi-tech weaponry being deployed in conflict zones .
US troops have also used the LRAD in action in the Iraqi cities of Falluja and Baghdad , and it was deployed for crowd control in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
The LRAD uses a high energy acoustic beam - in layman 's terms , a very loud noise - to disable and disorientate a opponent or a crowd .
The units , which measure 84 cm ( 33 inches ) across and weigh 20kg ( 45 lb ) , cost roughly $ 30,000 ( £ 17,200 ) each .
It is an option becoming increasingly popular on board the world 's cruise ships , AJ Ballard of ATC told the BBC News website .
" With all the things going on in the world today , if you have a $ 1bn ship and you can have the ability to make yourself understood at a distance , you 'll take it , " said Mr Ballard .
While it remains unclear whether the Seabourn Spirit 's deployment of the LRAD had an effect on the pirates , ATC boasts that it can issue a " warning tone that influences behaviour and determines intent at safe stand - off distances " .
Tour brochures made no mention of high - grade military defences
The manufacturers say the device can also be used as a loudspeaker , enabling operators to be heard " with authority " above the din of a battle , whether in the desert or on the high seas .
Security is an increasing concern for tour operators entrusted with the safety of thousands of passengers each year , most of whom have dug deep for fees that are often more than $ 10,000 ( £ 5,500 ) a trip .
" Most of the security guys [ on cruise ships ] are retired US and British naval officers .
We show them the latest and greatest and they 've decided it 's something they can use , " said Mr Ballard .
He praised the cruise sector for being awake to the dangers posed by pirates and , possibly , terrorists .
The security staff on board the Seabourn Spirit also won Mr Ballard 's praise .
" We train all the crew in how to adequately operate the device .
This time the head of security was an ex-Gurkha from Nepal , and he made some good quick decisions . "
The clear winner of this year ’s Celebrity Big Brother was Shilpa Shetty , the Bollywood superstar who is now an international name and has been hobnobbing with British politicians , the glitterati and Hollywood .
The racism row that engulfed Celebrity Big Brother gave her the stage and she graciously rode out the storm within the house to become a favourite of the British viewers , rightly appalled at the mindless bullying by some of her fellow housemates and deeply admiring the way Shilpa Shetty held onto her composure and refused to allow herself to be dragged into the gutter .
[ ad ]
Now that the dust has settled somewhat what has become of the bullies ; Jade Goody , Danielle Lloyd and Jo O’Meara and not forgetting , Jackiey Budden ( Jade Goody ’s mother ) .
The motivation
Jade Goody probably thought in her no - so - bright way , that she was writing headlines by her behaviour .
She may have thought in a rather niave ( some would say stupid ) way that the headlines would have been things like ; “ Goody v’s Shetty ” or “ Jade goes head to head with Shilpa ” – enough to raise her ( Jade ’s ) profile in the press but nothing that bad .
How poorly she read the public mood or even understood her own behaviour .
Unfortunately for her fellow contestants , Danielle Lloyd and Jo O’Meara , she dragged them like schoolgirls so afraid of the playground bully that they become her sidekicks rather than be on the receiving end , into the ugliness she unleashed .
So who became the real - life losers ?
Jade Goody has lost all credibility with the public .
The column inches she used to fill in so many magazines , built on her position of underdog rather than mafia - like underboss , are almost gone and so is the interview income she used to earn .
Her perfume brand , Shh , was withdrawn from the shelves of The Perfume Shop chain in direct response to the controversy .
The company that makes the perfume bottle , Pragati Glass , ironically an Indian firm , received word in January from the UK producer , Jean Christian , to cease production of the perfume bottles due to the expected crash in sales .
Jade Goody ’s mother , Jackiey Budden , is currently being investigated by Benefit bosses and officials at Southwark council over claims she has earnt thousands while on benefits .
The 48 - year - old lesbian could be forced to move out of her home if she is found guilty of benefit fraud .
As a result of her behaviour on the show , Danielle Lloyd lost six - figure modelling contracts with motorcycle insurance firm Bennetts , fashion label Rocawear as well as other minor sponsorship deals .
Speculation exists over whether she has also been dumped by her boyfriend , Teddy Sheringham , the ex-England and Premiership footballer .
Jo O’Meara , who had hoped for a career boost has probably paid the highest price of all since her appearance on the show appears to have led directly to her suffering for all intents and purposes , a nervous breakdown .
She had hoped to earn enough money to avoid losing her home .
Now she has lost her health and may never recover .
JOHNNY PATRELLO was a greaser .
I was a dork .
And yet , despite our rigidly stratified school culture , we came together in the spring of 1968 at Walt Whitman Junior High School , where I tutored Johnny in algebra .
I thought about Johnny again as I read The Times ’ series this week on L.A. 's dropout problem .
Algebra , the reporters found , is an insurmountable stumbling block for many high school students .
What struck me was that the reasons why Johnny ca n’t do algebra in L.A. today are remarkably similar to why Johnny Patrello could n’t do algebra almost four decades ago in Yonkers , N.Y .
Johnny and I were brought together by Mrs. Elizabeth Bukanz , the algebra teacher .
Mrs. Bukanz wore her sandy hair in a frizzy French twist and her glasses on a chain .
But she was gentle and smiling , and she had passion -- at least for what she called “ the beauty of algebra . ”
I , too , loved its perfect logic and tidy solutions , so unlike my messy teenage life .
Advertisement
But Johnny was deaf to algebra ’s siren song .
He was flunking , and Mrs. Bukanz hoped that if I used my study halls to tutor him , he might score at least 65 % on the New York State Regents exam .
Passing the exam allowed even failing students to move on to high school , which started in 10th grade ; otherwise , Johnny would be left behind .
Johnny wore his leather jacket in class despite the spring warmth , and he habitually tilted his face toward the floor so that when he looked up at me , he seemed embarrassed .
Yet for such a cool guy , he was surprisingly friendly and committed to giving this a try .
Things looked pretty hopeless to both of us those first couple of sessions , as Johnny stumbled through algebra problems while I tried to figure out exactly what he did n’t understand .
Then , as we took it down to each step of each little calculation , the trouble became clear : Johnny somehow had reached ninth grade without learning the multiplication tables .
Because he was shaky on those , his long multiplication was error prone and his long division a mess .
As Johnny tried to work algebraic equations , his arithmetic kept bringing up weird results .
He ’d figure he was on the wrong track and make up an answer .
Advertisement
This discovery should have made us feel worse .
How could we possibly make up for a dearth of third - grade skills and cover algebra too ?
But at least we knew where to start .
We spent about half of those early sessions on multiplication drills .
Seven times eight , eight times seven -- Johnny could never remember .
As an adult , in memory of Johnny ’s struggles , I would rehearse my kids at an early age in that one math fact .
Get that 56 down , I would tell them , and the rest of multiplication is a snap .
Today ’s failing high school students , though plagued by more poverty and upheaval than Johnny or I ever knew , bring the same scanty skills to algebra class , according to The Times ’ series .
They never quite grasped multiplication tables , but still they moved on to more complicated math .
Advertisement
Who can focus on the step - by - step logic of peeling back an equation until “ x ” is bared when it involves arithmetic that comes slow and slippery , always giving a different answer to the same calculation ?
Yet in all these decades , the same school structure that failed Johnny goes on , dragging kids through the grades even if they do n’t master the material from the year before .
This especially makes no sense for math , which is almost entirely sequential .
Leaving children back is n’t a solution ; it simply makes them feel stupid .
They learn , like Johnny , to look at the floor .
The floor ca n’t embarrass them .
What I learned from Johnny -- aside from the fact that greasers could be sweet - natured and very , very smart -- is that schools are structured to help administrators feel organized , not to help children learn .
Advertisement
Young children ’s skills are all over the map , yet we corral them into second grade , third grade and so forth , where everyone moves at one pace in all subjects .
Better to group them according to their skills in each subject , without the “ grade ” labels , and let them move on to the next skill when they have mastered the one they were on .
If they ’re not getting it , give them extra tutoring , but do n’t push them forward until they ’re ready .
This way , there is no failure -- only progress .
It requires a sea change in thinking , but it ’s not impossible or even all that hard .
Back before standardized tests put classes in lockstep , some progressive schools already were using team teaching to do this in math as well as reading and writing .
Johnny finally nailed seven times eight , then with amazing quickness worked his way through basic “ x ” problems up to multiple variables and beyond .
Still , I could n’t quite catch him up to a year ’s worth of work in a couple of months .
And on a sweltering June day , with humidity that neared 100 % , the regents exam came , faster than we felt ready for it .
A couple of weeks later , I saw Johnny in the hall .
He shot me a dazed look and broke the news -- 95 % !
That moment has wiped from memory my own regents score .
But I won the algebra award at the graduation ceremony .
Johnny cheered , apparently undaunted by the fear of appearing uncool .
Advertisement
We lost touch in high school .
I was college - prep , he was voc-ed .
We would pass occasionally in the halls , and he would glance up from the floor and say , “ Hi , teach ! ”
I know he received his diploma because I see his picture in my old yearbook , wearing a suit and tie instead of his leather jacket .
His eyes still look up cautiously from his slightly downcast face , as though he is a bit surprised to be there .
BEFORE I USED Johnny ’s full name in a story that would reach more than a million readers , it was only right to try to contact him for permission .
Directory assistance found one John Patrello , not too far from Yonkers .
The phone was answered by his wife , Joann .
It was the same Johnny , but he had died a year and a half ago of a massive stroke , leaving behind Joann and four children .
Advertisement
As she and I talked , both of us in tears at times , it was amazing how much of what I remembered about Johnny continued throughout his life -- the tough outer look , the sweetness a millimeter underneath , the quick mind , the habit of tilting his face toward the floor .
His eldest is a doctor ; the second , a teacher .
His teenage daughter wants to be a journalist , and I ’ll see what I can do to help her along the way .
Johnny became an auto mechanic .
( “ He loved math , and you know auto repair involves a lot of math , ” Joann said .
Yes , it does . )
Another thing Joann told me about Johnny : He was incredibly fast at multiplication .
Doctors in Gaza have reported previously unseen injuries from Israeli weapons that cause severe burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death .
The injuries were first seen in July , when the Israeli military launched a series of operations in Gaza following the capture of an Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants .
Doctors said that , unlike traditional combat injuries from shells or bullets , there were no large shrapnel pieces found in the patients ' bodies and there appeared to be a " dusting " on severely damaged internal organs .
" Bodies arrived severely fragmented , melted and disfigured , " said Jumaa Saqa'a , a doctor at Shifa hospital , the main casualty hospital in Gaza City .
" We found internal burning of organs , while externally there were minute pieces of shrapnel .
When we opened many of the injured people we found dusting on the internal organs . "
It is not clear whether the injuries come from a new weapon .
The Israeli military declined to detail the weapons in its arsenal , but denied reports that the injuries came from a Dense Inert Metal Explosive ( Dime ) , a new experimental weapon that causes a powerful blast but in a localised area .
The Dime , while causing severe injuries to its target , is intended to limit what the defence industry calls " collateral damage . "
In Gaza , Dr Saqa 'a said the small pieces of shrapnel found in patients ' bodies did not show up under x-ray .
" We are used to seeing shrapnel penetrate the body making localised damage .
Now we did n't see shrapnel , but we found the destruction , " he said .
Most of the injuries were around the abdomen , nearly a metre up from the ground , he said .
The doctors also found that an injured patient who had been stabilised after one or two days , might suddenly die .
" The patient dies without any apparent scientific cause , " he said .
" So far we do n't know why . "
At the Kamal Odwan Hospital , in Beit Lahiya , deputy director Saied Jouda , said he had found similar injuries .
" We do n't know what it means - new weapons or something new added to a previous weapon , " he said .
" We had patients who died after stabilisation and that is very unusual . "
He too found patients with severe internal injuries without signs of any large shrapnel pieces .
Often there was severe burning .
" There was burning , big raw areas of charred flesh , " he said .
" This must be related to the type of explosive material . "
Photographs of some of the dead from Shifa hospital showed bodies that had been melted and blackened beyond recognition .
Others showed internal bleeding without signs of shrapnel wounds .
In several cases doctors amputated badly burnt limbs .
At least 250 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the latest military operations began and hundreds more have been injured .
Neither of the doctors could give exact figures for the numbers of patients suffering the new injuries , although both said that most of those brought in during July showed signs of these injuries .
Dr Saqa'a of the Shifa hospital said the injuries occurred over a six - week period beginning in late June and running until early August , while Dr Jouda from Kamal Odwan hospital said he believed patients admitted even in recent days still showed signs of these unusual injuries .
The health ministry in Gaza has reported these injuries came from an " unprecedented type of projectile , " and also noted severe burning and badly damaged internal organs , often around the abdomen .
It called for an investigation into the cause of the wounds .
" You have complete burns that lead to amputation .
You find shrapnel entering the body and leaving very , very small holes .
We have never seen this before , " said Khalid Radi , a spokesman at the health ministry .
Tissue samples from patients in Gaza were given to journalists from the Italian television channel RAI .
In a documentary shown last week , the channel said the injuries appeared similar to the effects of the Dime .
An Italian laboratory that analysed the samples reportedly said its results were " compatible with the hypothesis " that a Dime weapon was involved .
The weapon is new and in the US is still in the early stages of development .
It has a carbon - fibre casing and contains fine tungsten particles rather than ordinary metal shrapnel .
It causes a very powerful blast , but with a much more limited radius than other explosives .
However , the Israel Defence Force ( IDF ) denies the use of Dime weapons .
" The defence establishment is investing considerable effort to develop weaponry in order to minimise the risk of injury to innocent civilians .
With regard to allegations of the use of Dime weaponry , the IDF denies the possession or use of such weapons , " the military said in a statement .
" Due to operational reasons , the IDF cannot specify the types and use of weapons in its possession .
In addition it should be emphasised that the IDF only uses weapons in accordance with the international law . "
Some Israeli military experts have also dismissed the suggestion that a Dime weapon is involved .
Isaac Ben-Israel , a professor at Tel Aviv University and a retired Israel air force general who was involved in weapons development , had seen some of the photographs of the dead and injured and said he believed the wounds came from ordinary explosives .
" I can tell you surely that no one in Israel ever developed such a Dime weapon .
It does n't exist at all , " he said .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , which monitors weapons used in conflicts , said it had heard reports of similar injuries from Gaza and was collecting information on the case .
" We have n't come to any sort of conclusion about what kind of weapon it was , " said Bernard Barrett , an ICRC spokesman .
The oil market is vibrating , and crude oil prices are bobbing up and down like a float on the water .
Around the world , experts make analysis and try to explain why .
The fact that the price of crude oil is approaching $ 60 per barrel and the production costs for the same barrel fluctuates between $ 1 and $ 10 shows that common economic theories are not valid any longer , something new is in the air and the question is how to interpret today ’s vibrations .
Since 2001 , the start of ASPO , Association for the Study of Peak Oil& Gas , we have tried to make the world aware of the fact that in a short while , we will have a problem supplying the world with crude oil when the demand is rising .
We call it Peak Oil .
The year for the peak at the first depletion workshop in Uppsala , Sweden , in 2002 was 2010 , and in Berlin , in 2004 it had moved to 2008 .
Now it might be that the peak will come even earlier .
The exact year depends very much on demand in the future , and we will not know when we have peaked until we have crossed the threshold .
Unfortunately , very few have listened to our alerts even though the signs have been so significant that even a blind hen should have seen them .
Fifty years ago the world was consuming 4 billion barrels of oil per year , and the average discovery was around 30 billion .
Today we consume 30 billion barrels per year , and the discovery rate is now approaching 4 billion barrels of crude oil per year .
If we make an extrapolation of the downward discovery slope from the last 30 years , we find that about 134 billion barrels will be found over the next 30 years .
That would not be a bad achievement , being more than double the North Sea , which is the largest new province found since the Second World War .
But it comes far short of providing sufficient discoveries to meet the IEA [ 1 ] scenario , which visualizes the consumption of 1000 billion barrels over the next 25 years , even though some of it may be drawn from reserves left over from past discovery .
Each oilfield has a time when it reaches maximum production .
One of the 40 largest oil fields in the world is the mythological East Texas field .
They discovered the field in 1930 , and some years later they reached a maximum production
After a plateau production of 160 million barrels per year it started to decline in 1936 and when the production was 60 million barrels per year at the end of the 1960s new technology was applied .
By injecting water into the field , the production rose to 80 million barrels , but since then the production has continued to decline and is now producing less the 10 million barrels per year .
If you study the production from existing oilfields , experts around the world agree that the decline is between 3 and 5 percent .
It means that all the oilfields that today produce 84 million barrels per day , m/ bpd , will next year at this time produce 80.6 M/ bpd and in the year 2030 , 30 M/ bpd .
In the World Energy Outlook 2004 , the IEA predicts that we will need 121 M / bps in 2030 .
In other words , we need to find more than 90 M / bpd in new production .
The world needs ten new Saudi Arabias .
Someone might call me a Doomsayer , but if so I ’m accompanied by Sadad Al Husseini , as this is a citation from him .
He was until recently vice director of Saudi Aramco , the largest oil company in the world .
Of the 65 largest oil producing countries in the world , 54 have passed their peak of production just like in East Texas , and they are now in decline .
Indonesia , a member of the oil - exporting club OPEC [ 2 ] , ca n’t produce their production quota .
But the most astonishing thing is that they now ca n’t produce enough oil for their consumption , they now belong to the oil importing countries .
Six years from now five more countries will peak in their oil production .
Cantrell in Mexico is the second largest oil - producing field in the world .
Next year it is expected to start to decline , and the whole production in Mexico will decline .
China has for the last five years has been fighting hard to keep their production flat , and the probability for them to keep it up is not very high .
By 2010 the following countries have the potential to produce more oil than they have ever produced before ; Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Kuwait , United Arab Emirates , Kazakhstan , and Bolivia .
These countries will have to cover the decline in 59 countries and the increased demand from the rest of the world .
Anyone that can provide information showing that this is possible must do it now .
At the beginning of the 1980s , Saudi Arabia produced 9.6 million barrels per day .
According to the scenarios of the IEA World Energy Outlook 2004 and the US EIA [ 3 ]
International Energy Outlook 2004 , Saudi Arabia must produce 22 M / bpd by the year 2030 .
Sadad Al Husseini just calls it plug - in numbers and claims , the American government ’s forecast for future oil supplies are a dangerous over - estimate .
The largest oil field in the world , Ghawar , is in decline , although Saudi Aramco says that the production can be increased to 12 M / bpd in the year 2015 .
They are not talking about 22 million barrels per day .
In 1979 Iraq produced 3.4 M/bpd .
The official reserve data claims that they have 112 billion barrels of crude oil .
We think that one - third of the reported reserves are just political barrels .
The reserves of Iraq were recently discussed in London , and the number that has leaked out through closed doors is 46 billion barrels .
If this is the case , it will be hard for Iraq to reach their past peak production .
It ’s time to ask , can the Middle East come back to the peak numbers from the 1970s ?
Recently a report titled The Mitigation of the Peaking of World Oil Production was handed over to the Department of Energy .
The report claims that World Oil peaking represents a problem like none other .
The political , economic , and social stakes are enormous .
Prudent risk management demands urgent attention and early action .
If you start a serious program today , it will take 20 years before completion .
A real tremble was felt from the Goldman Sachs alert , which predicts the price ceiling for a barrel of crude to reach 105 $ .
“ We believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we have referred to as a super spike period , they said .
We call it Peak Oil .

Scientists and government authorities that noticed the earthquake that caused the tsunami in Thailand are blamed for not making a tsunami alert .
They were afraid that the warning would hurt the tourism industry .
I think it is time for energy authorities around the world to make an oil supply tsunami alert .
The vibrations we are now feeling might turn into a wave of incredible magnitude .
If we start doing something right now , we might be able to build a breakwater .
If not , we will face an event that could change the life , as we know it , forever .

I can make a mean pizza , but it took me a while to learn how .
Maybe I should rephrase that - I can make a mean pizza , but it took me a while to find the right teacher .
For a long time I did n't really know where to look for guidance - I just knew I wanted pizza the way I 'd enjoyed it in Rome and Naples .
The key is good pizza dough .
Best Pizza Dough Ever : Watch the Video
I was smart enough to know early on , if you have bad pizza dough , you 're destined to have bad pizza .
Figuring out the dough factor was not as easy as you might think .
As I got going , my oven gobbled up the fruits of many deflated attempts - a little yeast here , a lot of yeast there , this flour , that flour , knead by hand , knead by mixer , high baking temps , lower baking temps , and on and on .
Crust Styles
Then I was given a hint .
A gift , really .
My friends and I would visit a favorite tiny pizza place in San Francisco quite often .
We would go to eat , but also to try to absorb some of the good pizza karma flowing from their single - shelf , Baker 's Pride oven .
A lot of time was spent there , not because we wanted to know their secrets really - but primarily because the food was so good .
Hours would pass as we chatted over thin - crusted pizzas with slightly puffy , blistered edges .
It became the crust I would try to emulate at home .
The Source
One day in the aforementioned pizza shop , I noticed a copy of Peter Reinhart 's Bread Baker 's Apprentice on a bookshelf near the prep area .
It must have been recently published , and my curiosity was piqued .
Sure enough , the book contained an interesting ( and meticulous ) description of how to make just the sort of pizza I was after .
The dough Peter uses for his Napoletana pizza in this book is rooted in a delayed - fermentation method - different from the other techniques I 'd tried up to that point .
Game on .
Make Ahead Pizza Dough
If you like to wait until the last minute to make pizza dough , you are out of luck here .
The key is the overnight fermentation .
You end up with a golden , beautiful crust with the perfect amount of crunch and subtle yeasty undertones .
If you try this recipe and like it , Peter also went on to write an entire book about the quest for the perfect pizza , fittingly titled , American Pie .
It 's a great reference for those of you who really want to geek out on pizza .
Give Peter 's dough a try , and if you are interested in baking world exceptional breads , be sure to spend time with his book .
Topping Strategy
I 'm going to leave you with the dough recipe .
It 's up to you to play around with the toppings .
The best advice I can give you is to take it easy on that front - a little goes a long way .
My favorite is a simple pizza margherita made with this tomato sauce , a few torn up bocconcini cow 's milk mozzarella balls , and a few pinches of salt before placing the pizza in the oven .
And , do n't forget the magic touches .
When the pizza is hot from the oven , give it a quick dusting of freshly grated Parmesan , a tiny drizzle of artisan - quality virgin olive oil , and a sprinkling of basil cut into a chiffonade .
Serve pronto !
Oven Temperature
As far as oven temperatures go - I have great results at 450 F degrees WITH a pizza stone .
Go buy a pizza stone immediately if you are serious about making great pizza at home .
They are cheap and make a huge difference in your crust .
This is the stripped - down , adapted version of Peter 's Napoletana pizza dough recipe .
If you want all his great side notes , tips , and back - history on the recipe , please pick up the book .
My last post on Jeff Pfeffer ’s next book , What Were They Thinking ?
reminded me of Jeff ’s recent research on how people in jobs where “ time is money ” fall into a trap :
They start devoting more time to their jobs , and less time to “ unpaid ” activities like family , friends , and leisure .
There is a splendid summary of this research on the Stanford Business School website , Time is Money When You are Paid by the Hour , “ In a series of recent studies , Pfeffer and doctoral student Sanford E. DeVoe found that people who are used to being paid by the hour start thinking of time as a commodity almost equal to cash .
And given the choice as to whether they ’ll take time or green bills , they ’ll usually take the latter — meaning they ’re nearly always willing to put in more hours to get the pay . ”
Writer Marguerite Rigoglioso quotes Pfeffer further : “ Being paid by the hour causes people to endorse the idea that they ’d rather make more money and spend more time at work , ” says Pfeffer , the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior .
“ This shows how a commodified view of time spills over into how people view their personal and leisure time . ”
“ Once you ’re paid by the hour , ” he says , “ you start placing a monetary value on that hour .
The opportunity costs of not working become clearer .
People gravitate toward things that are easier to evaluate , and it ’s easier to figure out the value of a paid hour than it is , say , the value of an hour spent in a leisure activity .
So they chose work over play . ”
Pfeffer and DeVoe also review related research , including one study that found “ lawyers watching their kids play soccer admitted to mentally ticking away lost income for each minute they stood on the sidelines . ”
Ouch …
I feel sorry for both the kids and the parents .
Unfortunately , many professional service firms – especially those like law firms that bill by the hour – systematically weed out people who do n’t think and act this way , as they are less “ profitable . ”
This is the kind of research that gives me chills and makes me wonder if a little less “ productivity ” might be a good thing at times .
Today , if we went into Iraq , like the president would like us to do , you know where you begin .
You never know where you are going to end .
— George F. Kennan , September 26 , 20021
I ask you , sir , what is the American army doing inside Iraq ? …
Saddam ’s story has been finished for close to three years .
— President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to Mike Wallace on Sixty Minutes , August 13 , 2006 -
In the ruined city of Fallujah , its pale tan buildings pulverized by Marine artillery in the two great assaults of this long war ( the aborted attack of March 2004 and then the bloody , triumphant al - Fajr ( The Dawn ) campaign of the following November ) , behind the lines of giant sandbags and concrete T - walls and barbed wire that surrounded the tiny beleaguered American outpost there , I sat in my body armor and Kevlar helmet and thought of George F. Kennan .
Not the grand old man of American diplomacy , the ninety - eight - year - old Father of Containment who , listening to the war drums beat from a Washington nursing home in the fall of 2002 , had uttered the prophetic words above .
I was thinking of an earlier Kennan , the brilliant and ambitious young diplomat who during the late 1920s and 1930s had gazed out on the crumbling European order from Tallinn and Berlin and Prague and read the signs of the coming world conflict .
For there in the bunkered Civil - Military Operations Center ( known as the C - Moc ) in downtown Fallujah , where a few score Marines and a handful of civilians subsisted in a broken - down bunkered building without running water or fresh food , I met young Kennan ’s reincarnation in the person of a junior State Department official : a bright , aggressive young man who spent his twenty - hour days rumbling down the ruined streets in body armor and helmet with his reluctant Marine escorts , meeting with local Iraqi officials , and writing tart cables back to Baghdad or Washington telling his bosses the truth of what was happening on the ground , however reluctant they might be to hear it .
This young diplomat was resourceful and brilliant and indefatigable , and as I watched him joking and arguing with the local sheikhs and politicos and technocrats — who were meeting , as they were forced to do , in the American bunker — I thought of the indomitable young Kennan of the interwar years , and of how , if the American effort in Iraq could ever be made to “ work , ” only undaunted and farseeing young men like this one , his spiritual successor , could make it happen .
This was October 2005 , on the eve of the nationwide referendum on Iraq ’s proposed constitution , and I had come to Fallujah , the heart of rebellious Anbar province , to see whether the Sunnis could gather the political strength to vote it down .
In a provision originally insisted on by the Kurds , a provision that typified an American - designed political process that had been intended to unify the country but that instead had helped pull it inexorably apart , the proposed constitution could be rejected …

Harsh interrogation techniques authorized by top officials of the CIA have led to questionable confessions and the death of a detainee since the techniques were first authorized in mid-March 2002 , ABC News has been told by former and current intelligence officers and supervisors .
They say they are revealing specific details of the techniques , and their impact on confessions , because the public needs to know the direction their agency has chosen .
All gave their accounts on the condition that their names and identities not be revealed .
Portions of their accounts are corrobrated by public statements of former CIA officers and by reports recently published that cite a classified CIA Inspector General 's report .
Other portions of their accounts echo the accounts of escaped prisoners from one CIA prison in Afghanistan .
" They would not let you rest , day or night .
Stand up , sit down , stand up , sit down .
Do n't sleep .
Do n't lie on the floor , " one prisoner said through a translator .
The detainees were also forced to listen to rap artist Eminem 's " Slim Shady " album .
The music was so foreign to them it made them frantic , sources said .
Contacted after the completion of the ABC News investigation , CIA officials would neither confirm nor deny the accounts .
They simply declined to comment .
The CIA sources described a list of six " Enhanced Interrogation Techniques " instituted in mid-March 2002 and used , they said , on a dozen top al Qaeda targets incarcerated in isolation at secret locations on military bases in regions from Asia to Eastern Europe .
According to the sources , only a handful of CIA interrogators are trained and authorized to use the techniques :
1. The Attention Grab :
The interrogator forcefully grabs the shirt front of the prisoner and shakes him .
2. Attention Slap :
An open - handed slap aimed at causing pain and triggering fear .
3. The Belly Slap : A hard open - handed slap to the stomach .
The aim is to cause pain , but not internal injury .
Doctors consulted advised against using a punch , which could cause lasting internal damage .
4. Long Time Standing :
This technique is described as among the most effective .
Prisoners are forced to stand , handcuffed and with their feet shackled to an eye bolt in the floor for more than 40 hours .
Exhaustion and sleep deprivation are effective in yielding confessions .
5 . The Cold Cell :
The prisoner is left to stand naked in a cell kept near 50 degrees .
Throughout the time in the cell the prisoner is doused with cold water .
6. Water Boarding :
The prisoner is bound to an inclined board , feet raised and head slightly below the feet .
Cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner 's face and water is poured over him .
Unavoidably , the gag reflex kicks in and a terrifying fear of drowning leads to almost instant pleas to bring the treatment to a halt .
According to the sources , CIA officers who subjected themselves to the water boarding technique lasted an average of 14 seconds before caving in .
They said al Qaeda 's toughest prisoner , Khalid Sheik Mohammed , won the admiration of interrogators when he was able to last between two and two - and - a - half minutes before begging to confess .
" The person believes they are being killed , and as such , it really amounts to a mock execution , which is illegal under international law , " said John Sifton of Human Rights Watch .
The techniques are controversial among experienced intelligence agency and military interrogators .
Many feel that a confession obtained this way is an unreliable tool .
Two experienced officers have told ABC that there is little to be gained by these techniques that could not be more effectively gained by a methodical , careful , psychologically based interrogation .
According to a classified report prepared by the CIA Inspector General John Helgerwon and issued in 2004 , the techniques " appeared to constitute cruel , and degrading treatment under the ( Geneva ) convention , " the New York Times reported on Nov. 9 , 2005 .
It is " bad interrogation .
I mean you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture 's bad enough , " said former CIA officer Bob Baer .
Larry Johnson , a former CIA officer and a deputy director of the State Department 's office of counterterrorism , recently wrote in the Los Angeles Times , " What real CIA field officers know firsthand is that it is better to build a relationship of trust … than to extract quick confessions through tactics such as those used by the Nazis and the Soviets . "
One argument in favor of their use : time .
In the early days of al Qaeda captures , it was hoped that speeding confessions would result in the development of important operational knowledge in a timely fashion .
However , ABC News was told that at least three CIA officers declined to be trained in the techniques before a cadre of 14 were selected to use them on a dozen top al Qaeda suspects in order to obtain critical information .
In at least one instance , ABC News was told that the techniques led to questionable information aimed at pleasing the interrogators and that this information had a significant impact on U.S. actions in Iraq .
According to CIA sources , Ibn al Shaykh al Libbi , after two weeks of enhanced interrogation , made statements that were designed to tell the interrogators what they wanted to hear .
Sources say Al Libbi had been subjected to each of the progressively harsher techniques in turn and finally broke after being water boarded and then left to stand naked in his cold cell overnight where he was doused with cold water at regular intervals .
His statements became part of the basis for the Bush administration claims that Iraq trained al Qaeda members to use biochemical weapons .
Sources tell ABC that it was later established that al Libbi had no knowledge of such training or weapons and fabricated the statements because he was terrified of further harsh treatment .
" This is the problem with using the waterboard .
They get so desperate that they begin telling you what they think you want to hear , " one source said .
However , sources said , al Libbi does not appear to have sought to intentionally misinform investigators , as at least one account has stated .
The distinction in this murky world is nonetheless an important one .
Al Libbi sought to please his investigators , not lead them down a false path , two sources with firsthand knowledge of the statements said .
When properly used , the techniques appear to be closely monitored and are signed off on in writing on a case - by - case , technique - by - technique basis , according to highly placed current and former intelligence officers involved in the program .
In this way , they say , enhanced interrogations have been authorized for about a dozen high value al Qaeda targets -- Khalid Sheik Mohammed among them .
According to the sources , all of these have confessed , none of them has died , and all of them remain incarcerated .
While some media accounts have described the locations where these detainees are located as a string of secret CIA prisons -- a gulag , as it were -- in fact , sources say , there are a very limited number of these locations in use at any time , and most often they consist of a secure building on an existing or former military base .
In addition , they say , the prisoners usually are not scattered but travel together to these locations , so that information can be extracted from one and compared with others .
Currently , it is believed that one or more former Soviet bloc air bases and military installations are the Eastern European location of the top suspects .
Khalid Sheik Mohammed is among the suspects detained there , sources said .
The sources told ABC that the techniques , while progressively aggressive , are not deemed torture , and the debate among intelligence officers as to whether they are effective should not be underestimated .
There are many who feel these techniques , properly supervised , are both valid and necessary , the sources said .
While harsh , they say , they are not torture and are reserved only for the most important and most difficult prisoners .
According to the sources , when an interrogator wishes to use a particular technique on a prisoner , the policy at the CIA is that each step of the interrogation process must be signed off at the highest level -- by the deputy director for operations for the CIA .
A cable must be sent and a reply received each time a progressively harsher technique is used .
The described oversight appears tough but critics say it could be tougher .
In reality , sources said , there are few known instances when an approval has not been granted .
Still , even the toughest critics of the techniques say they are relatively well monitored and limited in use .
Two sources also told ABC that the techniques -- authorized for use by only a handful of trained CIA officers -- have been misapplied in at least one instance .
The sources said that in that case a young , untrained junior officer caused the death of one detainee at a mud fort dubbed the " salt pit " that is used as a prison .
They say the death occurred when the prisoner was left to stand naked throughout the harsh Afghanistan night after being doused with cold water .
He died , they say , of hypothermia .
According to the sources , a second CIA detainee died in Iraq and a third detainee died following harsh interrogation by Department of Defense personnel and contractors in Iraq .
CIA sources said that in the DOD case , the interrogation was harsh , but did not involve the CIA .
The Kabul fort has also been the subject of confusion .
Several intelligence sources involved in both the enhanced interrogation program and the program to ship detainees back to their own country for interrogation -- a process described as rendition , say that the number of detainees in each program has been added together to suggest as many as 100 detainees are moved around the world from one secret CIA facility to another .
In the rendition program , foreign nationals captured in the conflict zones are shipped back to their own countries on occasion for interrogation and prosecution .
There have been several dozen instances of rendition .
There have been a little over a dozen authorized enhanced interrogations .
As a result , the enhanced interrogation program has been described as one encompassing 100 or more prisoners .
Multiple CIA sources told ABC that it is not .
The renditions have also been described as illegal .
They are not , our sources said , although they acknowledge the procedures are in an ethical gray area and are at times used for the convenience of extracting information under harsher conditions that the U.S. would allow .
ABC was told that several dozen renditions of this kind have occurred .
Jordan is one country recently cited as an " emerging " center for renditions , according to published reports .
The ABC sources said that rendition of this sort are legal and should not be confused with illegal " snatches " of targets off the streets of a home country by officers of yet another country .
The United States is currently charged with such an illegal rendition in Italy .
Israel and at least one European nation have also been accused of such renditions .

The US military is considering testing the principle behind a type of space drive which holds the promise of reaching Mars in just three hours .
The problem is , as New Scientist explains , it 's entirely theoretical and many physicists admit they do n't understand the science behind it .
Nonetheless , the so - called " hyperdrive " concept won last year 's American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics award for the best nuclear and future flight paper .
Among its defenders is aerospace engineer Pavlos Mikellides , from the Arizona State University in Tempe .
Mikellides , who reviewed the winning paper , said : " Even though such features have been explored before , this particular approach is quite unique . "
The basic concept is this : according to the paper 's authors - Jochem Häuser , a physicist and professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter and Walter Dröscher , a retired Austrian patent officer - if you put a huge rotating ring above a superconducting coil and pump enough current through the coil , the resulting large magnetic field will " reduce the gravitational pull on the ring to the point where it floats free " .
The origins of this " repulsive anti-gravity force " and the hyperdrive it might power lie in the work of German scientist Burkhard Heim , who - as part of his attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and Einstein 's general theory of relativity - formulated a theoretical six - dimensioned universe by bolting on two new sub-dimensions to Einstein 's generally - accepted four ( three space , one time ) .
As New Scientist explains ,
Heim 's two extra dimensions allowed him to couple together gravity and electromagnetism , and permits conversion of electromagnetic energy into gravitational and vice - versa - something not possible according to Einstein 's four dimensions , because " you cannot change the strength of gravity simply by cranking up the electromagnetic field " .
Heim , then , proposed that " a rotating magnetic field could reduce the influence of gravity on a spacecraft enough for it to take off " - an idea which caught the eye of Wernher von Braun when it was first proposed in 1959 and the rocket scientist was working on the US 's Saturn launch vehicle .
After the initial excitement died down , however , Heim moved on to other projects and his hyperdrive theory slowly gathered dust until the arrival of Walter Dröscher in 1980 .
Dröscher expanded on Heim 's work , in the process reactivating two further dimensions the latter had originally discarded .
Thus " Heim - Dröscher space " was born - an eight - dimensional concept of which Dröscher says : " If Heim 's picture is to make sense , we are forced to postulate two more fundamental forces . "
The said extra forces are : " A repulsive anti-gravity similar to the dark energy that appears to be causing the universe 's expansion to accelerate " ; and a second resulting from the " interaction of Heim 's fifth and sixth dimensions and the extra dimensions that Dröscher introduced " .
Crucially , it " produces pairs of ' gravitophotons ' - particles that mediate the interconversion of electromagnetic and gravitational energy " .
The groundwork done , Dröscher then teamed up with Häuser to produce the award - winning " Guidelines For a Space Propulsion Device Based on Heim 's Quantum Theory . "
So far so good - in theory .
However , as NS notes : " The majority of physicists have never heard of Heim theory , and most of those contacted by New Scientist said they could n't make sense of Dröscher and Häuser 's description of the theory behind their proposed experiment . "
Furthermore , Dröscher and Häuser 's proposed practical experiment to prove their theory requires " a magnetic coil several metres in diameter capable of sustaining an enormous current density " - something which the majority of engineers say is " not feasible with existing materials and technology " .*
So , Mars in three hours ?
As NS puts it : " Dröscher is hazy about the details " , but " suggests that a spacecraft fitted with a coil and ring could be propelled into a multidimensional hyperspace " where " the constants of nature could be different , and even the speed of light could be several times faster than we experience " .
Then , he says , a quick three - hour jaunt to Mars would indeed be on the cards . ®

Jan. 30 , 2007  -- Brian " Sapient " is an average - looking 30 - year - old guy who works out of his basement in Philadelphia .
His job ?
Well , Brian is taking on God .
" Wow , that 's a dramatic way of putting it , " says Brian , who asked that " Nightline " not use his real last name for safety reasons .
But however he defines his challenge , Brian is on the cutting edge of a new and emboldened wave of atheism .
" There is n't any good reason to believe in God , " asserts Brian .
" It 's that simple . "
What 's wrong with God ?
" What 's wrong with the tooth fairy ? " asks Brian .
" There 's nothing wrong with something that most likely does n't exist . "
There are an estimated 20 to 30 million atheists in the United States these days , and some of them say they feel like a persecuted minority .
" Atheists are completely vilified .
And it's OK , " says Kelly , an atheist who works alongside Brian and also asked that her last name not be used .
" It 's actually OK to hate atheists , " Kelly said .
" We are like the last group that people overwhelmingly agree that it 's OK to hate us , because there 's an absurd caricature of atheism out there . "
The Rational Response Squad
Brian and Kelly are co-founders of the Rational Response Squad .
From Brian 's basement they broadcast a weekly Internet radio show about God or the lack thereof .
And recently they came up with a new way to publicize their cause .
It is called the Blasphemy Challenge .
" Initially we wanted to find a way to allow atheists to come out of the closet , speak up and show other people that there are people that think like this , " Brian says .
What they did was challenge people to make videos of themselves , denying , denouncing or blaspheming the Holy Spirit , and then post them on YouTube .
' We Are Not Scared of This Unforgiveable Sin '
" We wanted to do it in such a way where we stripped the power from religious institutions that instill fear in people , " says Brian .
" And we did that by blaspheming the Holy Spirit , by showing that we are not scared of this unforgiveable sin . "
A passage in Mark 3:29 reads , " whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; he is guilty of an eternal sin . "
While the passage is open to interpretation , the Rational Response Squad is taking it literally and challenging people to gamble with their eternal souls .
So far more than 800 people have taken up the challenge .
One of the posts is by a young - looking man named Chandler .
He says : " I 've come to the conclusion that alongside the fact that there is no Santa Clause and there is no Easter bunny , there is also no God .
So , without further ado , my name is Chandler and I deny the existence of the Holy Spirit . "
Another : " My name is Joel .
I deny the Holy Spirit , as well as God , Jesus , Buddha , Zeus , Mohammad , Joseph Smith , Sponge Bob , the pope , Santa Clause , Mother Mary , the Easter bunny , the tooth fairy , Optimus Prime , all the saints and Spiderman . "
Dozens upon dozens have posted , including comedian Penn Jillette , who simply says , " I deny the Holy Spirit . "
' Eternal Trouble ' ?
" I think how sad it is that someone would be rejecting hope essentially , " says the Reverend Kathleen Liles , an Episcopalian minister , just one of many from the religious community who say this Internet challenge is misguided or worse .
" I think if people are courting blasphemy , going out of their way to cross that line , that is just dangerous , " says Paul de Vries , the president of the nondenominational New York Divinity School , which provides ministry training .
" They might get themselves in eternal trouble . "
Brian thinks otherwise .
" We are showing people that we are not afraid of what they are afraid of .
He is saying that he is afraid in that situation .
He is saying how he would feel if he were doing it himself .
He would be afraid .
I am not . "
Targeting Teens
Taking risks with your own soul is one thing , but the Rational Response Squad advertises for the Blasphemy Challenge on Web sites for teens , like Tiger Beat .
Why ?
" They have already been targeted , " Brian says .
" So hopefully they are at a point where they are not so indoctrinated and set in their ways that they can overcome this religious superstition that has been put into their brain unfairly . "
Is n't that simply another attempt at indoctrination ?
Brian says it is n't .
" We are not indoctrinating people , " he says .
" There is no fear of hell in what we do , in our activities .
We do n't tell people that if they do believe in God they are going to hell .
We are against fear - based systems . "
Brian was n't always an atheist .
He was raised Catholic , and became a born - again Christian when he was 13 .
" That 's what I was taught .
And I really believed , " Brian says .
" I loved Jesus and he was my best friend and I talked to him and God all the time .
I have to admit that they never talked back to me , and I think some people would say that God does talk to them and I think they 're not being honest with themselves . "
' The Faith to Believe '
Liles says Brian is simply missing the point .
Faith is not something that can or should be proven , she says .
" Faith is a gift , it is a mystery , as so many other gifts from God are , " she says .
" And when we open our hearts to God , then God will give us the faith to believe . "
However Liles feels about atheism , it is n't going away and might even be getting stronger .
Two of the best - selling books on Publishers Weekly 's religion list are by atheists about atheism .
There is a hard - hitting documentary questioning the very existence of Jesus .
There is even an atheists ' lobby in Washington .
Brian 's decidedly black - and - white rhetoric has won him many enemies .
He has received hundreds of death threats from Christians using decidedly un-Christian language -- more four - letter words strung together in a row than you can imagine .
Like his last name , he keeps his address a secret for safety reasons .
Despite the threats , the Rational Response Squad intends to keep Blasphemy Challenge going for some time .
" Until the end of Christianity , " Brian says .
Do Brian or Kelly worry their rhetoric and antics might land them in hell ?
" No , because hell does n't exist , " Kelly says .
Even if there was a one in a million shot that Hell existed , would they still be so unconcerned ?
Brian 's response ?
" That would stink , huh ? "
The jokes about hell and the whole Blasphemy Challenge open the squad up to critics ' attacks who say that whatever its views , its methods are simply disrespectful .
" If I knew that their belief system was wrong and I did n't say something , that would be much more disrespectful , " Brian responds .
And to the billions of Christians who have believed for the last 2,000 years , Brian says he is open to a dialogue .
" If they want to come to the table and present their evidence , I will present my evidence .
And we will see how much of theirs is based on faith , and how much of mine is based on fact . "

PHILADELPHIA , March 7 —
An unknown number of new George Washington dollar coins mistakenly struck without their edge inscriptions made it past Mint inspectors and are fetching about $ 50 apiece online .
Properly struck coins are inscribed on the edge with “ In God We Trust , ” “ E Pluribus Unum ” and the year and a mint mark .
The Mint struck 300 million of the coins , which are gold in color and slightly larger and thicker than a quarter .
The coins went into circulation Feb. 15 .
About half of them were made in Philadelphia and the rest in Denver .
Reports of error coins have come only from Philadelphia , Becky Bailey , a Mint spokeswoman , said .
Ms. Bailey said it was unknown how many coins lacked the inscriptions .
From HaskellWiki
A lot of people experience a curious phenomenon when they start using Haskell :
Once your code compiles it usually works .
This does not seem to be the case for imperative languages , not even strongly typed ones like Java or C# .
This page attempts to shed some light on reasons for why that this .
Types of errors
There are many types of errors , and many ways to categorize them .
For our purposes we shall categorize them in the following way :
Silly mistakes .
These include things like typos , or just forgetting some minor thing here and there .
Many of these would be caught by the type checker , or even the parser , though some might slip through .
Unintentional mistakes .
These are more serious mistakes than the silly mistakes , but they are still not due to a misunderstanding of the algorithm .
Intentional mistakes .
These are mistakes which are simply the result of not understanding the algorithm .
The programmer really did intend for the program to do what it does , the fact that it is not correct is due to the programmer not understanding the algorithm .
The important distinction here is between the two latter types .
Some will tend to think that these are actually the same category .
In other words , if your code compiles but does n't work , it 's the programmer 's fault .
This is true to some extent , but it is also true that this very often happens even though the programmer has a firm understanding of the algorithm she is trying to implement , so the distinction is important .
We will return to this categorization of errors later on in the discussion .
The method of computation
There is an important difference in how computation is performed in imperative and functional languages .
We shall first look at a strongly typed imperative language , and try to reason about how and where static checking might help to prevent errors , and where it wo n't .
The fundamental operation of computation in an imperative language is the modification of state .
An imperative program consists of an ordered sequence of state modifying commands .
This is of course only true to some extent , since you can often use a functional style even in an imperative programming language , but in general the computations are performed primarily by modifying state .
The important realisation here is that the result of a computation is not actually specified directly in an imperative programming language , but is extracted indirectly as a side effect of executing the state modifying commands .
From this we see the result of an imperative computation depends on two things ; the stateful commands , and the order in which these are executed .
Of these two things only the former can be statically checked .
Imperative languages in use today do very little meaningful static checking on the order of statements ( and for good reason , it is very hard ! ) .
This is the key to why plenty of programs which compile just fine in a strongly typed imperative language , simply do n't work properly at all ; the static checking performed by the compiler can only catch a very small fraction of the errors that are possible .
Functional programming is quite different .
Here the fundamental operation of computation is function application .
In a purely functional language like Haskell the question of " ordering " is simply not meaningful .
The argument should now become apparent :
Since the main operation of computation in functional languages ( function application ) is strongly typed , there 's simply less room for errors to sneak in .
So the difference , from a static checking standpoint , is that in an imperative language only part of the method of computation is actually checked , whereas for functional languages the entire method of computation can be type checked .
Let 's do an example .
We 'll write this in a fictional strongly typed imperative language , first using an imperative style , and then using a functional style .
We do n't use actual languages to better highlight the differences between the two versions .
As a simple example we shall implement a part of a merge sort algorithm .
We assume here that a function , merge , is available which will merge two sorted lists into one sorted list ( for two unsorted list it will simply produce the wrong result ) .
list.sort ( ) { if ( self.size <= 1 ) { return ; } ( list1, list2 ) = self.split( self.size / 2 ) ; list1.sort ( ) ; list2.sort ( ) ; merged_list = merge ( list1 , list2 ) ; self.set ( merged_list ) ; }
For the sake of argument , let 's assume that the programmer accidentally reordered the lines here , maybe she merges the lists before they are sorted , for example .
A type 2 error .
It 's clear that such a mistake would mean the sorting routine wo n't produce the correct result , however it is also clear that the compiler wo n't be able to catch a mistake like this .
Now , this is a fairly simple example , and naturally most people would n't make mistakes in simple examples like this , but hopefully you should be able to see how similar mistakes which are far less obvious and far easier to make are very common in imperative programming .
The key idea , yet again , is that the result of the computation depends not only on the stateful operations themselves , but also the order in which they are executed .
Only the former of these two aspects can actually be statically checked .
It is clear that mistakes due to the order of operations can in general not be caught by the compiler , and this leads to many faulty programs that nonetheless compile happily .
Let 's rewrite the same thing in a more functional style .
I should stress that this is not Haskell code , but the same made up pseudo language used above .
list.sort( ) : list { if ( self.size <= 1 ) { return self ; } ( list1, list2 ) = self.split( self.size / 2 ) ; sorted_list1 = list1.sort ( ) ; sorted_list2 = list2.sort ( ) ; merged_list = merge ( sorted_list1 , sorted_list2 ) ; return merged_list ; }
Notice that we only changed some minor things here .
Most importantly the sort method no longer changes any state , it simply returns a new sorted list ( rather than changing the current one in place ) .
By switching to a functional approach we now see that the algorithm is expressed directly in the code , rather than indirectly as a product of stateful operations and their uncheckable ordering .
If you were to make the same mistake in this code , trying to perform the merge before the sorts , you would get a compile time error .
This is because the lists used in the merge , depends on the lists retrieved from the split , which depends on the list we 're trying to sort .
So you see that the " ordering " is made explicit and direct , and will be statically checked at every stage .
You might claim the the equivalent error to the one used above would be to try to merge list1 and list2 rather than just moving the merge line up a bit , but that 's not the case at all .
We 're talking about a type 2 error here .
If the programmer understands the algorithm she will want to merge the sorted lists , not the unsorted lists .
In the imperative version the names list1 and list2 both referred to the unsorted and sorted lists depending on where you referenced them , which is the whole root of the problem , whereas in the functional way of thinking only the names sorted_list1 and sorted_list2 refer to the sorted lists .
Type of errors caught at compile time
We saw in the previous section that simply by switching to a different way of thinking we were able to catch a type 2 error at compile time , while this was impossible when using the imperative method .
Let 's discuss the three types of errors again , in some detail .

Story VIA Luxist .
It ’s been said that if you want to increase your success rate , you should increase your failure rate .
Success comes at least partially from your volume of attempts .
If you want to sell more , make more sales calls .
If you want more dates , ask more people out .
Pretty simple principle — one that ’s been around a long time .
We all know you can try to increase your rate of success as well , but for this blog entry , let ’s just stick with the concept of increasing the number of attempts .
Most people will take this advice to mean that you should take something where you have a reasonable probability of success and then do it more often .
But I ’ll take this idea a step further .
Go out and attempt something at which you know you ’ll fail .
Fail on purpose .
Keep reading and I ’ll explain how this will benefit you .
I wo n’t suggest you do this when you have lots of investors who are counting on your success or when the consequences of failure are big .
But there are many things you can do which you know you ’ll fail at but which do n’t have any serious long - term negative consequences .
Try to learn to play a musical instrument when you have no talent at it .
Attempt a small project that ’s beyond your technical abilities .
Ask for a job , promotion , or raise when you know the other person will say no .
Ask for a date when you ’re sure to get shot down cold .
Cook a meal that ’s beyond your cooking skills .
Sign up to run in a 10 K race when you ca n’t even run 1 K , and show up and run half a block .
There are several significant benefits to attempting something even when failure is certain :
You ’ll gain experience failing , how to take it , and how to recover from it , which is at least as important as learning to handle success .
You ’ll become better prepared for handling future failures .
You ’ll learn how to recover quickly , extract the key lessons , and put them to good use .
You ’ll develop greater humility , and this will allow you to subvert your ego more , so you neither become too optimistic or too pessimistic , and your productivity will become more steady and consistent .
You ’ll run straight into your limits and become comfortable working butt - up against them , instead of lagging behind your untapped potential with a comfortable padding .
You ’ll strengthen your resistance to fear of failure in the future .
Many tasks at which you ultimately fail will still yield partial success .
For example , if you try to lose 10 pounds in a month , you may fail and only lose 3 .
You ’ll become better at learning the difference between when a project is headed for failure and when it ’s headed for success .
And this will allow you to achieve more success when it really matters because you ’ll have far more experience to draw upon .
So you ’ll succeed more often .
You ’ll develop a thicker skin .
You ’ll get used to having other people slam and reject you for failing , and you ’ll be able to go out and tackle big projects without worrying what others will think .
You ’ll become more persistent .
You ’ll come to realize that failure just is n’t the big deal people made it out to be .
About 50 million sperm failed in their effort to create you , while just one made it through .
Yet what if none decided to try , the odds being overwhelmingly against success ?
You ’ll condition yourself to take action and stop ruminating .
You ’ll tear yourself away from the state of analysis paralysis , and you ’ll start making things happen instead of just pondering and planning them .
Every once in a while , you ’ll learn that you were wrong , and you ’ll succeed at something even when failure seemed certain .
You ’ll drop limiting beliefs and gain a more accurate grasp of what ’s realistically possible for you .
You ’ll discover new talents you never knew you had .
You ’ll learn that your previous concept of what you thought was realism was in fact too pessimistic , and you ’ll slide it down a notch closer to optimism until you get it just right .
You can say , “ Hehehe .
I meant to do that , ” and actually mean it for a change . 🙂
Make failure your friend , and success will tag along as well .
This advice may seem paradoxical and ironic when compared to my previous posts .
But what I ’m suggesting here is to use intentional failure as a training / conditioning exercise .
Do n’t fail on purpose when it really matters .
But embrace failure when it does n’t matter .
By going into a situation expecting to fail , you ’re more likely to fail than if you expect success .
But that ’s OK because success is n’t the point in this case .
You ’re not trying to succeed in this training exercise .
You ’re trying to increase your tolerance for and understanding of failure and rejection .
Fear of failure and fear of rejection hold many people back from setting and achieving big goals .
So it ’s critical to develop a strong immunity to both .
Taking in small , controlled doses of failure and rejection is one way to inoculate yourself against them .
They wo n’t kill you , but they will make you stronger .
Without this inoculation you ’re doomed to live as a failure hypochondriac .
Even a medium - sized failure can take you down ( into procrastination , depression , laziness ) .
So you start avoiding those failure germs .
Unfortunately , the places where success hangs out are all infested with nasty failure germs .
So by avoiding failure , you wo n’t encounter much success either .
Another problem with failure germaphobia is that you ’ll have to avoid successful people .
Successful people are constantly sneezing out failure germs , so if you get too close , they ’ll spray you .
You ’ll need to hang out mostly with other failure germaphobes then , so you ’ll learn a lot more about avoiding failure than you will about achieving success .
In the long run , you wo n’t be a failure , but nor will you be a success .
You ’ll basically just be unnecessary .
Mild failure inoculations are easier to take than confronting the most fearsome failure germs right away .
By going into a situation expecting to fail , you take your ego offline .
You are n’t emotionally invested in the situation .
Imagine asking someone out on a date when you ’re 100 % certain of hearing a no , and you just do it to get the no out of the way .
It ’s a lot less stressful than doing it when you desperately want a yes but do n’t think you can get one .
By building experience failing , you ’ll develop the backbone to still be able to do it even when you want the yes .
You ’ll be able to take your ego offline as needed , make the attempt , and then reboot and recoup quickly .
Take the failure / rejection inoculation , so you do n’t have to live out your life as a failure germaphobe .
Just ask yourself , “ What small thing can I fail at today ? ”
Then go do it .
Have some fun with it .
Let yourself discover that failure is n’t some monstrous scary thing to be avoided at all costs .
My failure task for today is to convince my 4 - year old daughter Emily to stop drawing the alphabet on her clothes .
Then maybe I ’ll teach my 1 - year old son Kyle to eat without getting food in his hair .
Is anybody keeping track of " Non-Violent Terrorism ? "
I think that it slipping between the cracks , since there are no bodies .
I have tried to focus on these acts as they appear in the news , with little or no news coverage on them .
One of the most recent , that was a major victory for Islam , was the incident about several Imams actions on a US air plane flight .
Islam is , has been using our racial and religious sensitivities against us .
Their ability to make us change how we live or how our customs of going about our everyday living .
They want us to change what we eat , say , teach , build , play and follow our laws , to name a few .
If we continue to make these accommodations as not to insult or denigrate the way they want to live , work , play and pray , we will find that our rights eroding .
I feel that they will not make the same or similar accommodations for us or anyone else , i.e. , look at any Muslim country .
One way , no otherway .
When one allows a thistle to grow in ones garden , it is not long before the garden is taken over by the thistle , where nothing other thistle will be allow to grow , all others must move out , become a thistle or be choked to death .
Beware " Non-Violent Islamic Terrorism " .
Chief counsel to committee that probed Nixon abuse of power wants similar Bush probe Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday February 7 , 2007 Print This Email
This Staffers to onetime committee voice mixed opinions
The chief counsel to the committee that investigated abuses of power by President Richard Nixon in the 1970s tells RAW STORY hed like to see a similar inquiry into clandestine intelligence operations under President George W. Bush .
Frederick A.O. Schwarz , who presently works as Senior Counsel at the New York University School of Laws Brennan Center for Social Justice , served as chief counsel to the Church Committee from 1975 - 1976 .
The committee drew its name from Senator Frank Church ( D - ID ) ( in photo ) , who led the massive probe into abuses of power by US intelligence agencies .
When asked by RAW STORY in an interview last week about whether a deeper inquiry into the activities of the intelligence community akin to the work of the Church Committee would be appropriate , Schwarz said ,  I think its a very good idea . 
 One thing that needs to be looked at is the conduct of the intelligence agencies on subjects like warrantless wiretapping and rendition for torture ,  he said .
 One important issue is the actual conduct of the agencies , and the other is the command and control questions  how were they authorized , or were they authorized ?
And if so , who were their bosses , the Department of Defense , or the White House ?  he added .
Schwarz also believes Congress should tackle the concept of presidential power espoused by the Bush White House .
 Another thing that needs to be looked at is the theory that the Bush administration has that the president is entitled to break the law ,  he said .
 Because if that s right , then much of what they 've done with respect to warrantless wiretapping and torture , he 's like a king , and he has the right , so you must take on that third subject to have a good investigation . 
Concerns about the government using its awesome technology against domestic communications  through abuses of power led to the formation of the bipartisan Senate committee in 1975 .
Over thirty years later , concerns about the Bush administrations spying activities which include employing tactics like warrantless wiretapping  and a signing statement giving the president power to open mail to fight terrorism , have led one Democratic Congressman to call for  dust[ing ] off  the same type of vigorous oversight plan which followed President Richard Nixon 's resignation .
Facing probable impeachment for the Watergate scandal , Nixon resigned after the release of a smoking gun audio tape , in which he was heard asking his chief of staff just days after the break - in at the Democratic National Committee offices in 1972 to call the FBI and say that we wish , for the country , do n't go any further into this case , period . 
RAW STORY interviews with former Church Committee staff members reveal mixed feelings about a similar probe being conducted today .
Staffers debate whether it would be appropriate to repeat  the thorough airing of Agency practices affecting American citizens  which Senator Church and Senator John Tower ( R - TX ) , the committee 's vice chairman , were able to hold in 1975 .
Schwarz , however , strongly supports a sweeping congressional investigation .
He addresses this legal controversy in a forthcoming book , Unchecked and Unbalanced : Presidential Power in a Time of Terror , which he co-authored .
But he acknowledged such an investigation would not be easy .
Whereas the Church Committee investigated intelligence agency operations from President Nixon back to the Truman administration , any probe now would likely concentrate on President Bushs tenure .
 Today , with the concentration on the current administration , it is harder to be done in a way that 's nonpartisan ,  he said .
 That does n't mean that its not necessary . 
Democrats have promised greater oversight and accountability in the 110th Congress , and one of its first legislative acts included the creation of a new committee to monitor the budgets of the nations spy agencies .
The question now is : Should both houses of Congress consider the model of intensive oversight that occurred in the post - Nixon - era Church Committee ?
The Church Committee Churchs oversight panel investigated CIA - sponsored assassinations , FBI spying on the civil rights movement , the opening of mail by those agencies , NSA activities that were in contravention of the Fourth Amendment , and other operations .
Its scope included the intelligence activities of all administrations since the end of World War Two .
 We are tasked , by Senate Resolution 21 , to investigate illegal , improper , or unethical activities  engaged in by intelligence agencies , and to decide on the need for specific legislative authority to govern operations of the National Security Agency ,  the chairman of the committee , Senator Frank Church ( D - ID ) , said on Oct. 29 , 1975 .
The Committees 160 staff members produced 50,000 pages of documentation .
Their recommendations led to a variety of reforms , including Gerald Fords executive order banning assassinations and the drafting of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which established the FISA Courts that oversee spying activities  the very court that President Bush first avoided when conducting his warrantless wiretap program .
Aside from Church and Vice Chairman Tower , the other nine members of the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities , which sat during 1975 and 1976 , included Democratic Senators Philip Hart , Walter Mondale , Walter Huddleston , Robert Morgan , and Gary Hart , along with Republican Senators Howard Baker Jr. , Barry Goldwater , Charles McCurdy Mathias Jr. , and Richard Schweiker .

Congressman says dust off the Church Committee RAW STORY contacted Schwarz to seek comment after the remarks of Rep. Adam Schiff , a California Democrat who recently said that the Church Committee 's oversight work should be dusted off .
On Jan. 24 , Schiff gave a speech on the House floor bemoaning the lack of oversight on the Bush administrations spying activities .
In the aftermath of NSA wiretapping  which President Bush agreed only under pressure to subject to the secret FISA court 
Schiff sees a need for escalated oversight of the NSA and the White Houses activities .
 In rebuffing recent congressional requests for information on the current NSA program , the administration has made the argument that the NSA surveillance program is too sensitive to be shared with Congress , even to Members in the classified setting ,  Schiff said .
 Congress should follow the example of the Church Committee , by vigorously examining the NSA surveillance program and determining what legislative action is necessary ,  Schiff added .
Along with Rep. Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , he therefore introduced H.R. 11 , the NSA Oversight Act .
Some documents on the NSA program were later released to the Intelligence Committees by the Department of Justice .
Rep.
Schiff expanded on his House speech in an e-mail to RAW STORY , saying ,  Congress should dust off the oversight plan from some 30 years ago and follow the example of the  Church Committee  which issued more than 50,000 pages of reports in what is considered the most comprehensive review of intelligence activities in the country . 
Some disagree with Church approach
Not all members of Congress agree .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , argues that more oversight could complicate the intelligence communitys broader activities and undermine existing oversight .
 The Church Committee recommended the creation of the Congressional Intelligence Committees for the purposes of carrying out oversight of the nation 's intelligence activities ,  Hoekstra spokesman Jamal Ware said in a statement .
 If changes are going to be made to intelligence oversight or appropriations , they should be made using the committees created by the Church Committee  not through creation of panels that increase the burden of congressional reporting and bureaucracy and risk confusing intelligence oversight .
Rep. Hoekstra is not alone in thinking that a Church Committee - like investigation is not the right move .
Loch Johnson , who served as Senator Churchs staff representative on the panel , says there is nt strong enough public outcry to justify such a vigorous investigation of the intelligence communitys activities .
Johnson , presently a Regents Professor of Political Science at the University of Georgia , stated ,  The CIA was Orwellian , and when you looked at the public opinion polls of the time , people were very concerned that it had gotten out of control .
We were receiving lots of mail on the subject , and it was clear something had to be done .
 The investigations of that matter were stimulated by an issue of huge concern to the American people , and we just do n't have that right now ,  he added .
 The public is riveted on the war in Iraq . 
Rhett Dawson , the minority counsel who worked with Republican Senators on the Church Committee and is now President and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council , gave another reason why the investigations model might not be applicable in the current political climate .
 The watchwords of the intelligence community in that day were plausible deniability ,  Dawson said .
 Those things were not known at all , the major operations like assassinations , and Frank Church thought that many were activities that would not have taken place but for fact that there was no strong oversight .
At one point , he called the CIA a rogue element .
Dawson continued ,  I do n't think there 's much comparison with what the Church Committee tried to do , because the particular activities now , presumably , are well known or at least known to the Intelligence Committees , and being reviewed by them . 
The former minority counsel also believed that an in - depth Church - like investigation could step on the toes of other oversight efforts in the 110th Congress .
 The Intelligence Committees in the Senate and House both get high marks ,  Dawson argued .
 I ca n't imagine that Senator ( Jay ) Rockefeller ( D - WV ) as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence would have a lot of enthusiasm to create a committee to duplicate what he thinks he 's already doing .
Churchs former staffer Loch Johnson agreed that the Intelligence Committees could accomplish a great deal , especially because he sees more Republican worries about intelligence activities .
 Republicans are concerned that the FISA court procedure is not working the way it is supposed to , and Senator McCain illustrates that the GOP is concerned with renditions and the secret prisons too ,  he explained .
Former chief counsel Schwarz says that the current Congresss committees could accomplish some vigorous oversight .
But he also maintains that theres a need for investigations to go deeper , and that existing committees arent capable of doing that .
 A good congressional investigation takes real time , it takes pushing aggressively for documents ,  he said .
 Single hearings to have people come in and pontificate , they re not going to give you the real credibility that something like the Church Committee had .
You need something with the staying power of a Church - type committee to have effective oversight . 
Last night , Harold Varmus appeared to me in a dream .
Dressed in cycling garb , the Nobel laureate and former director of the National Institutes of Health was on a mission to rid the world of corks .
This is not as foolish a quest as it might sound .
In the dream , corks were plugging bath drains and kitchen sinks , clogging street gutters in miniature logjams , even getting stuck in people ’s mouths .
For Varmus , the moment had come to fight back .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
I had been spending some time with Varmus , so I was not surprised to find him in a dream of mine , wearing his biking outfit .
At 66 , he is an avid cyclist , as well as a jogger , hiker , and rower , and he loves to talk about his physical pursuits .
His crusade against the corks makes sense , too .
They ’re a comically simple metaphor , courtesy of my rubelike unconscious , for a real - life struggle that has engrossed him since he left the NIH seven years ago and that has turned this icon of the scientific establishment into a powerful subversive .
Three days before the dream , I am walking with Varmus across Harvard Yard .
We ’re heading to the Berkman Center for Internet and Society , which has invited him up from Manhattan ’s Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , where he is president .
It ’s a cold , blustery day , but Varmus is wearing only a thin hounds - tooth sports jacket against the wind , which has whisked his sparse , reddish brown hair into a messy crest .
He keeps his hands in his jacket pockets and a slightly strained smile on his face .
Varmus is the most visible characterin the movement to free the scientific world of its figurative corks : scholarly journals that restrict the flow of information by charging often hefty subscription prices for access to their content .
Today , Varmus has been invited by Charles Nesson , a professor of law at Harvard , to enlighten the student editors of the various Harvard Law School journals about the virtues of so - called open - access publishing .
Nesson introduces his guest as “ the prophet of open access . ” Varmus ’ smile does n’t fade , and his hair stands proudly where the wind last left it .
He calmly lays out his campaign .
For centuries , journals have been the means both of disseminating scientific knowledge and building scientific careers .
Accordingly , the journals atop the hierarchy draw the highest - quality submissions , which reinforces their lofty reputations , which in turn enhances the status of the scientists who publish there .
This positive feedback loop puts the power in the hands of the journals , even though their existence depends entirely on the scientists who write , edit , and serve as reviewers , usually without compensation .
Meanwhile , their colleagues can gain access only through subscriptions that their institutions pay for , sometimes dearly .
( A yearly subscription to Brain Research , for instance , costs more than $ 20,000 . )
Worse , most of the public – scientists in developing countries , faculty and students in underfunded colleges , high schoolers , patients – have no access at all , even though taxes fund the government grants that support much of the research .
Varmus asks :
Should n’t this ancient system have changed with the Internet , which allows information to be disseminated cheaply and immediately searched , mined , archived , reviewed , and improved ?
He then opens the floor for discussion .
The editors seem enthusiastic , if a little perplexed .
“ We have a different situation , since the journal has its own institutional cachet , ” says the editor of The Harvard Law Review , a graceful young woman in a sky - blue cashmere sweater .
“ I ca n’t imagine proposing to my board that we stop printing paper copies . ”
“ Printing paper copies of the journal is n’t inconsistent with open access , ” points out Stuart Shieber , a computer science professor who is championing open access at Harvard .
“ What matters is whether you put your content up on your Web site , too , for free . ”
“ Oh , we do that already , ” she says .
“ Then in what sense are n’t you open access ? ” Varmus asks .
“ Well , we only leave it up for a little while , ” she replies .
“ Then we take it down .
We have to , because of our agreements with other Web content companies , like Lexis - Nexis . ”
“ How much money are we talking about ? ” Shieber asks .
“ I really should n’t be specific . ”
“ Ballpark . ”
“ Like , half a million ? ” ( Later , she tells a Wired fact - checker it ’s closer to $ 100,000 . )
People shuffle in their seats .
“ So , what happens to that money ? ” Shieber asks .
The law review editor shrugs .
“ We keep it . ”
There ’s a silence , like the sound of a cork not popping .
The exchange with the law review editor is a mere skirmish in a protracted war that Varmus and his comrades have been waging against the status quo .
His early attempts to change scientific publishing and convince the scientific community of the virtues of open access fell flat .
But that did n’t dampen his passion , and a recent effort has become a spectacular success .
Three years ago , through an organization he cofounded called the Public Library of Science , Varmus launched a set of journals , which survive not through subscriptions but by charging $ 1,500 to most authors ( and thus their grant givers ) whose articles are accepted for publication .
Everything is then put online and kept there , freely accessible to anyone .
Despite the newness of this model , research published in the flagship journals PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine often finds its way to The New York Times or the BBC .
Last June , less than two years after the first issue of PLoS Biology went online , Thomson Scientific , a firm that tracks citation rates , assessed the journal an “ impact factor ” higher than such established journals as Biological Reviews and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Indeed , in a phenomenally short time , it has become the most cited journal in general biology .
The success of the top two PLoS journals has led to the birth of four more modest ones aimed at specific fields : clinical trials , computational biology , genetics , and pathogens .
And this summer , Varmus and his colleagues will launch PLoS One , a paperless journal that will publish online any paper that evaluators deem “ scientifically legitimate . ”
Each article will generate a thread for comment and review .
Great papers will be recognized by the discussion they generate , and bad ones will fade away .
“ Our mission is to transform how science publishing is done , ” Varmus says .
“ We are n’t trying to torpedo the industry .
But we are definitely going to change it . ”
Walking back to Harvard Square to pick up a cab , Varmus looks over his shoulder toward Wendell Street , where he lived 44 years ago when he was a grad student in English literature .
The son of a doctor and a social worker , Varmus grew up on Long Island , spending his free time on the beach or with his nose in a book .
He entered Amherst College with a notion of becoming a doctor ( too predictable ) , then tried on philosophy ( too abstract ) and physics ( too hard ) before earning his degree in literature ( just right , it seemed then ) and starting graduate studies at Harvard in 1961 .
Varmus soon began to notice , though , that his medical school friends were much more excited about their work than he was .
Then one night he had a revelation :
If he became an English professor , his students would probably be relieved if he failed to show up for class .
But if he became a doctor and canceled his appointments , his patients would be disappointed .
He applied to med school .
Rejected by Harvard , Varmus ended up at Columbia .
To avoid the Vietnam draft , he applied for and won a position as a “ yellow beret ” in the NIH ’s Public Health Service .
Once there , he gravitated toward the study of tumor viruses , partly because his mother had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer .
Then , in 1970 , he moved with his wife to San Francisco to work with Michael Bishop , a young microbiologist at UCSF .
Their work showed that certain cancer - inducing viruses do their damage by capturing normal genes in the host ’s own cells and turning them into cancer causers .
This discovery led to the isolation of these so - called oncogenes .
“ The research I did with Mike did n’t have the manic quality of some scientific discoveries , like the discovery of the double helix , ” Varmus says .
“ This was Wagner rather than Mozart – a slow elaboration of themes , sung over and over again . ”
In the final act , Varmus and Bishop shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine .
Varmus had always been passionate and outspoken , and with a Nobel in hand he found people more willing to listen .
While continuing his research , he became increasingly involved in policy issues .
In 1993 , Donna Shalala , Bill Clinton ’s secretary of health and human services , tapped Varmus to run the world ’s largest biomedical research organization ; as NIH director , he nearly doubled the agency ’s budget , revamped its research programs , and hired some of the sharpest minds in science to run the individual institutes .
Writing in The New Yorker in 1999 , James Fallows wondered whether Varmus was “ the most effective backstairs politician the Clinton Administration has produced . ”
The day before the 1998 State of the Union address , Varmus received an invitation just as he arrived in London on business .
He responded that he would return to Washington if he could sit in the audience next to the First Lady .
The next night , there he was at her side , the president beaming at them while announcing yet another increase in the NIH budget .
By this time , however , Varmus was growing restless .
Too much of his schedule was occupied with administrative matters and answering to Congress .
Though Varmus liked the feeling of being in charge , it was time to move on .
Then , in December 1998 , Varmus met with one of Bishop ’s former postdocs , a Stanford biochemist named Patrick Brown .
Brown and a fellow of his , Michael Eisen , were using a technique for genetic analysis that benefits particularly from information - sharing across many labs .
Eisen had written a program to enable such exchanges , but it was constantly banging up against copyright restrictions from journals that did n’t want the data in their articles passed around .
Brown and Eisen thought that was insane .
For a decade , the physics community had run an electronic archive out of Los Alamos National Laboratory , where researchers could upload their papers even before having them formally accepted by journals .
The physicists loved it .
Why not create something similar for the bio-medical community ?
The conversation clicked with Varmus .
Soon , he , Brown , Eisen , and David Lipman , an NIH colleague , drafted a proposal for “ E - Biomed , ” a public , one - stop repository of biomedical papers .
Researchers could submit papers through a peer - review process similar to that used in the current journal system , or they could post work fresh out of the test tube .
In May 1999 , seven months before leaving the NIH , Varmus published his vision for E - Biomed online with high hopes .
It proved to be the first of several frustrating failures .
There were hundreds of responses , some supportive but most antagonistic .
Though the smaller , friendlier physics community had embraced the idea of freely sharing preprints , the more crowded and competitive world of biomedicine greeted it with open hostility , comparing it to socialism and lamenting what they saw as a loss of peer review .
E - Biomed “ is among the very worst ideas I have ever heard , ” one University of Wisconsin - Madison biochemist told The New York Times .
Chastened , Varmus and his colleagues regrouped .
Rather than challenge the journals directly , they would invite them to make their content available gratis in an online repository called PubMed Central after a six - month delay .
The waiting period was a bitter pill for Varmus , but it would allow the journals to continue collecting revenue from subscribers who wanted the very latest research results .
Still , only eight established journals accepted the invitation .
In the fall of 2000 , the activists went on the offensive for a third time .
They founded an organization called the Public Library of Science and circulated an open letter calling for the establishment of an online library that would provide the published record of biomedical research in a “ freely accessible , fully searchable , interlinked form . ”
The signatories pledged not to publish in , edit or review for , or subscribe to any journal after September 2001 that did not make its content freely available in PubMed Central six months after publication .
Over the next year , 34,000 scientists signed the pledge .
Journal editors decried what they rightly perceived as the threat of an economic boycott .
And when September 2001 came around , most signers , fearing harm to their careers , backed away from their promise .
The boycott crumbled .
Faced with this setback , Varmus and his coconspirators made their boldest move .
If the journals were going to resist the open - access movement , then open access would take the battle onto the journals ’ own turf : Varmus and his colleagues would become publishers .
In the UK , a spirited entrepreneur named Vitek Tracz had already started a venture called BioMed Central , publishing lower - level journals with revenue from authors ’ fees .
But Varmus wanted the PLoS journals to have the credentials to immediately draw outstanding submissions .
They lured the editor of the top journal Cell to serve as executive director .
They hired staff who had worked at both Nature and Science , and they began wooing prestigious contributors .
“ We felt we could make it work because we had revolutionary fervor , ” Varmus says , “ plus a $ 9 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . ”
PLoS quickly became a place for first - rate work .
Recently , I asked a scientist whose work had appeared in a PLoS publication how much his choice of an open - access journal was based on support for this movement .
“ Open access ? ” he replied .
“ I just sent the manuscript to PLoS because I figured it was a good place to get published . ”
And that ’s the issue .
Varmus is gratified that PLoS has established itself so quickly , but he ’s frustrated at how slowly the scientific community is embracing his ideals .
On the positive side , more scientists are sharing their work through listservs , preprint archives , and other informal networks that can be easily accessed through new searching and sorting tools like Google Scholar .
On the other hand , the scientists at elite universities who can put the most pressure on the journals to change their policies have the least immediate incentive to do so , since they already have access to most of what they require through the subscriptions paid by their institutional libraries .
Varmus also acknowledges that it ’s easier for a scientist at his exalted level to call for career sacrifices , and things like boycotts , than it is for those still in the trenches to respond .
Behind Varmus ’ office desk is a blowup of a photo taken 30 years ago of him paddling a raft down Wind River Country in Wyoming .
He wears a fishing vest , his beard is bushy and wild , and he looks ecstatically happy .
The picture was shot after his Nobel - worthy work with Michael Bishop appeared in Nature .
“ I ’d like to think that if I could do it over again , I would publish it in an open - access journal , ” he says – adding , however , that he knows the thrill of appearing in the most prestigious journal .
“ The change will come when scientists understand that they are in control .
The publishers need us more than we need them . ”
The group called itself " The Family . "
After meticulously casing a horsemeat packing plant in Redmond , Ore. , they made a firebomb using soap and petroleum products ( a napalm - like substance known as " vegan Jell - O " ) and a time - delayed incendiary device called a " Cat's Cradle . "
Arriving at the staging area after dark , they dressed in dark clothing , masks , and gloves , and checked their walkie - talkies and police radio scanner .
Quietly , they crept through the sagebrush toward the target .
They drilled holes through the wall so the fuel would pour into the building .
Then , they set the firebomb against the wall and retreated to the staging area .
There , they dumped their dark clothes and shoes into a hole and poured in acid to destroy DNA and other evidence .
By the time the packing plant , Cavel West , Inc. , was engulfed in flames , " The Family " had vanished into the night .
Five days later , through an anonymous communiqué , the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) took credit for the fire that destroyed the facility in July of 1997 .
But it would be years before the alleged plotters were apprehended .
And until then , according to a 65 - count indictment announced last week by the US Justice Department , the 11 - member group of activists launched 17 similar attacks across Oregon , Wyoming , Washington , and California in what authorities consider one of the most extensive campaigns of " ecoterrorism " in US history .
Documents and other information revealed in recent court hearings provide an inside look at how a band of extremists - 20th century Luddites , in a way - tried to leave their explosive imprint on a society whose commerce and industry they believed was overwhelming nature .
Edward Abbey , the desert curmudgeon whose 1975 novel " The Monkey Wrench Gang " inspired the environmental group Earth First ! , once declared that " sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul . "
Most who took this to heart had no intention of breaking the law .
But somewhere along the way , vandalizing log trucks and " liberating " lab rats escalated into firebombs , plots to blow up electrical towers and dams , code names , and anonymous communiqués boasting of destroying millions of dollars in property .
Other targets allegedly attacked by " The Family , " for instance , include US Forest Service ranger stations , wild horse corrals used by the US Bureau of Land Management , a Bonneville Power Administration electrical tower , and an SUV dealership .
There were also three forest products companies , the University of Washington Horticultural Center , a Colorado ski resort , and a police station in Eugene , Ore .
While the attacks occurred around the West , 12 of the 17 were in Oregon , most within an hour or so of Eugene .
Like Berkeley , Calif. , Madison , Wisc. , and Boulder , Colo. , Eugene is a university town known for its liberal politics .
But it 's also home to more radical thinking as well , including anarchists behind much of the rioting and destruction at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle .
Those close to the underground activists say the FBI has targeted the wrong people .
" What law enforcement has done is round up a bunch of above - ground , well - known , peaceful animal - rights activists and environmental activists and charged them with being members of the ALF and the ELF [ Earth Liberation Front ] simply because they can't find the real members , " says Jerry Vlasak , spokesman for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office in Canoga Park , Calif .
" These people are completely innocent of the charges . "
Many of those charged appear to have led unremarkable lives in recent years .
Suzanne Savoie works in a home for the developmentally disabled here in Ashland , Ore. Jonathon Paul , who lives with his wife in the mountains nearby , trains people who fight wildfires .
Kevin Tubbs has been an assistant manager at a department store .
Chelsea Gerlach is a disc jockey in Portland whose father works in the timber industry .
Yet modest , unassuming lives may have masked ideals and activism that went beyond the mainstream .
Thirteen years ago , Mr. Paul spent six months in jail for refusing to testify about convicted ALF arsonist Rod Coronado .
Mr. Tubbs once worked for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) .
As a sophomore at South Eugene High School , Ms. Gerlach wrote in the school yearbook : " Our generation was born to save the Earth - if we wait until we 're out of school it might be too late . "
Among activists , the recent arrests have brought a sense of fear and loathing - fear that there may be more to come from the police agencies that seem to have cracked the super - secrecy of ALF and ELF , and loathing for the informants who apparently enabled the breakthrough .
Activists writing online blogs have issued veiled threats against two " snitches , " one of whom has been charged in the destruction of an electrical transmission tower in 1999 .
The sister of one of the informants , describing herself as " brokenhearted , " speculated that law - enforcement officers may have provided drugs to her heroin - addicted brother .
" Just assume every conversation you have is bugged , assume everyone is an informer if you must , and do n't talk about ANYTHING to ANYONE , " another person wrote on an Internet site .
That warning seems to be well - founded .
Evidence supporting the indictments reportedly includes 35 compact discs of recorded conversations and 40,000 pages of transcripts , police reports , and photos .
Earlier this month , three more people were arrested for conspiring to destroy a US Forest Service genetics institute near Placerville , Calif .
In his affidavit to US Magistrate Gregory Hollows , FBI Special Agent Nasson Walker revealed that the investigation involved " a confidential source who is deeply embedded with the subjects ' cell . "
The paid informant secretly recorded conversations , sent text messages from her cell phone about ELF activities , and occasionally had clandestine meetings with FBI agents .
The recent arrests mark a breakthrough for the FBI in its fight against what it calls " ecoterrorism . "
But the story is far from over .
Some 1,200 such incidents have been recorded in recent years from Oregon to New York .
ALF / ELF and their defenders point out that no fatalities have resulted .
But property damage has totaled more than $ 200 million .
Both sides in the struggle understand its seriousness .
" Persons who conduct this type of activity are going to spend a long time in jail and they should understand that , regardless of the motive , " FBI Director Robert Mueller said .
Mr. Tubbs , now awaiting trial , no doubt has that possibility on his mind .
Supporters have set up a " book wish list " for Tubbs .
Among the volumes he'd like to read : " Prison Etiquette : The Convict 's Compendium of Useful Information . "

ヘッヘッヘッ。どうも書いてあることがよく分らなかった人がいるようだ。
何にしても、この間のブログエントリはすごーくたくさん読まれ、斜め読みされ、リンクされ、異議を唱えられ、共感され、誤解され、称賛され、こき下ろされ、あらゆる扱いを受けた。私はどうやら慣例を破って、本腰を入れてフォローアップを書いた方が良さそうだ。
ついでながら、アジャイル文法教師たちが小学校で私に押しつけたバカみたいな文法ルールを全部破るのがどんなに楽しいかは言葉にもできない。彼らは今日まで生き延びている几帳面で短気な性格タイプを代表していて、世界中のスクラムマスターを認定したり飼い猫にペンキを塗ったりで大忙しだ。[疑問に思っているかもしれないね。猫の話はもう少したらするよ。]
OK 。前口上は十分だろう。ショーを始めよう!
本日のエンターテインメントでは、山ほどのつまらないジョークと、洞察を1つか2つ提供することをお約束しよう。それからお行儀良く聞いていたら本物のマジックを最後にお見せしよう。じゃあ、がんばって!
いい種類はひとつではない
面白い部分に入る前に、いろんな人がひっきりなしに言ってくる1つの大きな誤解についてはっきりさせようと思う。
私がGoogleの開発プラクティスを反例として使ったことで、Googleのアプローチが(a)アジャイル、(b)ウォーターフォール、(c)ナイアルラトホテップ†に対する唯一の代替案であると、そう私が主張しているのだと思った人たちがいるようだ。
†H・P・ラヴクラフトの 「 クトゥルー神話」に登場するキャラクター
そうじゃない !
私が Googleのプロセスを出したのは、ただ他にも方法はあり、それが機能していることを示すためだった。私がこの証拠を示したのは、アジャイルの主張である、「このアジャイルマニフェストを47秒以内に5人の友達に転送しなければ、即死して高層ビルから肥溜めに放り込まれることになる」(若干言葉を変えてある)に立ち向かうためだった。
まじめな話、アジャイルを超えた姿について議論するとき、別にGoogleに目を向ける必要はない。ただまわりを見渡せば、アジャイルでないチームの「サクセスストーリー」をたくさん見つけられるだろう。「サクセスストーリー」を探すのは、もちろんバカだ。それは選択的強化であり、(たとえば)常習的ギャンブル癖へと至る道だ。本当の証拠が欲しいなら、実験によって科学的な根拠を構成すべきだ。あいにくとこれは、失敗にも目を向けなければならないということだ。あ痛っ!
これはマーケティングには具合が悪い。アジャイルの人たちが「サクセスストーリー」を聞いて回っていたら、ポジティブなものだけ見るのは疑似科学であることを丁寧に指摘してあげよう。
自分で見てまわって調査してみれば、2つの次元と4つのカテゴリがあることが分かる。「アジャイル
対 非アジャイル 」 と「 失敗 対 成功」だ。それぞれのカテゴリに当てはまるプロジェクトを見つけられるはずだ。「サクセスストーリー」にだけ目を向けないこと。全体像を見て、自分で観察したことと他の会社にいる友達が観察したことを関連付けてみよう。正直に評価したなら、アジャイルはそんなに広まってはおらず、彼らがあなたに信じさせようとしているほどには成功する傾向が強くないことが分かるだろう。それとはほど遠い。
具体例を1つ挙げると、ある人がコメントで、Blizzardがスケジュールにしたがって出荷していないことを指摘していた。彼らは「アプリケーションができたときに」出荷する。World of Warcraftって聞いたことのない人、手を挙げて。どう?
誰もいないの ?
WoWは過密でロックインされた( みんな自分の今のMMORPGの中に居続けようとする)ゲームの世界に押し入ってきて、SonyやMicrosoftのような巨大な競合たちが作っているクズを踏みつぶした。一夜にして。ドカーン。そしてBlizzardというのはGoogleとこれ以上ないくらいに違ったビジネスをしている。パッケージゲームソフトというのは他のソフトとは特に違っているものであり、歴史的に革新的で、賞を総なめにする、大勝のベストセラーが生まれる場所なのだ。
しかしアジャイルでないチームや会社を個別なケースとして数え上げていくよりも、一般的な法則を示す方がいいだろう。「世界の偉大なソフトウェア開発者のほとんどは、アジャイルを使っていない」。彼らは単に熱心に仕事し、軽量であり続け、偉大なものを作り出す。開発者の多くはアジャイルとは何かのアイデアさえ持っていない。そのことを考えることだ!
アジャイルはニッチであり、市場の少数派だ。ほとんど特異と言っていい。たまたま多量のマーケティングを手にしただけのことだ。これまでまったく未開拓だった、技術分野のいんちき薬のマーケットを開拓したのだ。コンサルタントはだまされやすいクライアントに、プロセスが「ちゃんとしていない」と言っては契約を拡張し、濡れ手に粟の儲けをしている。
アジャイルは別にたいしたものではないが、アジャイル陣営はほんとに声が大きいのだ。うるさいくらいに。開発者の普段の仕事に差し障るくらいに十分うるさい。それが私の声を上げなければならなかった理由だ。アジャイルはほとんど2ヶ月の間私をブロガーの壁に突き当たらせていた謎のトピックだ。しかしある時点で、私は耐えられなくなった。そこかしこで批判されてはいるが、しかしそのどれもアジャイルの連中ほどに声が大きくはない。
だから私は可能な限り大声で叫んだのだ。スラッシュドットにさえ載るくらいの大声で!
それはまさに私の望んだことだった。私が世界中の開発者に伝えたいマーケティングメッセージはただ1つだった。「アジャイルにノーと言ってもいいんだよ」。それだけだ。そんな込み入った話じゃない。しかしアジャイルの教会はあまりに強力になっていて、職場でアジャイルでない人々を批判することはますます許容されるようになっている。そのことについてはすぐに話すつもりだ。
実のところ、私のメッセージを伝えるのは、全体としてそんなに難しいことではなかった。いんちき薬というのは滑稽なものだからだ。簡単にコケにできる。
あなたはおそらく、アジャイルの連中がまったくユーモアを欠いていることに気づいていると思う。この間の私のブログ投稿のあと、アジャイルコミュニティ全体が、画策し、配置に付き、戦略をめぐらし始めた。そしてこれはできのいい方の人たちのことだ。その他の人たちはというと、ただ「私は実際このダイエットで35ポンド痩せた!」と叫んでいて、「実験
対 統計的に無意味な逸話」についての私の話のポイントを理解し損ねていることを示していた。それで彼らを非難するわけにはいかないだろう。処理すべき情報が山ほどあったのだ。まるまる本1冊分の情報が、1章分のブログ記事に押し込められていたのだ。しかし全体として、アジャイル側には自嘲的ユーモアがほとんど見受けられなかった。
コミュニティのユーモアのレベルを見てそれが「国家安全保障」レベルと位置づけられるようなら、それはあなたが絶対関わりたくないと思う相手であることのいい目印になる。
何にせよ 、Googleのアプローチが他の分野のテクノロジー企業にも実行可能かどうかという議論は注意をそらすものだ。多くの会社はアジャイル方法論を使ってはいないか、使っていたとしてもごく一部のチーム、おそらくは10%未満が使っているにすぎない。たぶんね。少なくとも私がその会社出身の人をたくさん知っている会社はそうだ。Sun、Microsoft、Yahoo、Amazon、Google、Blizzard、そのほか、クールなソフトを作っている業界のリーダーはみんなそうだ。彼らはほとんどアジャイルなしでやっている。Googleだけというわけではない。みんなそうなのだ。
アジャイルの連中はまったく声が大きく、彼らは何か治安妨害チケットでも持ってるに違いない。彼らは実際に多数派でなくとも、一種の道徳的多数派なのだとあなたに信じ込ませようとしている。
あなたも今ではそのことが分かっていると思う。
静的型付けと心強いメタデータの必要
いい/悪いアジャイルの暴言の最後の方で私が静的型付けについて述べた微妙な点に目を留めた人たちもいた。私はそれについてあまり書かなかったが、「だったら何を使 えばいいんだ?」という叫びを目にして、これはあのときに私が考えていたよりも、もっと中心的な問題なのかもしれないと思うようになった。
一見関係なさそうな短い逸話をお話しよう。しかしそれはかみ合うのだ。ちょっと我慢して聞いてほしい。
私の高校時代の英語教師は、学期の最後の日に、その人がだらしないかきれい好きか見ただけで言い当てられると言って、みんなを驚かせた。彼女はまた、(私はこれにまったく同意するのだが、)だらしない人ときれい好きな人とを分けている線は、その確かな指標は、毎朝ベッドメークするかどうかなのだと言った。それから彼女は私たちの1人ひとりに向かって、「だらしない」「きれい好き」と指摘していった。彼女の判定が合っていることをみんなが認めた。(そして私たちのほとんどはだらしない方だった。ベッドメークするのは間抜けだ。)
他の多くのプログラミング言語に対してやっているのと同じように、私は以前、Perlの技術的な弱点を長々とこき下ろしたことがあった。私はいつも驚きを感じ続けているのだが、Perlの連中というのは、唯一決して怒らない人たちだ。彼らはただ「ハハ、そうだね、坊や、お前正しいよ。確かに醜い。いやいや、うん、まあ、ともかく、俺仕事に戻んないと・・・ 」
これはすごいと思う。私は彼らにすごく敬意を感じるようになった。このことだけでも、Perlでのプログラミングに戻ろうかと思うに十分なほどだ。
まあ、ほとんどは 。
Perlの連中は毎 年Perl Haiku competitionというのをやっている。これは気の利いたアイデアだ。17音節で役に立つプログラムが書けるというのは、ほんとに驚くべきことだ。
私は一度 Javaで試してみて、ちゃんとし たJava俳句を作った。
ArrayList<int > myListOfInt = new ArrayList<int >( ) ;
これを声に出して読むとこうなる。
ArrayList of Int my list of int , equals new ArrayList of Int
私だけなのかもしれないが、Javaだとこんな単純な宣言だけで俳句サイズになってしまうのには、すごくがっかりする。
有名 なFar Sideの漫画家でありコンピュータサイエンティストであるGary Larson博士は、1987年10月に、Javaスタイルの静的タイプシステムについての決定的な論文を出した。あなた方の十分多くがFar Sideの本を買ってくれれば「フェアユース」になることを期待して、完全なム許諾のもと、彼の論文をここに複製する疑わしい自由を行使する。買ってくれないなら、まあ、Miranda Pinsley†がどうなったか思い出してほしい。
† 「 Miranda Pinsleyという女性がこのメールを転送しなかったためにひどい死に方をした」という内容のチェーンメールがある。
これ がLarson博士の、型推論のない静的型付けシステムに関する有名な論文だ。
これは本当に、かつて出版された中でも最も洞察に富んだコンピュータサイエンスの論文の1つだと思う。Larson博士が当時認識していなかったのは、彼がアジャイル方法論をも予言していたということだ。
私がこの何年かの間にタイプシステムについて学んだことが1つあるとしたら、それはだらしないタイプシステムと、きれい好きのタイプシステムがあって、それは結局個人の好みの問題だということだ。きれい好きな人たち( Java、C#、C++、Pascal ) は、だらしない連中( Perl、Python、Ruby、JavaScript)が同じくらいに生産的であることを十分にわかっている。あるいはもっと生産的かもしれない。誰にもはっきりとはわからない。はっきりしているのは、みんな言語の選択にかかわらず仕事をやり遂げているということだ。議論になっているのは生産性のことだと多くの人は思っているが、実際には生産性のことではぜんぜんない。それはベッドメークされてない家で暮らすのに我慢できるかどうかという問題なのだ。
ベッドメークは間抜けがすることだとは言ったかしら?
まあ、それは単に私の見方ということだ。私の妻はほとんど毎朝私たちのベッドのベッドメークをする。私にはそれがわずらわしいし、意味がないと思う。どうせ夜にはぐちゃぐちゃにしてしまんだから。しかし彼女はその場所をきれいにしておかないと、すごく居心地悪く感じる。だから私は靴下を拾ったりなんだりしなきゃならなくなる。
いつでもだらしない連中がおり、そしていつでもきれい好きな連中がいる。比喩的に言うと、猫に「猫」と書き、犬に「犬」と書かなきゃ気のすまないプログラマがいて、そうしないと彼らは、私が皿を山ほど流しに突っ込んでおいたり服を床に脱ぎ散らかしていたときの妻のように、ストレスを感じ、居心地悪く感じるのだ。それからメソドロジーを必要とするプログラマというのもいる。今のやつは助けにならないと納得させても、彼らにはそれを捨てることができない。彼らは何か別なものへと切り替える必要があるのだ。
それが証明された銀の弾丸などではなく、単にひとつのスタイルなのだと彼らが理解しているなら、別に問題はないと思う。
残念ながら、私たち1人ひとりの脳に組込まれた若干バグッぽい生存メカニズムを通して、アジャイルはウィルスのように広まっている。ウィルスの流行と戦うには極端な方法をとる必要がある。だから私は本当に大きな
切り札を出すことにして、私の父のチリについて話そう。
チリ作り
たくさんの頑固なアジャイル主義者たちが、自分たちにはアジャイルは何年もうまく機能しており、それで成功してきたのだと怒って反論している。彼らは私がアジャイルは「機能しない」と言ったと思っているらしい。アジャイルプロジェクトは90%の場合には失敗すると私が主張していると思った人さえいるのだ!
誤解しないでもらいたい。アジャイルはとても良く機能する(あるいは少なくとも機能しうる)。問題はそれよりもっと微妙なものだ。多くの人はそれを理解しているようだが、しかしアジャイルの人たちの多くはまったくそれに気付いていないのだ。だから私はその微妙なところをはっきりさせて、問題が彼らによりはっきり分るようにしようと思う。
私が十代の頃、父と兄のマイクがホームメイドのチリを作ろうと決めた。私はチリを作っているところを見たことがなかったので、彼らが牛肉や豆や野菜やスパイスや、そのほかの材料を加えていくのを、強い興味を持って眺めていた。父は味見して、もっと材料を付け加え、少し待って、また味見した。父はあるすごくいいレシピを持っているのだ。父が戸棚を開けて、ホーメルのチリソースの缶を2つ取り出して、ふたを開けてぶっ込んだのを見たときに、私がどれくらい困惑したか想像できるだろう。
私はしばらく間を置いてから、なんでチリに缶詰のチリを加えたのか聞いてみた。父も兄もひどい味だったからと答えた。今や有名になった父の発見は、「犬の糞から始めても十分なチリを加えればチリになる」ということだ。
同様に、アジャイルメソドロジーから始めても、十分な努力を注げば、多くの仕事をやり遂げられるのだ。考えてみて。
しかしこれはトートロジーだ。「アジャイルメソドロジー」の部分を何でも好きなものと置き換えたところで、相変わらず正しい。たぶん風水で何年にも渡ってプロジェクトを成功させてきたと信じている人たちを見つけるのも難しくはないだろう。あるいは泉に硬貨を投げ入れることによって。プロジェクトを完成させるために魔法を使っている人たちだってたぶんいるのだろう。そしてそれらのプロジェクトのかなりのものは—おそらく大多数は—最後には成功しているのだ。
十分長い日数雨乞いの踊りを続ければ、いつか効果が出る。間違いなく。
だから私はアジャイルが機能しないとは言わない。機能しますとも!
しかしそれは、単なるまじりっけなしの迷信だ。
では、諸君、本日最後のビッグトピックに取りかかることにしよう。さあマジックの準備だ!
ブレークダンスする 鶏
ああ、そうだ。はじめに鶏の話をしなきゃいけない。私たちは猫をやって、チリをやったから、今度は鶏だ。ほとんど最後の幕の準備ができている。これはたくさんの人を本当に怒らせることになると思うけど、すぐに話してあげる。
1986年、大学の心理学入門の授業で、教授が去年自分の異常心理の授業であった、ちょっとしたことについて話してくれた。その授業では、学生はそれぞれ実験用のネズミを渡され、ネズミが迷路で正しく行動したらご褒美をあげることで、迷路抜けられるようにネズミを訓練しなければならなかった。しかし学生の中に1人ネズミを怖がる女の子がいたため、彼女には鶏を渡して、くちばしで鍵盤をつついてピアノを弾くトレーニングさせることにした。鶏が正しい鍵盤をつつくごとに、彼女はペレット(あるいは何であれ、鶏が食べるもの)を与えた。間違えたらペレットなしだ。彼女が1度に音符を1つずつ教えていけば、最後には曲全体を覚えるようになるだろう。
彼女がたぶん曲の半分くらいまで鶏に覚えさせたある時のことだが、鶏が激しく頭を左右に振って、そのすぐあとに彼女が教えようとしている次の音符を含んだ音符の並びを正しく弾いた。鶏は正しく鍵盤を弾いたので、彼女はペレットをあげないわけにはいかなかった。鶏は彼女が望むことをすればおいしいペレットがもらえるのだとはっきり理解していた。そしてこのペレットによって、鶏は鍵盤と首振り運動の両方でご褒美がもらえると思うようになった。それ以来鶏はピアノを弾きながら絶えず狂ったようなツイスト運動をするようになった。正しく鍵盤を叩いたときには彼女はご褒美を与えなければならず、ツイストは必要じゃないのだと伝えるいい方法がなかった(最初からやり直すのでなければ。しかしそうする時間はなかった)。そして鶏は激しくのたうち回るのが、そのプロジェクトの成功に役立つのだと幸福に信じ続けた。
彼らは後に地元の大学をツアーしてまわったということだ。宣伝文句は「ブレークダンスしながらピアノを弾く鶏」だった。
教授は目を丸くした一年生たちに、この現象は迷信と呼ばれており、これは黒猫だとか、はしごの下をくぐるとか、鏡を割るとか、室内で傘を広げるとか、そういったことに誰かがこだわるというときの迷信とまったく同じ種類のことなのだと話した。科学的実験や純粋な演繹的推論に基づかない信念はみ
んな 「迷信」に含まれる( 多かれ少なかれ ) 。
まあ、それだとすごく範囲が広くなる。私たちは知っている(あるいは知っていると思っている)ことのほとんどについて、わざわざ検証しようとしたりはしない。それは私たちがみんな迷信的だということなのだろうか?
その通りであることが明らかになる。私たちの脳は強力なパターンマッチマシンだ。私たちは生き残り、世界について学ぶため、自分の経験について何百万という推論を構築できる必要がある。そしてリアルタイムでこの「パターンデータベース」にマッチングをかけるのだ。すべての情報を十分速く処理するために、私たちの心は、同時に起る2つの出来事には相関があると仮定する傾向がある。
今言ったことは、たぶん今回の文章全体の中で最も重要なところなので、もう一度繰り返しておこう。私の退屈な講義であなたが居眠りしていたかもしれない。寝ないでね!
もうすぐマジックをやるんだから。見逃したくないでしょ!
繰り返し : 因果関係があるように見える2つの出来事が起きるのを見ると、あなたの脳は自然かつ自動的に、強化される。これは「サクセスストーリー」としても知られている。鶏は全くの偶然に、ツイストと同時に正しい音符を見つけた。それからペレットをもらい、そのあとはツイストがペレットの出てくる原因の1つだと信じるようになった。その思い込みは、それ以降強化され続けた。
そういうことだ。これが迷信の生まれるしくみなのだ。そしてほとんどの場合にそれは正しいということをご存じだろう。それがパターン構築ストラテジーがとても上手く機能する理由なのだ。ストーブに触れば指に火傷する。もう一度やれば、案の定、また火傷する。原因と結果。しかし正しい推論をしたというだけで、それが迷信じゃないとは言えないのだ!
それが「真実」なのかどうかは、科学が示すまで分らない。迷信を公認された事実へと昇格させることが、科学の基本的な活動なのだ。
皮肉なことに、鶏の話は都市伝説だ。鶏を訓練したのが「自分の」異常心理クラスの学生だと教授が言ったのは本当なのか私には分らない。あるいは彼女は別な教授のクラスだと言ったのに、私が彼女のクラスだったと記憶していただけかもしれない。詳細なことを掘り起こすことはできると思う(多くの労力をかければ。これは20年も前の話なのだ)。そしてそれが真実かどうか明らかにできるかもしれない。そうなるまでは、これは都市伝説なのだ。
それは別に真実でないということを意味しない。「都市伝説」というのは中身のことについて言及しているのではない。伝達プロトコルについて言及しているのだ。Snopes.comを信じるなら、真実である都市伝説はたくさんある。それを都市伝説にしているのは、それが人から人へと伝えられるときに、誰が、どこで、いつという元々の話の詳細が保たれていないためだ。だからそれが真実だったとしても、それについて耳にする方法がそれを迷信にしているのだ。それが(必要なら再現可能な実験によって)確認されるまでは、それだけのものでしかない。
だから迷信というのは必ずしも悪いものではないのだ!
私たちは自分の耳にする、たぶん正しいと思う事実の1つひとつを確認することはできない。そうしていたら私たちは決して進歩しないだろう(個人としても、文明としても)。私たちは自分の知っていることの多くを当然のこととして受け取る必要がある。どの時点においても、私たちの知っていることのほとんどは迷信だ。それは正常なことなのだ。
そしてもちろん迷信の多くは、他の人々からウィルスのような伝搬によって伝えられる。伝搬の仕方の1つは都市伝説だ。別なものとして、残念だが、マーケティングがある。アイデアはどうにかして私たちへの道を見つけ出し、そして私たちはというと、何であれもっともらしく見えるものは信じる傾向がある。
先週このエッセイに書くことを考えていて、Googleで「技術的迷信」について検索し、2003年にジェフ・ラスキンが書いたこの素敵なACMのアーティクルを見つけた。この中で、彼は迷信の心理学的な基礎について少し話していて、あるポピュラーで広く行き渡っている迷信をからかっている。それは高価なオーディオケーブルは安いものに比べて音がいい、というものだ。この論文は絶対読む価値がある。そして最後のところには小さな珠玉のような洞察があり、この著者のノストラダムス的予言の力に驚いて息をのむことだろう。
誰かが睾丸をなくすまでは愉快な話
迷信には害がない。いいよね ?
ある意味では。だいたいのところ。まあ普通は。前の節の要点は、(私たちみんなにとって)迷信は不可欠というだけでなく、脳の重要な機能でもあるということだ。私たちが信じていることのほとんどは迷信だが、お望みとあらば、どれでも信念を選んで調べ上げ、情報源でチェックし(たとえば、その情報源はWikipediaなのかNational Enquirerなのか ? どちらも時に正しく、時に間違っているのだが、信頼性のレベルは大きく異なっている)、あるいは自分で再現実験することもできる。
人々が自分の周りの出来事に影響を与えコントロールしたいと強く望むときに、迷信は最も強くなる。しかしそれがあまりに難しい場合、彼らは願望的思考の魔法へと向かうことになる。風水に、泉の中の硬貨に、流れ星に、アジャイル方法論。
別にそれについて悪いことは何もない。
迷信の基本的な文化的問題は、信頼できる出所と信頼できない出所の違いを見分けられないときに現れてくる。そうして非科学を科学のように扱うようになる。自分が迷信的であることを認識していなかったり認めなかったりする人は、自分の信念をあなたへと広めることに何の呵責も感じない。
実際、彼らがそれを上手くやることができたなら、もし誰もがそれを信じるようになったなら、それはもはや迷信ではなくなる。(これは哲学者が科学的に受容されている事実さえ単なる迷信ではないかと疑う理由だ。前世紀において量子力学がこの問いかけを復活させた。)
彼らが自分の信じていることをあなたにも信じさせたいと思うのはそのためだ。それによって自分は間違っているかもしれないという悩ましい疑いを減らすことができるのだ。それが迷信的なコミュニティが生まれ、団結し、そして孤立する理由だ—彼らはグループの中で自己強化しているのだ。
これが、この10年の間にアジャイルをゆっくりと間違った方向に進ませたものなのだ。これは込み入った問題だ。そしてそれはアジャイルがあなたにとって「機能する」かどうかとはまったく関係のない話だ。
問題は、それが広まり続けるなら、いつか多数派の意見となり、その時点でも信じていない人たちは、権威に対して上手く折り合えないために職を得られなくなっていくということだ。カウボーイがそうだ。なぜアジャイルの連中が彼らをカウボーイと呼ぶか今なら分るだろう。私たちにごろつきの非チームプレーヤーという烙印を押そうとしているのだ。ちょっと怖いよね?
彼らと技術的宗教的信仰を共有してないというだけのことで腕章を着けさせられたくはない。私はもう十分たくさん着けている。たとえばC++の教会は物理的にも道徳的にもマジョリティであり、あなたがそれを使わないなら、劣ったプログラマだと見なされる。慣れることだ。私たちは啓発されない時代を生きているのだ。
私に関して言えば、アジャイル方法論をあなたが使うのは全然結構なのだが、あなたがそれを同僚に押しつけようとするなら、それは人間関係上の侵害行為として扱われるべきで、それは風水を信じない人を差別するようなものだ。
マネージャが部下にアジャイルを押しつけるなら、それはより重大なこととして扱われるべきだ。叱責、従業員記録への記載、強制トレーニング、3ストライクでアウト。
火には火をもって戦う必要がある。それが私たちのキャリアの問題になる前に、彼らのキャリアの問題になることを望む。
私はそれについてよくジョークにしているし、今後もそうするつもりだ。しかしこれは本当に深刻な問題なのだ。
しかし先に進むことにして、これは終わりにし、もっと軽い話をしよう。私は子馬を見せると約束していたよね?
違う? そうだ、マジックだった。その通りだ。ため息。いいよ、じゃあ。何が出ようと、自分で望んだことなんだからね!
アナグラムと隠された意味
さて、あなたのために最後の迷信を用意した。アナグラムだ!
ワーオ、これは最もポピュラーな迷信の1つだ。単語やフレーズの文字を並べ替えて、何か隠された意味が見つからないか見てみるのだ。それだけのことだ!
あなたがよっぽど迷信的なのでなければ—それも古い種類の、妖精とか、数秘術とか、ステロイドなしのオリンピックみたいなクレージーなものを信じているくらいに迷信的なのでなければ—あなたはアナグラムには別に隠された意味なんかないことを知っているだろう。それは単なる意味のない偶然にすぎない。
正直に言って、十分熱心に探せば、狙った相手を表す言葉で、ほんとにひどいアナグラムを持つものを何か見つけ出すことはいつだって可能だ。これは単なる偶然なのだ(通常は不運な)。スピロ・アグニュー†はこのことを歴史上の他の誰よりもよく知っていると思う。
† Spiro Agnew : ニクソンのときの副大統領 。" Spiro Agnew " は" grow a penis " のアナグラムになっている 。
しかしそれでも・・・ときどきそれが本当に偶然とは信じがたいことがある。私が20代の中頃に、自分のフルネーム( Stephen Francis Yegge ) をアナグラムソルバーにかけて何が出てくるか見てみたことがある。あ痛っ!
そのころ私は体重と格闘しており、私の名前の意味のあるアナグラムはすべて太っていることに関わっているように見えた。最悪なのは" piggery , hence fatness " ( 豚のようにどん欲だから太るんだ)だった。うわっ。私は呪われているのか?
そんな風に感じられた。
一方、弟のデイブはげんなりしていた。 「 どうして僕のは全部病気についてのなんだろう?
これはだめだ ! 」 私は昨日のことのように覚えている。" David Francis Yegge " ( 私の両親のなんて独創的なこと ! ) から出てきたアナグラムは、" gas acid fever dying " ( ガスと酸と熱で死ぬ ) とか、" dying grief cave sad " ( 死にかけの嘆きの洞窟の悲しみ)なんかだった。デイブはもちろんそんなのはうれしくなかった。隠された意味なんかクソッタレだと宣言して、彼はそのプログラムで遊ぶのをやめてしまった。彼がその後の生涯であのプログラムを再び使うことはなかったと思う。
「 隠されたメッセージ」というのはそういう偶然のことなの?
ああ、そうだ。そういうものだ。理性的でまっとうな観点からすれば、単なる不運としか言えない。問題は、私たちの脳は、時々理性的になろうとしないということだ。
最後に1つ例をあげて終わりにすることにしよう。そしてこれは汚いトリックだ。私より節操のあるブロガーなら品位に関わるような。これだけ迷信について文句を言った後に、私は自分の悪巧みのために迷信を使おうとしているのだから。
もちろん仮定の話としてだが、あなたが何かの言葉の文字を、単なる好奇心から、並べ替えようとしていたとしよう。そう、たとえばAgile Manifestoなんかどうだろう。たわいのない実験で、それ以上の意味はない。(
「 ねぇ、害はないって!
私にはうまく行ったんだ! 私は1990年からずっと文字を並べ替えてるんだから!」 あほくさ。 )
まあ、おそらくは、意味のない退屈なアナグラムがたくさん出てきて、それなりに面白いのが1つか2つ見つかるかもしれない。
しかし本当に明確なメッセージを、ことに長い語を含むようなものを望むなら—隠されたメッセージであることが間違いないようなものを望むなら—おそらく失望することになるだろう。
じゃあやってみよう。害はないって。
" Agile Manifesto " の2語からなるアナグラムはいくつくらいあるのだろう?
どう思う ?
1つしかないのだ 。Egomania Itself ( それ自体が自己中心的 ) だ。
そういうこと。これを見たとき、これはちょうどあなた方のやってることだと思ったよ。:-)
きっとあなた方は確率とか統計とかランダム性の基本的な性質とかについて持ち出して、顔が青くなるまで「卑怯だ!
フェアじゃない! スポーツマンシップに反する!
ローブローだ!」と叫ぶのだろう。そしてあなたはたぶん正しい。
しかし最後には、ねぇ、あなたは認めなきゃいけない。これがすごく気味の悪い偶然だってことを・・・
( 幽霊屋敷のコウモリの音楽が流れる )
・・・あるいは本当にそうなのだろうか?
( ショーのエンディングの楽しげな音楽が流れる)
次回をお楽しみに !
アジャイルについては、取りあえずもう終わりにしようと思う。ニンニクを口に押し込んで、木の杭を心臓に打ち込んでやったら、そいつはメロドラマみたいな退散のジェスチャーをして、握り拳を振りまわし、次回きっと復讐してやると言っている!
これで私は自分の評判を悪くせずにすむ退屈な話題に戻ることができる。たとえばGoogleみたいな。

According to the NPD Group , a consumer and retail information company , for every legally downloaded video file , there are five illegally downloaded ones on P2P networks and BitTorrent sites .
The research carried out by the group shows that 8 percent of all U.S. households ( 6 million ) illegally downloaded at least 1 copyrighted video from a P2P network in the past 3 months , whereas only 2 percent of U.S. households purchased a video legally .
Legal video downloads took place largely on Apple ’s iTunes Store with 9 in 10 downloads occurring on that site , followed by Vongo ( 5 percent ) , Movielink ( 3 percent ) and less than 1 percent for CinemaNow .
It ’s hardly surprising that almost 60 percent of all illegally downloaded video files were “ adult - oriented ” .
TV shows were the second most popular at 20 percent , and only 5 percent were “ mainstream movie content ” .
With regards to legal video downloads , sixty - two percent were TV shows , 24 percent were music videos and 6 percent were movies .
Russ Crupnick , the vice president of the NDP Group wants the movie industry to take the issue of illegal video downloads seriously , even though only a fraction of the video downloads were feature films , and the percentage of legal movie downloads was higher than that of illegal ones .
“ Even though right now the majority of downloaded video content is adult - film content , the amount of intellectual property stolen from mainstream movie studios , networks , and record labels will continue to rise , unless strong and sustained action is taken to prevent piracy , ” he says .
Most of the businesses are not familiar with the term , social media marketing , but what they do not know is how it works to build a brand image for any business .
Still , social media has proved to be beneficial for several businesses that encourage new businesses to attempt their own social media marketing strategies .
It is the best option available today to connect with the audience directly and understand their needs and demands .
Social media marketing is not as easy as opening a Facebook or Instagram account .
There is a lot more to learn in this marketing type before one can start expective results from it .
It is not a game of chance , and every business requires a dedicated team to manage their social media channels .
Here are five effective ways in which social media marketing can benefit your business .
Understand that these methods will require daily dedication and a team that you can trust .
﻿
Understand your audience
The first aspect of social media marketing is to understand who your audience is and why are they suitable for your business .
Many new businesses forget to learn about their audience and start promoting their products without a clue of whom they are targeting .
Every social media platform has a different kind of audience , and with so many platforms to work on , the task can get daunting easily .
The key is to focus on a platform that suits your business .
Facebook is the best for small businesses , while Instagram is popular for individual marketeers .
Similarly , Twitter is used by big franchises to make major announcements .
Communication builds relationships
A business needs to communicate with its audience to understand their requirements .
Talking with the consumers directly also develops loyalty from their side as they feel special and important for the company .
Generating conversations and engaging the audience will help in building the goodwill for the company .
When they know their feedbacks will be recognized , they will be more inclined to try out the products and services .
Admit your mistakes
Social media is a great platform to let your audience know that you have made a mistake .
You can apologize for it and interact with the audience to convey to them what went wrong .
Admitting your mistake is always better than coming up with excuses and not acknowledging the customers .
It will prove your sincerity and can pull you back from deep trouble .
Always be active
You should make sure that you keep posting on your social media platforms whether or not you are doing something new .
Social media is a crowded place , and if you lose track of time , your account can become something that people have already forgotten .
Keep your audience engages with contests , Q&As , campaigns , etc. , so they never forget about your brand ( Especially when it is new ) .
Backing up Linux and other Unix ( - like ) systems
There are two kinds of people : those who do regular backups and those who never had a hard drive failure — Unknown .
1. Introduction
The topic of doing backups of a ( live ) Un*x ( mostly Linux ) system regularly comes up on Linux mailing lists and forums and invariably the advice to simply do tar cvfz backup.
tgz / bin / boot /etc ... is given .
Unfortunately , a good backup takes more effort than that .
In this article I will outline a great deal ( but not necessarily all ) of the pitfalls and details you will have to be watchful of when making backups .
Note that this is not an application how - to , so you should not use the given examples verbatim , nor does it give an exhaustive list of backup programs and examples .
It also does n't give step - by - step instructions .
It is meant to create awareness for people who already have a general understanding of Un*x systems .
Reading all of the documentation of the tool itself is and remains important , for it may make you think of things you would n't otherwise have considered .
Also note that this article mostly describes the process of making backups to an external device or location .
If data protection is important to you , I also highly recommend using RAID .
While RAID offers no protection against fires , earthquakes , data corruption or humans , it does offer protection against failing disks .
It has saved me more than once .
Additionally , I 'd advice you to consider using a UPS .
Although my personal experience is limited to Linux , the issues I 'll discuss should ( could ) work as well on all or most Un*x systems .
2 . A backup is more than data
A proper backup contains far more than just your data .
It also contains the data about your data : the meta data .
It will also contain all the specific file system attributes and special devices to make your operating system work .
It is vital that the target medium / software of your backup supports all these .
As an extreme example , you should n't backup an Ext3 file system ( standard file system on Linux machines ) on FAT32 / FAT16 ( ancient Microsoft file systems , still used on USB sticks and similair devices , even though devices like USB sticks can be formatted with any choice file system , of course ) .
This chapter discusses these meta data and special files .
2.1 . File meta data
On an Ext3 partition , the meta data of a file consists of : file modification time , inode modification time , last access time , user and group ID 's and permissions .
When you have extended attributes , this can be a whole lot more , most notably Access Control List information .
You need to backup as much of this as you can .
Obviously , when you do n't store and restore proper permissions , you can end up with a buggered installation .
This is even true for something simple as the mtime .
The Gentoo Linux distribution , for example , uses mtimes to determine if files belong to the installation of a certain package , or if they have been replaced with something new .
If you do n't restore proper mtimes , the package management will be completely shot .
It depends very much on the software used what you should do to include all this information .
You need to make sure that you 're backing it up and restoring it .
When using tar , this only goes right by default when you 're root ( although I have n't tested how it deals with extended attributes and ACL's ) .
Ownership information can be stored in two ways : numerically or textually .
A lot of backup programs find it user friendly to use textual matches , but for making backups of an entire system , this is very undesirable .
It 's very likely that you will restore the backup using some kind of live CD , while the original backup was made on the system you 're backing up itself .
On restoring the backup , files belonging to user bin will be given the ID on the file system based on the /etc / passwd file of the live CD .
If this ID is 2 for example , but ID 2 is user daemon on the system you are restoring , all the files that used to belong to bin , now belong to daemon .
Therefore , always store owner information numericly .
Tar has the - - numeric - owner option for that .
Rdiff - backup has the -- preserve - numerical - ids option , added to version 1.1.0 per my request .
Dar will never support textual matches .
I discussed the issue with the author , and he agreed with my reasoning .
Certain backup software have the ability to set back atimes after files are read when doing a backup ( dar and tar for example ) .
The purpose of this is to leave everything behind exactly as it was .
One should be very careful with this behavior , because setting back the atime , changes the ctime .
There is no way to change this , because ctimes can not be set artificially .
According to the dar man page , Leafnode NNTP caching software relies on the preserveration of atimes , but normally the necessity for setting back the atime is very rare .
I would like to add that in my opinion , any program which relies on preservation of atimes , is flawed .
Atimes can be changed very arbitrarily , even by users who have no write permissions on the file .
Also , automatic indexing software like Beagle can cause atimes to change .
Futhermore , a change in ctime can trip certain security software .
As I said , ctimes cannot be set artificially , meaning that if a file has a new ctime but an identical mtime , since it was last checked , it 's possibly replaced by a different file , usually one that is part of a rootkit .
Therefore , do n't preserve atimes unless you know what you are doing .
Dar preserves the atime per default .
This behavior has been changed in the CVS repository , and is likely to be released in version 2.4.0 .
Until the default has changed , use the -- alter=atime option .
2.2 . Special files
2.2.1 . Links
Links come in two forms : symbolic links and hard links .
A symbolic link is simply a reference to another path .
A hard link is an additional reference to an inode .
For preserving symbolic links , all you have to do , is make sure the backup application stores the link information , instead of the file it links to .
This is not always the default , so be careful .
Hard links require a bit more attention .
As I said , a hard link is basically a second ( or third , or fourth ... ) name for a file .
When you have a file A , link it to B , you have what appears to be two files .
If these two files are 1 GB big , it will only consume 1 GB of space , even though applications can claim they take up 2 GB .
Because the file B is not just a link to A , but a second name for it , you can safely delete A .
The file B will still exist after the deletion of A .
Most backup applications have support for hard links , but only when they are all in the same source tree .
This means , if you copy / bin , /etc , /usr ... with separate cp - a commands , hard link information is not detected and copied .
Because hard links cannot span accross file systems , suppling one backup and restore command per partition will work fine .
For example , if you have your / home on a separate partition , you could make a separate archive for / with / home excluded , and another archive of / home alone .
If you choose to make one archive with all mount points included , you may have to take special actions to make sure that upon restoration , the data is restored to the proper partitions .
If the program in question does n't complain about existing directories , creating the mount points in the new file system with identical names as before should do it .
Otherwise , restoring to one partition first and copying parts to another partition with cp - a later , will most likely work for you .
Do n't use mv to move the data .
You can imagine what will happen if the command fails half - way ...
Linux , and all Unix machines , use hard links extensively , so make 100 % sure you maintain link integrity .
Rsync for instance , needs the special flag -- hard - links , even when you 've also specified -- archive ( as the man page says , -- archive still lacks -- hard - links , --acls and -- xattrs ) .
2.2.2 . Sparse files
A sparse file is a file of which the zeros are n't stored on disk as zeros , but are not allocated .
Therefore , it 's possible that a 1 GB file with a lot of empty space takes up only 1 MB , for example .
A program which uses sparse files is Azureus , a Bittorrent download client .
Support for sparse files varies widely in backup software .
When you use a program which does n't support sparse files , the file is read in the regular way .
The data of the file remains the same , but it can take up a lot more space .
You therefore have to be careful , because it 's possible a backup wo n't fit on the disk anymore when you restore it , since the sparse files are created as normal ones .
For Bittorrent download files , it 's not really an issue that they 're restored as normal files , because they will be filled up with data as the download progresses anyway .
But , if you have a lot of sparse files which should remain sparse , selecting a backup program that supports sparse files is essential .
Note however , that when a file is determined as sparse , the copy is not sparse in the exact same way and places as the original , because this information can't be retrieved .
Instead , it 's created as a new sparse file , where non allocated space is used as the backup tools sees fit .
This should n't be a problem however ; I can't think of a situation where this matters .
2.2.3 . Others
There are some other special files , like FIFO 's , named pipes , block devices , etc .
These are pretty unremarkable , and most applications know how to deal with them .
However , you do have to supply the correct option (s ) .
Using cp without - a on a named pipe for example , will try to copy the data of the pipe , and not recreate the pipe .
There is also a special kind of directory : lost + found ( part of Ext2/ 3/4 ) .
This is actually not a directory at all , and should not be made with mkdir .
Instead , use mklost + found .
In case you were wondering , lost + found is used to store files " recovered " with e2fsck when the file system is damaged .
3 . What to exclude
To save space on your backup medium , you can choose not to back up certain locations .
For my Gentoo Linux system , these include /usr / portage / and / var / tmp / portage .
There are also special file systems mounted within the root file system , which are created dynamically upon boot , and should n't be backed up .
For my system , these are /sys , / proc , / lost + found , / media ( which contains only dynamically created directories for removable media ) and / dev ( because I use udev ) .
I also exclude / mnt , but the need to backup / mnt can vary from system to system .
4. Application data
When making a backup of a live system , you have to be mindful of programs which can change their data files during the backup .
A good example is a database , such as MySQL or PostreSQL , but also the data of e-mail programs ( mbox files are more sensitive than maildir ) .
The data files ( stored somewhere in / var usually ) can undergo change on a live system .
This can be because of normal transactions , or automatic database clean - up .
Never trust these data files of a running database , LDAP server , Subversion repository , or whatever similar software you may use .
If shutting down such software before the backup is not an option , schedule jobs which periodicly dump the data of the database ( using pg_dump for Postgresql , slapcat for OpenLDAP , svnadmin dump or svn-backup - dumps for Subversion , etc ) into ( date stamped ) files .
These files are then backed up and you should be safe .
Use the software 's native dump utility whenever possible , as pg_dump and slapcat are for Postgresql and OpenLDAP respectively .
Doing this ( scheduled dumps ) is always a good idea , regardless of the situation .
Should the data suddenly get corrupted , you still have dumps of past situations , so not everything is lost .
And , when you dump them somewhere in the local file system , you do n't have the hassle of searching through your backups when the need arrises to restore the database ( or other application data ) .
5. General warnings
This chapter contains some general warnings and guidelines you should keep in mind .
5.1 . Incremental backup and mtimes
Some backup utilities support incremental backups , so that they only backup the data that has changed since the last backup .
Rdiff - backup is a very good example , as it supports nothing else .
My advice is to be careful with incremental backups and investigate how they detect change .
The best way is if they support hash checking , but this can be slow .
Second best , and very reliable and fast , is ctime checking .
The file system has to support ctimes though , but most do .
Only the ones which you should n't be using , do n't ( like FAT32 ) .
Some utilities only use the mtime , or the mtime + size combination , to detect changes in files .
This is somewhat unreliable .
For example , disk images attached to loop devices with losetup do not change their mtime when you mount the loop device and write to it .
A real - world example I encountered was this : I had just read a disk image with ddrescue , which needed heavy file system correction .
I decided to run my daily backup routine first .
It ocurred to me to check if the mtime of the image file actually changed when writing to the mounted loop device , because I suspected the file was not accessed through regular file - open routines .
And indeed , I was right .
To make sure the file is backed up whenever I changed it , I needed to touch it first .
This could also be an issue with virtual machine disk images .
I always use logical volumes as storage backends , so I can't check ( easily ) , but you may want to check if the mtime of your virtual machine images actually changes when it 's written to .
Or , setup a backup routine in the virtual machine itself , of course ( which is what I would do ) .
Another ( small ) real world example is editing ID3 - tags with Easytag .
Easytag has an option to preserve the mtime of a file when changing the tag .
Should the size of the altered tag be the same , when changing one charachter for example , the mtime and size will be identical , and the change will not be detected .
Rsync has an option to actually check if the file is different .
The problem with this , however , is that it 's very slow .
For example , scanning my / home for changed files takes longer than doing a complete backup with dar without compression .
See the detailed rsync info below for more information .
You can of course decide that the risk of this failure in change detection is not a problem for you ( since the chance is small ) , and benefit from the speed increase .
Personally , I just do n't really like it if I can formulate a scenario where it is known that the program fails to do what it should , but still accept it and use rdiff - backup on several locations .
5.2 . Backing up into a file system
it may not be the smartest choice to simply copy your data to another file system .
Using cp - a may do a pretty good job of preserving everything you need ( but only when copying into a file system which supports everything the source file systems supports , and in case of cp , when not using extended attributes ) , but my concerns are of a different nature .
It 's all too easy to accidentally make a change to a file , or it 's meta data , by opening and saving it .
It is more robust to have the data in archive files , like tar or dar does .
Because rsync also simply stores its meta data in the file system , this warning also applies to rsync .
With the information provided in this article , you should be able to decide for yourself if this is an issue or not .
It also has definite advantages , such as rapidly being able to find and copy one single file out of the backup .
5.3 . Archive size
A lot of file systems ( or network protocols ) have a very limited maximum file size .
When making backups with software that creates archives , the size of these archives has to be considered .
A maximum of 2 GB ( or a little less , to be on the safe side ) is usually a good idea .
Files this big can stored on ISO DVD's and FAT32 file systems .
My preferred choice would be 650 MB , so that they can be burned on ( 74 minutes ) CD's .
Even if you 're not planning to store the backup on such a file system , it 's still a good idea split the archive files , so that you still can burn them on CD or DVD when you have to .
5.4 . Restoring
Just as important as making the backup , is restoring the backup .
Just as you would read the man page to figure out the correct options for backing up , you would for restoring .
In my opinion , a good backup program has either well chosen defaults , or stores the options made during backup in the archive or meta data files , to be used upon restoration again .
Dar is good in this respect , as you should not need to specify any special options when restoring .
When using tar you have to be somewhat more careful .
6. Software recommendations , disrecommendations and examples
This chapter describes some details and examples of a number or programs .
Please note that there are far more backup programs in existence than the ones I mention here .
The reason I mention these , is because these are the ones I have a lot experience with , and it shows how to apply or consider the concepts described above , in practice .
Sometimes as specifically refer to the GNU version of an application , the standard version on Linux installations , which can be fundamentally different than the classic version , so keep that in mind .
6.1 . Dar
First a word of caution .
It 's highly recommended that you use version 2.3.3 ( most recent stable release at the time of writing ) or newer because it contains a major bugfix .
Read the announcement on Dar 's news list for more info .
Dar is very well thought through and has solutions for classic pitfalls .
For example , it comes with a statically compiled binary which you can copy on ( the first disk of ) your backup .
It supports automatic archive slicing , and has an option to set the size of the first slice separately , so you have some space on the first disk left for making a boot CD , for example .
It also lets you run a command between each slice , so you can burn it on CD , or calculate parity information on it , etc .
And , very importantly , its default options are well chosen .
Well , that is , except for the preservation of atimes ( see atime - preserveration above ) .
I use the following command to backup my system on an external USB drive about once a week , using dar 2.2.6 ( most site specific options removed , and abstracted a bit ) :
dar -- execute " par2 c - r5 \ " %p/%b.%n.par2\ " \ " %p/%b.%n. %e\ " " -- alter=atime -- empty - dir \ -- fs-root / -- noconf -- create ARCHIVE_NAME
-- slice 620M -- first - slice 600M - z6 \ - an - Z " *.ogg " - Z " *.avi " - Z " *. mp ? " - Z " *.pk3 " - Z " *. flac " - Z " *.zip " - Z " *.tgz " \ - Z " *. gz " - Z " *.gzip " - Z " *.bz2 " - Z " *.bzip2 " - Z " *.mov " - Z " *.rar " - Z " *. jar " \ -- prune lost + found -- prune usr / portage / -- prune var / tmp / portage -- prune media \ -- prune proc -- prune mnt -- prune sys
With the -- execute statement , I calculate parity information with par2 .
The mystery - strings passed to par2 translate into the par2 file (s ) to be generated , and the archive slice name .
-- alter=atime
Is mentioned above .
The -- empty - dir option stores every excluded dir as an empty dir in the archive .
The -an and subsequent - Z options specifies what to exclude for compression , with case insensitive masks .
The compression level is specified with - z6 .
-- prune
Is used to exclude paths .
The rest should be clear .
I also used to run a daily backup with dar on / home , without compression .
This was about 6 GB and takes about 10 minutes .
Very feasible I would say .
However , when my home dir grew in size , I switched over to Rsync and later to rdiff - backup , and accepted the change detection flaw .
Restoring a dar archive should be safe with the defaults ( a very important aspect in my opinion ) , but read the man page to be sure .
6.2 . GNU Tar
GNU
Tar supports everything needed to make a reliable backup ( although I must say I do n't know how well , if at all , it supports extended attributes ) .
One has to be careful though , to supply the - - numeric - owner option .
This could also include -- same - owner , but a quick test and glance at the manual shows the -- preserve - permissions option ( which is enabled by default for user root ) implies this .
Should you have forgotten the - - numeric - owner option for the backup command , this can also be given at restore time .
Giving it at backup time , should negate the necessity of giving it at restore time because tar wo n't store the textual names in the archive when you give this option .
Tar also has no decent splitting ability .
I 've seen people recommending to use split , but that is not very convenient .
With split , you first have to create the archive somewhere where it fits , and then split them up to be stored somewhere else .
At restore time , this is even more annoying , because you first have to concatenate the segments with cat before you can extract them .
An additional problem with Tar was reported to me by a reader .
With version 1.15.1 he got corrupted sparse files which were bigger than 4 GB .
Current releases ( 1.20 + ) of Tar do n't seem to have this problem anymore , but you might want to check for yourself .
I recommend not using tar unless you can live with the limitations are and careful to supply the correct options .
6.3 . Rdiff - backup
You have to consider its method of change detection to determine if rdiff - backup will be reliable enough for you .
If you deal with disk images a lot , read the example above .
I once discussed alternative change detection methods with the author , but because of lack of time on his part , the discussion was never really concluded .
It can very well be that in the future it will include a reliable change detection system , like hashes or ctimes .
Note that rdiff - backup does store the hash in its meta data since version 1.1.1 ( 2005/11/05 ) , but it still does n't use it for detecting changes in files ( at time of version 1.2.1 , 2008/08/24 ) .
Also , when restoring a full system backup from a different OS installation , like a LiveCD , with rdiff - backup , be sure to use the -- preserve - numerical - ids option , otherwise you will end up with files with wrong owners .
This is very easy to forget ( I 've done it myself ) .
In the mean time , if you are confident enough you wo n't suffer from the mtime problem described above , in your / home for example , it can safely be used .
You may also find my concerns exaggerated and use it for your entire file system after all .
I decided these concerns were n't big enough to stop me from using it .
Rdiff - backup is a very reliable and one of the best incremental backup programs , in my opinion .
6.4 . Rsync
My main problem with rsync is that it stores its meta data as new meta data in the target file system .
Not only does this restrict the use of target file system , but it is also somewhat flaky , as described above .
Also , rsync is one of the tools which uses the mtime + size for detecting changes in files .
And because its options for reliable checks for file changes ( with -- ignore - times or especially -- checksum ) are too slow , it can make dar without compression a better choice .
That is , only when backing up locally on a fast medium , of course .
An important thing to note here , is that because rsync does n't store meta data files , it compares the mtime + size with the target .
This means that only when you use the -- times option , to preserve the mtime of the files , does this change detection fail in the scenario described above .
Rsync has a special switch , -- archive , specifically meant for preserving all meta data .
Using this flag is not enough , however .
For instance , it does n't store hard link information by default , because that would be too slow .
Also , it does n't store hard links , extended attributes and access control lists .
So , you need to supply -- hard - links as well , and -- acls and -- xattrs should you use them ( rsync supports extended attributes since version 3 , I think ) .
The options -- sparse and -- numeric - ids are also recommended , as outlined above .
Additionally , I would supply -- delete -- delete - excluded -- delete - after as well , to not get stale files in my backup .
The -- delete - after is necessary because otherwise , should the backup fail half - way , files that have been renamed since the last backup ( meaning , old file is deleted , new file is created ) , are deleted before the new one is transferred .
It 's best to first transfer the new file , then delete the old one .
It is also important to construct a proper restore command .
Because the destination should be an exact mirror of the source , using the same options as you use for making the backup , is probably enough .
Some time ago , Rsync 3 was released .
It contains interesting new features , such as support for access control lists and extended attributes .
It may have the issue with the change detection , but especially since version 3 , you might want to consider using it ( perhaps only for a part of your backup plan ) , because it 's still very efficient and thorough .
6.5 . GNU cp
I always thought that cp - a would preserve everthing you need , but it appears it does n't copy access control list information , and probably extended attributes in general .
I do n't use access control lists , so I can't do any tests with them , so you want to test this yourself .
6.6 . Clonezilla
Clonezilla is an elaborate live - CD for making images of several types of file systems , including NTFS .
Besides some interface quirks , it 's a beautifully engineered piece of software .
It does all the extra things one expects , like using dd to backup the MBR and the space between the MBR and the first partition .
It even calls sync when it 's done .
It 's almost as if they read this article :) .
And , perhaps the most important : it allows you to remove the CD when halting or rebooting !
6.7 . Partition cloners in general
Partition cloners , like g4u , partimage , clonezilla ( or dd ... ) can be very convenient , but they ( mostly ) have one major annoyance : they ( often ) require that the backup is restored on an identical disk and / or partition layout .
If your disk explodes and you need to get a new one , this can be difficult .
However , this is not always the case .
I recently just dd'ed an entire disk over to another one ( that was 1 GB bigger ) , with dd if= / dev/sda of= / dev/sdb .
The new one now has unpartitioned space , but it still works fine .
The Windows XP installation that it contained , still boots on the new drive , even though Windows ( XP ) is very picky about that .
In any case , restoring to a smaller partition can be a problem .
Sometimes you can improvise , but this is something best avoided .
If you are going to use this method of backing up , it 's a good idea to make sure replacement disks are always big enough .
You can do this by assuming disks will always get bigger in the future or by keeping your partitions small ( but not too small as not to inhibit fragmentation prevention ) .
The less intelligent cloners , like g4u or dd , take an enormous amount of time , because they copy every file system block , including the ones that are not used .
And , when these unused blocks are not zeroed out first , the resulting image is very large .
Another aspect most people will find annoying , is that you have to take your machine down to make the image .
To my knowledge , there are no partition imagers which can do this on a live system .
In any case , you certainly should n't use dd on a live partition ...
7. Automation
When automating backups , there is one important thing you have to keep in mind : sync the disk buffers as often as possible , and preferably wait a second or two after the sync , for the drive to write its own cache to the disk itself .
Some disks lie about having written their cache to disk , so it 's not always safe to assume that all the volatile cache data has been written after the sync command returns , hence the wait .
To illustrate why this is important , consider a tar backup routine which first makes the backup and then removes the old one .
If the cache is n't synced and the power fails during removing of the old backup , you may end up with both the new and the old backup corrupted .
It has been suggested to me that this is pointless , because cache data is serialized , so any delete after the initial backup command first writes the volatile cache .
This is not the case , especially if you have a disk with NCQ / TCQ , which all modern disks have .
The whole point of the write cache is to be able to write out of order .
sync ; sleep 2 mount target [ BACKUP - COMMAND ] sync ; sleep 2 [ CLEAN - COMMAND ] sync ; sleep 2 umount
My suggestion is , to run the backup like this :
The sync at the end is also important , so that when the unmount fails , the data is still safe when the drive is unplugged or whatever .
8 . File system snapshotting
With tools like LVM and Btrfs you have the ability to take snapshots of the file system .
This allows for some extra flexibility when making backups .
For instance , you can put your root file system on logical volumes ( especially easy , and recommended , for virtual machines ) , giving you the ability to make a snapshot before dangerous operations , allowing for easy reverting in case something goes wrong .
Snapshots are also convenient for making consistent full file system backups ; you make the snapshot , use partclone or similar tools , and delete it again .
Remember that snapshots are usually copy - on - write .
That means that when you ( over ) write something on the source , the state as it was is copied to the snapshot .
This means that having snapshots around decreases performance .
9 . Choice of file system
Although it is somewhat out of the scope of this article , I would like to say a few words about the choice of file system .
People often choose Reiser FS over Ext3 , because it 's new or just different .
The default file system on most Linux systems is Ext3 .
My recommendation is to stay with that , unless you have a specific reason to use something else .
Reiser FS , for example , does logical journaling .
According to this , this can be dangerous in the event of a power failure .
Also , Hans Reiser himself has said ( or so it 's stated ) that Reiser FS is optimized for speed , not correctness .
Even the new Ext4 file system has potential problems , because of delayed allocation .
Ext3 has it as an option ( data=writeback ) , but for Ext4 , it 's the default .
Delayed allocation means , in the case of Ext4 , that the data is written to disk in the order of once a minute , whereas the meta data is written much more often , in the order of every few seconds .
Linus Torvalds says : " It literally does everything the wrong way around -- writing data later than the metadata that points to it .
Whoever came up with that solution was a moron .
No ifs , buts , or maybes about it .
At least with ext3 it's not the default mode . "
Anyway , my point is to investigate any file system you may want to use .
And , Ext3 may be ordinary , but it is not that bad .

Like a monkey that has been bitten by a scorpion , the doltish can always be counted upon to entertain the dull - witted with irrelevant chatter following a major crisis .
So it is with the catastrophe in New Orleans , as partisan political interests oppose one another on such questions as were Republicans or Democrats more to blame ; whether federal , state , or municipal governments were most at fault ; or did race or economic factors make for disparate treatment ?
As Thomas Pynchon so aptly expressed it : u201 Cif they can get you asking the wrong questions , they do n’t have to worry about answers .
u201D
One of the most important questions — going to the perverse nature of our institutionalized world — occurred in the recent flooding in New Orleans .
It grossly understates the significance of this tragedy to focus attention only upon the utter failure of state and federal government agencies to respond .
Standing alone , the sheer incompetence of government agencies and officials in the days following the flooding resembled the comic - opera buffoonery of a Marx Brothers film .
That Jon Stewart ’s insightful u201CThe Daily Showu201D was the only newscast capable of putting such behavior in perspective , tells us much about the fallen state of our culture .
The speed and scope of private responses to this devastation contrasted with those of the political establishment , reflecting not simply the greater efficiency of spontaneously ordered systems , but fundamental differences in purpose .
Millions of individuals from all over the world began sending food , clothing , blankets , fuel , money , water , medical supplies , and other life - and - death necessities to flooding victims .
Homeowners from across the country went online to pledge over 150,000 beds to help house those whose homes had been destroyed .
In the San Fernando Valley , one woman e-mailed to people that she would be collecting such items at a given location for trucking to the victims .
Her e-mails were , in turn , forwarded to others and , in three days time , six truckloads of relief supplies were collected .
Such experiences have been repeated manifold , with individuals , businesses , churches , and private charities voluntarily coming to the rescue of total strangers .
The disaster in the Gulf Coast is an object lesson in how compassionate and cooperative we can be toward one another when our thinking has not been infected by politically - contrived and manipulated conflicts .
The responses of the state stand in stark contrast to those of individuals .
From the moment government officials awoke to the enormity of the disaster — a number of days after private persons had already begun their shipments of aid — their principal purpose has been not to aid , comfort , and rescue the victims , but to establish their authority and control over them .
Political systems have always served as strange attractors to the control freaks and other misfits who have never become socially housebroken .
People express surprise that government did n’t come to the aid of stricken people sooner .
But aiding people is not what government is about ; that is the function of the marketplace and other voluntary activity .
The state is about menacing , threatening , commandeering , and killing .
You will not see mayors , senators , governors , or even presidents , wading through waist - deep waters to rescue a trapped family : their functions are confined to holding press conferences and muttering platitudes .
Control is what the state has always been about .
If you doubt this , consider the words of Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco , who declared that National Guard u201 Ctroops are fresh back from Iraq , well trained , experienced , battle tested and under my orders to restore order in the streets .

Or consider the words of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff expressing what , by now , has become the underlying motto of his police - state agency : u201CWe are in control of what ’s going on in the city .

Add to this the words of one National Guard general who decreed : u201CWe ’re going to go out and take this city back .
This will be a combat operation to get this city under control .
u201D
From whom will the city be u201 Ctaken back , u201D and to what ends ?
Those who have learned their political catechisms from the television priesthood will speak of u201 Clooters , u201D without distinguishing those stealing food and water from stores in order to survive , and without asking whether this will include a crackdown on the police officers and firemen who reportedly joined in the stealing of television sets , computers , and other valuables .
Perhaps getting u201 Cthis city under controlu201D includes continuing to interfere with such voluntary efforts as Red Cross deliveries of food , Wal - Mart ’s shipment of water , and physicians offering to come to New Orleans to help the sick and injured .
This purpose may also explain why FEMA cut emergency communications lines from New Orleans , an action reversed by the local sheriff who then placed guards around the facility .
And where , in any of the draconian rhetoric being barked by these martinets , is even an oblique reference made to ending the suffering that has now run for two weeks ?
While men and women were graciously opening their homes to flood victims , state officials were locking people inside crowded , smelly convention centers and domed stadiums .
While individuals were fighting the bureaucratic red tape that prevented the flow of assistance , National Guard troops were employing automatic weapons to menace dispirited flood victims .
Navy helicopter pilots who deviated from their assigned roles and rescued more than 100 victims , were reprimanded for having done so and , in the process , had the state ’s priorities reinforced upon them .
A police chief ordered his officers to block a bridge to prevent people from leaving the city , with some policemen firing warning shots over the heads of tourists trying to get out .
Meanwhile , residents who wanted to stay in their homes were being forcibly removed — handcuffed and at gunpoint — while homeowners were having their guns confiscated in what some might suppose was a practice run for a subsequent disarming of Americans .
All of this was , of course , defended in that most Rousseauian notion : u201CWe ’re trying to save them from themselves .
u201D
u201CLock and load , u201D and u201 Csixteen in the clip , u201D were oft - heard phrases coming from National Guard soldiers , one of whom put everything in perspective : u201CIt ’s like Baghdad all over again .

At no time in my life has this obligation been called to accountability more than now , as our institutionalized thinking continues to play out , in exponential fashion , its implicit absurdities .
The qualities that either foster or destroy a civilization are ultimately to be found only within the character and thinking of the individuals who comprise it .
Our world is only as peaceful , free , loving , and creative as you and I make it ; and can become violent , tyrannical , inhumane , and destructive only as our individual thinking produces such ends .
I have written of the common origins of the words u201 Cpeace , u201D u201 Cfreedom , u201D u201 Clove , u201D and u201 Cfriend.u201D
Most of us have long since forgotten what our ancestors must have implicitly understood , namely , that the intertwining of the qualities inherent in the meaning of these words is what produces a decent society .
To institutionalized minds , the idea that a free and peaceful world is dependent upon people living as friends , with genuine love for one another , is pass .
In our politically - structured world , u201 Cconfrontation , u201D u201 Ccontrol , u201D u201 Cambition , u201D and u201 Callyu201D have corrupted such earlier sentiments .
These changes in thinking have been necessary to sustain the conflict - ridden world of institutional domination .
A healthy society held together by trust and mutual respect deteriorates , in a politicized world , into one dominated by fear and incivility .
A complex system may experience turbulence and , later , reach a bifurcation point to which either a creative response will be made , or the system will collapse into total entropy .
Modern society appears to be at such a point .
The question before us is how we are to respond : by mobilizing our intelligence to generate systems that are supportive of life , or to allow the nature of our present practices to play out the destructive consequences of their premises ?
Events in New Orleans have brought into focus the long - standing question that we have heretofore preferred not to face : is society to be organized by and for the benefit of individuals or of institutions ?
Does life belong to the living , or to the organizational machinery that the living so unwisely created ?
We are confronted — as was Dr. Frankenstein — by a monster of our own creation , which must control and dominate us if it is to survive .
We continue to feed this destructive creature , not simply with our material wealth , but with our very souls and the lives of our children .
Perhaps we direct so much righteous anger at child - molesters because we are afraid to face our failure to fulfill parental obligations to our own children .
In the outpouring of individual compassion and cooperation following the disaster in New Orleans , the state discovered a threat to its existence .
Political systems thrive only through division and conflict ; by getting people to organize themselves into mutually - exclusive groups which then fight with one another .
This is why u201 Cwar is the health of the state .
u201D
But if people can discover a sense of love and mutuality amongst them , how is the state to maintain the sense of continuing conflict upon which it depends ?
This is why the state must prevent the private shipment of truckload after truckload of private aid to victims ; this is why flood victims — including those who want nothing more than to remain in their homes — must be turned into a criminal class , against whom state functionaries will u201 Clock and loadu201D their weapons and u201 Cshoot and kill . . . if necessary .u201D
The state is fighting for its life , and must exaggerate its inhumane , life - destroying capacities in order to terrify the rest of us into structured obedience .
This is the meaning of Pogo Possum ’s classic observation : u201 Cwe have met the enemy and they is us .
u201D
This is why , as New Orleans continued to be under the u201 Ccontrolu201D of federal agencies , the Pentagon proposed the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against u201Cterrorist groupsu201D using u201 Cweapons of mass destruction .
u201D
What could u201Cterrorizeu201D the state more than to have people realize that social order lies only within the hands of free men and women ?
What u201 Cweaponu201D could be more destructive to the state than a u201 Cmassu201D outbreak of love and compassion ?
In the waning days of Western civilization , you and I are in a struggle between the individualized sense of humanity and the collective forces of structured order .
The nature of this struggle has been no better expressed than by Gandhi : u201CThe individual has a soul , but the State is a soulless machine , it can never be weaned from the violence to which it owes its very existence .
u201D
It is this contest between the human spirit and the machine that will determine the fate of mankind — including our children — in our post - civilized world .

America devours oil like no other country in the world .
Representing 5 percent of the global population , the country consumes fully a quarter of the world ’s oil .
Every year , to move ourselves and our goods around , we burn 140 billion gallons of gasoline and 40 billion gallons of diesel — enough to propel the average U.S. car around the world 1.6 billion times .
But rising prices , climate change , and seemingly endless crises in the Middle East have sparked a reckoning .

While there is plenty of disagreement about how best to end what President Bush has called our “ addiction to oil , ” a rough consensus has formed in support of biofuel as an alternative to crude oil .
But biofuel — energy gained from plant or animal matter — is a broad category .
The term lumps together a number of energy sources that are , in fact , quite different , from turkey innards to corn stalks .
( Mmm , sounds like Thanksgiving dinner . )
So far , three fuels have emerged to lead the U.S. biofuels pack , whether in practice or in our collective imagination : corn ethanol , cellulosic ethanol , and biodiesel .
They are hailed as carbon - neutral solutions for an emissions - happy era .
And in one sense , all biofuels can indeed be thought of as CO2 neutral , since any carbon released at the tailpipe was recently captured by the plants for photosynthesis .
But plant - derived fuel does n’t emerge from a vacuum .
Crops must be cultivated , harvested , moved , and transformed — processes that are hardly carbon neutral .
And here is where the vast discrepancies cloaked by the term “ biofuels ” emerge .
Conventional Ethanol
People have been making conventional ethanol for about as long as they ’ve been getting drunk .
Creating it involves leaching simple sugars from plant matter and fermenting them into alcohol , just like the process for making “ corn liquor , ” or moonshine .
It ’s affordable and effective — Henry Ford even reckoned that ethanol would power his Model T cars .
( Presumably he was sober at the time . )
Photo : eere.energy.gov
Since conventional ethanol relies on simple sugars , it works best when derived from crops that concentrate starches in their seeds .
That ’s why corn makes a better feedstock than wheat , and sugarcane makes a better feedstock than corn .
But the same quality also limits conventional ethanol ’s efficiency when it comes to mass production : since it can use only a relatively small portion of each plant , a lot of biomass goes unused in the process .
In the United States , corn , the nation ’s most prolific crop , is by far its dominant ethanol feedstock : some 95 percent of all ethanol produced in the U.S. comes from the starchy yellow kernels .
Corn - based ethanol remains the only biofuel produced in serious quantity in the U.S. , though biodiesel is making a push ( see below ) .
Yet even after brisk recent growth , ethanol producers will churn out the equivalent of just 3 percent of U.S. gasoline consumption in 2006 .
Still , production trends point steeply upward .
Output was 3.9 billion gallons in 2005 , and increased to a projected 4.8 billion gallons for 2006 — the largest jump in production since 1980 , the year industry began tracking such data .
Production is expected to swell to 7.5 billion gallons in the next few years , and the number of ethanol plants under construction in the U.S. has gone from 16 in 2005 to 33 today .
Rising oil and gasoline prices have clearly spiked recent interest in ethanol , but its boom in popularity has other sources too .
The Energy Policy Act passed by Congress in 2005 includes a Renewable Fuel Standard stipulating that gasoline sold in the U.S. must include a certain amount of renewable fuel .
This year , 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels must be used in gasoline , rising to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012 .
Gasoline refiners have also begun turning en masse to ethanol as an alternative to the octane booster MTBE , which many states have recently banned .
Among environmentalists , however , the growing consensus is that corn - based ethanol is more fool ’s gold than eco-treasure .
Conventional agriculture relies on fertilizer and pesticides derived from fossil fuels .
Diesel powers the tractors and other machinery that plow , plant , and spray crops , as well as the vehicles that haul away the final product ( due to ethanol ’s tendency to absorb water , it must be transported in special containers on trucks or trains instead of in the cheaper pipeline system used for oil and gasoline ) .
Figure in the fuel — mainly coal and natural gas — burned in the distillation process , and experts reckon each gallon of ethanol takes the energetic equivalent of roughly three - quarters of a gallon of ethanol to produce .
Then there are greenhouse - gas emissions .
After accounting for the coal and natural gas burned to process it , the nitrous oxide — a greenhouse gas hundreds of times more potent than CO2 — generated from fertilizer production , and other factors , a recent study in Science found that ethanol use reduces greenhouse - gas emissions by just 13 percent compared to gasoline use .
Despite its clearly limited environmental benefits , domestic ethanol draws plenty of help from Washington .
Since 1978 , the fuel has qualified its producers for a federal tax credit , which now stands at 51 cents to the gallon .
Ethanol producers also benefit from a 54 cent - per - gallon tariff on sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil — a country where production is not only cheaper but more efficient , given sugarcane ’s superiority as a feedstock .
And now U.S. automakers , also with a boost from Washington , are jumping on the ethanol bandwagon .
Advertising campaigns like GM ’s “ Live Green , Go Yellow ” are plugging flex - fuel vehicles capable of running on gasoline or a mixture of gasoline and ethanol .
E85 — a mix of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline — can now be pumped at some 650 service stations nationwide , a threefold increase since 2004 .
And at the same time , the federal government ’s “ dual - fuel loophole ” provides automakers a 1.5 mile - per - gallon credit toward meeting fuel - economy standards — without requiring that flex - fuel vehicles actually run on alternative fuel .
The government estimates that flex - fuel vehicles run on ethanol blends less than 1 percent of the time , hardly surprising since the E85 infrastructure has a long way to go before it catches up to gasoline .
As a result , even while 2005 saw more flex - fuel vehicles on the roads than ever before , Americans consumed 80,000 more barrels of oil than in the previous year .
Meanwhile , legislative plans are on tap to either increase the credit for selling flex - fuel vehicles or extend it beyond 2014 , effectively removing any incentive for carmakers to move toward lighter , more efficient vehicles .
Ethanol ’s proponents argue that a homegrown fuel could be good for the American farmer .
Alas , these tax credits and import tariffs accrue not in the bib pockets of corn farmers , but in the well - lined coffers of companies that blend ethanol with gasoline .
Archer Daniels Midland , the largest of the processing firms , controls an estimated 40 percent of the ethanol market , while the top 10 producers together control an estimated 70 percent .
To date , farmers own less than half of all ethanol plants on line , according to statistics compiled by the Renewable Fuels Association .
So this homegrown dream may be something of an industrial nightmare .
Cellulosic Ethanol
If criticism of corn ethanol grows even as production booms , the opposite problem haunts cellulosic ethanol .
Nearly everyone loves the idea of it , yet no one ’s making it on a commercial scale .
Photo : usda.gov
Cellulosic ethanol , a fuel chemically identical to the conventional kind but instead derived from “ biomass , ” a term encompassing everything from waste materials like corn stover and paper pulp to fast - growing plants like switchgrass , willow , and poplar .
Roughly two - thirds of this cellulosic matter is complex carbohydrate , which can be broken down into fermentable sugars , and from there , into ethanol .
Lignin makes up the remaining dry weight and carries an energy content similar to that of coal .
Most models of cellulosic ethanol production , in fact , use lignin combustion to power the process , thereby closing the energy loop .
As end products , cellulosic and conventional ethanol are indistinguishable ; gallon - for - gallon , both yield roughly two - thirds the energy of gasoline .
But take into account the resources it takes to churn out a gallon of corn ethanol versus a gallon of ethanol from cellulose , and their energy profiles could hardly be more different .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , corn - based ethanol provides 26 percent more energy than is required for its production , while cellulosic provides 80 percent more energy .
And while conventional ethanol reduces greenhouse - gas emissions 10 to 20 percent below gasoline levels , the reductions with cellulosic range from 80 percent below gasoline to completely CO2 neutral .
Switchgrass — a word first heard by many in the notorious “ addiction to oil ” speech — holds the key to large - scale and ecologically sound ethanol production , many think .
A perennial prairie grass native to North America , switchgrass requires little water or fertilizer to grow and thrives in places unsuitable for most crops , ranging from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada and from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
Some five to nine feet tall , this gangly weed also yields twice as much ethanol per acre as does corn .
But do we have enough land to support a cellulosic - ethanol industry without also competing with food or destroying the environment ?
The answer is … maybe .
According to a recent study from the University of Tennessee , as many as 100 million acres of cropland and pasture will need to be devoted to switchgrass to produce enough ethanol to offset 25 percent of petroleum use .
Currently , U.S. farmers have about 80 million acres in corn , 15 - 20 percent of which goes into ethanol production .
Since land scarcity will clearly be an issue , some analysts argue that any biofuel strategy will need to be accompanied by a strong dose of conservation .
According to “ Growing Energy , ” a 2004 Natural Resources Defense Council report on biofuels , the U.S. is on track to consume 290 billion gallons of gasoline for transportation in 2050 .
By boosting fuel efficiencies and reigning in urban sprawl , the report says , we could feasibly cut this figure down to 108 billion gallons .
So here ’s where the mathematics of biomass come in .
NRDC has forecasted that the number of gallons of ethanol produced per ton of dry switchgrass could jump from 50 gallons to 117 gallons by 2050 .
Crop experts say that current averages of five dry tons of grass per acre could easily double under a standard breeding program .
These combined boosts in efficiency mean that enough switchgrass could be grown on a reasonable chunk of land to produce 165 billion gallons of ethanol by 2050 .
And because one gallon of ethanol contains 66 percent of the energy content of gasoline , 165 billion gallons of ethanol equates to — you guessed it — 108 billion gallons of gasoline .
It ’s an optimistic scenario , to be sure .
On the efficiency side , it demands radical cuts in fuel usage .
On the ethanol side , it requires an infrastructure of pipelines and pumps specially designed to transport the hygroscopic fluid .
( Railcars and barges currently do the job , but this adds to both CO2 emissions and expense . )
More tricky is the problem of the ethanol production itself .
Cellulosic biomass is bulky and materially complex , unfit for the same methods of ethanol extraction used with corn .
In order to even get the stuff into manageable form , processors must soak it in a pre-treatment bath , followed by an acidic or enzymatic digestion that splits it into simple sugars .
Researchers are now trying to engineer a bacterium that can chomp through all of these sugars at once , but for now the multistep digestion procedure is a requirement .
The future of ethanol production will rely not only on streamlining that digestion , but on combining all processes — from pre-treatment through fermentation — in a single genetically engineered microorganism .
In short , the shining promise of cellulosic is still just that .
“ The prospects for ethanol from cellulose may be more promising than is the case for corn , but the benefits , assuming they exist , surely lie a decade or more in the future , ” wrote Harvard environmental studies professor Michael McElroy in a recent article in Harvard Magazine .
“ The best , immediate option would be to conserve : to use less gasoline . ”
Biodiesel
Imperatives to use less gas , unfortunately , are not something most Americans swallow easily .
Images of drive - in movies , drive - thru restaurants , and the wide open road , after all , speckle our formative history .
But some very American icons , ranging from Willie Nelson and Neil Young to Julia Roberts and Morgan Freeman , are hoping to lessen the impacts of our four - wheel love affair by championing biodiesel — a fuel usually derived from soybean , palm , or oil - seed plants like canola and mustard , but also acquirable from waste animal and vegetable fats , and even , surprisingly , algae .
Photo : fueleconomy.gov
Begun as a grassroots network of brewers that — without subsidies or government regulations — maintained a countercultural , anti-establishment aura , the biodiesel industry is rapidly turning mainstream .
According to a recent article in the New York Times , about 76 commercial biodiesel plants are in production today , up from 22 in 2004 .
Even these can barely keep pace .
Nationwide consumption of biodiesel tripled from 25 million gallons in 2004 to 75 million in 2005 , and was expected to quadruple from that in 2006 , reaching 300 million gallons .
Accordingly , 50 new larger - scale plants are under construction .
These numbers still pale in comparison to Europe , where compression - ignition ( diesel ) vehicles are far more common than in the U.S. , and where nearly 90 percent of all global biodiesel is produced and consumed .
As demand rises , however , many E.U. countries will be hoping to fulfill their Kyoto Protocol requirements with fuel imported from Southeast Asia and Brazil .
Japan , too , has expressed interest in obtaining biodiesel , as have India and China .
None of which is surprising , since as a substitute for regular diesel , biodiesel holds great appeal .
Over its lifetime , pure biodiesel emits about 78 percent less CO2 than conventional diesel , according to a 1998 Department of Energy study [ PDF ] .
Burning biodiesel also reduces emissions of smog - forming hydrocarbons and particulate matter by about 50 percent , and emissions of sulfur oxides and sulfates by 100 percent .
On the downside , all diesel engines — whether fueled by conventional diesel or biodiesel — still spew more toxic soot and smog - forming pollutants than gasoline engines , and this will likely remain true until cleaner “ Tier 2 ” diesel emission standards go into full effect in 2009 .
So making the switch to biodiesel makes great environmental sense for the current fleet of diesel cars , buses , trucks , and heavy - duty equipment .
But for individuals deciding on their next car purchase , a gasoline - powered hybrid ( one that will soon be able to utilize cellulosic ethanol ) remains the better choice .
That said , researchers at the University of Minnesota and St. Olaf College recently found that biodiesel production is highly efficient , generating 93 percent more energy than is required to make it .
They also found that biodiesel reduces greenhouse - gas emissions by 41 percent compared with fossil fuels — strikingly less than the 1998 DOE study ’s 78 percent , but still significant .
When Tier 2 emissions standards bring biodiesel up to par with gasoline and ethanol for air pollutants , biodiesel seems like it should be a no - brainer for green energy .
And the Winner Is …
With the Middle East embroiled in conflict and evidence of climate change mounting , finding a viable source of renewable energy has never been so critical … or so in vogue .
It is tempting , almost instinctive , to jump toward the most visible and abundant source for that energy — in this case , corn .
Some say that corn ethanol could be a “ stepping stone ” to cleaner fuels like cellulosic ethanol .
Perhaps .
The danger is that the stepping stone becomes the destination — a substitute for meaningful change , squandering precious time and public faith when it does n’t pan out .
When it comes to biodiesel , limitations on the scale of production may be the greatest weakness .
According to the Minnesota research teams , if the entire American corn and soybean crop were diverted to biodiesel , that fuel would still satisfy only about 6 percent of diesel demand .
To put that into perspective , in even the most optimistic 2006 production estimates , biodiesel will replace less than half of one percent of all diesel consumed .
Ramping up worldwide cultivation of biodiesel crops is a possibility , but that will mean deforestation and the concomitant loss of biodiversity .
If Brazil razes more of its jungle and Malaysia and Thailand theirs , little will be left of rainforests anywhere in the world .
Experts say that cellulosic ethanol stands a real chance to displace significant amounts of oil .
But they also say this wo n’t happen without great financial support from both the public and private sectors .
It wo n’t happen unless our political leadership implements greater efficiency standards and other incentives for companies to “ go green . ”
It wo n’t happen unless we as individuals are willing to cut back on how much energy we consume , bottom line .
And most important , it wo n’t happen unless we call for a change .
Which , of course , is why it ’s so important to understand why some changes are better than others .
Nobody I know can understand a thing Steve Gillmor is talking about , mainly because he makes so many obscure references without explaining them .
I thought as a public service I would provide a detailed exposition of his latest blog post , Bad Sinatra .
My goal here was to explain just about everything , and I hope it ’s not too tedious .
It works like the Talmud .
First I ’ve got a paragraph quoted directly from Steve .
I ’ve taken the liberty of adding hyperlinks , which are not in the original article , and correcting an accidental edit which renders one of the paragraphs nonsensical .
Then I went ahead and bolded all the terms that needed definition , including names that were relevant .
Those are defined in the “ Rashi ” section below each paragraph .
Finally , I added my own commentary in the “ Tosefot ” section .
The idea is that the Rashi stuff helps you understood what Gillmor literally meant , while the Tosefot section contains more in - depth commentary addressing the actual points he ’s trying to make .
It took me over three hours to research and explain all this , and , as you ’ll see if you follow closely , Gillmor ’s entire argument fell apart under scrutiny , so I do n’t think I ’m going to be doing in - depth explanation like this again .
So without further ado , here ’s Bad Sinatra , with Rashi and Tosefot .

That ’s entertainment , folks . ”

Playing to the middle of the pack : Avoiding technical detail so as to remain comprehensible to mainstream journalists .
Tosefot Mining Gillmor is president of and was a co-founder of AttentionTrust , a non-profit organization tightly connected to the for - profit startup RootMarkets , so it ’s safe to assume that he agrees with their belief that users on the Internet should own their attention data .
For example , if a user goes to Amazon and visits certain product pages , Amazon obtains data about what that user is paying attention to .
Under current practice , Amazon “ owns ” that data .
Briefly , the AttentionTrust / RootMarkets idea is that the user should have a right to control that data , delete it from Amazon ’s servers if they choose , sell it to the highest bidder , etc .
The “ sell it to the highest bidder ” part is where they hope to make their money , creating an exchange , Root Exchange where user ’s “ intentions ” can be traded .
In practice this means trading leads : contact information for customers who have expressed a desire to purchase some commodity .
For example a user might go to a website and say they ’re buying a house and want a mortgage ; this lead would be traded on an exchange just like a stock or bond and lenders who wanted to write mortgage loans would bid on it .
Participants in this exchange would be ( presumably ) required to abide by strict privacy rules and the principle that users own their attention data ( i.e. they have the right to control the information that they are interested in a mortgage right now ) , which makes this an attempt to create a legitimate and ethical version of what has traditionally been a shady , boiler - room operation characterized by illicit markets for names and phone numbers of the elderly and the feeble - minded who are likely to fall for scams ( c.f. Glengarry Glen Ross ) .
Whether it works or not remains to be seen .
In any case it is fair to assume that Gillmor strongly objects to Benioff ’s mining his customer database , which , according to the Attention Trust philosophy , amounts to theft .
Microsoft ’s developer strategy Benioff and Salesforce.com have a history of overstating the importance of their own work .
Even though their product is primarily a sales force automation product , Salesforce.com advertising historically focused only on the way it was delivered , as a hosted web application , as if this was a more important aspect than the functionality of the web service itself .
I was at a Salesforce.com presentation that started out with a quick five minute summary of the evolution of programming ( Eniac , mainframes , minicomputers , microcomputers , and web - based applications ) and then presented Salesforce ’s latest feature as if this was the next big step in the evolution of programming , on a par , say , with the shift from PCs to the web .
The latest feature ?
Custom Fields .
The highly savvy audience literally laughed at the pretense .
Now , Microsoft ’s “ developer strategy ” probably refers to their massively successful strategy of creating platforms , especially Windows , and doing everything imaginable to make it easy and profitable for developers to create software for that platform , thus strengthening the value of the platform and creating massive network effects .
Presumably what happened at the Salesforce.com luncheon was that Benioff described his company ’s efforts to mine its customer data as if this were an accomplishment on a par with Microsoft ’s greatly successful strategy of courting third - party developers .
Gillmor mocks the hubris of this comparison .
On the other hand , it seems more likely that Gillmor might just have been conflating two things Benioff was talking about : their own customer data mining and Salesforce .
com ’s new platform strategy which encourages developers to write their own enterprise applications to run on Salesforce.com .

“ The thick client : why is Jonathan floating this lead balloon ?
To get some blogoversy ?
Probably .
His slick sales pitches do n’t register , and one of the best guys on his feet in the business seems hamstrung by his day job .
He should take a look at what Jon Udell is doing .
The new show business is actionable information on demand , spiced with a healthy disrespect for marketing bullshit and strategic kindergarten .
Take Edelman ’s alliance with Newsgator to provide pre-gamed conversations .
Nice : avoid the messy run-up to PayPerPost stench , and go right for the stupid notion that people wo n’t immediately look not at the approved conversation but at the telltale odor of the missing links .
Attention : the “ customers ” are listening now .
Think of the stream as meditation . ”
Rashi Blogoversy : Weblog controversy .
Slick sales pitches : Most of Schwartz ’s weblog posts are earnest and unsubtle sales pitches for Sun ’s products .
Do n’t register :
As a result Schwartz ’s weblog has very little influence and is rarely linked to by other bloggers .
It has only 2342 incoming links as reported by Technorati compared to , say , Scoble , who has 16,090 .
Hamstrung : Unable to write what he really thinks on his weblog .
John Udell : Former InfoWorld columnist who recently joined Microsoft as a professional blogger .
Actionable information : News You Can Use.
Strategic kindergarden : Childish strategies attempting to get publicity through weblogs .
Edelman : Large , old , established public relations firm .
PR firms attempt to gain publicity for their clients by creating news stories , as opposed to advertising firms which simply purchase paid ads .
Newsgator : RSS software company .
PayPerPost : Loathsome , despicable company which proposes to pay bloggers to mention products , pissing in the well and destroying what little trust we had earned .
Stream : list of URLs which the web user visits in the order they visited them .
Tosefot
The thick client .
After a brief sojourn in his social calendar , Gillmor threatens to return to the topic at hand , the critique of the blog post by Schwartz .
New show business .
Jonathan Schwartz ’s slick marketing weblog is ineffective because readers are on the lookout for marketing BS and attempts to create bogus product placements on weblogs .
Stupid notion .
PR agencies have traditionally done very well by building up relationships with journalists and news outlets so that when one of their clients has a product to push , they can get news stories about that product into the media .
This is far more effective than advertising , because readers consider editorial content to be more credible than the advertising , which has almost no credibility at all .
As more and more attention shifts from mainstream media ( MSM ) to the web and especially weblogs , PR firms are naturally concerned about how to do PR in this new environment .
Their initial attempts consist almost entirely of treating popular bloggers as if they were traditional media outlets , so , for example , I get at least half a dozen “ press releases ” every day from PR firms , written in the style of a newspaper article , as if Joel on Software were some kind of newfangled newspaper .
These releases are sent by completely clueless PR professionals who have absolutely no idea what ’s going on ; not only are they clueless , but they actually think they ’re clever by adding a few bloggers to their spam directories .
What they ’re really doing is training bloggers ’ bayesian spam filters to ignore the company they ’re supposedly promoting , and generating ill - will towards their clients by spamming on their behalf .
Steve Rubel of Edelman has been blogging for quite a while and certainly knows more than most PR professionals how blogging works , however , the Edelman / Newsgator plan , besides being almost impossible to understand , wo n’t work , because readers will immediately see it for what it is : paid advertising .
Gillmor argues that users will recognize it as paid advertising because it lacks hyperlinks which are characteristic of genuine blog posts .
“ Microsoft ’s market standards into a commodity .
Spare me the garbage that we need real code running on the client .
If you want to know what a vendor is afraid of , figure out what competitor they ’re more afraid of .
Is it Adobe with Apollo , eroding Java ’s device penetration lead ?
It ’s certainly not Microsoft ?
If you want to see why I ’m so relaxed , go look at CrittendenIV ’s post about this five tags bullshit .
He mentioned me at the end so it bubbled up in my vanity feed , but there ’s no way I can match or even come close to this guy .
A star is born .
By contrast , Jonathan ’s bizarre thesis that the browser is a Winerian locked trunk is a ) probably true , and b ) so the fuck what .
Mozilla forever put the lie to that theory when Firefox jujitsued Microsoft ’s market standards into a commodity .
Papadopoulos levels about Sun ’s difficulty in driving sales in the Web 2 value chain no matter how right they are in their technology bets .
Jonathan changes the subject to clients .
Why ? ”
Rashi Apollo : Project by Adobe to allow Flash applications to run on the desktop on any operating system .
CrittendenIV : Oregon blogger .
Five tags :
Blog game in which a blogger writes five things that their readers did not know about them , and then tags five other bloggers who are expected to then do the same thing .
Vanity feed : Tracking mentions of oneself on the Internet .
Winerian locked trunk : Metaphor by Dave Winer in which a large company creates a platform that allows small companies to participate in a market , but only as second class participants and at the whim of the large company .
Papadopoulos : ( Greg ) , CTO of Sun. Tosefot Microsoft ’s market
There appears to have been an inadvertent edit between the time the text was written and the way it appears on the web .
I have redacted the text to the way that I believe Gillmor originally wrote it .
Firefox jujitsued
The success of the web browser and the fact that it is a commodity , available for free on every platform , and the fact that developers now develop most new code to run over the web in the browser , has removed a lot of Microsoft ’s market standards power .
When all your applications run on a browser , Windows is just another commodity platform for running web browsers , no better than Macintoshes or Linux machines .
Levels
Not sure where this “ leveling ” is taking place .
Lately Papadopoulos has been talking about how the world only needs 5 computers , by which he means megacomputer clusters like Google , live.com , Yahoo ! , etc .
None of those clusters is running very much Sun hardware , so somewhere Gillmor might have read Papadopoulos admitting this .
Why ?
It appears that Gillmor is interpreting Schwartz ’s claim in favor of “ rich clients ” as meaning that people will write Java applications to run on the desktop , as opposed to Ajax web applications .
This is why he brings up Apollo , which , if successful , would directly compete with Java as a platform for building desktop clients .
Gillmor makes several errors here .
First , “ Spare me the garbage that we need real code running on the client … ”
Gillmor himself considers
Ajax applications in web browsers the “ sweet spot ” , and those involve an awful lot of real code running on the client .
Second , in evaluating competitors , it is almost absurd to consider Apollo , which is still in beta and has virtually no penetration , as a serious competitor .
It might become one , but that would be years away .
The CEO of Sun does n’t spend his days worrying about every project under development when he has real , current competitors to think about .
( One of the frequent failings of pundits is a strong tendency to extrapolate wildly about trends which have n’t even begun yet , and assume that they will take over the world .
There was a maddening dialog on one of the last episodes of The Gillmor Gang about whether Microsoft Office would move to the web , like Google Documents , in which Steve Gillmor and Jason Calacanis repeatedly talked about “ flipping the switch , ” as if porting hundreds of megabytes of Windows code to the web was a simple matter of “ flipping the switch . ”
There was no recognition that web - based word processors and spreadsheets , while amusing , have merely a sliver of the capabilities of Windows - based apps . )
The third mistake is even more drastic ; Schwartz ’s argument in favor of rich clients , if you read it , is actually an argument in favor of Ajax clients .
Schwartz simply redefines those as “ rich ” clients .
He writes : “ In my book , it ’s inaccurate to say Google or YouTube are ‘ thin clients ’ – they ’re services that leverage someone else ’s thick client .
A browser ….
Innovation on clients is back – we see it in a flurry of Web 2.0 companies investing in creative desktop interaction and the resurgence of JavaScript … ”
So actually , Gillmor ’s entire “ argument ” with Schwartz is one based on a misinterpretation of what Schwartz is saying , and in fact they both seem to agree that the “ Google sweet spot ” is where the world is moving .
“ Similarly , Dave is changing the subject from god knows what to JSON and Ajax API and for what reason ?
Dave is one of the most efficient if not the supreme political pragmatist , so why is he bringing up these subjects ?
Who am I supposed to be scared of ?
Google ?
Nope , if the Ajax API and the terms of service around including unaltered adsense are so counter to user interest , that will precipitate a decline in usage and therefore less adoption of Google properties .
Seems self - correcting to me : user votes , user wins .
Why do we need saving here ? ”
Rashi JSON : JavaScript Object Notation , the most efficient and concise way to transmit data from a web server to JavaScript code running on a browser .
Unaltered adsense : Google ’s requirement that if you use their API to perform search queries , you must show the sponsored links that come back with those results , unaltered .
Tosefot
Why is he bringing up these subjects ?
Dave recently misinterpreted the goal of JSON , thinking that it was an interop technology — reinventing the wheel that he himself invented in the form of XML / RPC and its successor SOAP .
His readers corrected him , and he accepted the correction and moved on gracefully .
“ Who , then , is Dave ’s competitor ?
Is he caught , like Microsoft , competing against his own success ?
RSS won , and Dave did it .
I ’ll wait while nobody argues with this .
Good .
Now we live in an RSS world .
What to do next ?
I say it ’s gestures , but I do n’t care what you think about that .
Let ’s say I ’m right , that the world will move from inference to direct testimony , from links to gesture feeds , from push to accept , from pressure to permission .
In that world , do we need protection ?
Or does Dave need to reinvent himself in this brave new world he launched ? ”
Rashi Nobody argues with this :
Winer ’s frequent insistence on getting credit for RSS leads many people to tease him by denying or downplaying his role , which makes him angry .
Gestures :
An esoteric astronaut architecture .
“ It ’s tough to teach an old dog new tricks , the saying goes .
But Dave is not your average bear .
He ’s tough , cunning , honest , and vulnerable .
There ’s an opening to ignore what I ’m saying as personal , but honestly all politics are local , and deeply personal .
I ’m not counting Dave , or Jonathan , out .
But they need to face the music .
They ’ve outgrown the jobs they invented for themselves , and it ’s time to grow again . ”
Rashi Bear : Affectionate term for a husky , large man with a lot of body hair .
Tosefot Outgrown the jobs :
There are , it seems , two main points in Gillmor ’s post .
First , Jonathan Schwartz is wrong about rich clients .
It appears that Schwartz was just being clever and using the term rich client to mean Web Browser +
JavaScript plus a few other cutesy toys , nothing to be alarmed about , and Gillmor and Schwartz do n’t seem to disagree at all .
So that point evaporates .
The other point is about why Dave Winer is changing the subject ( what , are we only allowed to have one subject on the entire internet ? ) , and it turns out that was just a simple misunderstanding , which is common on blogs : bloggers will frequently post something before fully researching a subject .
Gillmor ’s entire thesis about old dogs and new tricks thus completely collapses in a puff of smoke .
And it only took me 3 hours to figure it out .
Luckily there ’s one more unrelated paragraph :
“ Oh , and Microsoft , you guys better step up right now and cut this RSS patent cancer out before we do it without anesthesia . ”
このpopCount問題は、去年岡野原さんに教えてもらいました。
テーブル参照で分岐命令をなくす
ちなみに最近のプロセッサは分岐予測・投機実行が失敗したときのコストが非常に高いので、 popTable [ ] は 8 bit のテーブルで予め計算しておきます。
unsigned char popTable [ 256 ] ; int popCount8 bit ( int x ) { int n = 0 ; if ( x & 0x01 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x02 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x04 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x08 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x10 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x20 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x40 ) n++ ; if ( x & 0x80 ) n++ ; return n ; } void init_popTable ( ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 256 ; i++) { popTable [ i ] = popCount8 bit( i ) ; } }
ベンチマーク結 果
実行結果 （AMD Opteron 240EE / CentOS 4.4 x86_64 / gcc 3.4.6 ）
% gcc - O0 pop.c && ./a.out loop=1000000 popCount32bitA ( fffffffe ) =31 : 0.027621[sec ] popCount32bitB ( fffffffe ) =31 : 0.025511[sec ] popCount64bitA ( f0f0f0f0f0f0f0e1 ) =32 : 0.049293[sec ] popCount64bitB ( f0f0f0f0f0f0f0e1 ) =32 : 0.038641[sec ]
手元のx86_64環境では、テーブル参照を行なわない popCount64bitB の方が速い、という結果になりました。面白いですね。
Efficient Implementation of Population Count Function
以上の話をラボの社内掲示板に振ってみたところ、早速奥さんから
Athlon Code Optimization Guidelines ( pp.136-139 ) に、もっと速いMMXのアセンブリコードが載っているよ、ということを教えてもらいました。
なるほど、勉強になります。pp.136-139から該当コードを抜粋します。
Example 1 ( Integer Version ) :
unsigned int popcount ( unsigned int v ) { unsigned int retVal ; __asm { MOV EAX , [ v ] ;v MOV EDX , EAX ;v SHR EAX , 1 ;v >> 1 AND EAX , 055555555 h ;( v >>
1 ) & 0x55555555 SUB EDX , EAX ;w = v - (( v >> 1 ) & 0x55555555 ) MOV EAX , EDX ;w SHR EDX , 2 ;w >> 2 AND EAX , 033333333h ;w & 0x33333333 AND EDX , 033333333h ;( w >>
2 ) & 0x33333333 ADD EAX , EDX ;x = ( w & 0x33333333 ) + (( w >> 2 ) & 0x33333333 ) MOV EDX , EAX ;x SHR EAX , 4 ;x >> 4 ADD EAX , EDX ;x + ( x >>
4 ) AND EAX , 00F0F0F0 Fh ;y = ( x + ( x >>
4 ) & 0x0F0F0F0 F ) IMUL EAX , 001010101h ;y * 0x01010101 SHR EAX , 24 ; population count = ( y * 0x01010101 ) >>
24 MOV retVal , EAX ; store result } return ( retVal ) ; }
これはMMX命令を使わない32bitバージョン。
Efficient 64 - Bit Population Count Using MMX ™ Instructions
The following code sample is an MMX version of popcount ( ) that works on 64 bits at a time .
This MMX code can do popcounts about twice as fast as the integer version ( for an identical number of bits ) .
Notice that the source was loaded using two instructions instead of a simple MOVQ to avoid a bad STLF case ( size mismatch from two DWORDs feeding into a QWORD ) .
Example 1 ( MMX version ) :
#include " amd3d.h " __declspec ( naked ) unsigned int __stdcall popcount64_1 ( unsigned __int64 v ) { static const __int64 C55 = 0x5555555555555555 ; static const __int64 C33 = 0x3333333333333333 ; static const __int64 C0 F = 0x0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0 F ; __asm { MOVD MM0 , [ ESP+4 ] ; v_low PUNPCKLDQ MM0 , [ ESP+8 ] ;v MOVQ MM1 , MM0 ;v PSRLD MM0 , 1 ;v >> 1 PAND MM0 , [ C55 ] ;( v >>
1 ) & 0x55555555 PSUBD MM1 , MM0 ;w = v - (( v >> 1 ) & 0x55555555 ) MOVQ MM0 , MM1 ;w PSRLD MM1 , 2 ;w >> 2 PAND MM0 , [ C33 ] ;w & 0x33333333 PAND MM1 , [ C33 ] ;( w >>
2 ) & 0x33333333 PADDD MM0 , MM1 ;x = ( w & 0x33333333 ) + (( w >> 2 ) & 0x33333333 ) MOVQ MM1 , MM0 ;x PSRLD MM0 , 4 ;x >> 4 PADDD MM0 , MM1 ;x + ( x >>
4 ) PAND MM0 , [ C0 F ] ;y = ( x + ( x >>
4 ) & 0x0F0F0F0 F ) PXOR MM1 , MM1 ;0 PSADBW ( MM0 , MM1 ) ; sum across all 8 bytes MOVD EAX , MM0 ; result in EAX per calling convention EMMS ; clear MMX state RET 8 ; pop 8 - byte argument off stack and return } }
このように64bitのpopCountでMMX命令を使えば、32bitの処理を2回実行するよりも速く実行できるというお話。
* それSSEでやればいいんじゃね？
SSE （SIMD 拡張命令）の「 PSADBW 」を使うというアイディア
688 ：・∀・）っ-○◎● ◆ DanGorION6 ：2006/10/07 (土) 15:13:39 てけとーにでっち上げてみた DWORD PopCountDW_SSSE3 ( DWORD src ) { DWORD dest ; static const __m128i table = { 0,1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,3,2,3,3,4 } ; __asm { movd xmm1 , dword ptr [ src ] movdqa xmm0 , xmm1 psrlq xmm1 , 4 punpckldq xmm0 , xmm1 pshufb xmm0 , xmmword ptr [ table ] pxor xmm1 , xmm1 psadbw xmm0 , xmm1 movd dword ptr [ dest ] , xmm0 } return dest ; }
このコードはちゃんと動くかどうかまだ試していません。
* それSSE4で1命令でできるよ
次の Intel CPU で拡張される SSE4 でズバリそのもの の「 POPCNT 」命令が追加されるという話を思い出しました。
また 、IntelはSSE4に加えて、CPUに統合するアクセラレータコア向けの命令についても言及している。 これまでの汎用( General Purpose ) CPUは、できる限り汎用的に使える命令を中心にしてきた(実際にはそうでもない命令もある)。だが、アクセラレータ命令は、それとは趣が異なる。非常にアプリケーションに特化した特殊な命令になるという。 その中で、Intelが最初に実装しようとしているのは「Cyclic Redundancy Check ( CRC:巡回冗長検査 ) 」のアクセラレーション。CRCアクセラレータのために、CRCバリューのチェックを行なう命令「CRC32」を実装するという。CRCは、データの完全性、つまり、データが破損しているかどうかをチェックする仕組み。対象とするデータから生成されるCRCバリューを比較することで、チェックを行なう。 CRCは通信やストレージでよく使われており、Intelもネットワークストレージをターゲットとすると説明している。Intelによると、「iSCSI( Internet Small Computer System Interface ) 」 や「 RDMA ( Remote Direct Memory Access ) 」といったストレージのデータトランスファプロトコルのアクセラレートが主目的だという。現在は、こうしたプロトコル処理をCPUオフロードする専用チップも使われているが、Intelの構想はそれをCPUベースで取り込むことにある。CPUの汎用コアをオフロードするか、外付けのアクセラレータカードの必要性をなくすことで、システム全体の消費電力を下げることになる。 さら にIntelは、2つ目のアクセラレータ命令としてラージデータセットのサーチ向け命令「POPCNT」を挙げている。Population Count命令で、オペランド中のビットセットの数を数える。Intelは応用例としてゲノムマイニング、手書き認識、ハミングアルゴリズムなどを挙げている。
この「 POPCNT」命令が普通のPCで使えるようになれば、全文検索エンジンのスコア計算（疎なビットベクトルから1の数を数える処理）とかをPCクラスタを使って高速に処理することができるようになるかも。機械学習の分野でも役立ちそう。
私はi386の頃のハンドアセンブルしかやったことがないのですが、どんどんx86のアーキテクチャは進化しているのですね。
まだまだバイナリアンの仕事はなくならない、ということみたい。自分ももっと勉強しなきゃ。
ということで 、Binary
Hacks には直接的なパフォーマンスチューニングのテクニックは書かれていませんが、以下の参考文献とあわせて読むと参考になるかもしれません。 これからバイナリアンを目指す方にもお勧めです。

Last week , a 41 - year - old U.S. Army sergeant from Hinesville , Ga. , was released from prison after serving 13 months of a 15 - month sentence for refusing to board a plane bound for Iraq .
Born in Alabama and raised in rural Tennessee , Sgt. Kevin Benderman first joined the Army in 1987 out of a sense of purpose and tradition .
His family has a history of fighting wars .
Both grandfathers fought in World War I .
His father served in World War II .
His uncle served in Korea .
Benderman had served 10 years in the military before refusing to obey orders .
He filed an application for conscientious objector status after serving a tour in Iraq in 2004 .
The military turned him down .
He spoke to IPS this week following his release .
IPS : You ’ve just been released from 13 months in a military prison .
Did your opinions on the war in Iraq change or develop at all during your incarceration ?
K. BENDERMAN : After I made my decision to file as a conscientious objector , my opinion has n’t changed on the [ Iraq ] war or any war that may come along afterwards .
It ’s all the same .
If you go back and look through the history of wars , you can see that they ’re all the same .
There ’s violence .
It ’s young men killing each other for whatever reason , and I think we should have learned that a long time ago and been working toward eliminating war from our daily lives .
IPS : Were there any experiences that you had while you were over in Iraq that helped lead you to this conclusion ?
KB : A lot of people have asked me if I ’ve had an epiphany , and I ca n’t say that I ’ve had one .
It was just the total sum of [ seeing ] all the people who lived in that region and how they were affected by wars  seeing the young men and some of the other men and what it did to them and what it made them become in order to survive in that kind of a situation .
IPS : In your first tour , you served in Khanaqin , that ’s an area where the population is mostly Kurds .
Most of them would probably have positive feelings about the U.S. invasion .
Did you feel any of that ?
KB : From what I saw in the particular area I was in , we had a pretty good relationship with the people living there .
It was kind of an odd situation because there were still people who could have caused serious bodily injury because just the type of situation it was .
It was war .
So you never know where anything is going to come from .
IPS : While you were over there you were in a relatively peaceful area , and there were n’t a lot of attacks on your unit .
Given that , what ’s pushed you to take this decision that caused you to spend this time behind bars ?
KB : It ’s war .
There were mass graves [ from Saddam Hussein ’s 1988 ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kurds ] in that area that I was in .
So when you see a mass grave full of bodies of old men , and old women and children and then you realize that it was war that put them there 
I ’m not saying it ’s us that put them there , but war put them there , and that ’s something that I saw that made me think that war is not something we need to be doing in the modern world .
IPS : What would you say to someone who said , " That ’s something that Saddam Hussein did against the Kurds , and what the U.S. military was doing was to make it right " ?
KB : Well , I can tell you that I do n’t think that war is the way to make it right , because war is what put them there in the first time .
I do n’t think it ’s a good idea to continue to kill people with war when all that does is create more mass graves .
IPS : Now you ’re out having not served your full court - martial , pending an appeal .
What is your feeling about the appeal given your experiences with the military justice system so far ?
KB : I talked to my military attorney , and he seemed to believe that we have a chance .
I do n’t know .
It may be 50/50 .
I ’ll have to wait to reserve judgment until I see how it turns out .
IPS : While you were in prison , Amnesty International called you a prisoner of conscience who should be released .
While you were in prison , there were a number of other people who applied for conscientious objector status .
Some have gotten it .
Just last week there was a young gentleman , Mark Wilkerson , who turned himself in at Fort Hood after being AWOL for a year and a half .
Do you believe there ’s a trend ?
Or , based on your experiences in the military , do you believe we are likely to see just a few very isolated cases ?
KB : Each individual is going to have to come to a conclusion about how to conduct their lives .
There may be more that come out and apply for conscientious objection .
They ’re going to have to make their minds up themselves .
IPS : The nut of the military ’s argument to the denial of your petition is that you signed up for the military and did n’t have any qualms about killing people for 10 years .
Since then , you have n’t gone through a religious conversion or anything like that .
What do you have to say about that ?
KB : I guess I ’m not your perfect conscientious objector who has heard angels singing and all the rest of that , but I can deal with reality .
When I see the reality that war makes our young men and women do things they might not otherwise do and puts them in situations where killing is just  well , it ’s kind of hard to say , really , because everybody looks at war in a certain way .
It ’s all glamorized on TV and in the movies and everything else , and you see all the stories .
Personally , I was influenced by stories from my family members .
Growing up in the neighborhood that I did , [ the military ] was held in high regard .
But once you see the reality of war up close and personal  people say you should know what this is , but sometimes it ’s hard until you see it yourself .
It ’s hard to see because the way war is presented in the media is so different from the way it looks up close .

Последнее время говорить об ипотеке было несколько непринято .
После катастрофического обвала рубля , панической истерии на валютном рынке и после всех передряг , случившихся за последнее время , ассоциации с ипотекой были весьма негативными .

Apress has recently published a " mainstream " book ( in English ! ) on OCaml .
Here is an interview with the author , on a Ruby blog , of all places .
I have n't seen the book yet , but will certainly buy it .
If it 's as good as Practical Common Lisp and generates as much buzz , this will be a very nice thing .

During my freshman year at MIT , my roommate RJ Ryan and I worked on creating the most elaborate automation system we could envision .
Featuring everything from web control , voice activation , and a security system , to large continuously running information displays , electric blinds , and one - touch parties , the custom designed MIDAS Automation System has brought ease to our lives ( if one does n't count all the time it took to actually build and program the system ) .
This page both describes the system functionalities and explains how it was built .
Anyone with some programming and construction skills , drive , and a couple hundred dollars should be able to replicate this system .
Text Displays
MIDAS incorporates three VFDs and one large , color LED display .
A VFD and the LED display are centralized to give randomized information from various sources .
Everything from news , local weather , and of course , Slashdot articles , scroll across the displays .
The Control Pod allows a user to select a particular topic to display immediately on the display .
Otherwise , it will automatically cycle through information .
MIT has a mailing list called " Reuse " where people post equipment they no longer want .
Many of the devices incorporated into MIDAS are parts from devices picked off Reuse .
When something very desirable is put on the list , it will often be gone within minutes .
Whenever a Reuse post is sent to the list , the display immediately displays the title of the email and the location of the item .
This works by using a script that browses through mail sent to a particular address .
Once an email comes in , the title field is sent to the MIDAS controller via Ethernet , the web server picks up the request , and the LED display program sends the information to the display .
The other two VFDs perform different tasks .
One is hooked up to the music server , which stockpiles all the music that MIDAS controls .
Whenever MIDAS is playing music , this VFD will display the title and artist of the current song .
The third VFD is an accessory VFD hooked up to my laptop and is used for various purposes .
Party Mode
This is my favorite part of the entire system .
One touch to this button :
and the room goes to this :
( Above : video showing the party mode activation )
When the button is hit , all the lights shut off , the blinds close , the displays show : " FEEL THE ENERGY . "
Simultaneously , a deep voice says this over the speakers with a deep bass beat in the background .
Then intense music turns on along with a sound activated strobe light , laser light show , fog machine , black lights , revolving disco light , LCD visualization projector projected onto a blackout - screen , neon colored lights , computer screen Winamp visualization , oscilloscope showing the waveform of the music , and surveillance camera monitors .
Below is a flattened schematic of the dorm room with all of the Party Mode devices highlighted in red .
Note that the layers have been flattened ( the beds are actually lofts , that is why there is a desk partially under them , etc. ) .
( Above : video showing the different devices that make up party mode )
Party Mode can also be activated using the touch screen controller and the web interface .
This is how Party Mode works :
The large red e-stop button is wired to the Control Pod ( see below for more information ) .
When the button is hit , MIDAS will read the bit of the port the button is connected to as a logical low ( since it is wired with a pull - up resistor ) .
When this happens , MIDAS runs through its Party Mode batch script which calls my X - 10 control program various times , first telling all lights to turn on , and then for all of the Party Mode devices to turn on .
While this is happening , MIDAS sends an http request to the music server , which has a large inventory of music .
Running on this machine is a Perl script that controls Winamp .
The parameters of the GET request tell the music server to play the Party Mode playlist , a specially crafted selection of dance music preceded by the custom recorded Party Mode intro ( see video to listen to it ) .
The system is coordinated such that this Party Mode intro plays at just the right time for the text to be displayed on the LED and Vacuum Florescent displays .
The displays , like the audio , say , " Feel the Energy ! "
( Above : a reenactment of a typical Thursday night party )
Mood Settings
Various mood settings in addition to party mode can be actuated with the touch of a button .
These include work , relax , and sleep mode .
Each of these mood settings can be actuated via the touch of a button on the Control Pod , the touch screen controller , the web interface , or by remote control .
These modes are simply batch scripts which call my cm19a ( a USB X - 10 device ) control program .
This activates the X - 10 controlled lights and appliances for each mode .
The work mode turns on all the regular lighting and puts on appropriate work music .
Relax mode uses colored lighting to create a peaceful atmosphere for kicking back .
Sleep mode turns off all the lights , closes the blinds , and queues the sleep playlist on the music server by hitting the Perl script .
Touch - Screen Controller
A 10.1 inch touch screen controller with an embedded computer features a GUI for controlling room settings .
It also displays news and weather .
It serves as the perfect addition to any sink .
The controller was purchased off Ebay , and came stock with a Pentium 166 MHz processor and Windows 98 .
The software running on the machine is a simple GUI that authenticates with the MIDAS controller over Ethernet and then hits a certain URL to activate lighting commands .
Since this is based on the web control aspect of the system , it was a very easy addition to implement .
Current weather is also displayed on the screen .
Remote Light / Appliance Control
The core of any automation system is light and appliance control .
X - 10 equipment controls the majority of the lights in the room .
These modules are very inexpensive and easy to use .
The MIDAS main controller interfaces with these units .
One highly utilized aspect of the system is remote capabilities .
Using the remotes to interface with the X - 10 wireless adapter ( which plugs into the wall and re-transmits signals from the air over the power lines ) , the room has been able to accommodate a number of wall switches without the hassle of wiring them up .
Since X - 10 devices have a certain lag time and are somewhat susceptible to interference and / or outside tampering ( i.e. someone else gets an X - 10 remote and scans through the codes ) , the more time or security critical devices ( such as all the alarm components , blinds , etc. ) are run directly from relays hardwired to their respective custom processing board .
Main Controller
At the heart of the system is the main controller .
Housed in a locked metal alarm system case is an M1000 Mini ITX board .
A DC power supply takes in 12v and outputs the necessary regulated voltages to the motherboard .
This plugs into an old laptop power transformer .
Early testing with transformers proved that the DC power supply I was using is very picky about its input voltage .
If the voltage goes somewhere over about 13 volts , it shuts down for self - protection .
As a fail - safe , a 12 volt , 4 amp - hour battery is wired in parallel with the power input on the power supply .
Since MIDAS only takes about 20 watts of power , if the power goes out , the battery will run MIDAS for another two and a half hours .
The original idea was to run the hard drive off of a 512 MB compact flash card hooked into an IDE / CF adapter .
The adapter provides pretty much a one - to - one connection to an IDE cable , and also provides power to the card .
Due to the limited number of write cycles , the fact that I wanted to log video data , and since I had an old laptop hard drive lying around , I ended up using a laptop drive .
To hook this up to the Mini ITX , one needs an adapter to provide power to the drive and convert from the smaller 40 - pin connector to 38 - pin IDE .
In the picture one may note the USB hub .
Due to the large number of USB devices hooked into the controller , a hub was necessary .
The USB devices include a webcam , the fingerprint scanner , the X - 10 cm19a transceiver ( which transmits commands to turn on lights , and listens for X - 10 remote commands ) , and the Control Pod ( see below ) .
In the top center of the screen is the ultrasonic motion detector used for redundancy in addition to the PIR ( passive infrared ) detector on the other side of the room .
Hooked into the parallel port is the VFD display cable , and in the serial port is the LED display cable .
Since I did n't want to buy a data cable I could make myself , I wired the DB - 9 to RJ - 12 ( 6 pin modular ) adapter myself .
Internet Control
A web interface allows for the room lights and appliances to be controlled from any computer connected to the internet .
For surveillance purposes , the video cameras can also be monitored .
A website written in PHP allows the lights / appliances to be controlled , the music in the room to be controlled , to activate different modes , and to monitor the security cameras .
The site makes calls to the custom X - 10 control software mentioned above .
For obvious reasons , the site also had to be secure .
Currently it uses SSL authentication using certificates issued by MIT .
To control the music , the site merely hits the Perl script on the music server , which controls Winamp on the machine .
For mode control , the PHP running on the main controller merely runs batch scripts on the machine .
Displaying the security cameras is slightly more complicated , yet still relatively simple .
A program on the machine updates an image file every second with the latest shot from the camera .
The video monitor page is set to reload every second with the current image .
This provides the illusion of slow frame rate video .
Alarm System
To prevent any break - ins , a multi-pronged , custom alarm system was designed .
The system features : ( 1 ) ultrasonic motion detector , ( 1 ) PIR motion detector , ( 1 ) magnetic door sensor , ( 1 ) fingerprint scanner for authentication to deactivate alarm system , ( 1 ) backup power supply , ( 3 ) video cameras , one of which is in continuous recording mode , ( 1 ) 120 dB siren , and ( 1 ) revolving siren light .
In addition to the siren and light activating when an intrusion is detected , a text message is sent to my cell phone informing me of the break - in and which sensor (s ) detected the intrusion .
Future work on the system will include a lockdown procedure such as that implemented in my workshop alarm system .
This will close the door , in addition to the activities it already performs .
The three detection sensors are all wired into the Control Pod .
The alarm service on the computer polls the sensors at 20 Hz , so if any sensor is tripped , the program will activate the alarm sequence .
To do this , it simply has to activate a single relay to turn on the alarm siren and light through the Control Pod .
In addition , it sends a text message through the AOL Instant Messenger service .
To scare the intruder , the lights all turn off , the blinds close , and a halogen light turns on , illuminating the mannequin in the corner of the dorm room .
Right below and above her are video monitors which turn on showing the intruder from various angles .
Video Monitoring
The system includes six video cameras .
Two are in the room , one is attached to the antenna rig , looking out the window at the courtyard , and three are near the door looking at the entrance and each direction of the hallway .
One of these cameras is a hidden camera known as " SEAGALVISION " .
After discovering Steven Seagal 's decision to make his own energy drink , the idea of using the can as a hidden camera came to me .
A pinhole lens looks out of Seagal 's right eye .
Automatic Secure Closet Door
While the hardware is still in development , the software and control electronics are finished .
Since a standard swinging closet door takes up too much room , a roll - up garage - door - style door will be installed .
The unit in the below picture that also controls the automatic blinds , shows the hand wave sensor and the status display .
With the wave of a hand , using an infra-red proximity sensor circuit , the Handyboard will activate the door motor .
This hand wave sensor operates on the same principle as automatic sinks : an infra-red LED is pulsated at a certain frequency , and if something comes in a certain range of the LED , the IR receiver will recognize the light , time the offset , and determine if the object is in range .
If so , it sends a digital high to the Handyboard , which then activates a relay to close the closet door .
Voice Activation
Say , " MIDAS AUTOMATION - Lights On ! " and all the lights turn on .
Built into the system is a command set of ten different instructions to perform different tasks .
Utilizing the Microsoft Speech SDK , a service on MIDAS is constantly listening for commands .
Whenever it hears the " MIDAS AUTOMATION " prefix , it knows a command is about to be made .
Originally it was simply " MIDAS , " but due to the occasional false - positive ( i.e . I would be talking on the phone and the room would suddenly break out into Party Mode ) , I changed it to a longer identifier .
The Speech SDK makes voice dictation very easy , and it comes with a wealth of source code to get one started .
The program calls the designated batch script associated with a given command .
The script calls my X - 10 control program a number of times with the desired parameters .
Currently I do not have a very good omni-directional microphone , so one must speak loudly if trying to activate the system on the other side of the room .
Omni-directional boundary microphones , the types found on the floors in front of stages , are well suited for this purpose .
Automatic Blinds
As junk started to pile up in my dorm room , it became apparent that opening and closing the blinds could be quite a feat in itself ( having to climb over desks , for example ) .
Naturally , this was an unacceptable hardship that needed taking care of .
The room came with a retractable , spring - driven blackout screen .
Since the spring would have interfered with the automatic control , I removed the entire shade off the wooden bar and attached it to a 1 / 4 inch threaded rod that spanned the length of the window sill .
The diameter was chosen because it fits very nicely into the chuck of an electric drill , a motor / gearbox assembly I had lying around a parts bin in my room .
The assembly is very powerful , and the gearbox limits the speed to an acceptable rate for blinds .
( Above : video showing the automatic blinds in action )
Two relays control the direction of the blinds motor and a limit switch on both the bottom and top stop the motor from tearing itself out of the wall ( an event which at one point happened ) .
To save myself from running wire across the room , the switches control power directly to the relays like so :
To attach the motor to the wall , I drilled two pipe holder brackets over the motor into the concrete behind the drywall .
On the opposite end of the blinds sits a U - shaped bracket I made out of a small L - bracket and a bolt .
This allows the other end to free - spin , while still holding it up .
The limit switches are cherry switches with small pads attached , and then bolted into a bracket bent out of thick sheet metal .
An old Handyboard controls the blinds .
While it may be overkill for this use , it does provide a nice LCD display that I programmed to show the system status .
The unit controls the relays for the blinds .
To control the Handyboard , I made a control box with three switches ( see below ) : up , down , and stop .
The unit also has a digital input wired to the USB Control Pod which can tell the blinds to close .
This same board controls the closet door as well .
Personal MIT PA System / Antenna Rig
Outside the dorm window , a miniature antenna rig ornaments the dorm window frame .
The rig , the last remnant of the antenna tower , has a multi- band scanner antenna as well as an extremely loud power horn speaker .
This speaker is weatherproof , and hooks up to a long - range wireless audio microphone system .
When spoken through , due to the dynamics of the courtyard that it projects into , the sound reverberates and sounds unbelievably powerful ... especially given its size .
The rig also has a video camera with infrared LEDs ( for night vision ) that points out to the courtyard .
The rig is made up of steel plumbing piping , 90 degree elbow connectors , a fitting flange , and a couple of brackets .
I have found that such piping makes for very solid , high - strength , and easy prototyping .
If you go to the page on my car , you can see that I used the same type of piping to make a touch screen mount .
Custom USB Control Pod
Made out of an old relay box for laboratory equipment , this custom - designed control pod hooks up to one of MIDAS 's USB ports and controls a number of system features .
Three of the buttons on it activate preset " modes " .
One will activate sleep mode , which turns off all the lights and cues sleep music , another activates work mode , which turns on all the standard lights and cues study - appropriate music .
The third button initiates a relax mode which turns off all the lights except the ambient colored lights which give the room a peaceful feeling .
In addition , the blinds are shut and relaxing rhythms play from the speakers .
A " romance " mode is in the making .
Another three buttons control the information displays ( one of the VFDs and the LED display ) .
One button displays the current weather , and also announces it over the speakers through an implementation of Microsoft 's Speech SDK .
The weather information is retrieved via a Yahoo Weather RSS feed .
Another small button announces and displays the time .
The third button shifts the LED displays to a different topic .
The two rocker switches on top control power to the VFDs and the room security cameras .
The indicator lamps display the status of the alarm system , MIDAS power , and the security camera power .
The Pod is comprised of two circuit boards .
The primary control board is an ActiveWire USB control board which has 16 I/O lines and interfaces with a computer USB port .
Since this outputs 3.3 v control signals as outputs , the secondary board has 2N700 transistors wired to IRF730 mosfets .
These then go to relays to control the large loads that the pod controls .
Below is a simple schematic of how the devices are controlled .
This circuit is repeated for every controlled device in the Pod .
The outputs on the board control the four indicator lamps , the automatic blinds , and the alarm system sensors and sirens .
All of the switches hook up to the ActiveWire board and feature a 10 k pull - up resistor .
For power , 120v AC is transformed to 12v DC .
The 12v controls the relays in the Pod as well as the indicator lamps .
This is stepped down to 5v for the controller board and for the VFDs .
Entertainment System
With the touch of one button on an X - 10 remote , entertainment mode will initiate .
The blinds will close , which both blocks out light and since they are white black out shades , they double as the projection screen for the LCD projector which I salvaged and repaired .
The button will also turn off all the lights .
Then it is just a matter of playing a movie or television show , sitting back , relaxing , and having a great time .
Flapjax Tutorial
Welcome !
Welcome to Flapjax !
This tutorial combines the specific with the abstract .
We 'll begin by discussing pure client - side programming , then describe obtaining data from third - party servers , and finally discuss storing data on the Flapjax server .
This tutorial contains links to the demos .
We encourage you to not only run them but also read their sources .
We 've tried to create clean and readable code for you to learn from .
The tutorial will be even most effective if you run the examples in this tutorial for yourself .
Once again , welcome to Flapjax .
Please fasten your seat belts !
Introducing Behaviors
The easiest way to start programming in Flapjax is to use the templating syntax , which lets you embed Flapjax code in an HTML page .
Here 's a simple example :
< p >
The time is {! timerB( 100 ) !}. </ p>
In this fragment , the {!
( pronounced curly - bang ) and !} surround an expression written in Flapjax .
The expression 's syntax looks remarkably similar to that of JavaScript , and this is no coincidence : Flapjax shares the syntax of JavaScript .
You may not be sure of what it does , but you can probably guess : the function timerB probably returns the current system time .
That is , the page probably prints the system time at the point when it was loaded .
Let 's check by running the program .
Hopefully what you saw is not just the current system time , but the time incrementing rapidly .
The function timerB constructs something called a behavior , which is a value that changes over time .
In the first part of this tutorial you 'll learn quite a bit more about behaviors , which are central to Flapjax .
Returning to the example , the expression timerB ( 100 ) creates a timer behavior that returns a value every 100 milliseconds , i.e. , ten times every second .
What it returns , however , is a microsecond timer value , and all those extra digits are what make the timer appear to be updating madly .
So to smooth it we should divide the value by 1000 :
< p >
The time in seconds is {! Math.floor ( timerB( 100 ) / 1000 ) !}. </ p>
First , see how it runs .
As you can see , this value updates more sedately , once every second .
Here 's what is interesting about this example : the division and floor happened every time there was a new value for the timer !
We did n't need to tell the program to recompute : when the value of timerB changed , the rest of the computation automatically noticed the change and updated itself .
In other words , not only did the value of timerB ( 100 ) change over time , so did the value of timerB ( 100 ) / 1000 and , in turn , the value of Math.floor ( timerB ( 100 ) / 1000 ) .
This points to an important rule : if an expression is a behavior , all expressions whose values depend on it also become behaviors .
This automatic updating of the values of behaviors is central to Flapjax .
We do n't actually have to write all expressions inside the HTML document : we 're welcome to , and should , move more complex expressions into a script tag , where we can give them names that we can refer to later .
Let 's do this :
< script type =" text / flapjax " > var timerB = timerB ( 100 ) ; var secondsB = Math.floor ( timerB / 1000 ) ; var secsModTenB = Math.floor( secondsB % 10 ) ; </ script >
The script header tells the Flapjax compiler that the script code is in the Flapjax language .
The compiler converts this into pure JavaScript code , so that it can run on standard browsers without any plugins .
Notice how the definitions resemble regular JavaScript code , with the sole exception of the use of behaviors .
Having created such definitions , we can now use them in our pages .
For instance , we could ask whether the current system time , in seconds , is even or odd :
< p >
The current system time is {! (( secondsB % 2 === 0 ) ? " even " : " odd " ) !}. </ p>
Or , suppose in a separate JavaScript script tag we had defined the function arrayToString .
We could apply this function to a behavior inside Flapjax :
< p >
The list of time modulo 10 elements is {! arrayToString( oneToN(secsModTenB ) ) !}. </ p>
Again , see how it runs .
Notice how arrayToString , even though written in JavaScript , automatically works over behaviors , and does the right thing : it recomputes a fresh array as the time changes every second .
This process , of making a function written in JavaScript operate over behaviors , is called lifting : it ``lifts '' the function from operating over JavaScript values to operating over Flapjax behaviors .
The Flapjax compiler performs lifting for you automatically , so you should rarely , if ever , have to encounter it yourself .
If , however , you treat Flapjax simply as a JavaScript library ( which is a mode of operation we support ) , you 'll find yourself performing lifting explicitly .
The examples used in this introduction to behaviors warrant two disclaimers .
First , you probably should n't rush to uselessly display such timers on your Web pages : they remind people of the worst abuses of JavaScript from the 1990s , and will make your site unpopular .
Second , this tutorial has shown only excerpts of the full pages you see when you run the programs .
There is some missing code that you must write and some that you should write .
The must - write code creates a proper Web page and loads the Flapjax library .
The should - write code provides meaningful messages when the Web browser has disabled ( or does not support ) JavaScript .
You should read the annotated versions of the demos to understand these details .
At this point , you can either soldier on with the tutorial or you can stop to read the demos and create your own working Flapjax pages .
We suggest you consider doing the latter .
The joy of a programming language is that you can actually write programs in it .
As the tutorial 's examples get more complex , you 'll find it helpful ( if , occasionally , frustrating ) to be able to not only see what we present but to also tweak the examples and see what impact your changes have .
Altering Content Based on Behaviors
Think about the position of the mouse .
Whenever you look it has a value , but the value keeps changing .
If we write a program that makes some entity depend on the current position of the mouse , we'd want that entity to be updated whenever the mouse moves .
Fortunately , this is easy because the mouse position is another built - in Flapjax behavior .
Here 's an example that draws a text box at the current mouse position .
The code looks a little dense , but it 's actually quite simple once you parse it :
< div id =" themouse " style={!
{color : '# FFFFFF ' , backgroundColor : ' # 000000 ' , position : ' absolute ' , left : mouseLeftB( document ) , top : mouseTopB ( document ) , padding : ' 10 p x ' } !} > the mouse </div >
This creates a div element and sets its style .
The most important attributes are left and top , which are set to be those of the mouse .
But because Flapjax provides these as behaviors , the values of the style setting update automatically , moving the box to follow the mouse .
See the mouse move .
The example above employs a syntactic convenience implemented by the Flapjax compiler .
Inside the delimiters , the expression has the form { ... } .
This syntax creates a literal object in JavaScript .
A object is just an aggregate that maps names to values ; an HTML style is also just an aggregate that maps names to values .
When a Flapjax expression evaluates to an object , the delimiters therefore automatically splice the object into the context using the CSS attribute - value notation .
This shorthand makes it exceptionally easy to define an object containing behaviors and use these to manipulate style attributes of page entities .
( Note that the Flapjax expression can even evaluate to an object ; the example above is a special case , where the expression is syntactically an object . )
Now let 's add some complexity to this example .
Suppose our mouse has a somewhat lazy tail , which takes a little while to catch up with the rest of the mouse .
That is , the tail 's current position is where the mouse was a little while ago ; in other words , the tail 's position is a delayed version of the mouse 's position .
This is easy to express in Flapjax :
< div id =" tail " style={!
{ color : '# FF0000 ' , backgroundColor : '# 000000 ' , position : ' absolute ' , left : delayB ( mouseLeftB( document ) , DELAY ) + $ ( ' themouse ' ) .
offsetWidth , top : delayB ( mouseTopB ( document ) , DELAY ) , padding : ' 10 p x ' } !} > its tail !
</div>
The key expression is
delayB ( mouseLeftB( document ) , DELAY ) + $ ( ' themouse ' ) .
offsetWidth
The sub-expression on the left delays the mouse 's left position by some value given in the constant DELAY ( defined elsewhere ) , creating a new behavior .
The one on the right references the object on the current page whose whose CSS id is themouse , and computes its width .
The sum of these yields the new horizontal position of the mouse .
Watch the mouse 's tail follow it .
Now you should try to write more complex examples yourself .
For instance , suppose we want another segment of the tail that not only follows the rest of the mouse but also wags .
( Do the tails of mice wag ?
We do n't really know : a quick survey around the office was inconclusive . )
You may not succeed , but you 'll learn from the effort .
When you 're done , see all the code .
Once again , our lawyers have asked us to warn you that pages that gratuitously contain such behaviors are annoying , so please use them only when necessary or when you 're trying to annoy your users .
Reflecting Content as a Behavior
We 've seen how the content of a page can depend on a behavior , thereby updating when the behavior 's value changes .
We can go the other way , too : create a behavior that depends on the content of a page , so when the page 's content changes , so does the behavior .
( And if something else on the page depends on that behavior , it 'll update too ... and so forth . )
Suppose you have a form that contains a field whose content must be precisely three characters long .
It would be nice to use the border color of the field to indicate whether or not its content satisfies this constraint .
Notice that whether or not the constraint has been satisfied that is , the boolean value representing satisfaction depends on the current content of the form field ; the color of the border in turn depends on this boolean value .
Expressing all of these as behaviors ensures that the language automatically maintains the dependencies between them .
First , here 's the fragment of an HTML page that creates the field :
Enter a 3 character string : < input id =" textField1 " / >
We want to modify the border color attribute of the input field depending on whether or not the length of the field is correct .
The function extractValueB converts the value of an element on the page into a behavior .
Given this helpful function , the expression that determines the background color becomes
( extractValueB ( ' textField1 ' ) .
length === 3 ? ' green ' : ' red ' )
So all that 's left is to use this behavior to set the border color :
Enter a 3 character string : < input id =" textField1 " style={!
{ borderColor : ( extractValueB ( ' textField1 ') . length === 3 ? ' green ' : ' red ' ) } !}/>
This kind of inline expression is not always desirable , nor even always feasible :
It 's sometimes undesirable because it clutters the page , intermingling presentation with behavior .
It is often better to move the validation code into a script tag , so the HTML portion of the page remains unencumbered by scripting .
Indeed , because Flapjax provides the ability to convert page elements into behaviors , it 's easy to retroactively add scripting to named id s on a page without having to modify its HTML .
Some people recommend this strategy of employing unobtrusive JavaScript .
If you 're starved for buzzwords you can also think of this strategy as a kind of aspect - oriented programming , where the Flapjax script is advising the page , which is oblivious to Flapjax .
In this tutorial we 'll try to speak in plain English , though .

In this tutorial we 'll try to speak in plain English , though .
It may not be feasible because the constraints are not all local .
In the example above , the only constraint on the input field was its own length .
But in a more complex form , the constraints may be hierarchical or even mutually - dependent .
In such cases it becomes highly advisable to lift the scripting into a script tag .
That also makes it possible to define functions that capture common validation options ( such as checking for the length of a string using the appropriate comparison operator ) .
See the longer example , which demonstrates these concepts .
If you have prior experience programming in JavaScript , you will find it instructive to compare the use of Flapjax ( whether in Flapjax syntax or in raw JavaScript syntax ) to having to program the same behavior entirely using callbacks .
Intermezzo : The Spreadsheet Grew Up
Since we 're catering to multiple audiences , we sometimes digress into more conceptual material .
You can always spot a digression because it's in a separate section labeled as an intermezzo ( such as this one ) .
If all you want is the nitty - gritty of programming in the language you can safely ignore these digressions , but if you want to understand how it relates to other topics in programming , you may find these enlightening .
Of course , you can always skip the intermezzos in your early readings and come back to them later .
Spreadsheets are a good idea .
Not in the sense that it 's fun to spend all day crunching numbers arranged in rows and columns ; rather , in the sense that they let you express dependencies between cells , then automatically perform the ``heavy lifting '' of propagating these dependencies .
They are , in some respect , the ultimate kind of declarative programming language , but without any associated religious cult .
Behaviors are essentially the natural extension of the spreadsheet model , generalized in two respects :
You can program over arbitrary data , not just numbers and a few other impoverished datatypes .
You do n't have to write everything in a grid and use an unscaleable naming convention .
Instead , expression A depends on the value of expression B if B is a sub-expression of A ( which includes B being an argument to a method and A being the method invocation , or even B being an expression in a method that A invokes ) .
If you do need to name an expression , you can employ the naming power of JavaScript , which includes not only variable names but also array indices , objects fields , and so forth .
Just pick the one that works best for your needs .
That said , behaviors are still in the spreadsheet mould of expressing dependencies and letting the language sort out the propagation of values .
Like most spreadsheets , Flapjax has optimizations to avoid wasteful computation ; unlike most spreadsheets , Flapjax has mechanisms to handle quite sophisticated dependencies including mutual references ( which often arise in programming visual user interfaces ) .
One way of view Flapjax , then , is that it tries to reconcile two important programming styles that have needlessly been in conflict : declarative and imperative programming .
Imperative programs often put too much book - keeping burden on the programmer ; where the programmer fails , the program generates errors owing to inconsistencies .
In contrast , traditional declarative programming forces programmers into a straightjacket that sometimes even ignores the presence of imperative effects in real - world data and systems .
In contrast to both of these , Flapjax fully embraces mutation behaviors are entirely built around the existence of mutation but encourages programmers to describe their systems declaratively , pushing the burden of propagating these changes through the declarative specification onto the language .
In short , Flapjax programs tend to be declarative specifications over imperative data .
Discrete Streams
The time , the position of the mouse , the content of a field : these all have a value continuously , i.e. , at all points in time .
It 's just that the value may change during observation , so all expressions dependent on these values must have their values updated to keep the system in a consistent state .
Flapjax automates the updating of these values .
This is the essence of behaviors .
Now consider the following phenomena : the clicks of a mouse , the keystrokes at a keyboard , or the arrival of network packets .
These are discrete .
Over time there may be any number of values , perhaps even infinitely many , but a value may not arrive just when we look ; in fact , there may never be a value ever again ( if , for instance , the connection was unplugged ) .
This is especially typical of the communication patterns of external devices .
Because they are discrete , and because there is n't always a ``current '' value , behaviors are a poor model for these phenomena .
We do n't want to poll for values because this may cause the system to pause indefinitely .
Instead , we want the arrival of a new value on this discrete stream to push computation through the rest of the system , updating dependencies and keeping the system consistent .
In Flapjax , we refer to such streams as event streams .
Programming with event streams is a little different from programming with behaviors .
A behavior masquerades as an ordinary JavaScript object whose content just happens to change automatically .
In contrast , an event stream is a new kind of value , with new primitives for programming over it .
Let 's start with a very simple example : given an input box , we want a program that prints the length of the string in that box .
We can write this in terms of behaviors , but it is conceptually clean to also think of each keystroke as an event , and of wanting to only update the value when an event occurs .
The program first creates a text box :
Text buffer : < input type =" text " id =" toLength " ></ input >
The program then uses extractValueE to create an event stream reflecting all events associated with this text box .
( In practice , this stream includes not only keystrokes but also tabbing and other activities .
extractValueE takes additional arguments that help refine the set of events . )
We want to then transform this event stream into a series of strings representing the length :
< p > Length : {! extractValueE ( 'toLength ' ) . mapE ( function ( s ) {return s.length ; } ) !} < p >
The method mapE iterates the supplied function over the given event stream , generating a transformed event stream as its output .
In this case , it iterates the event stream of the string in the toLength entity into a stream of the lengths of the strings .
For a second example , suppose we have a text box and we want to save the box 's content as a draft .
This requires a server on which to save it .
We 're only describing client - side programming for now we 'll get to servers in a bitso for the moment , let 's focus on how to program the client - side functionality .
The Web page contains a text box , a button to click on to save drafts , and space to indicate when the draft was last ``saved ' ' :
Last Saved : < span id=' savedTime '></ span > < form > < textarea id='theText '></textarea > < br > < input type=' button ' id=' saveButton ' value= ' Save Now '></input > </ form >
Every time the user clicks on the button , we want the time to update ( and , in a future version of this program , the content to be saved on a server ) .
First we 'll create variables that represent the different DOM objects in the page ( the `D ' suffix helps us remember that these are references to DOM objects ) :
< script type =" text / flapjax " > var textD = $ ( ' theText ' ) ; var saveD = $ ( ' saveButton ' ) ; var savedTimeD = $ ( ' savedTime ' ) ; ... </ script >
Now we want to extract the event stream of button clicks ; every time there 's a click , we want to update the time of last save :
var saveClickE = extractEventE ( saveD , ' click ' ) ; var savedTimeE = saveClickE.mapE( getTime ) ; insertValueE ( savedTimeE , savedTimeD , ' textContent ' ) ;
getTime
< script type =" text / javascript " > var getTime = function ( _ ) { var date = new Date ( ) ; return date.toLocaleString ( ) ; } </ script >
whereis a JavaScript function :
Watch this run .
You notice that there 's something rather unsatisfactory about it : it only registers drafts when the user clicks the button , which means a user immersed in their work who forgets to click may lose their draft .
Instead , we 'd like to use a timer that periodically saves the text :
var autoSaveE = timerE ( 100 ) ; var savedTimeE = autoSaveE.mapE( getTime ) ; insertValueE ( savedTimeE , savedTimeD , ' textContent ' ) ;
While this is much better , this is n't quite right , either : now the auto - save happens only when the timer fires .
What we 'd really like is an auto - save feature that saved both when the user clicks and when the timer fires .
That is , given an event stream corresponding to the timer and another corresponding to the user 's clicks , we 'd like one that merges these two to form a unified trigger for saving drafts .
This is precisely what the Flapjax operator mergeE does :
var saveClickE = extractEventE ( saveD , ' click ' ) ; var autoSaveE = timerE ( 10000 ) ; var saveE = mergeE ( saveClickE , autoSaveE ) ; var savedTimeE = saveE.mapE( getTime ) ; insertValueE ( savedTimeE , savedTimeD , ' textContent ' ) ;
Be sure to study the full code .
Intermezzo : Contrasting Behaviors and Event Streams
Event streams and behaviors offer complementary views of the world .
It is easy , however , to overstate their differences .
Given an initial value , every event stream can be converted into a behavior : the behavior always has the value of the last event to have arrived on the stream , starting with the specified initial value until the first event arrives .
Likewise , every behavior can be converted into an event stream : when the behavior 's value changes , send the new value as an event .
These conversions are handy enough that Flapjax provides them as primitive functions called startsWith and changes , respectively .
( These are not the sole means of converting between the two , only the most natural ones . )
Though some phenomena are more naturally thought of as one or the other , in some cases the same phenomenon can be thought of as either , depending on the context .
As a rule - of - thumb , use behaviors to represent internal state and when the computation that expresses a dependency between two values wo n't run for too long .
When the state is in some external medium , odds are the communications channel can be unpredictable , making event streams more suitable .
Similarly , if a computation has the potential to take too long and you may need to time it out , it 's better to use event stream and merge in timeout behavior , as we saw in the buffer draft saver example .
Dot Notation
Earlier we saw the following program :
( extractValueB ( ' textField1 ' ) .
length === 3 ? ' green ' : ' red ' )
. length
extractValueB
length
extractValueB ( ' textField1') .
length
Static Initialization
This fragment actually contains a small sleight - of - hand .
Notice the use of : we treated the result ofas if it were a regular object and dereferenced itsfield .
Not only is this perfectly legal in Flapjax , it behaves as you 'd expect : the value of the entire expressionis defined to be the length of that entity at all points in time , which means its value updates as the entity 's content updates .
As you may have noticed from some of the demo programs , we sometimes use the notation ||| ( which we pronounce  super - or ) .
This is associated with the {!
and !} delimiters .
Everything on the left of the super - or is the Flapjax code ; but because it may take some event to invoke this program , the right of the super - or specifies what HTML to use initially .
We call this the static initializer .
A static initializer is especially important when using event streams where the programmer cannot predict when the first event will occur , but it 's a good idea to provide one even when using behaviors .
Sometimes there may be a moment or two before the code on the page begins to execute .
More likely , though , if a static initializer appears in place of a behavior 's value after a few seconds , it often indicates a problem : either JavaScript has been disabled , or the library is not loading , or the program contains an error .
Obviously , static initialization is a linguisitic concept that exists even in the absence of templating syntax .
Every event stream supports the method startsWith to enable the programmer to provide the static initialization value .
Intermezzo :
Where are the Callbacks ?
If you 're experienced in JavaScript or in using GUI toolkits , and you 've been paying attention to the examples , you must have noticed an important absence : callbacks !
Whereas callbacks are the cornerstone of most traditional interactive and event - driven programming , the Flapjax style seems to be entirely devoid of them .
Why ?
Most programs can usefully be thought of as black - boxes that consume some input ( possibly an infinite stream of them ) and producing corresponding output ; that is , the output depends on the input .
The callback , however , is invoked by some application - independent part of the system ; it therefore reverses the natural order of dependency .
The problem is even easier to see in a language with static type declarations : because the callback is invoked by an application - independent framework , it returns nothing ( or , at best , a generic status code ) .
As a result , a callback cannot compose with any other application - specific method .
The use of callbacks therefore forces the use of mutation and other imperative effects , even when these are not conceptually necessary .
There is still value to callbacks , primarily because they enable a data - driven style of computation .
That is , rather than the output constantly polling the input for data , the system can stay dormant until the input has fresh data to generate new output .
To keep this benefit , Flapjax evaluates its updates by pushing rather than pulling .
To summarize , while callbacks are a very useful programming mechanism and have a useful place in programming , their use often obscures important details of program structure .
For this reason , Flapjax programming style tries to avoid the use of callbacks .
We encourage you to give it a try .
It does sometimes force you to rethink your program structure , but invariably you 'll find this is making you think less about imperative operations and more about your underlying data models .
By thinking harder about the relationships between your data you write more declarative specifications , leaving more of the work of maintaining consistency to the language .
Be lazy : Larry Wall and Randal L Schwartz called it one of the ``three great virtues of a programmer ''!
Accessing Data from Foreign Servers
The security model of JavaScript prevents remote procedure call ( RPC ) requests from being made to sites other than the one where your page originated .
This makes it difficult to load data from other sites .
Several people have proposed a variety of techniques to work around this shortcoming .
One common technique relies on the following observation : even though you cannot make an RPC request to a different host , you can load the content of a JavaScript script tag from it .
The resulting JavaScript is then evaluated with the rest of the code on your page .
It can , for instance , therefore be a program that simply defines the datum you were trying to download .
For instance , the Web site del.icio.us offers a limited number of your bookmarks in this form .
Writing the code to perform this operation is laborious .
You have to first create a script , insert the reference to the remote site , wait for the data to download , and extract the resulting data .
The script binds the result to a fresh variable , so you would want to remove this variable from your namespace once you 've obtained its value .
If your page is interactive , you will need to do all this on a repeated basis .
Therefore , Flapjax provides a primitive that implements this behavior , and the primitive works over event streams ( natch ) .
Let 's consider the del.icio.us example concretely .
Connecting to a particular URL that includes the username of a del.icio.us user downloads JavaScript code which , when run , binds the variable Delicious to some of that user 's bookmarks .
The Flapjax interface to this mechanism is evalForeignScriptValE , which consumes an event stream of requests .
Suppose userName were a field in which the user entered a del.icio.us username :
var userNameChangeE = extractValueE('userName ' ) ; var deliciousUserLinksE = evalForeignScriptValE( {'url ' : ' http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/' + userNameChangeE , ' globalArg ' : ' Delicious'} ) ;
Every fresh username places a new value on the event stream , which leads to a fresh iteration of the remote site call .
Each time the Flapjax function extracts and returns the value bound to the named global argument , in this case Delicious .
Run the program .
Observe that an event stream is the natural argument to this Flapjax function .
Even though event streams and behaviors are interchangeable , we want to think of connecting to a foreign Web site as a discrete activity rather than a continuous one .
Thus , even though it is natural to think of the value of the field as a behavior , we only want to connect to the foreign site when the value changes .
Indeed , this is a case where it is simply not clear what it would mean for evalForeignScriptVal to consume a behavior instead of an event streamor , at the very least , how to be a good citizen of the Internet in the process .
Though we are not continuously connecting to the Internet , we are still connecting after every change .
This leads to a slightly jerky interaction , and perhaps also fetches the bookmarks of usernames we were n't interested in .
Rather , it is more natural to connect only when the user pauses .
This is a sufficiently useful construction that Flapjax provides two useful functions for this purpose : filterRepeatsE and calmE .
The former eliminates duplicates from an event stream .
The latter takes an additional argument , a duration , and only releases the latest event when the duration has elapsed and no new event has occurred .
Putting these together :
var deliciousUserLinksE = evalForeignScriptValE( {'url ' : ' http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/' + calmE( filterRepeatsE(userNameChangeE ) , 450 ) , ' globalArg ' : ' Delicious'} ) ;
Run the revised program .
This is all quite a bit of fun , so we can't warn you strongly enough that it's also very dangerous : you 're downloading code from a random Web site and running it right within your browser !
( We do n't even need lawyers to tell you this .
Just thinking about it is enough to turn us into lawyers . )
You really , really do n't want to do this until you have good reason to trust the remote site .
Even then , you should carefully examine the code they 're generating .
And even then , you should check it repeatedly because it may change in ways you find undesirable .
And even if you do that , your classical education has taught you to keep in mind Bertrand Russell 's chicken .
That 's not all .
Flapjax offers much more to enable you to program over Web services .
Take a look at Yaggle , a client - side mashup that uses Yahoo !'s local services directory in conjunction with Google 's mapping capability .
The key to this mashup is the Flapjax primitive getWebServiceObjectE , which simplifies the process of both constructing the service call and , even more usefully , parsing the response by converting XML responses into JSON .
Server - Side Persistence
Let 's go back to the draft saver .
Obviously this is only useful if we can store drafts on an actual server , and access it at a later date .
Flapjax provides a server where you can save your data !
Because the server conceptually stores Flapjax values , it automatically propagates changes to these values to all clients accessing them .
( In practice , of course , the Web makes it difficult to implement such an interface , so for now clients work by polling the server .
As Web standards evolve , Flapjax will exploit them without you , the programmer , having to rewrite your code . )
To make a value persistent , we must specify do three things .
First , we should give the value a place to reside on the server , akin to a filename .
Second , we should specify how we want to initialize and subsequently read the value from the server .
Third , we must specify how to write changes to the server .
This separation proves to be quite flexible , and lets us implement a range of policies depending on our needs .
Concretely , recall that the draft was stored in an element labeled the Text .
We should initialize the draft with its contents from the last time we edited it , which we do as follows :
< textarea id='theText ' value={! readPersistentObject( {path : [ ' draftFT ' ] , initial : ''} ) !}/>
We could , of course , have chosen to not read the value that was previously there .
The initial attribute simply indicates what value to use the very first time , before the persistent object has been created .
In addition , we must write changes back to the server .
This could n't be simpler : we just state where to store the value , and what to store there .
In this case , every time there is a event on saveE we want to store the current value of the Text : that is , we want to snapshot the value of that field :
writePersistentObject(saveE.snapshot($ B( ' theText ' ) ) , {path : [ ' draftFT ' ] } ) ;
Finally , we have to initialize the server and load the appropriate libraries .
See the example for the minutiae .
Notice that you can run the application and open the same URL in two windows or frames ; you 'll eventually see changes in one propagate to the other .
Intermezzo : Is n't This Model - View - Controller ?
Software engineering textbooks love to tell you how you must use Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) , which is a useful but heavy - weight way to think about structuring an application .
Flapjax gives you MVC , but with a twist .
You want to think of the server as holding the model , and the client as implementing the view .
The controller is the annoying part : updating values , distributing updates , propagating updates , and so forth .
Flapjax is the glue that implements the controller for free .
It 's MVC without the bondage and discipline .
Conclusion
This concludes our tutorial on Flapjax .
Congratulations on making it this far !
There is more to the language , as you 'll learn from reading the documentation and building your own programs .

JUST IN TIME for “ google ” to become an official verb , my mother learned how to google .
About a week ago .
She figured it out herself even though , less than a year ago , she thought high - speed Internet access was strictly for impatient people , namely her adult children .
When she finally agreed to give up dial - up , it opened up a whole new world : googling .
And so last week , my mother decided to google , and for fun , she googled me .
Then she clicked on an essay I ’d written called “ 9 Tips for Surviving the Holidays at Your Republican Parents ’ Home . ”
It was published in the LA Weekly in 2004 .
The only newspapers to grace my parents ’ door are the San Diego Union - Tribune , the Wall Street Journal , the Catholic Digest and maybe , in a pinch , USA Today .
My father , a former football coach , used to hate the New York Times because it had no self - respecting sports page .
Now he just hates it for the liberal rag that it is , and he feels the same way about the Los Angeles Times .
So I figured I was safe writing a little 900 - word satire for the LA Weekly .
I mean , who of my parents ’ generation and political bent reads the Weekly ?
The bulk of my mother ’s e-mails are forwards on moms or kids or dogs or jokes or Erma Bombeck ’s purple hat musings .
I never dreamed she would venture to Google and happen upon the piece in which I liberally trash Bill O’Reilly , Rush Limbaugh , box wine and the holidays .
Now my mother is no longer speaking to me .
Advertisement
My last e-mail from her was something like this : “ I googled you and found ‘ How to Survive the Holidays With Your Republican Parents . ’
Why did n’t you share that one ? ”
Why indeed ?
In my guilt , I ’ve sent them summer reading and care packages .
But they are silent .
They are hurt .
They go out of their way to make Christmas special with feasts , presents , highballs -- and their ungrateful daughter mocks their politics and religion .
So I do n’t blame them .
I would n’t speak to me either .
The very first time my mother found something egregious I ’d written was in 1987 , and dark days ensued .
I was living with my brand - new husband in my parents ’ basement .
During that time , I finished a terrible play that featured a domineering mother who ropes her daughter into moving in with the grandparents , who are in failing health , while she flees to live the good life .
And I had the gall / lack of imagination to set it in my grandparents ’ home in Leavenworth , Kan .
My mother found the play , read it and recognized every insidious detail , from the Reader ’s Digest Condensed Books to the frozen OJ cans stuffed with fast - food condiments and A &W ; 's two - for - one Chili - Dog Tuesdays .

It struck a nerve .
Me ( strangled ) : I have to write about what I know !
Mother ( devastated ) : Ha !
What do you even think you know ?
Me : What do you think Tennessee Williams and Eugene O’Neill wrote about ?
Advertisement
Mother :
Well , all I have to say is that you put yourself in VERY HIGH COMPANY , MISSY !
The fight disintegrated into slinging accusations and huffy silence .
My father said to her : “ If you do n’t want her to write about you , do n’t talk to her , because that ’s what writers do .
They write down what we say . ”
My mother shrieked at him , “ How do you know what writers do ? ”
Advertisement
“ Well , I do n’t exactly , but I guess that ’s what they do , and we ’ve got one in the family , ” my father replied .
Now I ’m nearly the same age as my mother when she read the lousy play , and I ’ve written many stories , books , plays and articles since that time .
Plenty have focused on the politics and religion in my family , but I ’ve never shared a single story that I thought would cause pain to my parents .
But the vitriol of talk radio and talking - head TV and the ghosts of Rush and Bill lingering at the holidays over the years has been painful .
So the lively discussions and / or shouting matches tattooed themselves on my brain , and I wrote down many of them to try to figure how it happened .
We grew up on sportsmanship and a positive attitude .
Whining was n’t tolerated .
Kids who whined got to vacuum , so we learned to “ suck it up . ”
Politics were n’t discussed when real life was about beating Nebraska or Alabama , but it was a understood that we were Catholics and Democrats , in that order .

It was only when my father retired and Limbaugh and O’Reilly took to the airwaves that my parents became steadfast Republicans , and their newfound fervor for the right was served up along with the turkey .
Without politics and religion , my parents are the most wonderful , generous and gracious people , but throw in politics and it ’s time to duck behind the yucca tree .
Mother finally called a moratorium on all politics at the holidays after my husband parodied Fox News in a puppet show , igniting a fury -- a wine glass flung , buttons ripped , children rushing from the room .
And so I ’ve written down the talk in fiction , drama and essay .
I ’ve written it down to understand it ... maybe to exorcise the demons .
It was n’t to humiliate or hurt them .
It was n’t to attack them .
It was n’t even for their eyes , but Mother found it anyway , googling .
I think I ’ll send roses next .
Muy Crudo
“ Where ’s Luis ? ” I ask Miguel , one of the restaurants many bus boys .
“ My party ’s gonna be here any minute and the tables not set up . ”
“ I do n’t know , ” Miguel says .
“ Rolando , ” I ask , turning to our fabulous Chileno busser .
“ Do you know where Luis is ? ”
“ I think he ’s in the bathroom , ” Rolando replies .
“ He do n’t look so good . ”
“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
“ Probably borracho , ” Rolando says , shrugging .
“ Lovely . ”
I walk over to the staff bathroom .
The unmistakable perfume of expelled stomach fluid is hanging in the air .
I give the door a sharp knock .
“ Luis ! ” I call out .
“ You all right ? ”
“ Si , ” a hoarse voice replies weakly .
“ Twenty people coming .
We ’ve got to finish setting up . ”
“ Un momento por favor , ” Luis groans over the sound of a flushing toilet .
“ Un momento . ”
After a minute the door opens and the bus boy stumbles out .
Usually a handsome twenty - year old kid , today Luis looks like the pickled worm from a bottle of cheap tequila .
“ Luis , ” I say , “ You look like mierda . ”
“ Muy crudo , ” Luis says , wiping the cold clammy sweat off his forehead .
“ Muy crudo . ”
“ Hungover huh ? ” I laugh .
“ Too much cerveza last night ? ”
“ Tequila , ” Luis groans .
“ That shit will fuck you up kid . ”
“ Oh my God , ” Luis says .
“ You ’ll be OK Luis , ” I say with mock cheerfulness .
“ And you ’ve only got a twelve hour day ahead of you . ”
“ Oh my God , ” Luis repeats , his voice becoming desperate .
“ I need to go home . ”
“ You think the owners gonna let you go home ? ” I ask .
“ No , ” Luis says sheepishly .
“ Neither do I .
You ’re hangover , not dying .
You ’ll be fine in a little bit . ”
“ Heyyyy , ” Rolando calls from the back room .
“ Your party ’s here . ”
“ Let ’s go Luis , ” I say , pulling on his arm .
“ We ’ve got to finish setting up . ”
As Luis and I travel the back corridor connecting the kitchen to the party room Miguel starts taunting him .
“ Hey Luis , ” Miguel shouts , his voice dripping with gleeful mockery , “ You spend all your money on tequila last night ? ”
“ Shut up , ” Luis snaps .
“ Buying the ladies drinks ?
They dance with you ? ”
Luis flips Miguel the bird .
“ Siempre borracho , ” Miguel says , shaking his head .
“ You always drunk . ”
Once were out of range of Miguel ’s hearing I ask , “ Is that true Luis ? ”
“ What ? ”
Siempre borracho ?
“ I go out man , ” Luis says .
“ The ladies are there .
Sometimes I drink too much . ”
“ Pace yourself next time , ” I suggest .
“ Drink till you ’re mellow then stop .
Its all downhill from there . ”
“ You ’re right man , ” Luis says .
“ I ’ll try that next time . ”
“ Do you have a headache ? ” I ask .
“ Si . A big one . ”
“ When we ’re done setting up for this party I want you to drink lots of water . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ You ’re probably dehydrated . ”
“ Dehydrated ? ” Luis asks , not understanding the word .
“ What ’s that ? ”
“ Deshidratado , ” I reply .
“ Necesita mucho agua . ”
“ OK . ”
I smile inwardly .
When I was Luis age I must ’ve upchucked my body weight in vomit a hundred times .
Like many people , I made alcohols acquaintance during my freshman year of college .
Since I was in the seminary , and we seminarians thought our tastes were clerical and sophisticated , I got trashed on Scotch whisky while the normal dorm kids were shot gunning Meisterbraus and puking up Bartles and James .
( Remember that stuff ? )
Too say I got borracho would be an understatement .
I can still remember the feel of cold porcelain against my cheek as I hugged a filthy toilet bowl and prayed for death .
Ah yes , I was very sophisticated .
“ I ’ve been there man , ” I say , patting Luis on the shoulder .
“ You ’ll be OK . ”
“ I hope so . ”
Luis and I finish setting up and he somehow survives the party .
As we move into the dinner shift Luis color starts returning .
By seven o’clock he appears to be fully recovered .
At midnight , our double shift finally over , Luis and I pack up and walk out the front door .
With fresh money burning a hole in his pocket Luis goes to a nearby tavern to traumatize his liver all over again .
I feel like saying something but I can’t .
He ’s a young man and he needs to learn his from his own mistakes .
I just hope he does n’t do something stupid and get into trouble .
Besides , I ca n’t judge him .
We ’ve all been sinners in the hands of an angry porcelain god .
Researchers find great value in gossip / Spreading tales of others ' misdeeds helps arrest offensive behaviors
Juicy gossip moves so quickly -- He did what ?
She has pictures ? --
that few people have time to cover their ears , even if they want to .
" I heard a lot in the hallway , on the way to class , " said Mady Miraglia , 35 , a high school history teacher in Los Gatos , speaking about a previous job where she got a running commentary from fellow teachers on the sexual peccadilloes and classroom struggles of her colleagues .
" To be honest , it made me feel better as a teacher to hear others being put down , " she said .
" I was out there on my own , I had no sense of how I was doing in class , and the gossip gave me some connection .
And I felt like it gave me status , knowing information , being on the inside . "
Gossip has long been dismissed by researchers as little more than background noise , self - serving blather that serves no useful function .
But some investigators now say it belongs front and center in any study of group interaction .
People find gossip irresistible for good reason :
It not only helps clarify and enforce the rules that keep people working well together , studies suggest , but it circulates crucial information about the behavior of others that cannot be published in an office manual .
As often as it sullies reputations , psychologists say , gossip offers a foothold for newcomers in a group and a safety net for group members who feel in danger of falling out .
" There has been a tendency to denigrate gossip as sloppy and unreliable " and unworthy of serious study , said David Sloan Wilson , a professor of biology and anthropology at the State University of New York at Binghamton .
" But gossip appears to be a very sophisticated , multifunctional interaction which is important in policing behaviors in a group and defining group membership . "
When two or more people huddle to share inside information about another person who is absent , they are often spreading important news and enacting a mutually protective ritual that may have evolved from early grooming behaviors , some biologists argue .
Long - term studies of Pacific Islanders , American middle - school children and residents of rural Newfoundland and Mexico , among others , have confirmed that the content and frequency of gossip are universal : People devote anywhere from a fifth to two - thirds or more of their daily conversation to gossip , and men appear to be just as eager for the skinny as women .
Sneaking , lying and cheating among friends or acquaintances make for the most savory material , of course , and most people pass on their best nuggets to at least two other people , surveys find .
This grapevine branches out through almost every social group , and it functions , in part , to keep people from straying too far outside the group 's rules , written and unwritten , social scientists find .
In one recent experiment , Wilson led a team of researchers who asked a group of 195 men and women to rate their approval or disapproval of several situations in which people talked behind the back of a neighbor .
In one , a rancher complained to other ranchers that his neighbor had neglected to fix a fence , allowing cattle to wander and freeload .
The report was accurate , and the students did not disapprove of the gossip .
But men in particular , the researchers found , strongly objected if the rancher chose to keep mum about the fence incident .
" Plain and simple , he should have told about the problem to warn other ranchers , " wrote one study participant , expressing a common sentiment that , in this case , a failure to gossip put the group at risk .
" We 're told we 're not supposed to gossip , that our reputation plummets , but in this context there may be an expectation that you should gossip :
You 're obligated to tell , like an informal version of the honor code at military academies , " Wilson said .
Given this protective group function , gossiping too little may be at least as risky as gossiping too much , some psychologists say .
Knowing that your boss is cheating on his wife , or that a sister - in - law has a drinking problem or a rival has benefited from a secret trust fund may be enormously important , and in many cases change a person 's behavior for the better .
" We all know people who are not calibrated to the social world at all , who if they participated in gossip sessions would learn a whole lot of stuff they need to know and can't learn anywhere else , like how reliable people are , how trustworthy , " said Sarah Wert , a psychologist at Yale .
" Not participating in gossip at some level can be unhealthy , and abnormal . "
I 've been trying to learn Haskell lately , and the hardest thing seems to be learning about monads .
" Monads in Ruby " and " Monads for Functional Programming " helped me finally to break the ice , but more importantly , they gave me a glimpse behind the veil .
I finally began to understand something that is trivial to people such as Philip Wadler , but something that never had been explained to me so succinctly .
In computer science , we enjoy using mathematic models , but the science still works if you violate the math .
And , much to the dismay of purely functional programming enthusiasts , we almost always do .
However , when we embrace the math , sometimes the loss in flexibility is more than compensated for by the increase in functionality .
Monads as a Design Pattern Somewhere , somebody is going to hate me for saying this , but if I were to try to explain monads to a Java programmer unfamiliar with functional programming , I would say : " Monad is a design pattern that is useful in purely functional languages such as Haskell .
Although the concept of a monad has been taken from mathematics , this design pattern can be applied in Haskell to implement a wide range of features . "
Philip Wadler says , " Monads provide a convenient framework for simulating effects found in other languages , such as global state , exception handling , output , or non-determinism . "
The Java programmer could argue fairly , " Hey , Java has all those things , and monads are n't even mentioned in Design Patterns .
What 's the deal ? "
I 'd respond : " Design patterns fluctuate by language .
Just as each language has its own set of native features , it also has its own set of both idioms and design patterns that make sense within that language ; naturally , there 's a lot of crossover between similar languages .
So although I do n't expect monads will be the next great thing in Java , they 're a necessary part of understanding Haskell . " [ see Footnote 1 ]
The Java programmer might continue , " By why would I care about Haskell , especially if I have to learn about this whole monad thing , simply to do the things I already know how to do in Java ? "
I 'd slyly say : Have you been paying attention to the The International Conference on Functional Programming Contest over the last several years ?
It 's one of the largest programming contests of the year , and it 's often mentioned on Slashdot .
Users of any language may enter , and a wide variety of languages are routinely used by the contestants .
During the last several years , the winners of the ICFP Programming Contest were mostly Haskell , OCaml and Dylan programmers , all of which are functional programming languages .
Learning new things occasionally can be painful .
Someone once said , " If a programming language does n't teach you a new way to think about problems , it 's not worth learning . "
I 've found that learning about monads and Haskell in general has both been painful and rewarding .
A Trivial Introduction to Monads Both Wikipedia and " Monads for Functional Programming " offer introductions to monads from a category - theoretic perspective , but they are n't for the faint of heart .
Despite having a degree in math , I found that it took a while for me to grasp what was going on .
Perhaps I 'm rusty , but I think a simpler explanation is possible .
" Monad " is an interface .
For any type " < InnerValueType > " ( notice the template - ish syntax ) , a class " MonadExample " that implements the " Monad " interface has the following two methods :
It has a constructor with a parameter named " value " of type " InnerValueType " .
It has a method named " pass " that takes a callback .
The callback must accept a parameter of type " InnerValueType " , also named " value " .
It must return an instance of " MonadExample " .
[ see Footnote 2 ]
The " pass " method invokes the callback , passes " value " and immediately returns the result .
Whacky interface , eh ?
It may help if you start by thinking of monads as a special type of container .
Just as " List < Integer > " makes sense , so should " MonadExample < InnerValueType > " .
Some classes that implement the Monad interface always contain exactly one value .
Others might contain zero or more values , as List < Integer > does .
Continuing , let 's imagine a simple function " f ( ) " that accepts a value and returns another .
Now , instead of simply passing around values , let 's wrap the values in monads and pass around the monads .
To use the function f( ) on that value , you must call the monad 's " pass " method .
Doing so , you suddenly get two benefits .
First , you can put a lot of other stuff in the monad besides the value .
Second , you can do whatever you want when someone calls the pass method .
For example , you can keep track of how many times it was called .
What 's even more interesting is you can pass different objects to f( ) ; each implements the Monad interface .
Per polymorphism , they can do totally different things , and f( ) does n't have to know or care .
In Java , this behavior is not novel -- any method may have side effects .
But , in a language such as Haskell , side effects are strictly forbidden ; functions should take values and return values .
Use of the monad , in such a language , enables you to make use of side effects where otherwise impossible .
An Example Philip Wadler has written several papers detailing how monads can be used to implement a variety of language features in a purely functional programming language , such as Haskell .
This article barely scratches at the surface .
However , I 'd like to offer one example that is somewhat interesting .
The " Maybe " class implements the Monad interface .
The Maybe class has two states : it either can contain a real value or it can contain nothing .
It 's a fairly common cause of bugs in a lot of languages to end up with NULL in a place you were n't expecting it .
Sometimes NULL is a valid value in some parts of the code , and sometimes that NULL escapes into code not expecting NULL .
The Maybe monad " captures " this behavior in a way that is useful , easy to understand and verifiable at compile time in Haskell .
This may be of interest to anyone who 's stumbled across such a bug .
[ see Footnote 3 ]
At this point , the reader may be begging for some code .
One of the hardest things about learning Haskell is you can't understand Haskell without understanding monads , and you can't understand most of the monad examples without understanding Haskell .
Hence , here 's the Maybe example in Python : class Maybe : def __init__ ( self , value=None ) : self.value = value def __repr__( self ) : return " Maybe ( %s ) " % self.value def pass_to( self , callback ) : # " pass " is a keyword , so I 've used the name " pass_to " .
if self.value is None : return Maybe( None ) return callback ( self.value ) def add ( left_monad , right_monad ) : monad_class = left_monad.__class__ #
This strange indentation is perhaps more readable .
return left_monad.pass_to(lambda left_value : ( right_monad.pass_to( lambda right_value : ( monad_class ( left_value + right_value ) ) ) ) ) n 1 = Maybe ( 5 ) n2 = Maybe ( 6 ) n3 = Maybe( None ) print n1 , " + " , n2 , " = " , add ( n1 , n2 ) # => Maybe ( 5 ) + Maybe ( 6 ) = Maybe ( 11 ) print n2 , " + " , n3 , " = " , add ( n2 , n3 ) # => Maybe ( 6 ) + Maybe( None ) = Maybe( None )
Here the same example in JavaScript : function Maybe( value ) { this .value = value ; } Maybe.prototype.constructor = Maybe ; Maybe.prototype.pass = function ( maybe , callback ) { if ( maybe.value == null ) { return new Maybe ( null ) ; } return callback ( maybe.value ) ; } Maybe.prototype.toString = function ( ) { return " Maybe ( " + this.value + " ) " ; } function add ( leftMonad , rightMonad ) { //
Pass leftMonad and function taking leftValue .
return leftMonad.pass( leftMonad , function ( leftValue ) { //
Pass rightMonad and function taking rightValue .
return rightMonad.pass( rightMonad , function ( rightValue ) { //
Return the resulting monad .
leftValue and // rightValue are accessible via a closure .
return new leftMonad.constructor( leftValue + rightValue ) ; } ) } ) ; } n1 = new Maybe ( 5 ) ; n2 = new Maybe ( 6 ) ; n3 = new Maybe ( null ) ; document .
write ( n1 + " + " + n2 + " = " + add ( n1 , n 2 ) + " < br > " ) ; // => Maybe ( 5 ) + Maybe ( 6 ) = Maybe ( 11 ) document .
write ( n2 + " + " + n3 + " = " + add ( n2 , n3 ) + " < br > " ) ; // => Maybe ( 6 ) + Maybe ( null ) = Maybe( null )
A few things deserve note :
To implement this , your language must support closures .
The " add " function works with any monad .
That 's part of the beauty of monads .
All the knowledge about Maybe was encapsulated in the Maybe class ( Python ) or prototype ( JavaScript ) .
The successively nested anonymous functions used in the add function are perhaps a bit difficult to understand , but this is a literal translation of how it would work in Haskell .
Fortunately , Haskell has syntactic sugar that makes this style programming very easy to read .
It 's fair to say that the translation into either Python or JavaScript is a bit awkward in comparison .
What 's Up with All the Math ?
If you read either Wikipedia 's or Philip Wadler 's introduction to monads for functional programming , you may wonder , " what 's up with all the math ? "
Why is it that computer scientists feel compelled to justify things mathematically before they feel comfortable using them as techniques in computer science ?
Sure , early computer scientists were mostly mathematicians , but is the connection really so crucial ?
I can think of three reasons : Mathematicians are trained to base their work on previous work .
Euclid taught us how to create chaos out of definitions , postulates and common notions .
If you base your work on an existing body of work that already has been scrutinized via proof , you reasonably can assume that things probably will turn out better .
If you can prove that your work meets certain criteria , you can let the math do a lot of the work for you .
For instance , if you can prove that your code implements a true monad , everything else you know about monads will " just work " .
At the risk of stating the obvious , mathematical models are n't perfect .
If you add two cups of one substance to two cups of another substance , you might end up with four cups because 2+2=4 - - or you might end up with an explosion .
Obviously , the model must fit the facts , not the other way around .
Only then can you use the model to try to ascertain additional facts .
What Happens If You Start Ignoring the Math ?
The idea of a function in computer science comes from the Lambda Calculus .
What happens if you start ignoring the math ?
C already fails to comply with Lambda Calculus because of the side effects , but let 's take it further .
Imagine a version of C called C ' that passes all arguments by reference instead of by value and has no return statement .
Hence , when you call a function , you can pass a bunch of arguments ( note , some of those arguments might contain only junk values ) .
The function itself uses some of those parameters to do something .
Then it may , as a side effect , change some of the parameters .
Because the arguments are passed by reference , the function is really changing the caller 's variables : /* Increment x. */ void inc( int * x ) { ( * x ) ++ ; } /* ... */ int x = 5 ; inc( &x ) ;
We suddenly have a language with no return values and only side effects .
Nonetheless , it 's easy to see that any program in C easily can be translated into C '.
Furthermore , it'd be easy to write a pure Lambda Calculus programming language in C '.
C ' still would be a useful language if you had nothing else .
Next , let 's consider the associative nature of integers : ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c )
In languages that permit operator overloading , such as C++ , Python and Haskell , you can implement the " + " operator for objects .
There 's nothing in the compiler that forces you to make + associative .
Of course , it 's usually foolish to implement + in a way that is n't associative , but there 's nothing stopping you .
Similarly , in Haskell , you can declare that a type is a member of the type class " monad " -- that is , it implements the interface -- even if your type does n't mathematically qualify as a monad .
I 'm sure that you can expect bad behavior , in some manner or another .
But as intelligent as Haskell compilers are , they wo n't stop you ( which is mentioned here ) .
Why the Universe Wo n't Come Crashing Down If You Violate the Identity Principle To belabor the point in the interest of humor , consider the identity principle : a thing must equal itself .
My buddy , Leon Atkinson , use to jokingly argue with me that " Nothing makes sense if you violate the identity principle " .
Well , observe : $ python >>> class A : ... def __eq__( self , other ) : ... return False ... >>> a = A( ) >>>
a == a False Notice that the universe did n't cease to exist .
I did n't get a core dump or even an exception .
I bet if I embedded this naughty class in some dark corner of my Python program , and never made use of it , my program would run .
Now consider that in SQL , " NULL " can best be translated as " nothing " ; it 's not FALSE , 0 or " " .
Observe the identity principle in SQL : mysql > SELECT FALSE = FALSE ; +---------------+
| FALSE = FALSE | +---------------+ | 1 | +---------------+ 1 row in set ( 0.06 sec ) mysql > SELECT NULL = NULL ; +-------------+
| NULL = NULL | +-------------+
| NULL | +-------------+ 1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) Notice that NULL does not equal NULL .
This leads to my point :
In computer science , nothing [ still ] makes sense [ even ] if you violate the identity principle .
Why Less Is More Okay , so what ?
Should we forsake our math background ?
Is purely functional programming a lame holdover from a bunch of bitter mathematicians ?
If it works , it works .
Right ?
No. Sometimes less is more .
In math , additional constraints on a set of elements may lead to more theorems that you can prove about that set of elements .
Sometimes being more restrictive about what code is allowed to do allows you to make assumptions that lead to optimizations .
Sometimes , entire new features can result .
Consider the bad old days of assembly programming .
As programs got larger , and as more pieces relied on one another , assembly programmers eventually discovered that you have to be pretty stringent about who gets to modify what .
These days , we 've learned to be rather controlling about which subroutines are allowed to modify which registers .
You can push and pop all you want , but by the time you leave a subroutine , the registers that are n't supposed to be changed better still have their original values intact .
Similarly , as we moved away from structs in C to objects in C++ , we started being a lot more strict about who could modify or even know about the internal structure of an object .
As soon as you break encapsulation and start poking around the inside of an object in code using that object , your own code becomes tied to the implementation of that object .
What seemed like freedom is really slavery .
Now , consider the order of evaluation of C function parameters .
Expert C programmers will know where I 'm going with this .
What does the following program print ?
# include < stdio.h > int * inc ( int * x ) { printf ( " %d
" , * x ) ; ( * x ) ++ ; return x ; } void printboth ( int x , int y ) { printf ( " x : %d , y : %d
" , x , y ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int x = 0 ; printboth ( * inc ( &x ) + 10 , * inc ( &x ) + 100 ) ; return 0 ; } The question comes down to which inc ( &x ) comes first .
I believe it 's actually part of the ANSI standard , although I could be wrong , that arguments are evaluated right to left : $ ./test 0 1 x : 12 , y : 101 Notice that y ends in 1 , whereas x ends in 2 .
Indeed , the y argument was evaluated first .
Can you guess what would get printed if you translated this code into Java ? [ see Footnote 4 ]
It makes me wonder , if a function 's side effects can't influence anything beyond the monad in a purely functional programming language such as Haskell , and if the programmer is completely in control of the monad , does that make the program easier to understand ?
If you do n't have to worry about the side effects of some random function that you did n't even write , do you get fewer bugs ?
As a further point , consider what " Joel on Software " reminds us of when explaining MapReduce , the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable [ see Footnote 5 ] : if a list of functions [ is n't ] allowed to have any side effects , you can safely call them all in parallel .
Considering how hard it is to make something thread safe , suddenly parallel programming in a functional programming language such as Haskell , Erlang or Alice seems a lot nicer !
Summary Purely functional programming languages such as Haskell are very strict in their approach to side effects .
Monads can be used to compensate for this strictness in order to implement a lot of the features we have come to take for granted in non-strict languages .
They can do this without compromising the strictness of the language as a whole .
Although staying true to an underlying mathematical model is n't fundamental to the continued existence of the universe , sometimes doing so can have substantial benefits .
Sometimes the ideas that are hard to understand and that seem overly restrictive can open up whole new worlds in the universe of computer science .

The gene helps sperm combine DNA with the egg's DNA
The HIRA gene is involved in the events necessary for the fertilisation that take place once a sperm enters an egg .
Faults in this gene might explain why some couples struggle to get pregnant despite having healthy sperm , say the researchers from the UK and France .
Although their work in Nature is based on fruit flies , the same genetic processes are present in humans .
A slight mutation in the HIRA gene means that life does not even get started
Lead researcher Dr Tim Karr
It may be worth screening infertile couples to see if they have a faulty version of HIRA , experts suggested .
Lead researcher Dr Tim Karr , from the University of Bath , said : " All sexually reproducing animals do the same kind of DNA ' dance ' when the DNA from the mother 's egg cell and the father 's sperm cell meet for the first time . "
When the sperm enters the egg , its DNA has to undergo a complete transformation so that it can properly join with the female DNA to form a genetically complete new life .
Re-packaging
Sperm makes this change by swapping the type of ' packing material , known as histone proteins , it contains .
The result is called the male pronucleus , which can then combine with the female pronucleus .
The process is controlled by the HIRA gene .
There may be a rationale for screening infertile couples for mutations in HIRA
Wolf Reik of the Babaraham Institute
Dr Karr , who worked alongside French scientists from Centre de Génétiqiue Moléculaire et Cellulaire , said : " A single gene , HIRA , looks after this re-packaging process , making it fundamental for those first 15 minutes in the regeneration of a new life .
" This is one of the most crucial process that takes place in sexually reproducing animals .
" A slight mutation in the HIRA gene means that life does not even get started . "
To understand the process better , the researchers studied a type of mutant female fruit fly , known to biologists as a sesame mutant , which they know produces eggs that do not allow a proper male pronucleus to form .
They found that HIRA is the gene responsible for chaperoning the assembly of the sperm pronucleus and if it is damaged in any way in the egg then fertilisation fails .
The research was funded by a Wolfson Royal Society Merit Award , the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the French Ministry of Research .
Wolf Reik of the Babaraham Institute said : " This is a really exciting discovery .
" This could indeed be an explanation for some types of infertility in humans ; if there were females that carried this mutation , they would not be able to conceive normally .
" There may be a rationale for screening infertile couples for mutations in HIRA in order to provide best counselling on infertility . "

A female advantage in the recognition of emotional facial expressions : test of an evolutionary hypothesis
Abstract
The results showed that women were faster than men at recognizing both positive and negative emotions from facial cues , supporting the attachment promotion hypothesis .
Support for the fitness threat hypothesis also was found , in that the sex difference was accentuated for negative emotions .
Volume 27 , Issue 6 , November 2006 , Pages 401-416 Elizabeth
Hampson et al .
A set of computerized tasks was used to investigate sex differences in the speed and accuracy of emotion recognition in 62 men and women of reproductive age .
Evolutionary theories have posited that female superiority in the perception of emotion might arise from women 's near - universal responsibility for child - rearing .
Two variants of the child - rearing hypothesis predict either across - the - board female superiority in the discrimination of emotional expressions ( “ attachment promotion ” hypothesis ) or a female superiority that is restricted to expressions of negative emotion ( “ fitness threat ” hypothesis ) .
Therefore , we sought to evaluate whether the expression of the sex difference is influenced by the valence of the emotional signal ( Positive or Negative ) .
There was no evidence that the female superiority was learned through previous childcare experience or that it was derived from a sex difference in simple perceptual speed .
The results suggest that evolved mechanisms , not domain - general learning , underlie the sex difference in recognition of facial emotions .
EA : The Human Story [ Nov. 10th , 2004 | 12:01 am ] ea_spouse
My significant other works for Electronic Arts , and I 'm what you might call a disgruntled spouse .
EA 's bright and shiny new corporate trademark is " Challenge Everything . "
Where this applies is not exactly clear .
Churning out one licensed football game after another does n't sound like challenging much of anything to me ; it sounds like a money farm .
To any EA executive that happens to read this , I have a good challenge for you : how about safe and sane labor practices for the people on whose backs you walk for your millions ?
I am retaining some anonymity here because I have no illusions about what the consequences would be for my family if I was explicit .
However , I also feel no impetus to shy away from sharing our story , because I know that it is too common to stick out among those of the thousands of engineers , artists , and designers that EA employs .
Our adventures with Electronic Arts began less than a year ago .
The small game studio that my partner worked for collapsed as a result of foul play on the part of a big publisher -- another common story .
Electronic
Arts offered a job , the salary was right and the benefits were good , so my SO took it .
I remember that they asked him in one of the interviews : " how do you feel about working long hours ? "
It 's just a part of the game industry -- few studios can avoid a crunch as deadlines loom , so we thought nothing of it .
When asked for specifics about what " working long hours " meant , the interviewers coughed and glossed on to the next question ; now we know why .
Within weeks production had accelerated into a ' mild ' crunch : eight hours six days a week .
Not bad .
Months remained until any real crunch would start , and the team was told that this " pre-crunch " was to prevent a big crunch toward the end ; at this point any other need for a crunch seemed unlikely , as the project was dead on schedule .
I do n't know how many of the developers bought EA 's explanation for the extended hours ; we were new and naive so we did .
The producers even set a deadline ; they gave a specific date for the end of the crunch , which was still months away from the title 's shipping date , so it seemed safe .
That date came and went .
And went , and went .
When the next news came it was not about a reprieve ; it was another acceleration : twelve hours six days a week , 9 am to 10 pm .
Weeks passed .
Again the producers had given a termination date on this crunch that again they failed .
Throughout this period the project remained on schedule .
The long hours started to take its toll on the team ; people grew irritable and some started to get ill .
People dropped out in droves for a couple of days at a time , but then the team seemed to reach equilibrium again and they plowed ahead .
The managers stopped even talking about a day when the hours would go back to normal .
Now , it seems , is the " real " crunch , the one that the producers of this title so wisely prepared their team for by running them into the ground ahead of time .
The current mandatory hours are 9am to 10 pm -- seven days a week -- with the occasional Saturday evening off for good behavior ( at 6:30 pm ) .
This averages out to an eighty - five hour work week .
Complaints that these once more extended hours combined with the team 's existing fatigue would result in a greater number of mistakes made and an even greater amount of wasted energy were ignored .
The stress is taking its toll .
After a certain number of hours spent working the eyes start to lose focus ; after a certain number of weeks with only one day off fatigue starts to accrue and accumulate exponentially .
There is a reason why there are two days in a weekend -- bad things happen to one 's physical , emotional , and mental health if these days are cut short .
The team is rapidly beginning to introduce as many flaws as they are removing .
And the kicker : for the honor of this treatment EA salaried employees receive a ) no overtime ; b ) no compensation time !
( ' comp ' time is the equalization of time off for overtime -- any hours spent during a crunch accrue into days off after the product has shipped ) ; c ) no additional sick or vacation leave .
The time just goes away .
Additionally , EA recently announced that , although in the past they have offered essentially a type of comp time in the form of a few weeks off at the end of a project , they no longer wish to do this , and employees should n't expect it .
Further , since the production of various games is scattered , there was a concern on the part of the employees that developers would leave one crunch only to join another .
EA 's response was that they would attempt to minimize this , but would make no guarantees .
This is unthinkable ; they are pushing the team to individual physical health limits , and literally giving them nothing for it .
Comp time is a staple in this industry , but EA as a corporation wishes to " minimize " this reprieve .
One would think that the proper way to minimize comp time is to avoid crunch , but this brutal crunch has been on for months , and nary a whisper about any compensation leave , nor indeed of any end of this treatment .
This crunch also differs from crunch time in a smaller studio in that it was not an emergency effort to save a project from failure .
Every step of the way , the project remained on schedule .
Crunching neither accelerated this nor slowed it down ; its effect on the actual product was not measurable .
The extended hours were deliberate and planned ; the management knew what they were doing as they did it .
The love of my life comes home late at night complaining of a headache that will not go away and a chronically upset stomach , and my happy supportive smile is running out .
No one works in the game industry unless they love what they do .
No one on that team is interested in producing an inferior product .
My heart bleeds for this team precisely BECAUSE they are brilliant , talented individuals out to create something great .
They are and were more than willing to work hard for the success of the title .
But that good will has only been met with abuse .
Amazingly , Electronic Arts was listed # 91 on Fortune magazine 's " 100 Best Companies to Work For " in 2003 .
EA 's attitude toward this -- which is actually a part of company policy , it now appears -- has been ( in an anonymous quotation that I 've heard repeated by multiple managers ) , " If they do n't like it , they can work someplace else . "
Put up or shut up and leave : this is the core of EA 's Human Resources policy .
The concept of ethics or compassion or even intelligence with regard to getting the most out of one 's workforce never enters the equation : if they do n't want to sacrifice their lives and their health and their talent so that a multibillion dollar corporation can continue its Godzilla - stomp through the game industry , they can work someplace else .
But can they ?
The EA Mambo , paired with other giants such as Vivendi , Sony , and Microsoft , is rapidly either crushing or absorbing the vast majority of the business in game development .
A few standalone studios that made their fortunes in previous eras -- Blizzard , Bioware , and Id come to mind -- manage to still survive , but 2004 saw the collapse of dozens of small game studios , no longer able to acquire contracts in the face of rapid and massive consolidation of game publishing companies .
This is an epidemic hardly unfamiliar to anyone working in the industry .
Though , of course , it is always the option of talent to go outside the industry , perhaps venturing into the booming commercial software development arena .
( Read my tired attempt at sarcasm . )
To put some of this in perspective , I myself consider some figures .
If EA truly believes that it needs to push its employees this hard -- I actually believe that they do n't , and that it is a skewed operations perspective alone that results in the severity of their crunching , coupled with a certain expected amount of the inefficiency involved in running an enterprise as large as theirs -- the solution therefore should be to hire more engineers , or artists , or designers , as the case may be .
Never should it be an option to punish one 's workforce with ninety hour weeks ; in any other industry the company in question would find itself sued out of business so fast its stock would n't even have time to tank .
In its first weekend , Madden 2005 grossed $ 65 million .
EA 's annual revenue is approximately $ 2.5 billion .
This company is not strapped for cash ; their labor practices are inexcusable .
The interesting thing about this is an assumption that most of the employees seem to be operating under .
Whenever the subject of hours come up , inevitably , it seems , someone mentions ' exemption ' .
They refer to a California law that supposedly exempts businesses from having to pay overtime to certain ' specialty ' employees , including software programmers .
This is Senate Bill 88 .
However , Senate Bill 88 specifically does not apply to the entertainment industry -- television , motion picture , and theater industries are specifically mentioned .
Further , even in software , there is a pay minimum on the exemption : those exempt must be paid at least $ 90,000 annually .
I can assure you that the majority of EA employees are in fact not in this pay bracket ; ergo , these practices are not only unethical , they are illegal .
I look at our situation and I ask 'us ' : why do you stay ?
And the answer is that in all likelihood we wo n't ; and in all likelihood if we had known that this would be the result of working for EA , we would have stayed far away in the first place .
But all along the way there were deceptions , there were promises , there were assurances -- there was a big fancy office building with an expensive fish tank -- all of which in the end look like an elaborate scheme to keep a crop of employees on the project just long enough to get it shipped .
And then if they need to , they hire in a new batch , fresh and ready to hear more promises that will not be kept ; EA 's turnover rate in engineering is approximately 50 % .
This is how EA works .
So now we know , now we can move on , right ?
That seems to be what happens to everyone else .
But it 's not enough .
Because in the end , regardless of what happens with our particular situation , this kind of " business " is n't right , and people need to know about it , which is why I write this today .
If I could get EA CEO Larry Probst on the phone , there are a few things I would ask him .
" What 's your salary ? " would be merely a point of curiosity .
The main thing I want to know is , Larry : you do realize what you 're doing to your people , right ?
And you do realize that they ARE people , with physical limits , emotional lives , and families , right ?
Voices and talents and senses of humor and all that ?
That when you keep our husbands and wives and children in the office for ninety hours a week , sending them home exhausted and numb and frustrated with their lives , it 's not just them you 're hurting , but everyone around them , everyone who loves them ?
When you make your profit calculations and your cost analyses , you know that a great measure of that cost is being paid in raw human dignity , right ?
Right ?

IT ’S NOT THE CRIME , IT ’S THE ….
Here ’s a quote from one of the U.S. Attorneys who was fired in the “ Pearl Harbor Day Massacre ” :
“ It should never have come to this , ” said John McKay , former U.S. attorney for the Seattle - based western district of Washington , who was among those fired and is now an adjunct law professor at the Seattle University law school .
“ I resigned quietly and left .
But when they started saying it was for ‘ performance reasons , ’ I could n’t keep quiet any more . ”
It ’s remarkable .
The Bushies quietly got a shiny new Patriot Act power to fire and replace U.S. Attorneys without Senate approval , so they went ahead and used it .
Then they got called on it .
So how did they react ?
Well , they could have just said it was for policy reasons : they wanted people who were on board with administration policies a little more heartily , and these folks did n’t make the grade .
So we replaced them .
What would have happened then ?
A little bit of grumbling , probably .
Some complaints that Bush was politicizing the office , perhaps , but since the offices are political appointments in the first place that would n’t have gone very far .
And the fired official themselves , who are all Republican loyalists in the first place , would have packed their bags and gotten other jobs .
They know how politics works .
But no .
This administration is so dedicated to spin and deceit that they just could n’t leave it alone .
They figured maybe they could avoid any criticism by claiming the firings were for performance - related reasons .
That should shut everyone up !
But of course it did just the opposite .
The fired attorneys , who were originally willing to suck it up and accept their political fate , were unhappy over being called incompetent .
Who would n’t be ?
And so the whole thing unraveled .
Now it ’s a case of U.S. Attorneys being fired because they were too zealous about prosecuting Republican corruption , and the Department of Justice is reduced to feebly arguing that it ’s just a coincidence that so many of the Pearl Harbor Eight were investigating corruption cases .
It ’s the Bush administration in a microcosm : a too - clever - by - half expansion of executive power , spin and deceit when it ’s discovered , followed by a storm of backtracking and protestations of innocence that no one believes .
It would n’t be so bad if this were n’t also the Bush administration in a macrocosm .
But it is .
IN OCTOBER , shortly after taking over as head of information technology ( IT ) at Arizona State University , Adrian Sannier gave the nod to his contact at Google , the internet giant known for its search engine , and with one flick of the proverbial switch 65,000 students had new e-mail accounts .
Unlike the university 's old system , which stores e-mails on its own server computers , the new accounts reside on Gmail , Google 's free web - based service .
Mr Sannier is not forcing anybody to change but has found that the students , many of whom were already using Gmail for their private e-mail , have been voluntarily migrating to the new service at a rate of 300 an hour .
Crucially , they can take their “ asu.edu ” e-mail addresses with them .
The service , part of a bundle called “ Google Apps for Your Domain ” that also includes instant messaging ( IM ) and a web - based calendar , has not even been officially launched yet .
It began running in a test ( or “ beta ” ) form in August .
But Dave Girouard , the boss of Google 's small but growing enterprise division , says that “ tens of thousands ” of organisations have already signed up to use Google 's web - based tools in place of traditional in - house e-mail systems and other software .
Using Google 's services has several advantages for companies .
Most employees already know how to use web - based software , and thus do not need training .
They can access the services through any web browser , regardless of what kind of computer ( or telephone ) they use .
Like the consumer service , the corporate product is free .
( Mr Sannier pays for support — “ less than $ 10,000 ” — but most organisations do not . )
And in - house IT staff need do absolutely nothing , since the data and software reside on Google 's server computers .
For Mr Sannier , however , a bigger reason than money for switching from traditional software to web - based alternatives has to do with the pace and trajectory of technological change .
Using the new Google service , for instance , students can share calendars , which they could not easily do before .
Soon Google will integrate its online word processor and spreadsheet software into the service , so that students and teachers can share coursework .
Eventually , Google may add blogs and wikis — it has bought firms with these technologies .
Mr Sannier says it is “ absolutely inconceivable ” that he and his staff could roll out improvements at this speed in the traditional way — by buying software and installing it on the university 's own computers .
In the past , innovation was driven by the military or corporate markets .
But now the consumer market , with its vast economies of scale and appetite for novelty , leads the way .
Compared with the staid corporate - software industry , using these services is like “ receiving technology from an advanced civilisation ” , says Mr Sannier .
He is now looking at other consumer technologies for ideas .
He is already using Apple 's iTunes , a popular online - music service , to store the university 's podcasts .
Mr Sannier is ahead of his time because most IT bosses , especially at large organisations , tend to be sceptical of consumer technologies and often ban them outright .
Employees , in return , tend to ignore their IT departments .
Many young people , for instance , use services such as Skype to send instant messages or make free calls while in the office .
FaceTime , a Californian firm that specialises in making such consumer applications safe for companies , found in a recent survey that more than half of employees in their 20s and 30s admitted to installing such software over the objections of IT staff .
Executive toys
Consumer technologies such as IM usually make employees more productive , says Kailash Ambwani , FaceTime 's boss , so IT bosses should concentrate not on stopping them but on making them secure .
In the case of IM and some kinds of file - sharing , the risks are that viruses or spyware could come into the corporate network from the outside , or that employees could ship vital information outward .
With Google Apps for Your Domain and other software services that are accessed through a web browser , the security issues are more subtle .
Since the software and the data reside on the service provider 's machines , the danger is of losing control of sensitive data , which is now in somebody else 's hands .
Most IT bosses find this scary .
Not so Mr Sannier .
He remembers a picture that Google showed him of one of its data centres burning to the ground ; it looked awful .
The point , however , was that no users of Google services anywhere even noticed , because Google 's systems are built to be so robust that even the loss of an entire data centre does not compromise anybody 's data .
“ I have a staff of about 30 people dedicated to security , ” says Mr Sannier .
“ Google has an army ; all of their business fails if they are unable to preserve security and privacy . ”
Google 's Mr Girouard says a similar evolution in trust occurred when people reluctantly accepted that their money was safer in a bank than under a mattress .
This trend could cause problems for traditional software firms such as Microsoft , Oracle and SAP .
Already , start - ups such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite provide “ software as a service ” , supplying sales - force automation , accounting , payroll and other features via the web .
( Marc Benioff , the founder of Salesforce.com , had the idea for his firm while browsing on Amazon 's online store one day .
Why , he wondered , could business software not be delivered the same way ? )
Other firms , including Google , provide web - based e-mail , word processing , spreadsheets and databases .
Big companies will probably keep “ mission critical ” systems in - house .
But as everything else migrates to web - based services , software will increasingly resemble the web technologies of the consumer market , says Mr Benioff .
Those enterprise firms , such as his own , that follow the lead of consumer - oriented websites will do well in this environment , he argues .
Security concerns , Mr Benioff implies with a wink , are red herrings thrown by ageing IT bosses trying to justify their salaries .
They will , after all , be out of a job if companies no longer maintain their own big data centres .
Mr Sannier agrees .
The old IT bosses “ ca n't possibly embrace this idea unless they 're getting ready to retire , ” as his own predecessor did after decades in the job .
But at 45 , Mr Sannier believes the trend is inevitable , and his job requires him to get on top of it .

Just want to point out that according to Elizabeth Edwards ' autobiography , John Edwards went to the mat with Kerry to not concede , saying , " But we promised ! ! "
So even though Kerry gave in almost instantaneously , Edwards was ready to duke it out .
Too bad he was n't the one calling the shots .
My guess is that Kerry listened to the chicken - sh*t consultants who gave him so much bad advice throughout the campaign , who probably told him not to " damage " his 2008 chances ' cause they were afraid he'd get branded a " sore loser " , and have to tap into his unused campaign money .
The tragic irony is that after all the hemming and hawing and fighting with Edwards that must have gone on before he conceded , after all that effort to try to " save " it for 2008 , he ended up losing it after all , way back on Election Night 2004 .

Why is messing with the most important part of democracy , elections , only a misdemeanor ?
Any interferance with elections , whether that be vote tampering , interfering with votes or simply intentionally failing to count or recount votes correctly should be a felony with prison time .
Anything less will not deter people in the future and will weaken not only the democratic process in the US , but will weaken democratic processes in nations that look to the US as the pinicle of representitive democracy .
This is all the more important now , given that the US is currently trying to export the idea of democracy to the Mid East .

{ed note :
The following comment is disinfo , misleading , and most just incorrect .
We 're allowing it to remain posted anyway .
Because we feel generous today for some reason .}
Two election officials that are Democrats were convicted of not using statistically - proper samples to determine if a full recount was necessary .
The Democrat presidential candidate did not bother to pursue the recount , which was brought by minor party candidates .
The Democrat totals in Cuyahoga county were 2 points ahead of the exit polls , and Cuyahoga vas the extreme point for Democrats in the state of Ohio ( Kerry had 2/3 of the vote in that county ) .
In order for the election total to have changed , Kerry would have needed to poll another 9 points in Cuyahoga , meaning that more than a quarter of Bush votes in that county would have to flip to Kerry .
That is statistically unlikely --- the only thing the story proves is that the particular Democrats involved can not be trusted to properly count votes , and the Democrat presidential candidate could not be trusted to keep his promise of fighting until every vote was counted .
Stop drinking Kool - Aid --- Bush won in 2000 and 2004 .
If you cannot accept that , you will not be able to focus on 2008 .

re : Neil Farr # 15 and AlanS # 16 - Bless your hearts , you really do n't understand what just happened here , do you ?
Let me see if I can make it simple enough for you to understand .
Here 's what happened :
Some people got lazy and did n't want to spend the time to do a legal recount , because there was a chance that to do so would point out discrepancies in the vote counts and they might have to actually spend time and do their job .
They broke the law .
They 're going to jail .
Once we 're done with all of this , maybe someone here can write a " Democracy for Dummies " book .
Having said that - your posts point to the fact that you do n't give a s**t about your country and the direction in which it is headed .
If you DID , you'd be celebrating with us - people who did NOT care enough about our democracy to treat it with the reverence it deserves GOT BUSTED FOR BREAKING THE LAW !
Convictions like this are helping us PROVE that there are major flaws in our election system in this country - and we are working to change that , for ALL Americans - even slugs like you !

How many times can i say Scum and Bonesman / illuminati party is ONE as in 1 corporate party .
the democrat / republican theft of 2004 is all the evidence you need for those who are willing to open the frigin cover of the book .
Point of interests :
Ohio changes laws making it much more difficult for Presidential candidates like David Cobb to get a recount that is even a rigged recount .
In these times of electronic voting fraud and massive humanistic fraud in the god ole USA , can i get a shout out to the mo-foes responsible for passing that bushit legislation ?
O.T. Even though we have a new Congress the anti-environmentalist Bushit administration is still doing everything in it 's power destroy our wild lands and pollute the environment .
The only way we can fight them right now since changing the laws of forestry for example 1 month after stealing the 2004 election is in COURT !
Give to the non profit enviromental organizations like the NRDC and Earth Justice who go to court .
Thank you ,
GBD Chris Severheen and the US forestry department under the direction of bushit cabinet member Gale Norton is moving ahead with delisting the Grizz even though they received 212,000 comments against removing it from Federal Endangered Species Protection compared to 989 in favor .
The bears might be in the bowl but their mascot is fighting for their survival in the lower 48 because of greedy mismanagement typical of the Bushit administration .

__________________________________________________
Thank you for that post , Kestrel .
It seems as if the knee - jerk reaction with some people is to twist this into some Democrats v. Republicans issue .
The issue is about right and wrong .
Elections officials rigged the election to avoid a thorough recount , got caught and now they 're in deep trouble .
What they did is undermine our Democracy .
They proved it was very easy for them to do , as well .
This is serious and effects us all , not just Ohio .
If it can happen there , it can happen anywhere to any candidate .
These convictions are felonies , not misdemeanors .
These two convicted felons will be stripped of their right to vote , as all felons are .
I think this is very fitting because anyone who attemps to undermine Democracy by rigging election should never be near a voting booth again .

This news is remarkable for two reasons : 1 . What it implies about our election procedures .
2 . What it implies about the media coverage .
One would have to be diligent indeed to find any mention of this verdict in the " establishment " press .
In regard to this information , I saw , late one night , a documentary about a group of citizens who are concerned about vote tallying procedures and who have pursued their own investigations into what really went on in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 .
The documentary showed a visit to Cuyahoga County by this watchdog group , and the slippery tactics the election officials used in responding to their inquiries .
The documentary also purported to demonstrate that Diebold vote tabulator chips could be " hacked " and programmed to alter vote tabulations .
Alas , as is often the way things late at night and early in the morning , I forgot to note the title of this remarkable work .
You , Brad , monitor of things to do with the keystone of a democracy -- the integrity of the vote -- must know the name of this documentary .
I would like to know the title so that I may obtain copies of this documentary for my information and for the edification of others .
Can you help me ?

Sounds like the Hursti Hack .
Not " purported " ... verified .
Performed by Harri Hursti at the request of , and in front of , Leon County 's election supervisor Ion Sancho ... who has since paid a heavy political price for daring to allow the open testing of an e-voting machine .
The show was Hacking Democracy
http://www.hbo.com/docs/...gdemocracy/synopsis.html

I suggest that Neil Farr check out this website belonging to a Republican computer security expert , Chuck Herrin .
Another Republican warrior for honest elections is Jim March , a former lobbyist for the NRA .
And they are not alone .
Republicans have contested elections and Republicans have donated beaucoup bucks to citizen lawsuits and recounts .
See , Neil , here are some folks who do n't believe that winning is the only thing .
They 're old - fashioned and conservative enough to believe that it is n't if you win or lose , but how you play the game .
And they want an honest game .
But I 'm not saying that there are n't some Republicans who are sore losers , because they do n't like the neo-cons taking over their party , and they never thought that Bush was the best their party could come up with .
There well may be .
I just have n't met them .
All the Republicans I 've met in the election reform movement are primarily concerned with honesty , integrity , and citizen oversight of elections , something that not all Democrats really care about , as the Cuyahoga convictions demonstrate .
You can't judge a person 's character by their political party affiliation .
The convicted felons in our federal prisons include representatives of both major parties , of third parties , of independent voters , and of people who never bothered to vote at all .
The only thing they all have in common is that they were convicted of felonies .
Chances are that your local Rotary Club also includes Republicans , Democrats , Libertarians , Greens , and unaffiliated voters , although it is unlikely to include anyone who shirks their civic duty and does n't bother to vote .
And if there 's a Heaven , I 'd venture to guess that you 'd find the same demographic mix there too .
This is the USA , not Democratistan or Republicanistan .
Home of the free , land of the brave , and a place where , at least when it comes to voting and to moral fiber , everyone has an equal opportunity to be a crook or an honest citizen .

Is Election Fraud a partisan issue ?
Well , you see , I 'm basically just of average intellect , not a rocket scientist , so I see this issue pretty simply .
If somebody tells me that election fraud is n't a Republican or Democratic issue , then I think to myself , that means that it is something that is engaged in equally ( or nearly so ) by both parties and that the fruits of election fraud will favor both parties equally .
So , that must mean , that if I look at the last four elections ( 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 ) , I would see approximately equal instances of votes being flipped from Democrat to Republican as from Republican to Democrat .
I would see equal instances of long lines in Democratic strongholds as Republican Strongholds .
I would see equal hand - outs of Provisional Ballots to Democrats as Republicans .
I would see nearly the same numbers for Democrats who come to the polls and are told they are at the wrong voting station or not on the rolls as for Republicans .
I would see equal instances of extra votes showing up mysteriously for Republicans as for Democrats .
I would see the vote counting closed down for false reasons and closed to the public equally in Democratic - controlled areas as Republican - controlled areas .
In short , in every instance of electoral fraud , the results would follow a pattern of no worse than 55 percent towards one party , and 45 % towards the other party ( and that is being VERY generous about what would be considered approximately equal ) .
Hmmm .
But that does n't seem to be the case , does it ?
For some totally inexplicable reason , even though honest elections are a " non-partisan " issue , the majority --- no , the PREPONDERANCE of instances of electoral fraud and abuse favor the Republican Party by a factor of 10 - 1 .
Gee , that seems a little bit out - of - line , does n't it ?
So , that said , I can't quite wrap my head around this idea that somehow , fighting for honest elections is a non-partisan fight .
Oh , well , I guess it WOULD be , if Republicans cared more about what was RIGHT than WINNING .
But , alas , they do n't , so , no matter how nice and friendly and inclusive anybody wants to make this issue , it comes down to this ...
The Republicans control the voting apparatus and have created systems and processes that guarantee an electoral system that is unfairly biased in their favor , and they will do NOTHING to change that .
To fight for electoral reform ( PAPER BALLOTS , COUNTED TRANSPARENTLY BY HAND , AND TOTALS REPORTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ) is by definition an anti-Republican fight .

I see where these " cheap plastic " machines cost somewhere between $ 4,400 and $ 6,400 .
They certainly do n't cost that much to manufacture .
Think about your own latest computer purchase .
It does n't cost that much .
Just another tax ripoff .
We need to go to paper ballots with local control .
I went to the " www.boe.cuyahogacounty.us " county election boards and looked at their training video .
Watch it closely when they show you how to correct your vote .
The " X " is supposed to disappear when you change your vote .
Later in the video it does n't when they show how to correct your vote !
The machine is n't working in the " example " .
Electronic voting needs to be outlawed - permanently .

Last Friday – around ten in the evening – Pentheus , my main character in World of Warcraft , hit level sixty .
Thinking back , I ’m now not entirely sure where he was when this happened , although I believe it was in the wastes of Silithus .
I waited until I ’d got to the Altar of Storms to start my quests for my Dreadsteed before I took the above picture .
I honestly do n’t know how I feel about the whole thing .
It was – frankly – sort of an anti-climax .
Nothing happened , I just remained being level sixty .
There was no sense of a threshold being reached .
My character – the same character I ’ve been playing on and off since November – was just slightly more powerful than he was before .
And a whole range of long extended new quests wandered off before him .
There would be no new spells , no new pets , no real development – except in sets of armour and property .
Each quest , each raid will now be longer and more involved than they were before – a dungeon taking two or three evenings to explore properly and requiring a group of people to play with that I ’ve struggled to collect along the way .
The whole game now feels very laborious and slow – the simple pleasures of earlier in the game , where you were picking up new abilities and developing quickly have just disappeared , to be replaced with something more drudgelike , robotic and … as the people in game describe it … grinding .
Now the interesting thing about this is you ’d think that was a very good reason to stop playing the game immediately – but somehow no .
My relationship with World of Warcraft is a lot more complicated than that – so complicated that it ’s forced me to reconsider a lot of my assumptions about gaming .
These assumptions have been further challenged by reading Raph Koster ’s book and weblog , A Theory of Fun for Game Design .
The two experiences – reading and playing – have not pushed in the same direction however – they ’ve not led me to the same conclusions – and this has resulted in me spending a lot of time wondering about the relationship between entertainment and productivity , fun and work , drudgery and compulsion .
I ’ve started wondering whether a game could still be considered good if you want to play it a lot but at the same time resent the time that it takes from you .
What if you find it boring but still somehow ca n’t put it down .
Can you love and hate a game at the same time and still call it ‘ fun ’ ?
Can a game be a narcotic , or a guilty secret or an addiction ?
Can it be a fruitless activity without value that still feels good
Raph ’s book includes a really interesting analysis on what games are , and what fun is and is not which is far too long to quote in full here , but which includes this summary :
Games are n’t stories .
Games are n’t about beauty or delight .
Games are n’t about jockeying for social status .
They stand , in their own right , as something incredibly valuable .
Fun is about learning in a context where there is no pressure , and that is why games matter .
This sort of fascinates me because it contains a weird twist of logic – that fun is learning without pressure , and that therefore games matter – presumably because learning is de facto a good thing .
But what if you ’re learning a system or a landscape with no transferable value – what if a specific game presents you with a structure designed to purely generate the sensation of perpetual fun by short - circuiting the learning impulse and misdirecting it into valueless territories ?
There would be a memetic advantage in being a game that could be intoxicating in that way without requiring that people learn skills that were transferable elsewhere .
For a start , real - world skills are harder to develop and perhaps less short - term satisfying .
Secondly , a process that teaches you real - world skills would result in you evolving and changing .
A game that could short - circuit your learning instinct would n’t have to do that .
There would be no reason for you to leave .
There ’s another quote in Raph ’s book which is about what happens when you get older and why people stop playing games .
He says , “ We do n’t actually put away the notion of ‘ having fun ’ as far as I can tell .
We migrate it into other contexts .
Many claim that work is fun , for example ( me included ) .
Just getting together with friends can be enough to give us the little burst of endophins we crave . ”
I think this is really interesting , because it hits on a few more weird contradictions – working can be a learning exercise , it ’s true , but there ’s normally some risk involved .
if you do bad things in a job , you can be fired .
There are consequences .
So that seems rather at odds with his earlier sense of fun .
And a work environment has no formal ruleset , has no structure that you ’d recognise as game - like .
And of course it can have real - world rewards .
If work can be fun , then I ’d argue that ’s not because it ’s like games – an environment in which you can learnwithout risk , but precisely because it ’s not like games , the productive element generates a satisfaction that is totally missing in World of Warcraft .
The creative and generative element is also absent .
Perhaps the reason we think of games as a childish activity is because play in our youth is supposed to inform work in our adulthood .
Perhaps then , a game that feeds on our desire to learn and our childlike instincts but cannot give us the satisfactions of creation or real dangers , is a con , a short - cut , a parasite .
Perhaps adult gaming is nothing more than an opiate , designed to provide satisfactions and a sense of development or progress that the real world is unable to provide for most people , or that people are too nervous to fight for .
Apparently you can get a character on World of Warcraft to level sixty in about three months of consistent after - work play .
Personally , my experience has taken me three times that length of time , and has been squeezed around long hours on work projects and more travelling than I ’ve ever done before .
Given that it has n’t massively compromised these parts of my life , I ’m guessing that the level of compulsion I ’ve felt to play has not been massively excessive – but it ’s still felt like a time sink that somehow claims me for my out of work creative time .
That really worries me .
Let me put it this way – while I feel no massive compromise to my life is occurring now , while my relationship with the game is merely grudging at the moment , I can imagine coming to hate the game and yet still wanting to play it .
Is that an extraordinary statement ?
Is that a piece of self - insight there , or is it something about the game ?
I ca n’t tell where the fault lies if there is a fault ?
Can you build something that is too addictive simply in the way it presents challenges and rewards , to the extent that it becomes psychologically addictive .
Can something with no pharmaceutical components be a drug ?
Or is this simply a matter of self - discipline and self - control ?
How tempting does an alternative world filled with mechanisms for alleviating status anxiety have to be before the space between fun and craving gets crossed ?
Is television any different ?
Am I just coming to some weird form of Protestant neurosis in my mid-thirties ?
One of my older posts is currently full of people talking about their problems with World of Warcraft in particular – wives saying that her husband ignores his children to play , men who say they would rather play WOW than have sex with their wives , teenagers who say that they ’re failing school so they can play , and it ’s led me to this weird point .
Are they all making excuses ?
Is the game a scapegoat ?
Are they weak - willed and to be pitied ?
Or are we as a culture starting to construct toys that are too effective and end up hurting people ?
I know it sounds alarmist , but I really want people ’s opinions .
What do you think ?
There are no stranger beasts in the business world than the major music labels .
Only these creatures , represented by their legal attack dog the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) , would apply an excusatory tone to the release of product shipment figures that show a significant increase in sales .
Where other companies would brag , the music labels warn that making money is really quite excruciating and depressing .
The RIAA has just released US music sales figures for the first half of 2004 .
Heaven help us all - CD shipments were up 10 percent compared to 2003 and revenue was up around 4 percent .
This is the first time in five years that the first half figures have jumped year - over - year .
That 's great news , right ?
Well , not so fast , consumers .
You still need to do quite a bit more to help out the emaciated labels .
" The record industry has experienced some gains so far in 2004 , but we are rising out of a deep hole and still have a long way to go , " said Mitch Bainwol , Chairman of the RIAA .
" Piracy , both online and on the street , continues to hit the music community hard , and thousands have lost their jobs because of it . "
The RIAA demands that while 2004 sales look pretty good , they are just not up to the glorious levels of 2001 when the labels pulled in $ 14bn .
So what are the labels doing to try and bring sales back ?
Well , as the RIAA highlights in its press release , the pigopolists have this year teamed with the FBI to create a new anti-piracy warning seal , they 've expanded their lawsuits against teenagers and promoted DRM - infected music stores .
All of these being sensible measures to encourage a disaffected customer base to return to the fold and spend $ 17.99 for an album at a Virgin store .
" The foundation for success is in place , " said Bainwol .
" Continued growth requires innovative business models , aggressively making music available to legitimate digital services , public education , appropriate legislation and a strong measure of deterrence .
We still have our work cut out for us , but the encouraging news behind these numbers confirms we are on the right track . "
Nothing says " please buy our over - priced boy band spew " like a strong measure of deterrence .
While examining the latest RIAA data , we stumbled upon a separate collection of figures that lays out the consumer profile for the average music buyer .
One bit of data in this set ( PDF ) really stands out .
Since 1999 , the labels ' true glory year , the majority of music sales have shifted from traditional record shops to other retailers .
In 1999 , 45 percent of sales came from the record shops , 38 percent from other retailers and 8 percent from music clubs .
In 2003 , only 33 percent of sales came from music shops , 53 percent from retailers and 4 percent from music clubs .
That 's a compelling trend when you think that stores such as Best Buy and Wal - Mart try to push CD prices as close to $ 10 as possible , while record shops tend to price CDs much higher .
A recent Rolling Stone story points out that Wal - Mart has become the largest music seller in the US , selling one out of every five albums .
Wal - Mart is now doing everything in its power to drive the costs of CDs down - much to the labels ' dismay .
Many of you will recall the labels have had issues with over - active retailers before and were accused of trying to stop cheap CDs by price - fixing the products .
The labels later had to pay up for harming consumers .
The upshot of this is that consumers are meant to ignore higher sales of cheap CDs , a sour overall economy for the last three years , lawsuits against consumers , a price - fixing scandal , a Harvard study that shows no line between file - trading and lower sales and believe that piracy is driving a slowdown in overall music sales .
Makes perfect sense .
No wonder the RIAA is agonizing over increased recent revenue . ®

Yesterday at Mantua , in an amazing echo of that heartrending story , archaeologists revealed the discovery of a couple locked in a tender embrace , one that has endured for more than 5,000 years .
The find was unearthed by experts digging at a neolithic site at a less than romantic industrial estate .
Scientists are to examine the skeletons to try to establish how old they were when they died and how long they have been buried .
One theory being examined is that the man was killed and the woman then sacrificed so that his soul would be accompanied in the after life .
Elena Menotti , who is leading the dig at Valdaro near Mantua in northern Italy , said : ' I am so excited about this discovery .
" We have never found a man and a woman embraced before and this is a unique find .
" We have found plenty of women embracing children but never a couple .
Much less a couple hugging -- and they really are hugging .
It 's possible that the man died first and then the woman was killed in sacrifice to accompany his soul .
" From an initial examination they appear young as their teeth are not worn down but we have sent the remains to a laboratory to establish their age at the time of death .
" They are face to face and their arms and legs are entwined and they are really hugging .
" I am so thrilled at this find .
I have been involved in lots of digs all over Italy but nothing has excited me as much as this . "
" I 've been doing this job for 25 years .
I 've done digs at Pompeii , all the famous sites .
" But I 've never been so moved because this is the discovery of something special . "
An initial examination of the couple - dubbed the Lovers of Valdaro - revealed that the man ( on the left in the picture ) has an arrow in his spinal column while the woman has an arrow head in her side .
The area has already given up a spectacular Roman villa .
Five thousand years ago the area around Mantua was marshland and criss - crossed by rivers and the environment has helped preserve the skeletons in their near perfect state .
The tribes of the area thrived through hunting and fishing and travelled along the waterways in boats but even then the simple hunter gatherer lifestyle was being replaced by livestock rearing , weaving and pottery .
In Romeo and Juliet , Romeo is sent to Mantua for killing Tybalt Capulet in a swordfight .
Romeo subsequently leaves the city and returns to Verona when he hears his love , Juliet , has died .
Sleep Labs of the Soviet Empire [ Image : A " garden suburb " outside Moscow .

Specifically , we 're told , " the building consisted of two large dormitories either side of a central block , " and the dormitories each " had sloping floors . "
This would " obviate the need for pillows . "
Even more amazing – or is it absurd ?
– we read :
At either end of the long buildings were to be situated control booths , where technicians would command instruments to regulate the temperature , humidity , and air pressure , as well as to waft salubrious scents and " rarefied condensed air " through the halls .
Nor would sound be left unorganized .
Specialists working " according to scientific facts " would transmit from the control centre a range of sounds gauged to intensify the process of slumber .
The rustle of leaves , the cooing of nightingales , or the soft murmur of waves would instantly relax the most overwrought veteran of the metropolis .
Should these fail , the mechanized beds would then begin gently to rock until consciousness was lost .
While all this certainly sounds ambitious enough , apparently " Melnikov 's original impulse had been much more far - reaching . "
His original dream had been to create an Institute for Changing the Form of Man .
The whole article is awesome , frankly , encompassing the resurrection of the dead , a house designed by Melnikov in which residents felt as if they " were floating in thick golden air , " and further thoughts about how Melnikov " recombined industrial iconography into a series of spatial adventures , " most notably with a building that was " a delirium of gigantic stairways and roller bearings .

Above is a picture of one of the first piles , built just a few weeks ago .
In just over a year , 60 of them will have been planted in the seafloor , have a wind turbine bolted on top , and the farm will start producing electricity - enough to provide power to 125,000 households and to avoid 225,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year .
It will look a lot like this one , North Hoyle , completed in 2004 and which uses the same turbines :
This Wednesday , a few banks , including mine , signed and disbursed a ground - breaking loan : we put 378 million euros on the table , to build 60 wind turbines in the North Sea , 25 kilometers off the coast of the Netherlands , near Amsterdam .
The wind farm , at 120 MW is not the biggest to be built offshore ( that title goes to Nysted , built three years ago , which has a capacity of 165 MW ) , but it is the first - ever offshore wind farm to be financed by banks .
I am finally in a position to write about a project that has kept me busy in the past year and a half and that may interest the readers of the Oil Drum ...
I explained in a diary written almost two years ago what project finance was and how it works , but the principle is simple : you finance a specific asset , and you get repaid only from the revenues generated by that asset , without recourse to the investors that own the project .
This is a financing technique that works well for project with well identified assets with high initial investment costs , and strong cash flows after that , like big infrastructure items ( toll bridges , pipelines ) and energy assets ( oil fields , power plants ) .
Wind farms are quite easy to fund using this project finance mechanism , and it has indeed been done on a wide scale in most Western countries , which have stable regulatory frameworks for renewable energy , i.e. mechanisms that guarantee that renewable energy sources get a high enough price ( usually higher than " grey " power , but not always these days with the price increases for gas ) for each kWh put on the grid .
But so far , offshore windfarms seemed to be scaring banks , for a number of reasons :
construction costs are higher than onshore , as you need special boats and equipment to build the turbines , and you need to build a longer cable .
The high cost of the cable , which must be borne by the wind farm ( as it is built exclusively to connect it to the grid ) also means that only larger scale projects make economic sense , thus implying bigger investment outlays ;
operating costs are also higher , as the marine environment is tougher on parts , and access is similarly more difficult : even minor repairs will require the intervention of a boat and will take more time ;
more problematic for the banks , operating costs are also more uncertain : there is little track record for offshore operations , and risks are not completely understood , such the long term impact of corrosive salt , and stronger winds , on turbines initially designed for onshore use .
Bad weather can prevent access to the farm altogether and mean that even minor technical problems can cost big production losses as repairs are delayed ;
finally , the issue of the size of the projects ( which reach hundreds of millions of euros ) has become an issue .
Developers can be utilities , but they can be pretty small players ; similarly , turbine manufacturers ( with the exception of GE and , more recently , Siemens - Bonus ) are also relatively small industrial companies .
The presence of such small players was not an obstacle in the onshore sector , where the technology is well known , and nimble wind investors proved capable to develop , and these manufacturers to build , the windfarms typically seen onshore , i.e. in the 10 - 50 MW ( or 10 - 50 million euros ) range , and banks were comfortable to support both .
For the bigger , longer , more expensive offshore projects , this is no longer the case .
How reasonable is it to finance a project costing 400 million but developed by companies with 10 millions euros turnover and built by a company with 50 million euros in annual profits ?
The fact that wind is stronger and steadier offshore , and energy production is typically 50 % higher per turbine than onshore helps make the case for offshore wind economically more compelling , but does not alleviate the above problems , and both investors and financiers have been reluctant to put money in this sector , despite currently being extraordinarily aggressive for onshore wind assets .
So how did we solve this ?
Now , I have to walk a fine line not to reveal any confidential information , so I 'll use the press release which is in the public domain , and explain some bits briefly :
The financing structure includes a number of novel features to mitigate the risks associated with the construction and long term operation of wind turbines at sea , including the availability of a contingent facility ( jointly with contingent equity provided by ENECO ) to cover potential cost overruns or delays , cash sweep mechanisms and specially tailored availability guarantees under the operating contract with Vestas that allow debt service to continue even during periods of lower availability than expected .
The project also benefits from a comprehensive , 11 - year insurance programme with Delta - Lloyd N.V .
Availability of a contingent facility .
That means that we have some additional funds available should there be unexpected spending or problems that cause the production ( and thus revenue ) to be delayed .
We rely on fairly standard construction contracts , which have a given price and date , and usually include penalties if commitments are not meant , and I 'm certainly not going to give ideas to people that there is more money out there to be spent .
There will need to be real problems that are not covered by normal contractual terms , and banks will have a final say on whether any money is provided .
But it is fairly unusual for banks to put up such reserves ( usually , this is done exclusively by the investors ) , and we 've done it in this case because it gives us additional control over construction and a higher certainty that the project will be built successfully .
We 've been willing doing this because we have studied the plans and contracts in much detail and are comfortable with the technical challenges , the solutions used to solve them and the backup plans .

We 've been willing doing this because we have studied the plans and contracts in much detail and are comfortable with the technical challenges , the solutions used to solve them and the backup plans .
Cash sweep mechanisms .
That simply means that if the project is successful , we get repaid faster , by taking ( " sweeping " ) a portion of the surplus to reimburse the loans .
Banks always use more conservative revenue estimates than investors to have a higher certainty that such revenue levels will always be reached - and make it possible for the debt to be paid .
If thing go well , of even just as expected , there will be more revenue than the banks plan , and the investors will make a lot more money .
So in this case , we have a right to a portion of these extra revenues in the " better - than - the- pessimistic - scenario " cases .
That means that it is actually quite likely that we be repaid faster than we expect .
We do n't earn more , but we take risk over a shorter period , and it does lower the rate of return of the investors ( as their own income is delayed by these payments ) .

Availability guarantees .
That 's the operator , Vestas , guaranteeing that its turbines ( which it will be running and maintaining on behalf of the investors ) will indeed produce the expected amounts of electricity , and agreeing to pay penalties if the production levels are lower than guaranteed .
I cannot go into much detail here , but the general principle here is that these guarantees should not only cover the impact of lower revenues for the investors , but rather for the lenders .
So the penalty payments take place for really degraded performance , rather than for slightly degraded performance , in order to ensure that there is still some income in the project even if things go really bad ( if things go a little bit bad , we are covered to some extent by the fact that the banks already count on things going less well than normal as their " base case " scenario ) .

Insurance programme .
That 's fairly simple : you can buy insurance that compensates you if some things that should not go wrong do go wrong .
Insurances make money because they charge you a slightly higher fraction of revenues than the probability of that thing happening .
Risks like lighting , boat accidents , mechanical failures or weather events are known to insurers and they can quite easily quote prices for such circumstances .
In this case , the project has managed to get insurance coverage for a fairly comprehensive set of events , which brings additional comfort to the lenders .
For those of you that know the business , this is all maddeningly vague , I suspect , while those of you that do not know much finance will probably already find it unbelievably complex and mind - numbing .
Let 's say that this is a compromise between the desire to explain what we did and the confidentiality requirements inherent to this job , and it may be slightly frustrating .
I will say that I am extremely proud of having brought this project to fruition , and I will further say that I consider that I had an instrumental job in getting it done , and I think that this financing will be a reference and a model for future transactions .
I also consider myself lucky to work in a sector where I can do some good for the planet and which is fully compatible with the political ideas that I push here .
JAKARTA , Indonesia -
The closest most people will ever get to remote Papua , or the operations of Freeport - McMoRan , is a computer tour using Google Earth to swoop down over the rain forests and glacier - capped mountains where the American company mines the world 's largest gold reserve .
With a few taps on a keyboard , satellite images quickly reveal the deepening spiral that Freeport has bored out of its Grasberg mine as it pursues a virtually bottomless store of gold hidden inside .
They also show a spreading soot - colored bruise of almost a billion tons of mine waste that the New Orleans - based company has dumped directly into a jungle river of what had been one of the world 's last untouched landscapes .
What is far harder to discern is the intricate web of political and military ties that have helped shield Freeport from the rising pressures that other gold miners have faced to clean up their practices .
Only lightly touched by a scant regulatory regime , and cloaked in the protection of the military , Freeport has managed to maintain a nearly impenetrable redoubt on the easternmost Indonesian province as it taps one of the country 's richest assets .
Months of investigation by The New York Times revealed a level of contacts and financial support to the military not fully disclosed by Freeport , despite years of requests by shareholders concerned about potential violations of American laws and the company 's relations with a military whose human rights record is so blighted that the United States severed ties for a dozen years until November .

Cruel almost beyond belief , this Chinese farm breeds hundreds of tigers in rows of battery cages ... so they can be killed and turned into wine ...
King , the Siberian tiger , stares at me through the bars of his cage .
His two beautiful , graceful companions pace back and forth across their tiny compound .
They look crushingly bored .
The most exciting thing they can do is paw mournfully at the dirty pools of rainwater on the floor of their cage .

• Purrfect : Rare tiger born in captivity
Although the Xiongsen tiger park , near Guilin in south - east China , appears to be a depressingly typical Third World zoo , with a theme park restaurant and open areas where tigers roam , it actually hides a far more sinister secret : it 's a factory farm breeding tigers to be eaten and to be made into wine .
In row upon row of sheds , hundreds of tigers are incarcerated in battery - like cages which they never leave until they are slaughtered .
Visitors to the park can dine on strips of stir - fried tiger with ginger and Chinese vegetables .
Also on the menu are tiger soup and a spicy red curry made with tenderised strips of the big cat .
Visitors can wash it all down with a glass or two of wine made from Siberian tiger bones .
A waitress at the farm 's restaurant tells me proudly : ' The tiger meat is produced here .
It 's our business .
When Government officials come here , we kill a tiger for them so they have fresh meat .
Other visitors are given meat from tigers killed in fights .
We now have 140 tigers in the freezer .
" We also sell lion meat , bear 's paw , crocodile and snake .
The bear 's paw has to be ordered in advance as it takes a long time to cook . "
The waitress clearly does not care that she is selling meat and wine from endangered species .
She is not worried that selling them is against Chinese and international law , and helps to fuel the poaching that is driving tigers to extinction .
Tigers and other endangered species are being reared on an industrial scale throughout China , despite international treaties forbidding this .
The Mail discovered three factory farms breeding tigers in China .
The Guilin farm alone has 1,300 tigers , including the incredibly rare and elusive Siberian sub -species .
It rears and slaughters Bengal , South China and White tigers .
More than 300 African lions and 400 Asiatic black bears are also reared here for food and traditional Chinese medicines .
The Chinese authorities claim that farms like the one at Guilin are a vital part of the country 's conservation efforts , and that they will one day release these endangered creatures back into the wild .
But my visit to the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village shows their real intention could not be more different .
For the fact is that these animals could never survive in the wild .
Having spent their lives in tiny , battery - style units , they cannot hunt and would be dead within days of being released .
Each shed at the tiger farm - and I saw at least 100 - houses between three and five tigers in a space no larger than a typical family living room .
In relative terms , they have about as much space as a battery hen .
The animals have all been bred on the farm .
The cubs are taken from their mothers at three months and put in a kindergarten .
I saw around 30 tiger cubs in this creche , where they stay until they are old enough to be transferred to the battery units .
Many of the youngsters kept leaping at the fencing .
The younger ones simply wanted to play like kittens .
The older cubs were already showing signs of stress .
Tigers are naturally solitary creatures that roam over dozens of square miles , so it 's hardly surprising that life in the cages drives them insane .
I saw numerous examples of stress - related repetitive behaviour .
The mature animals paced back and forth across their cages for hours on end - three steps forward , three steps back .
Some hurled themselves at the bars of their prison cells , while others simply stared into space .
Over -crowding drives the creatures to attack each other , often resulting in death .
Officially it is only the tigers killed in such fights that can be eaten or turned into wine .
But it is clear that many of them die as a result of a bullet to the head .
They are not the only animals killed .
For entertainment , visitors to the animal park can watch the ' live killing exhibition ' , a sick spectacle in which animals are ' hunted ' and torn to pieces by tigers while onlookers cheer .
I watched in horror as a young cow was stalked and caught by a tiger .
Its screams filled the air as it struggled .
A wild tiger would dispatch its prey within moments , but these tigers ' natural killing skills have been blunted by years of captivity .
The tiger tried to kill - tearing , biting at the cow 's body in a pathetic - looking frenzy - but it simply did n't know how .
Eventually , the keepers stepped in and put the cow out of its misery .
Virtually all the tigers from the Guilin farm end up at a winery 100 miles to the north , their carcasses dumped in huge vats of rice wine and left to rot for up to nine years .
The Chinese believe that the tiger 's strength passes into the wine as its body decomposes .
They also believe that it is a powerful medicine that wards off arthritis , strengthens bones and acts as a general tonic .
Smelling like a mixture of methylated spirits , antiseptic and congealed meat , it is difficult to believe that anyone would willingly drink it , and yet people pay up to £ 100 a pint for it .
The Guilin farm also has its own small winery and acts as a distribution centre across China .
The distribution manager showed me around with a Chinese tourist .
A small dingy office acts as the nerve centre of the warehouse .
On the wall were charts showing that day 's deliveries of tiger wine across China .
Six crates were sent to Wuhan and another to Tianjing .
Six crates of ' powdered bear ' were sent to Shanghai .
Numerous other cities and countless deliveries were also listed .
We were led into the warehouse , where I was hit with the disgusting and potent aroma of tiger wine .
I was led past countless crates containing the foul - smelling brew .
In the corner of the warehouse was a huge brown earthenware vat .
It must have held at least 50 gallons , and its contents were probably worth around £ 12,000 .
" We have three ages of wine , " said the manager .
" Three , six or nine - years old .
It helps with arthritis and strengthens old people 's bones . "
She slid aside the lid of the earthenware vat to reveal a reddish - brown liquid with an overpowering smell of meths .
A piece of string was pulled out of the vat .
Attached to the end was a tiger 's rib cage .
Small slivers of dark red flesh could still be seen clinging to the bone , even though it had probably been in the vat for at least three years .
The manager then filled up an old plastic water bottle with a pint of wine and handed it to my fellow tourist .
He paid £ 30 for it .
Whatever westerners think of tiger wine , the Chinese regard it as a potent drink with almost magical qualities .
In the past , a Chinese doctor may have prescribed small quantities of wine for a short period of time .
But in recent years , big companies have moved into the market and industrialised all parts of the industry .
Now the wine is becoming an essential drink for China 's corrupt bureaucrats and the nation 's nouveaux riches .
Conservationists say tiger farming is not only barbaric , it could lead to the animal 's extinction in the wild .
" It is stimulating demand for meat and wine , and this will inevitably lead to more poaching , " says Grace Gabriel , of the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
" It costs £ 5,000 to raise a tiger from a cub to maturity in one of these farms , while it costs no more than £ 20 in India to poach one .
On the market , a dead tiger can fetch £ 20,000 .
" With such a huge margin , it is inevitable that more people will poach wild tigers if demand increases , " she adds .
" There are only a few thousand tigers left in the wild , and the last thing they need is increased demand for their body parts . "
If present trends continue , tigers could be extinct in the wild within a decade .
Three subspecies have already vanished .
Chinese tigers are down to a pitiful 20 animals in the wild and are " functionally extinct " .
There are only about 450 Siberian tigers left in Russia 's Far East .
The remaining 3-4,000 are sparsely scattered across India , Nepal and South - East Asia .
The trouble is that , as tigers become rarer in the wild , their ' street value ' increases , which in turn encourages even more poaching .
Tigers have already become extinct in India 's most famous reserve at Sariska .
Numbers have plunged in several other reserves , too .
Most of these tigers will have been sold to traders in China .
The Chinese authorities do virtually nothing to clamp down on this illegal trade , and many corrupt bureaucrats and police earn substantial sums from it .
And demand is continuing to increase as ever more bizarre uses for tigers are promoted .
Tiger whiskers are used to ' cure ' laziness and protect against bullets .
Their brains , when mixed with oil and rubbed on the skin , are promoted as a cure for acne .
Penises are used as aphrodisiacs , while hearts apparently impart courage , cunning and strength .
Tiger farmers also have their eyes on the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .
They hope that a huge influx of tourists will lead to increased demand for tiger wine .
Although it is illegal to trade internationally in such tiger products as wine , the Chinese are lobbying hard to get the law relaxed .
This June , the Chinese Government is expected to press the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) to allow the trade in ' medicines ' such as wine produced from farmed tigers .
If agreed , it will lead to a massive increase in tiger farming and tens of thousands of these noble beasts will spend their lives in battery cages .
If the Chinese get their way , then it will almost certainly drive the tigers over the cliff into extinction .
It is almost too late to save this magnificent creature - but not quite .

While we all may follow our own unique pursuits in a lifetime , the quest for purpose through self - improvement and knowledge is among the great unifiers of humankind .
Progressive thinking is the backbone of society 's progress .
Great visionaries and their quests for knowledge have inspired the majority of the modern marvels we rely on today .
While the process of seeking purpose in your life may not seem as universal or consequential as Einstein's , it is crucial to find how to learn in a way that works for you , which can lead to greater self - awareness and wisdom — not to mention a new job , better pay , a new hobby , or simply knowledge for knowledge 's sake — whatever is important to you as an end goal .
This brand of introspection and knowledge is not necessarily acquired through traditional means , and the learning techniques that work best may differ from one person to the next .
In fact , some of these tips may surprise you .
Imagine all of the ways you may have been perfecting how to learn to find your smartest self for years without even knowing it !
Health
Reduce stress + depression : Stress and depression can affect the ability to recall information and cause short - term memory loss .
In mild cases , depression can sometimes be improved simply by exposing yourself to more white light and eating fewer refined foods .
Shake a leg :
Lack of blood flow is a common reason for lack of concentration .
If you 've been sitting in one place for awhile , bounce or bend and flex one of your legs for a minute or two .
It gets your blood flowing and sharpens both concentration and recall abilities .
Food for thought : Eat breakfast .
A lot of people skip breakfast , but creativity is often optimal in the early morning and it helps to have some protein in you to " feed " your brain .
Plus , a lack of protein can actually cause headaches .
Food for thought , part 2 : Eat a light lunch .
Heavy lunches have a tendency to make people drowsy .
While you could turn this to your advantage by taking a " thinking nap " ( we 'll get to that later ) , most people have n't learned how to actually make this work on a regular basis .
Ginkgo biloba : Ginkgo biloba is a natural supplement that has been used in China and other countries for centuries and has been acclaimed for its brain - energizing properties .
Balance
Sleep on it : Hitting an REM cycle not only helps you rest and reset , it may also help with high - level problem solving .
Researchers at University of California , San Diego noticed that getting some rest and dreaming allowed creative thinkers to work through some of their toughest problems .
Take a break : Sometimes , in order to change your physical or mental perspective and lighten the invisible stress that can sometimes occur when you sit in one place too long , it helps to take a 5 - 15 minute break every hour during study sessions .
Studies show this is more beneficial than non -stop study , as it gives your mind time to relax and absorb information .
Take a hike : Changing your perspective ( and surroundings ) often relieves tension , thus freeing your creative mind .
Taking a short walk around the neighborhood may help you liberate those latent learning skills .
Change your focus :
Sometimes you just do n't have enough time to take a long break , however you can always just change subject focus .
Try alternating between technical and non-technical subjects , for example .
Perspective and Focus
Do walking meditation :
If you 're taking a hike , do n't stop there !
Go one step further and learn walking meditation as a way to tap into your inner resources and strengthen your ability to focus .
Just make sure to not get so carried away that you disregard safety and traffic rules .
Change your focus , part 2 : There are three primary ways to learn : visual , auditory , and kinesthetic ( VAK ) .
If one is n't working for you , simply try another .
Full immerse yourself : Focus only on whatever you 're studying , not watching TV at the same time or worrying yourself about other things .
Anxiety is known to inhibit the absorption of information and ideas .
Turn out the lights :
If meditation is n't for you , this can be another way to focus your mind .
Sit in the dark , to literally and figuratively block out extraneous influences .
This is especially helpful for learning something kinesthetically , such as guitar chord changes .
Take a bath or shower :
We know this one may be a bit surprising , but both activities can loosen you up , making your mind more receptive to recognizing brilliant ideas .
Recall Techniques
Listen to music : Research has long shown that certain types of music can act as a " key " to open doors and recall memories .
The theory is that Information learned while listening to a particular song or collection can often be recalled simply by replaying the songs in your head .
Speedread :
Some people believe that speedreading causes you to miss vital information , however the idea is that , when done right , speedreading results in filtering out irrelevant information .
If necessary , you can always read and re-read technical subjects that often require slower reading , though some studies show slow reading actually hinders the ability to absorb general ideas .
Trying this reading technique online ?
Try the free Spreeder application .
Use acronyms and other mnemonic devices : Mnemonics are essentially tricks for remembering information .
Some tricks are so effective that proper application will let you recall loads of mundane information months or even years later .
Visual Aids
Every picture tells a story : Draw or sketch whatever it is you are trying to achieve to help you visualize it .
Having a concrete goal in mind can help you progress towards reaching your goal .
Brainmap it : Need to plan something ?
Brain maps , or mind maps , offer a compact way to get both an overview of a project as well as better manage it .
Through mind mapping , you can see the relationships between disparate ideas and better utilize brainstorming techniques .
Learn symbolism and semiotics : Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols .
Having an understanding of the iconography of a particular discipline not only aids in the learning process , but also allows you to retain information more efficiently .
Use information design :
When dealing with information that has an inherent structure , applying the tenets of information design can help to convey that information more clearly .
A great resource is Information Aesthetics , which gives examples of different types of information design and provides links to their sources .
Use visual learning techniques :
Try gliffy to explore all kinds of structured diagrams , flow charts , and more and to see what might pique your visual interest .
If this works for you , find even more webbing and outlining ideas , plus graphic organizers , concept maps , and plots at Inspiration.com .
Map your task flow : Learning often requires gaining knowledge in a specific sequence .
Task flow mapping your course of actions , or organizing your thoughts on what needs to be done , is a powerful way to prepare yourself to complete tasks or learn " how to learn . "
Verbal and Auditory Techniques
Laugh :
This might seem counterproductive to the seriousness of studying , but that 's precisely the point : laughing relaxes the body , and a relaxed body is more receptive to new ideas .
Stimulate ideas :
It 's important to not overthink this one : play rhyming games , utter nonsense words , use word - association or stream - of - consciousness methods .
These techniques can help loosen you up , making you more receptive to learning .
Brainstorm :
This is a time - honored technique that combines verbal activity , writing , and collaboration .
While one person can brainstorm , it 's more effective in a group .
For effective brainstorming , follow these simple rules : firstly , do n't shut anyone 's idea out .
Secondly , do n't " edit " in progress ; just record all ideas first , then dissect them later .
Participating in brainstorming can help to assess a topic objectively and thoroughly .
Learn by osmosis :
Turn your iPod into an educational tool : find some podcasts that speak to you or are relevant to what you 're learning now , upload them , and sleep on it .
Literally .
Put your iPod under your pillow and play back your favorites to let them seep in overnight .
Binaural beats : Binaural beats involve playing two pure frequencies simultaneously to produce alpha , beta , delta , and theta waves , all of which can inspire either sleeping , restfulness , relaxation , meditativeness , alertness , or concentration .
Binaural beats are often used in conjunction with other exercises to enhance " super - learning " abilities .
Check out this free online binaural beat machine to see which tones will work for you .
Kinesthetic Techniques
Write , do n't type :
While typing your notes into the computer is great for posterity , writing by hand stimulates ideas .
The simple act of holding and using a pen or pencil may seem old - fashioned in this day and age , but just think of all the visionaries it 's worked for throughout the years .
Carry a notebook at all times : Samuel Taylor Coleridge dreamed the words of the poem " In Xanadu ( did Kubla Khan ) â¦ " .
Upon awakening , he wrote down what he could recall , but was distracted by a visitor and promptly forgot the rest of the poem .
Forever .
Should ideas suddenly come to you through " walking meditation " or any other methods on our list , record them immediately or you might regret it .
Keep a journal :
This is n't exactly the same as a notebook .
Journaling has to do with tracking experiences over time .
By adding in visual details , charts , brainmaps , etc. , journaling can be a much more creative way to keep tabs on what you are learning .
Organize :
Use sticky colored tabs of folder flags to divide a notebook or journal into sections .
They are a great way to partition ideas for easy reference .
Use post - it notes :
Post - it notes can provide a helpful way to record your thoughts about passages in books without defacing them with permanent ink or pencil marks .
Self - Motivation Techniques
Prepare yourself for learning : Positive thinking alone can't always help us to successfully achieve our goals , which is why it is especially important if you are an adult with many distractions surrounding your daily life to implement ways of reducing these distractions , at least for a few hours at a time .
Give yourself credit : Ideas are actually a dime a dozen .
If you learn to focus your mind on getting the results you want , you 'll recognize the good ideas , and your mind will become a filter for them , which will motivate you to learn more .
Motivate yourself :
Why do you seek knowledge ?
What do hope to achieve through learning ?
Exploring the reasons behind why you want to learn and what motivates you can help keep distractions at - bay .
Set a goal : W. Clement Stone once said " Whatever the mind of man can conceive , it can achieve . "
This phenomenon in goal achievement dictates that if you prepare yourself by whatever means necessary , any and all hurdles will seem surmountable .
Those who have experienced this phenomenon likely understand its validity .
Think positive :
After all , what 's the point in setting learning goals for yourself if you do n't have any faith in your own ability to learn ?
Every skill is learned : Bodily functions notwithstanding , every skill in life is learned .
Generally speaking , you can learn something new just as easily as anyone can .
It takes us all a varying amount of effort , but once you 've set your goal , it 's likely as achievable as it is believable .
Prepare yourself , part 2 : Unfortunately , not everyone in your life will be a well - wisher of your self - improvement and learning plans .
They may intentionally or subconsciously distract you from your goal .
If you have classes to attend after work , make sure that work colleagues know that you are unable to work late , for example .
Diplomacy works best , if you think your boss is intentionally giving you work on the days he / she knows you have to leave .
Reschedule such meetings to a later time if possible and / or necessary .
Constrain yourself :
Most people fundamentally need structure in their lives .
Freedom is sometimes a scary thing — like chaos .
But even chaos has order within .
By constraining yourself by giving yourself deadlines , limiting your time on any one idea , or focusing the tools you are working with , you can often accomplish even more in less time .
Supplemental Techniques
Read as much as you can :
This tip is perhaps the most self - explanatory on our list .
Use Spreeder if you have to .
Pursue a broad range of topics as well as depth of field .
Cross - pollinate your interests : Explore interdisciplinary study to your heart 's content .
After all , neurons that connect to existing neurons give you new perspectives and abilities to use knowledge in new ways .
Learn another language : New perspectives can also give you the ability to cross-pollinate cultural concepts and expand worldly inspiration .
Sometimes reading a book in its original language will provide you with insights that might otherwise be lost in translation .
Learn how to learn : Management
Help has a resource page especially geared towards online learning , but they 're also a valuable resource for any type of learning .
If you 're serious about optimizing your learning habits , check out this crash course in learning theory .
Learn what you know and what you do n't :
Many people might say , " I 'm dumb , " or " I do n't know anything about that . "
The fact is , many people are largely unaware of what they already know about a topic .
If you want to learn about something , you need to determine what you already know , figure out what you do n't , and then fill in the gaps .
Learn to effectively multi-task : Effective multi-tasking allows you to devote focused yet limited time to accomplish several tasks at once .
By effective multitasking , I do n't mean doing two or more things at exactly the same time —
It 's not possible .
However , multitasking with the right approach and prepping your mind for it are what can make it an effective technique .
For example , a successful freelance writer learns to manage several articles at the same time .
Research the first topic , and then let the background processes of your mind takeover before you move on consciously to the second topic .
While on the second topic , the first one will often become clear to you .
Think holistically : Holistic thinking might be the single most " advanced " learning technique to help students learn new things .
You may have even heard this word used to describe an overall mindset rather than as a single technique .
Use the right type of repetition to your advantage : Complex concepts often require revisiting in order to be fully absorbed .
For some people , this can take months or even years .
Repetition of concepts and theories , including concrete examples , improves absorption and speeds up the learning process .
Apply the Quantum Learning ( QL ) model :
The Quantum Learning model is being applied in some US schools to extend beyond typical education methods to engage students through five core components : foundation , atmosphere , environment , design , and delivery .
Get necessary tools :
Obviously , there are a variety of tools designed for learning .
If you are learning online like the majority of people are these days , then consider online study aids such as Quizlet and StudyBlue , as well as education communities like Edmodo and Schoology , among countless other tools .
Learn critical thinking : Critical thinking is a skill that is not only essential to the learning process but will carry you through life .
Read Wikipedia 's discourse on critical thinking as a starting point .
It involves good analytical skills to aid in one 's ability to learn selectively .
Learn complex problem solving :
For human beings in general , life is a series of problems to be solved , and learning is just part of the process .
Especially
If you have a complex problem , you need to learn the art of complex problem solving .
For Teachers , Tutors , and Parents
Be engaging : Lectures are often one - sided and thus can be counter - productive .
Information merely heard or observed ( from a chalkboard across the room , for instance ) is often forgotten .
Teaching is not simply talking .
Discussion is more important : ask students questions , present scenarios , and engage them .
Use information pyramids : Learning happens in layers .
Build a solid base of knowledge upon which you can continue to add advanced concepts .
Use video games : Video games get a bad rap because of the many distinctly non-educational violent titles out there nowadays .
But some video games can actually be an effective aid to learning , believe it or not .
Role play : Younger people often learn better by being part of an interactive learning experience .
For example , history is easier to absorb through reenactments , and can be further enhanced by using costumes , props , or other visual cues .
Apply the 80/20 rule :
This rule is often interpreted in different ways , but in this case , the 80/20 rule means that some concepts , say about 20 % of a curriculum , require more effort and time than roughly 80 % of others .
So be prepared to carve out time to expand on complex topics .
Tell stories :
However you can make a complex concept more relatable by telling a story or using metaphor , take the opportunity .
When a story works to help a student understand something they might otherwise see as too boring or complicated , you 'll see understanding sparked in the student 's eyes .
Go beyond the public school curriculum :
The public school system is still generally lacking in teaching advanced learning and brainstorming methods .
It 's not that the methods cannot be taught ; they just are n't .
To be afforded these advanced learning methods , you typically have to pay a premium in additional time , effort , and money .
While the standard for public schools and what is available to all students regardless of economic status is still a work - in - progress , you may need to seek supplemental resources such as tutoring or community programs to enhance learning for your kids .
Use applied learning :
If a high school student were having trouble in math , say with fractions , one example of applied learning might be to teach fractions using photography , lenses , or f-stops .
Another example is through cooking and measuring ingredients .
Tailor the applied learning to the interest of the student and the subject at - hand .
For Students and Self - Studiers
Be engaged : Sometimes students are bored because they know more than is being taught , maybe even more than a teacher .
Hopefully teachers will assess what each student already knows prior to that lesson .
Students should discuss with a teacher if they feel that the material being covered is not challenging enough , or consider asking for additional materials .
Teach yourself : Teachers cannot always change their curricula at their own discretion .
If you 're not being challenged , challenge yourself .
Some countries still apply country - wide exams for all students .
Even if courses from the top online education programs do n't cover a topic you 're interested in , you can learn it on your own .
Do n't wait for someone to teach you .
Even class lectures are more effective when you 've pre-introduced yourself to a concept .
Collaborate :
If studying by yourself is n't working , maybe a study group will help .
Teach something :
One of the best ways to learn something better is to teach it to someone else .
The process forces you to learn more yourself when you share your knowledge with another person .
Write about it :
An effective way to " teach " something online is to create a wiki page containing everything you know about a topic .
Or even create your own blog about it .
Doing so helps you to realize what you know and , more importantly , what you do n't .
You can still grab a freebie account on old favorites like WordPress or Blogger .
Learn by experience : Seems pretty obvious , but it simply means to put in the necessary time .
An expert is often defined as someone who has given their all and put countless hours of blood , sweat , and tears into a particular experience or endeavor .
Are you an expert without even realizing it ?
If not , do you have the dedication to become one ?
Quiz yourself : Testing what you 've learned will reinforce the information .
Flash cards have stood the test of time as one of the best self - test tools for kids and adults alike .
Learn the right things — or the basics — first : Case in point : consider the way a baby learns a new language ( hint : it 's not to learn grammar and spelling and sentence constructs first ) .
An adult or young adult should be no different .
Try immersing yourself in the basics instead and see the difference for yourself .
Plan your learning :
If you have a long - term plan to learn something , then to quote Led Zeppelin , " There are two paths you can go by " .
You can either take a haphazard approach to learning , or you can put in a bit of planning and find the optimum path .
Plan your time and balance learning with living your life .
Parting Advice
Persist : Do n't give up the pursuit of learning in the face of intimidating tasks .
Anything one human being can learn , most others can as well .
Take it from Thomas Edison , who said , " Genius is 1 % inspiration and 99 % perspiration " .
Challenge yourself : People are often more intelligent than they realize .
In a world that compares and criticizes everything so publicly , it 's harder and harder to know where we fit in .
And unexpected genius can be found in all walks of life .
If you suspect you have more potential than you 've shown to others or yourself , try an IQ test such as the one offered by MENSA .
Unlike the standardized IQ tests given in many schools , this test helps to comprehensively assess a student 's knowledge and learning ability .
And the mere ability to learn is far , far more important than what you already know .
Party before an exam : OK , maybe not a party , but the key is to relax .
The worse thing to do is cram the night before an exam .
If you do n't already know a subject by then , cramming is n't going to help .
If you have studied , simply review the topic , then go do something pleasant ( not studying ) .
Doing so tells your brain that you are prepared and that you will be able to recall anything that you have already learned .
On the other hand , if you did n't spend the semester learning the ideas you need , you might as well go party anyway because cramming at the last minute is n't going to help much at that point .

Zell Miller : Abortion has shrunk our military , hurt social security , caused illegal immigration Michael Roston
Published : Friday March 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Zell Miller , the former Democratic Senator from Georgia who backed President George W. Bush in 2004 and spoke at the Republican National Convention , recently told an anti-abortion gathering that the " killing " of unborn babies was the cause of many of America 's woes , including its military , social security , and immigration problems .
" How could this great land of plenty produce too few people in the last 30 years ? "
Miller asked .
" Here is the brutal truth that no one dares to mention :
We re too few because too many of our babies have been killed . "
Miller claimed that 45 million babies have been " killed " since the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade in 1973 .
" If those 45 million children had lived , today they would be defending our country , they would be filling our jobs , they would be paying into Social Security , " he asserted .
Miller was speaking at a fund raiser for Sav a Life Center of Macon , Georgia , an organization which tries to persuade women not to have abortions .
In 2004 , Miller abandoned his fellow Democrats and came out in favor of the policies and re-election of President Bush .
At the Republican National Convention in New York City , referring to his grandchildren , Miller declared " There is but one man to whom I am willing to entrust their future and that man 's name is George W. Bush . "
He also slammed Senator John Kerry on security in the speech .
" For more than twenty years , on every one of the great issues of freedom and security , John Kerry has been more wrong , more weak , and more wobbly than any other national figure , " he remarked .
An article from Terrence Jeffrey in Jan. 2004 spelled out some of the influences that caused Miller to become a pro-life , anti-choice Democrat .
" Many sources influenced his thinking .
They range from the birth of his great - grandchildren , to Sean Hannity 's apt comparison of Roe to Dred Scott , to Newsweek 's cover of an unborn child , to two female college students who challenged him on the right - to - life , to signs carried by some women in the March for Life , " he wrote .
The story was first publicized at the Macon Telegraph , where a video of some of Miller 's remarks can be viewed .

It 's Undeniable Friday !
Every Friday , in addition to an odd little factoid , UndeniableFacts.com gives you a fun puzzle , illusion , or activity to enjoy and share .
Today : Un - dissolving Dye
The effect : You stir a glass of colored water with a simple wooden stick and , contrary to expectations , the dye and water separate , leaving the water clear , and the dye at the bottom of the glass .
Materials : Wooden or bamboo stick ( I used a plain chopstick ) Candle wax ( not beeswax ; too many electrolytes from the hornets ' abdomens ) A pot or saucepan3 tin cans1 tbsp salt1 tbsp vinegar powder ( or other acidic powder ) 1 tbsp baking soda ( or other alkaline powder ) The setup : Divide the wax into three equal portions .
You will be melting three batches of wax , so put one portion into each can .
Put enough water into the pot so that the water level comes to about half way up one of the cans .
Turn on the stove and wait for the wax to begin to melt .
Once it begins to melt , sprinkle the vinegar powder into the can , trying to distribute it evenly .
Once the wax has completely melted , and you can no longer see bumps on top from the vinegar powder , dip the wooden stick in several times to get a good thick coat of wax on it .
Set the stick aside , and carefully remove the can from the pot ( use an oven mitt or tongs ! ) and throw it away .
Now repeat this process two more times , using the salt instead of vinegar powder for the second batch , and the baking soda for the third batch .
Once the stick cools , your work is done .
Try a test run : mix some food coloring with some water and then stir it with your wax - coated stick .
It 's like magic !
The explanation : Water is a polar molecule .
This means that one side of the molecule has a positive charge , while the other side has a negative charge .
Because of this , water can only dissolve other polar molecules .
The dye in food coloring is a polar molecule , which is why it dissolves .
The key to this trick is to temporarily force the molecules in the dye to become non-polar .
The wax - coated stick does this because the wax is " doped " with three different ionic compounds .
The one in the center has a positive charge , while the one on the outside has a negative charge .
The result is a material which acts like a polar solution , but whose " molecules " cannot easily turn around .
There 's something else I did n't tell you about water molecules : their centers are also negatively charged .
Remember , in the world of physics , opposites attract .
This means that the water molecules are weakly repelled by the negatively charged exterior layer of the wax .
More balanced polar molecules , like those in the dye , are not repelled , and so the net effect is that they move towards the wax .
As they do so , their electrical imbalance is satisfied , which means they act like non-polar molecules .
As a result , they precipitate from the water , allowing you to separate the solution .
Google brings maps to phones By Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY LOS ANGELES  Internet search giant Google introduces its first downloadable cellphone application on Monday , bringing its acclaimed map technology to phones .
Now cellphone users can get Google 's map service on the go .
Google With Google Local for mobile devices , users can get colorful , overhead views of a neighborhood and even check a hotel listing to see how close it is to the beach .
Unlike most new cellphone offerings that work on only a handful of phones , Google 's application can be used on more than 100 current phones that use the Java programming language .
That includes models from Cingular , Sprint Nextel and T - Mobile .
Verizon 's phones use a different programming language , as do BlackBerrys and Palm devices , so they are not compatible .
Google 's application and service is free , but users will need an Internet data plan from their cellphone provider , which adds $ 10 to $ 25 to monthly bills .
To test the service , Google lent Sprint 's MM - A800 by Samsung ( $ 179 , with contract ) to reviewers .
But Sprint says many models work with the program — including the free ( with contract ) V1660 by Samsung .
Check www.google.com/glm to see whether your phone is on the list .

• Software " We know local information is a big deal for our users , " says Deep Nishar , Google 's director of product management .
Google 's search engine is currently available to cellphone users with an Internet data plan , but this is the first time Google has added graphics in a separate application to wireless devices .
" Text results for a search are fine , but sometimes you need to use a map to orient yourself , " Nishar says .
Yahoo has a competing search and map program for mobile phones , heavy on text and light on graphics .
For most consumers , that 's just fine , says Chris Sherman , the editor of the SearchDay blog .
Google 's Local for mobile is " one of the slickest applications to come to cellphones , " Sherman says .
" It 's nice to have , especially if you 're in a new city and do n't know where you 're going .
But otherwise , I 'd probably just stick with the text . "
Using Google 's local application on a mobile phone is a good deal more complicated than on the Web , unless you have a phone with a traditional qwerty keyboard .
Users must switch a phone 's numeric keyboard into letter mode and find the button on the phone that doubles as the " enter " button .
That takes time to get used to .
Google 's program , like most local wireless applications , is ad - free .
Greg Sterling , an analyst for researcher Kelsey Group , sees wireless local applications reaping $ 386 million in advertising by 2009 , vs. practically nothing today .

( This article was written as a kind of business plan for a new language .
So it is missing ( because it takes for granted ) the most important feature of a good programming language : very powerful abstractions . )
A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language .
The expert told him that it would be a waste of time , that programming languages do n't become popular or unpopular based on their merits , and so no matter how good his language was , no one would use it .
At least , that was what had happened to the language he had designed .
What does make a language popular ?
Do popular languages deserve their popularity ?
Is it worth trying to define a good programming language ?
How would you do it ?
I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking at hackers , and learning what they want .
Programming languages are for hackers , and a programming language is good as a programming language ( rather than , say , an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design ) if and only if hackers like it .
1 The Mechanics of Popularity
It 's true , certainly , that most people do n't choose programming languages simply based on their merits .
Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else .
And yet I think the effect of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages is not as great as it's sometimes thought to be .
I think a bigger problem is that a hacker 's idea of a good programming language is not the same as most language designers ' .
Between the two , the hacker 's opinion is the one that matters .
Programming languages are not theorems .
They 're tools , designed for people , and they have to be designed to suit human strengths and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet .
If a shoe pinches when you put it on , it 's a bad shoe , however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture .
It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one .
But that 's no different with any other tool .
It does n't mean that it 's a waste of time to try designing a good language .
Expert hackers can tell a good language when they see one , and they 'll use it .
Expert hackers are a tiny minority , admittedly , but that tiny minority write all the good software , and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers will tend to use whatever language they use .
Often , indeed , it is not merely influence but command : often the expert hackers are the very people who , as their bosses or faculty advisors , tell the other programmers what language to use .
The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines the relative popularity of programming languages — legacy software ( Cobol ) and hype ( Ada , Java ) also play a role — but I think it is the most powerful force over the long term .
Given an initial critical mass and enough time , a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be .
And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones , because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements .
Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life .
Perl and Fortran are extreme cases , but even Lisp has changed a lot .
Lisp 1.5 did n't have macros , for example ; these evolved later , after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs . [ 1 ]
So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular , I think a language has to be popular to be good .
And it has to stay popular to stay good .
The state of the art in programming languages does n't stand still .
And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s , because that 's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base .
Of course , hackers have to know about a language before they can use it .
How are they to hear ?
From other hackers .
But there has to be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even to hear about it .
I wonder how large this group has to be ; how many users make a critical mass ?
Off the top of my head , I 'd say twenty .
If a language had twenty separate users , meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it , I 'd consider it to be real .
Getting there can't be easy .
I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand .
The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use a trojan horse : to give people an application they want , which happens to be written in the new language .
2 External Factors
Let 's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a programming language .
To become popular , a programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular system .
Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes .
C was the scripting language of Unix , and so , later , was Perl .
Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascript are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers .
Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the scripting language of a massively popular system .
What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s , when it was the scripting language of MIT .
A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point .
And in the early 1970s , before C , MIT 's dialect of Lisp , called MacLisp , was one of the only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use .
Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular systems , Emacs and Autocad , and for that reason I suspect that most of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp .
Programming languages do n't exist in isolation .
To hack is a transitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and in practice languages are judged relative to whatever they 're used to hack .
So if you want to design a popular language , you either have to supply more than a language , or you have to design your language to replace the scripting language of some existing system .
Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan .
It did originally come with a system to hack : the Lisp Machine .
But Lisp Machines ( along with parallel computers ) were steamrollered by the increasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s .
Common Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting language for Unix .
It is , alas , an atrociously bad one .
One way to describe this situation is to say that a language is n't judged on its own merits .
Another view is that a programming language really is n't a programming language unless it's also the scripting language of something .
This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise .
I think it 's no more unfair than expecting a programming language to have , say , an implementation .
It 's just part of what a programming language is .
A programming language does need a good implementation , of course , and this must be free .
Companies will pay for software , but individual hackers wo n't , and it 's the hackers you need to attract .
A language also needs to have a book about it .
The book should be thin , well - written , and full of good examples .
K&R is the ideal here .
At the moment I 'd almost say that a language has to have a book published by O'Reilly .
That 's becoming the test of mattering to hackers .
There should be online documentation as well .
In fact , the book can start as online documentation .
But I do n't think that physical books are outmoded yet .
Their format is convenient , and the de facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect filter .
Bookstores are one of the most important places for learning about new languages .
3 Brevity
Given that you can supply the three things any language needs — a free implementation , a book , and something to hack — how do you make a language that hackers will like ?
One thing hackers like is brevity .
Hackers are lazy , in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy : they hate anything extraneous .
It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use , at least subconsciously , based on the total number of characters he 'll have to type .
If this is n't precisely how hackers think , a language designer would do well to act as if it were .
It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long - winded expressions that are meant to resemble English .
Cobol is notorious for this flaw .
A hacker would consider being asked to write
add x to y giving z
instead of
z = x+y
as something between an insult to his intelligence and a sin against God .
It has sometimes been said that Lisp should use first and rest instead of car and cdr , because it would make programs easier to read .
Maybe for the first couple hours .
But a hacker can learn quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr means the rest .
Using first and rest means 50 % more typing .
And they are also different lengths , meaning that the arguments wo n't line up when they 're called , as car and cdr often are , in successive lines .
I 've found that it matters a lot how code lines up on the page .
I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable - width font , and friends say this is true for other languages too .
Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose .
All other things being equal , no one wants to begin a program with a bunch of declarations .
Anything that can be implicit , should be .
The individual tokens should be short as well .
Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question .
Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense , while the names of built - in Common Lisp operators are comically long .
The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them .
But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing it .
There is also the cost of reading it , and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen .
4 Hackability
There is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker : being able to do what you want .
In the history of programming languages a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers from doing things considered to be improper .
This is a dangerously presumptuous plan .
How can the language designer know what the programmer is going to need to do ?
I think language designers would do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will need to do things they never anticipated , rather than a bumbler who needs to be protected from himself .
The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway .
You may save him from referring to variables in another package , but you can't save him from writing a badly designed program to solve the wrong problem , and taking forever to do it .
Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things .
By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade the language is trying to present : getting hold of the internal representation of some high - level abstraction , for example .
Hackers like to hack , and hacking means getting inside things and second guessing the original designer .
Let yourself be second guessed .
When you make any tool , people use it in ways you did n't intend , and this is especially true of a highly articulated tool like a programming language .
Many a hacker will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never imagined .
I say , let them ; give the programmer access to as much internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like the garbage collector .
In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields of a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object , for example , or find fields that are uninitialized .
I know the structs are just vectors underneath .
And yet I can't write a general purpose function that I can call on any struct .
I can only access the fields by name , because that 's what a struct is supposed to mean .
A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once or twice in a big program .
But what a difference it makes to be able to .
And it may be more than a question of just solving a problem .
There is a kind of pleasure here too .
Hackers share the surgeon 's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards , the teenager 's secret pleasure in popping zits . [ 2 ]
For boys , at least , certain kinds of horrors are fascinating .
Maxim magazine publishes an annual volume of photographs , containing a mix of pin-ups and grisly accidents .
They know their audience .
Historically , Lisp has been good at letting hackers have their way .
The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration .
Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything .
A good deal of that spirit is , fortunately , preserved in macros .
What a wonderful thing , to be able to make arbitrary transformations on the source code .
Classic macros are a real hacker 's tool — simple , powerful , and dangerous .
It 's so easy to understand what they do : you call a function on the macro's arguments , and whatever it returns gets inserted in place of the macro call .
Hygienic macros embody the opposite principle .
They try to protect you from understanding what they 're doing .
I have never heard hygienic macros explained in one sentence .
And they are a classic example of the dangers of deciding what programmers are allowed to want .
Hygienic macros are intended to protect me from variable capture , among other things , but variable capture is exactly what I want in some macros .
A really good language should be both clean and dirty : cleanly designed , with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal operators , but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their way with it .
C is like this .
So were the early Lisps .
A real hacker 's language will always have a slightly raffish character .
A good programming language should have features that make the kind of people who use the phrase " software engineering " shake their heads disapprovingly .
At the other end of the continuum are languages like Ada and Pascal , models of propriety that are good for teaching and not much else .
5 Throwaway Programs
To be attractive to hackers , a language must be good for writing the kinds of programs they want to write .
And that means , perhaps surprisingly , that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs .
A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task : a program to automate some system administration task , or generate test data for a simulation , or convert data from one format to another .
The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that , like the " temporary " buildings built at so many American universities during World War II , they often do n't get thrown away .
Many evolve into real programs , with real features and real users .
I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way , rather than being designed big from the start , like the Hoover Dam .
It 's terrifying to build something big from scratch .
When people take on a project that 's too big , they become overwhelmed .
The project either gets bogged down , or the result is sterile and wooden : a shopping mall rather than a real downtown , Brasilia rather than Rome , Ada rather than C .
Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwaway program and keep improving it .
This approach is less daunting , and the design of the program benefits from evolution .
I think , if one looked , that this would turn out to be the way most big programs were developed .
And those that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first written in , because it 's rare for a program to be ported , except for political reasons .
And so , paradoxically , if you want to make a language that is used for big systems , you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs , because that 's where big systems come from .
Perl is a striking example of this idea .
It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs , but was pretty much a throwaway program itself .
Perl began life as a collection of utilities for generating reports , and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger .
It was not until Perl 5 ( if then ) that the language was suitable for writing serious programs , and yet it was already massively popular .
What makes a language good for throwaway programs ?
To start with , it must be readily available .
A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour .
So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you 're using .
It ca n't be something you have to install before you use it .
It has to be there .
C was there because it came with the operating system .
Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system administrators , and yours had already installed it .
Being available means more than being installed , though .
An interactive language , with a command - line interface , is more available than one that you have to compile and run separately .
A popular programming language should be interactive , and start up fast .
Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity .
Brevity is always attractive to hackers , and never more so than in a program they expect to turn out in an hour .
6 Libraries
Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you , and merely to call it .
And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages : library functions .
Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings .
This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs , which are often originally written for converting or extracting data .
Many
Perl programs probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck together .
I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions .
I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language .
Programming language design will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly typed , or object oriented , or functional , or whatever , but about how to design great libraries .
The kind of language designers who like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this .
It 's almost like writing applications !
Too bad .
Languages are for programmers , and libraries are what programmers need .
It 's hard to design good libraries .
It 's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code .
Once the libraries get too big , it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the code yourself .
Libraries need to be designed using a small set of orthogonal operators , just like the core language .
It ought to be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do what he needs .
Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short .
There are only rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings , and almost none for talking to the operating system .
For historical reasons , Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS does n't exist .
And because you can't talk to the OS , you 're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built - in operators in Common Lisp .
You have to use some implementation - specific hacks as well , and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want .
Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support .
7 Syntax
Could a language with Lisp 's syntax , or more precisely , lack of syntax , ever become popular ?
I do n't know the answer to this question .
I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp is n't currently popular .
Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar syntax .
I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefix syntax and yet use Perl by default , because it has powerful string libraries and can talk to the os .
There are two possible problems with prefix notation : that it is unfamiliar to programmers , and that it is not dense enough .
The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is the real one .
I 'm not so sure .
Yes , prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic .
But I do n't think ordinary programmers ' opinions matter .
Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them , and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation .
Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible , but that has not stood in the way of Perl 's popularity .
If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult .
A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation .
For expert hackers , that really is a problem .
No one wants to write ( aref a x y ) when they could write a [x , y ] .
In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of the problem .
If we treat data structures as if they were functions on indexes , we could write ( a x y ) instead , which is even shorter than the Perl form .
Similar tricks may shorten other types of expressions .
We can get rid of ( or make optional ) a lot of parentheses by making indentation significant .
That 's how programmers read code anyway : when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another , we go by the indentation .
Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs shorter .
Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read .
This is especially true for math expressions .
I 've used Lisp my whole programming life and I still do n't find prefix math expressions natural .
And yet it is convenient , especially when you 're generating code , to have operators that take any number of arguments .
So if we do have infix syntax , it should probably be implemented as some kind of read - macro .
I do n't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp , as long as it translates in a well - understood way into underlying s-expressions .
There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp .
It 's not necessarily bad to introduce more , as long as no one is forced to use it .
In Common Lisp , some delimiters are reserved for the language , suggesting that at least some of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future .
One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp occurs in format strings ; format is a language in its own right , and that language is not Lisp .
If there were a plan for introducing more syntax into Lisp , format specifiers might be able to be included in it .
It would be a good thing if macros could generate format specifiers the way they generate any other kind of code .
An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to the section format .
Mine too .
This probably indicates room for improvement .
It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O .
8 Efficiency
A good language , as everyone knows , should generate fast code .
But in practice I do n't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language .
As Knuth pointed out long ago , speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks .
And as many programmers have observed since , one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are .
So , in practice , the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler , rather than by , say , making the language strongly typed .
You do n't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program .
You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks .
And even more , you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are .
One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it 's hard to tell what 's expensive .
This might be true .
It might also be inevitable , if you want to have a very abstract language .
And in any case I think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem : you 'd soon learn what was expensive .
Part of the problem here is social .
Language designers like to write fast compilers .
That 's how they measure their skill .
They think of the profiler as an add - on , at best .
But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code .
Here , again , language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users .
They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem .
It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it .
For example , the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code .
Another approach would be to somehow represent what 's happening in running programs .
This would be an especially big win in server - based applications , where you have lots of running programs to look at .
An active profiler could show graphically what 's happening in memory as a program 's running , or even make sounds that tell what 's happening .
Sound is a good cue to problems .
In one place I worked , we had a big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers .
The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned .
I could n't see the board from my desk , but I found that I could tell immediately , by the sound , when there was a problem with a server .
It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically detect inefficient algorithms .
I would not be surprised if certain patterns of memory access turned out to be sure signs of bad algorithms .
If there were a little guy running around inside the computer executing our programs , he would probably have as long and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government employee .
I often have a feeling that I 'm sending the processor on a lot of wild goose chases , but I 've never had a good way to look at what it 's doing .
A number of Lisps now compile into byte code , which is then executed by an interpreter .
This is usually done to make the implementation easier to port , but it could be a useful language feature .
It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language , and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks .
Then such optimizations would be portable too .
The nature of speed , as perceived by the end - user , may be changing .
With the rise of server - based applications , more and more programs may turn out to be i/o - bound .
It will be worth making i/o fast .
The language can help with straightforward measures like simple , fast , formatted output functions , and also with deep structural changes like caching and persistent objects .
Users are interested in response time .
But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important : the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor .
Many of the interesting applications written in the near future will be server - based , and the number of users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such applications .
In the capital cost of a business offering a server - based application , this is the divisor .
For years , efficiency has n't mattered much in most end - user applications .
Developers have been able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their desk .
And by Parkinson 's Law , software has expanded to use the resources available .
That will change with server - based applications .
In that world , the hardware and software will be supplied together .
For companies that offer server - based applications , it will make a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can support per server .
In some applications , the processor will be the limiting factor , and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize .
But often memory will be the limit ; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user 's data .
The language can help here too .
Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single heap .
It may also help to have persistent objects and / or language level support for lazy loading .
9 Time
The last ingredient a popular language needs is time .
No one wants to write programs in a language that might go away , as so many programming languages do .
So most hackers will tend to wait until a language has been around for a couple years before even considering using it .
Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover this , but you need time to get any message through to people .
A friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks him .
He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn out not to want .
To avoid wasting his time , he waits till the third or fourth time he 's asked to do something ; by then , whoever 's asking him may be fairly annoyed , but at least they probably really do want whatever they 're asking for .
Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about .
They do n't even start paying attention until they 've heard about something ten times .
They 're perfectly justified : the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time , and eventually go away .
By delaying learning VRML , I avoided having to learn it at all .
So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating their message for years before people will start to get it .
We wrote what was , as far as I know , the first web - server based application , and it took us years to get it through to people that it did n't have to be downloaded .
It was n't that they were stupid .
They just had us tuned out .
The good news is , simple repetition solves the problem .
All you have to do is keep telling your story , and eventually people will start to hear .
It 's not when people notice you 're there that they pay attention ; it 's when they notice you 're still there .
It 's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum .
Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they 're first launched — programming languages especially .
Nothing could be better , for a new techology , than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters .
Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding , and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology .
When you only have a few users you can be in close contact with all of them .
And early adopters are forgiving when you improve your system , even if this causes some breakage .
There are two ways new technology gets introduced : the organic growth method , and the big bang method .
The organic growth method is exemplified by the classic seat - of - the - pants underfunded garage startup .
A couple guys , working in obscurity , develop some new technology .
They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few ( fanatically devoted ) users .
They continue to improve the technology , and meanwhile their user base grows by word of mouth .
Before they know it , they 're big .
The other approach , the big bang method , is exemplified by the VC - backed , heavily marketed startup .
They rush to develop a product , launch it with great publicity , and immediately ( they hope ) have a large user base .
Generally , the garage guys envy the big bang guys .
The big bang guys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs .
They can afford the best of everything , and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities .
The organic growth guys , sitting in their garage , feel poor and unloved .
And yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves .
Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method .
If you look at the dominant technologies today , you 'll find that most of them grew organically .
This pattern does n't only apply to companies .
You see it in sponsored research too .
Multics and Common Lisp were big- bang projects , and Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects .
10 Redesign
" The best writing is rewriting , " wrote E. B. White .
Every good writer knows this , and it 's true for software too .
The most important part of design is redesign .
Programming languages , especially , do n't get redesigned enough .
To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposing ideas in your head .
You need the young hacker 's naive faith in his abilities , and at the same time the veteran 's skepticism .
You have to be able to think how hard can it be ?
with one half of your brain while thinking it will never work with the other .
The trick is to realize that there 's no real contradiction here .
You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things .
You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem , but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you 've got so far .
People who do good work often think that whatever they 're working on is no good .
Others see what they 've done and are full of wonder , but the creator is full of worry .
This pattern is no coincidence : it is the worry that made the work good .
If you can keep hope and worry balanced , they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward .
In the first phase of the two - cycle innovation engine , you work furiously on some problem , inspired by your confidence that you 'll be able to solve it .
In the second phase , you look at what you 've done in the cold light of morning , and see all its flaws very clearly .
But as long as your critical spirit does n't outweigh your hope , you 'll be able to look at your admittedly incomplete system , and think , how hard can it be to get the rest of the way ? , thereby continuing the cycle .
It 's tricky to keep the two forces balanced .
In young hackers , optimism predominates .
They produce something , are convinced it 's great , and never improve it .
In old hackers , skepticism predominates , and they wo n't even dare to take on ambitious projects .
Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good .
Prose can be rewritten over and over until you 're happy with it .
But software , as a rule , does n't get redesigned enough .
Prose has readers , but software has users .
If a writer rewrites an essay , people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility .
Users are a double - edged sword .
They can help you improve your language , but they can also deter you from improving it .
So choose your users carefully , and be slow to grow their number .
Having users is like optimization : the wise course is to delay it .
Also , as a general rule , you can at any given time get away with changing more than you think .
Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage : the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it .
Everyone knows that it's not a good idea to have a language designed by a committee .
Committees yield bad design .
But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign .
It is so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother .
Whatever a committee decides tends to stay that way , even if most of the members do n't like it .
Even a committee of two gets in the way of redesign .
This happens particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written by two different people .
To change the interface both have to agree to change it at once .
And so interfaces tend not to change at all , which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc parts of any system .
One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces are horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are always vertically stacked strata of abstraction .
Then the interface will tend to be owned by one of them .
The lower of two levels will either be a language in which the upper is written , in which case the lower level will own the interface , or it will be a slave , in which case the interface can be dictated by the upper level .
11 Lisp
What all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp .
There is hope for any language that gives hackers what they want , including Lisp .
I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackers are turned off by Lisp 's strangeness .
This comforting illusion may have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp , or at least Common Lisp , which is that it sucks for doing what hackers want to do .
A hacker 's language needs powerful libraries and something to hack .
Common Lisp has neither .
A hacker 's language is terse and hackable .
Common Lisp is not .
The good news is , it 's not Lisp that sucks , but Common Lisp .
If we can develop a new Lisp that is a real hacker 's language , I think hackers will use it .
They will use whatever language does the job .
All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages .
History offers some encouragement .
Over time , successive new programming languages have taken more and more features from Lisp .
There is no longer much left to copy before the language you 've made is Lisp .
The latest hot language , Python , is a watered - down Lisp with infix syntax and no macros .
A new Lisp would be a natural step in this progression .
I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to call it an improved version of Python .
That sounds hipper than Lisp .
To many people , Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses .
Fritz Kunze 's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L - word .
But my guess is that we should n't be afraid to call the new Lisp Lisp .
Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the very best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it , for example .
And those are the users you need to win .
In " How to Become a Hacker , " Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise , even though you wo n't actually use it : Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it ; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot .
If I did n't know Lisp , reading this would set me asking questions .
A language that would make me a better programmer , if it means anything at all , means a language that would be better for programming .
And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying .
As long as that idea is still floating around , I think hackers will be receptive enough to a new Lisp , even if it is called Lisp .
But this Lisp must be a hacker 's language , like the classic Lisps of the 1970s .
It must be terse , simple , and hackable .
And it must have powerful libraries for doing what hackers want to do now .
In the matter of libraries I think there is room to beat languages like Perl and Python at their own game .
A lot of the new applications that will need to be written in the coming years will be server - based applications .
There 's no reason a new Lisp should n't have string libraries as good as Perl , and if this new Lisp also had powerful libraries for server - based applications , it could be very popular .
Real hackers wo n't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let them solve hard problems with a few library calls .
Remember , hackers are lazy .
It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for server - based applications .
For example , explicit support for programs with multiple users , or data ownership at the level of type tags .
Server - based applications also give us the answer to the question of what this new Lisp will be used to hack .
It would not hurt to make Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix .
( It would be hard to make it worse . )
But I think there are areas where existing languages would be easier to beat .
I think it might be better to follow the model of Tcl , and supply the Lisp together with a complete system for supporting server - based applications .
Lisp is a natural fit for server - based applications .
Lexical closures provide a way to get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of web pages .
S - expressions map nicely onto html , and macros are good at generating it .
There need to be better tools for writing server - based applications , and there needs to be a new Lisp , and the two would work very well together .
12 The Dream Language
By way of summary , let 's try describing the hacker 's dream language .
The dream language is beautiful , clean , and terse .
It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast .
You can write programs to solve common problems with very little code .
Nearly all the code in any program you write is code that 's specific to your application .
Everything else has been done for you .
The syntax of the language is brief to a fault .
You never have to type an unnecessary character , or even to use the shift key much .
Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program very quickly .
Later , when you want to optimize , there 's a really good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention .
You can make inner loops blindingly fast , even writing inline byte code if you need to .
There are lots of good examples to learn from , and the language is intuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples in a couple minutes .
You do n't need to look in the manual much .
The manual is thin , and has few warnings and qualifications .
The language has a small core , and powerful , highly orthogonal libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language .
The libraries all work well together ; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera .
Nothing is deprecated , or retained for compatibility .
The source code of all the libraries is readily available .
It 's easy to talk to the operating system and to applications written in other languages .
The language is built in layers .
The higher - level abstractions are built in a very transparent way out of lower - level abstractions , which you can get hold of if you want .
Nothing is hidden from you that does n't absolutely have to be .
The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work , rather than as a way of telling you what to do .
In fact , the language encourages you to be an equal participant in its design .
You can change everything about it , including even its syntax , and anything you write has , as much as possible , the same status as what comes predefined .
Notes
[ 1 ] Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy Hart in 1964 , two years after Lisp 1.5 was released .
What was missing , initially , were ways to avoid variable capture and multiple evaluation ;
Hart 's examples are subject to both .
[ 2 ]
In When the Air Hits Your Brain , neurosurgeon Frank Vertosick recounts a conversation in which his chief resident , Gary , talks about the difference between surgeons and internists ( " fleas " ) : Gary and I ordered a large pizza and found an open booth .
The chief lit a cigarette .
" Look at those goddamn fleas , jabbering about some disease they 'll see once in their lifetimes .
That 's the trouble with fleas , they only like the bizarre stuff .
They hate their bread and butter cases .
That 's the difference between us and the fucking fleas .
See , we love big juicy lumbar disc herniations , but they hate hypertension .... "
It 's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy ( except literally ) .
And yet I think I know what they mean .
I 've often had a juicy bug to track down .
Someone who 's not a programmer would find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug .
Surely it 's better if everything just works .
In one way , it is .
And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction in hunting down certain sorts of bugs .

Five Questions about Language Design
How to Become a Hacker
Japanese Translation
A President is afforded some leeway to interpret Congressional laws which must be executed by the Executive Branch .
Under our system , if the executive branch oversteps its bounds when it implements a program under its reasonable interpretation of the law , then there is an interim period between implementation of the program and eventual redress by the courts or Congress in which citizens ’ rights are violated .
The violation of our rights during this interim period would not usually be considered as any kind of repeal or amendment of the law because redress will occur in the usual course of our process to ensure that the existing laws are honored .
Therefore , Bush ’s interpretation and implementation of programs is just business as usual in our democracy , or so the White House often says .
If this were anyone other than the worst President in our history , then this meme might have some traction .
The problem is that Bush has injected steroids into this power so that he may unilaterally change laws .
It is not business as usual when the President ’s interpretation of laws is based consistently on legal analysis that is twisted upside down and contrary to the majority view of courts , experts and scholars on the most basic and simple issues .
It is not business as usual when the President abuses his powers to prevent the courts and Congress from providing the remedies that our system envisions to stop the violation of our rights .
It is not business as usual when the President demands that the laws be changed to adopt or legalize his illegal programs retroactively .
And , it is not business as usual when the President demands that these new laws also provide retroactive immunity to him and executive branch officials .
It is one thing if a President obtains reasonable legal analysis of how to interpret laws which the Executive Branch must implement , and then the process of review by the courts or Congress can take place to redress any violations which occur during the period between implementation and redress .
However , if it is the intent and plan of the President from the beginning to say the hell with the laws , implement a program that violates these laws , and then ultimately plan to change the laws to legalize his programs and provide immunity , then there is no redress for violation of our rights .
That interim period between implementation and redress then becomes a period when the laws were repealed or amended de facto by the President .
We have seen this with Bush ’s NSA spying program on Americans .
Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to protect us by imposing a warrant requirement before government surveillance .
The law was straightforward and clear that government surveillance required a warrant , but Bush defended his actions with a convoluted theory of unitary executive powers to change the law .
Bush then used his usual secrecy cloaks of national security and classified information to prevent judicial redress and Congressional oversight while seeking a new law to adopt his program and provide him with retroactive immunity for violating our rights .
If Bush succeeds , then essentially the " law " that determined our rights for the past 5 years was not FISA , but Bush ’s interpretation of FISA .
Bush is using this same game plan to repeal or amend our privacy rights .
The Privacy Act Of 1974 .
Congress enacted the Privacy Act of 1974 as a response to Nixon ’s abuse of our privacy rights , such as using confidential government records to intimidate political enemies .
This law was designed to balance individual rights and national defense .
After 9/11 , Congress revisited this privacy v. national defense debate , concluding that the federal government may need to enhance or create additional powers to fight terrorism and that this shift in power to the government required a new system of checks and balances to protect our rights and liberties .
Congress enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( IRTPA ) partially to authorize Bush to establish a privacy rights board to oversee the protection of our rights while our government collected and used " terrorism information " to fight the " war on terror . "
Given Bush ’s history of expanding the definition of terrorism to include data on ordinary Americans , Congress mandated that the privacy board review laws , regulations and executive branch policies not only at the proposal or drafting stage but also at the implementation stage .
A brief overview of the Privacy Act of 1974 summarizes our existing rights which Bush now seeks to repeal or amend .
The Privacy Act created a process for the collection , maintenance , use or dissemination by the federal government of records , which are defined broadly to include " any item , collection , or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency , " such as educational or financial data , and which contains identifying information , such as name , number or symbol .
The law requires the federal government to inform the public when it compiles " systems of records " about individuals .
The law restricts the type of information maintained by the government .
The data must be " relevant and necessary " to accomplishing an agency purpose mandated by statute or Executive Order .
The government is prohibited from collecting data which describes how an individual exercises First Amendment rights unless expressly authorized by statute , the individual , or within the scope of law enforcement activity .
And , if the data is to be used by the agency to make " any determination , " then the records must be accurate , relevant , timely and complete " to assure fairness to the individual in the determination . "
This is an extremely important requirement because the type of " determinations " made by the government -- such as that a person is a terrorist or terrorist suspect ( or an associate of either ) -- have many serious collateral consequences .
For this reason , the law mandates that the government must provide access to records .
Individuals have a right to obtain a copy of their record to review and may request amendment of records that are not " accurate , relevant , timely , or complete . "
The agency may refuse to amend the record , but then it must state the reasons for its refusal , the procedures for administrative review and notify us of our right to judicial review of this decision .
We also have the right to file a statement of disagreement about the contents of our records , and when the government discloses our record to anyone , it must " clearly note any portion of the record which is disputed and provide the statement of disagreement . "
These rights are very important to prevent further deleterious and wrongful consequences of an improper record , which may then be shared with numerous federal , state and local agencies as well as the private sector .
Civil remedies are available as redress for government violations .
The court may remedy violations by ordering the government , for example , to produce or amend records .
If the government acted in an intentional or willful manner , then the court may order actual damages which can not be less than $ 1,000 .
Given the number of records that Bush is compiling on Americans , the damages could be significant .
The government may also face criminal penalties of a maximum $ 5,000 fine for willfully disclosing material to any person or agency not entitled to receive it .
How Bush Quietly Changes Privacy Rights .
Bush uses a variety of methods to repeal or amend our privacy rights .
The 1974 Privacy Act , IRTPA and the privacy board are intertwined together such that Bush ’s interpretation of IRTPA or the privacy board ’s guidelines may affect the Privacy Act .
In this regard , IRTPA amended the 1974 law .
One of the primary goals of IRTPA is to permit government agencies to share information , which is an amendment of the 1974 law that mandated agencies could not share records without our prior written consent or compliance with specified exemptions .
The privacy board recently issued privacy guidelines to regulate the sharing of " terrorism information " amongst agencies .
Therefore , while Bush was not in office to whip out a signing statement for the 1974 law , he can impose his interpretation of that law now when implementing his programs and policies .
The Bush Team claim that it is not possible for them to repeal or amend our rights under the existing laws .
Why ?
Because the Bush administration says that the ISE privacy guidelines expressly state that the guidelines do not " override existing laws such as the Privacy Act " and could not possibly do so because the guidelines require " compliance with applicable laws . "
However , Bush " complies " with " applicable laws " through his prism of claimed unitary executive powers .
And , Bush has reserved his unitary executive prerogatives with the issuance of another signing statement for the IRTPA .
Bush can repeal or amend privacy rights by implementing programs that violate the law .
Here are just two examples .
The Homeland Security Dept. publicly admitted that a program to screen domestic air passengers against terrorism lists violated federal privacy law because it gathered passenger data from commercial brokers without notifying the passengers .
This occurred 2 years after the same agency was found in another report to pull a bait and switch when its proposal stated that there would not be any data storage , yet the agency improperly stored 100 million commercial data records containing personal information on passengers .
The government violated the law because of a disparity between its paper proposal and the actual implementation of the program .
No doubt we may one day be informed of numerous other examples where Bush stated a program was X , but then pulled a switch to implement the program in Y manner , which constituted violation (s ) of our rights .
In addition , it was recently disclosed that the government has been using an invasive data - mining system on US travelers ( Automated Targeting System or ATS ) which creates a risk assessment or profiling of citizens and has been secretly operating for several years .
Last " November , DHS announced that the program would launch on December 4 , but Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff later admitted that the program had already been in operation for several years . "
This risk assessment is retained by the government for 40 years but citizens are not provided notice that they have been " assessed " and do not have access to the " assessment " to correct any false information or challenge irrelevant information because the data is classified .
Yet , this information is then made available to federal , state , local and foreign agencies .
The government has also failed to disclose the consequences of a bad " assessment . "
As noted by legal counsel for a privacy group which filed a lawsuit , " ATS is precisely the sort of system that Congress sought to prohibit with the Privacy Act of 1974 . "
Bush can repeal or amend privacy laws by his control and supervision over the privacy board , which does not have any independence from Bush .
Congress authorized the privacy board to be created within the executive branch under the " general supervision of the President . "
Bush then packed the 5 member board with 4 Republicans and one Democrat , Lanny Davis , and all serve at Bush ’s pleasure .
Unlike other executive branch entities that have some space from the President , the privacy board is " part of the White House Office within the Executive Office of the President and supported by an Executive Director and staff . "
In an apparent attempt to give the appearance of an independent board , it has its own website but the only item posted is the same document published at the White House web site on the privacy board ’s role and functions .
The privacy board members have already indicated that the board is not transparent but secretive from the public because it is part of the White House and therefore needs to maintain confidentiality .
Consequently , at its first public meeting , the privacy board refused to answer any questions from the press .
This lack of independence affects how board members perform their duties as mandated by Congress .
The privacy board was created as a compromise between Congress and the White House to respond to public concerns about Bush ’s tactics in the " war on terror , " such as warrantless spying and secret CIA prisons .
Yet , even the Democratic privacy board member maintains that it ’s not their job to review the legality of Bush ’s programs but to find ways to improve them .
Color me silly , but how can a privacy board protect our rights if it does not assess whether Bush is violating our rights ?
Instead of functioning as a watchdog over our civil rights , the board " all but said they view their job as helping Americans learn to relax and lovewarrantless surveillance . "
Bush may also repeal or amend privacy laws by issuing Executive Orders which mandate that federal agencies implement privacy laws in accordance with Bush ’s interpretation of those laws .
In IRTPA , Congress mandated that the privacy board consider and balance privacy rights with government powers .
Congress also provided a standard for the privacy board to consider when the government enhances a particular government power , which includes whether there is " adequate supervision of the use by the executive branch of the power to ensure protection of privacy and civil liberties , " whether there are " adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine the use of the power , " and whether the need for the power , including the risk to national security if the government does not take actions , is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties .
Bush changed this standard by issuing an Executive Order which directed executive branch agencies – when using or disseminating information -- to give the highest priority to government collection and use of information while relegating protection of privacy interests to an afterthought :
" Section 1 . Policy .
To the maximum extent consistent with applicable law , agencies shall , in the design and use of information systems and in the dissemination of information among agencies :
( a ) give the highest priority to ( i ) the detection , prevention , disruption , preemption , and mitigation of the effects of terrorist activities against the territory , people , and interests of the United States of America ; ( ii ) the interchange of terrorism information among agencies ; ( iii ) the interchange of terrorism information between agencies and appropriate authorities of State , local , and tribal governments , and between agencies and appropriate private sector entities ; and ( iv ) the protection of the ability of agencies to acquire additional such information ; and
( b ) protect the freedom , information privacy , and other legal rights of Americans in the conduct of activities implementing subsection ( a ) . "
If the " highest priority " is accorded to our government ’s ability to collect and store data on us which is then shared by other agencies , privacy rights are nothing more than a footnote buried in the paperwork of programs and policies and whipped out for a floor show when defending against claims of abuse .
Bush may repeal privacy laws by issuing guidelines that constitute a step backwards from existing rights provided by federal law :
" What struck me about the guidelines when compared with the federal privacy act was the absence of transparency , the absence of oversight and the inability for individuals to know what information about them is being collected by the federal government . "
Criticism of the guidelines include the failure to provide substance and specificity , address standards for data collection , or establish a redress process for people wrongly or erroneously targeted in counterterrorism programs .
And , Bush can repeal privacy laws by removing data bank or information sharing facilities from the federal sector and relocating to the state sector which is not subject to the privacy board ’s oversight .
For example , there is a new plan to " use state police - run intelligence fusion centers as the hubs for a national network of officials from different agencies and levels of government sharing information about terrorism . "
Given that civil rights groups , anti-war groups and environmental groups were included in the Pentagon ’s terrorist threat database , all should be concerned about Bush maintaining control over the privacy board that is supposed to protect our rights .
The potential for abuse is enhanced by the fact that this information is shared not just with state and local governments , but also the private sector .
At a minimum , Congress needs new legislation to provide the board with subpoena powers , remove it from the executive branch so that there is institutional independence and provide specific , express mandates for issues , processes and powers of the board because otherwise the gaps will be filled in by Mr. Decider .
And , Congress should make it clear that Bush ’s vast information sharing super highway does not trump the 1974 privacy law .
Finally , an independent determination should be made whether the government is overclassifying documents improperly to avoid complying with Privacy Act requirements , such as notice , disclosure and amendment .
UPDATE
Just found this article posted today about a Democratic response to some of the issues raised in this diary :
Senate Democrats want to investigate Bush ’s data mining programs , but not ban the practice .
A 2004 government report shows 52 federal agencies are operating at least 199 different data mining programs .
Feingold , Leahy and Akaka plan to introduce a legislative proposal called the Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act .
Nearly identical proposals died without a floor vote in 2003 and 2005 .
Sen .
Leahy is pushing for renewed oversight due to press reports about " toubling data - mining regimes . "
" Perhaps most recently , the Washington Post reported that through a system known as OneDOJ , the Department of Justice has amassed more than a million case records , including incident reports and interrogation summaries reports involving people who have not been formally charged or convicted . "
Last night , the House voted 299 - 128 to approve " heightened independence " for the privacy board .
This proposal would remove the privacy board from the president ’s office , grant it subpoena power , require members be confirmed by Senate and require periodic reports on its findings .
However , this proposal is embedded in a 277 - page legislative package and may not pass Senate .
On Monday , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the case of Kahle v. Gonzales , which sought to challenge the U.S. 's change from an " opt- in " copyright system to an " opt- out " system between 1976 and 1992 .
The ruling was a setback for those seeking to free works that are no longer commercially valuable from the grips of copyright law .
The case is important because recent advances have made it technologically feasible to scan , store , and distribute public - domain works at extremely low cost .
There are several efforts to do just that , including the commercial Google Book Search and Brewster Kahle 's non-profit Internet Archive .
Only copyright prevents these projects from making hundreds of thousands of works created between 1964 and 1977 available for free via the Internet .
Kahle 's suit sought to overturn the changes in copyright law that prevented those works from falling into the public domain if their authors did not renew their copyrights .
The Eldred decision
The Kahle case has its roots in the 2002 Supreme Court decision of Eldred v. Ashcroft .
The plaintiff in that case , Eric Eldred , was a publisher of public - domain books .
He was represented by Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig .
Eldred and Lessig argued that the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension
Act , which extended the term of most copyrights to the life of the author plus 70 years , was unconstitutional for two reasons .
First , retroactively extending the term of copyrights violated the Constitution 's requirement that copyrights be granted only " for limited times . "
Second , the act violated the First Amendment by unduly burdening those who wished to make use of works that would otherwise have fallen into the public domain .
The Supreme Court rejected those arguments .
It held that although the life of the author plus 70 years is a long term , it is still limited as the Constitution requires .
And they ruled that because the CTEA had not changed " the traditional contours of copyright protection , " it did not require further scrutiny under the First Amendment .
The Kahle case
Lessig seized on the phrase " traditional contours " and used it as the basis of a new lawsuit , which he filed in 2004 .
Entrepreneur Brewster Kahle , the chairman of the Internet Archive , was the lead plaintiff .
The Internet Archive is a partner in the Million Book Project , an ambitious effort to scan a million books and make them available to the general public .
The Archive also distributes some films from the Prelinger Archives , a vast storehouse of obscure 20th century films .
Copyright law hampers both efforts , because all works created since 1964 — even works with no commercial value — are still under copyright .
Kahle 's lawsuit challenges recent changes to copyright law that have hampered the efforts of the Million Book Project and the Prelinger Archives .
Prior to 1976 , obtaining a copyright required observing certain formalities , including registering the work with the Copyright Office .
And maintaining copyright protection had required renewing the copyright after 28 years .
But between 1976 and 1992 , Congress gradually made those formalities optional .
Since 1992 , copyright protection is automatically granted to creative works whether the author wants it or not , and no renewals are required to preserve copyright protection for the full term available — now set at the life of the author plus 70 years .
While that saves authors some hassle , it has also resulted in hundreds of thousands of out - of - print works remaining under copyright that otherwise would have fallen into the public domain .
In many cases , it 's not even possible to locate the copyright holder in order to ask for permission to use the works .
These so - called " orphan works " are needlessly excluded from projects that build on the public domain .
In their complaint , Lessig and Kahle noted that the vast majority of works published between 1964 and 1977 would have fallen into the public domain had Congress not eliminated the renewal requirement for those works in 1992 .
They argued that such a dramatic expansion of the number of older works covered by copyright amounts to a significant departure from the " traditional contours " of copyright law .
And under Eldred , they argued , changes in the " traditional contours " require First Amendment scrutiny .
They also said that the issue was given new urgency by recent technological developments .
The orphan - works problem would n't have mattered very much in the 1970s because there was simply no economically feasible way to make out - of - print books available to a wide audience .
The Internet has changed that .
Whereas the switch to an opt - out regime may have seemed like a minor change in 1976 , recent technological developments have made it far more significant .
The courts were not persuaded .
The district court dismissed the case in November 2004 , ruling that the Supreme Court had already addressed Kahle 's arguments in Eldred .
On Monday , the Ninth Circuit agreed and upheld the lower court 's dismissal .
In its opinion , the Ninth Circuit accused the plaintiffs of making " essentially the same argument , in different form , that the Supreme Court rejected in Eldred . "
Neither court was persuaded by the contention that the switch to an opt - out regime changed the " traditional contours " of copyright law .
Promoting progress
Kahle plans to appeal the ruling to a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit , but their prospects do n't look good .
With three Ninth Circuit judges already ruling against him , Kahle will face an uphill battle convincing the full Ninth Circuit that his arguments are different from those the Supreme Court raised in Eldred .
That 's a shame , because Kahle 's lawsuit highlights a serious and growing problem .
New technologies are greatly enhancing the opportunity to make better use of older creative works .
Books that have traditionally sat unread on dusty library shelves can now be made available in searchable form via the Internet .
Old films that once languished unwatched in vaults could be digitized and made available for consumers to view in their living rooms .
The main thing standing in the way is copyright law .
If the courts ultimately reject Kahle 's arguments , the battle to free orphan works will shift back to Congress .
Some scholars have suggested that Congress should enact an orphan - works defense that would shield individuals who reproduced a copyrighted work after making a diligent effort to find the copyright holder .
The UK's Gowers Review has recommended that a similar rule be adopted in the European Union .
Although this would not make orphan works as widely available as placing them in the public domain , it might be enough for the likes of Kahle and Google .
Fixing the orphan - works problem is especially relevant to Google , which is embroiled in litigation with publishers over Google Book Search .
Regardless of the outcome of that battle , a solution to the orphan - works problem would greatly expand the number of works that Google could include in its products .
The company could benefit both itself and the general public by throwing its weight behind efforts like the Kahle case and orphan - work reform legislation .
Copyright has traditionally focused on providing economic incentives for the commercial creation and distribution of creative works .
But in recent decades , copyright law has increasingly begun to regulate non-commercial creative activities that are not primarily motivated by financial goals .
Vigilance is required to ensure that the copyright system does not become a serious obstacle to these non-commercial endeavours , so that it continues to " promote the progress of science and useful arts " as the Constitution requires .
